            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

On the poope of that proud vessell presently appeared a young Turk, who for his beauty might have been taken for one of those mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells which have made the Isles of the Archipelago so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned. He commanded a Shallop to be unshipped, with an intent to be set on shore, and those whom he had chosen to attend him, were already with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> downe, when a confused voice, and fearfull howlings staid him on the very side of his Ship. He turn'd his eyes towards the place whence the noise came, and standing so a while undiscovering any thing, he perceiv'd (at last) that from the point of a rock high, exstreamly steep, two men, who strictly embrac'd in the arms of each other, threw themselves headlong into the Sea. He was much mov'd with a chance so strange and pitifull, and those of his followers by a great shreek witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their great resentment: Yea the very Mariners suspending that obduratenesse, which their manner of life makes naturall to them, offered to succour those two so desperate. The faire Turke prays'd their resolution, and commanded them to put it in execution. Thereupon some fifteen or twenty cast themselves into the Shallop, and row'd on with all the earnestnesse that ought to accompany charity, and the excesse of it was almost the cause of their losse. But the winds and the waves sensible of so rare an example, suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their violence; and to have part in the glory to have saved two so miserable, threw the one upon a banke of sand, and carried the other aginst the Turks Shallop. Presently foure or five caught hold of him by the haire and drew him up, and strait hastened to the succour of his companion, whom they found more hard to be saved: Yet at last their agility link'd with their affection, overcame all obstacles both of sea and land, and drew him out of the sands, where those two elements seem'd to have dig'd his grave. If their joy was great for their good successe, their astonishment was far more when in unclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing one of those unfortunate creatures, they found about him two chaines of gold, to which hung two boxes covered with diamonds and pearls: It is likely they had so much curiosity to amuse themselves a little while in the viewing of things of such value. But the desire they had to please the faire Turke surmounting all other, they betooke them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to their oares, and got againe to their Ship with the same alacrity that they left it. Whilst some were recounting the strange successe of their short voyage, others were stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to bring out of their long swounding those whom they had recovered from the sea. But perceiving all their endeavours uneffectuall, they got into their Ship and with those engins us,d to raise their Canon and Merchandise, drew up the two swounded persons to them. The faire Turke commanded them to be carried into his Cabin, and seeing no signe of life, was fearfull, that nature alone was not strong enough to give them backe,

The man who appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be an Ethiopian as well by his habit as face, fell into such a showre of teares that he seem'd to powre forth by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He stopt at last the overflowing of his teares, and turning his eyes pitifully towards the faire Turke, made him understand by signes that his tongue was cut out. So unexpected a novelty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the astonishment of the faire Turke, and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The faire Turke had been of the same opinion, if he had suffered himselfe to be led by his first motives; but unwilling to commit any thing prejudicate which might be disadvantagious to the pretended rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he resolv'd to heare him before he would condemne him: He therefore (causing first not only the Mute, but all those to retire whom curiosity had brought into his chamber) came neare him, and having setled and assur'd him with that sweetnesse and eloquence, wherewithall he could both charme the most brutall, and encourage the most cowardly soules: Fortune (said he) in drawing thee from the depth of the Sea, hath justified her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and possibly 'twas done for thee to justifie thy selfe too. Thy companion accuseth thee, and if I well understand his language maintaines that thou hast robb'd him of those chaines he tooke from thee. Confesse the truth; and let not the desire of being rich bee more powerfull over thy minde, then that of preserving thy life. Thou art amongst men who make profession to protect innocence, and to chastise what is criminall; but they have learn'd by their owne weaknesse, not to condemne all the infirmities of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

The ancients have expell'd this tale, and though there be no misfortune equall to mine, I did not think my selfe so unfortunate that the dead must needs come out of their graves to crosse my intentions.

The Cymeter wherewith he had done this sad act, reek'd yet with the bloud that it had shed, and he transported with the horror of his murder, seem'd as he were losing his senses after hee had lost his humanity. For in lieu of benefiting himselfe by his homicide, he betooke himselfe to weeping with most strange lookes and howlings. But it is very hard for a villaine to keepe long the good motions which reason gives him. The barbarous Mute pass'd presently from one extremity unto another, and be again the same man he was. Hee made an end of the extravagant actions on the body of the dead, and though by his sighs and tears he seem'd to be exteamely afflicted, yet forbore he not to take from him a scarlet robe wherewith he was covered, and by a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty without example cleft open his left side and tore out his heart.

See my friends are all as you desired; and in so saying came one to give the first blowe; but he was prevented, and receiv'd so weighty a blowe on his headpeece, that he knewe by this essay that he had met with an enemy such as he had often wished for. He would instanly shew what his power was, and with his full strength strooke at his enemy, who putting it by, gave
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54727:5"/>
the young Turke a second blowe. This Lions-heart considering nothing but victory, threw himselfe from his owne ship into the others, and reveng'd himselfe of the blowes he had receiv'd. He puts by, presseth on, strikes, joines nimblenesse to strength, and searcheth his enemy in every part where he thinks him unarmed. The other who was glad to finde so valiant an adversary, spar'd him, &amp; let him not feele the weight of his arme, but in that measure where to the necessity of overcomming obliged him, yet letting fall a blowe on the head of the faire Turke more heavily then he was aware on, he made him stagger, and forc'd him to set one knee on the deck. This fearfull stroake being seene by the spectators, some grew pale, and the others, by an indiscretion of persons too af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate cried out that Polexander was alwaies unequalled and ever victorious. The young Turke no sooner heard the name of Polexander but he threw away his sword and buckler, and cast himselfe at the feet of his enemy, Polexander was astonish'd at this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but he was more when the young Turke put off his helmet, yes, said he, Polexander is ever without a Peere and alwaies victorious; and the rash Iphidamantus too much honor'd to be vanquished by an arme that may subdue the whole world. My Lord (said he) you see at your feet that Iphidamantus who would call himselfe the most unfortunate of men, if he had not the happinesse to be your brother. Iphidamantus my brother?

One of a good as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, hereat stepping in; sir said he to Polexander, after he had well looked on the young Turke; the Prince Iphidamantus is not dead, as the Queene your Mother would make you beleeve. He was given to the Sultan Bajazet for the ransome of the King your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And is this then, cri'd Polexander that Iphidamantus whom I have so long bewai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l'd? Ah my deare brother how happy and welcome to me is this meeting? But (and it please you) we must not let that vessell escape, whose taking, you hindred. If I loose her you loose Polexander the same day you found him. She belongs to Alcidiana and the Pilot that governes her is the only man that knowes which way to get to the Island of that faire Princesse. Iphidamantus very sorry to be the cause of Polexanders displeasure, intreated pardon for his fault, and hearing the Prince who held him imbraced, to sigh. I vowe said he never to rest till you have recover'd that which by my indiscression you have lost. Polexander pressing him to his cheeke, my deare brother said he, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse your assistance, but I am afraid least it come too late, &amp; in thus saying he commanded his vessells to steere after that of Alcidiana. They all set saile together, and that of Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus with the rest, whilst Polexander taking his brother apart, and he who first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred conversation with them, understood all the adventures that this faire Prince had run through in the Court of the Grand Seigneur, and the occasion that made him forsake an Empire, where he could expect no lesse place then that next to the Soveraigne. On the suddaine the impatience and displeasure of Polexander breaking out; doubtlessely said he we shall loose the vessell of Alcidiana. Doe one thing, said he to Iphidamantus which may take effect: Goe backe into your owne ship, and follow Linceus alone. I imagine that in acknowledgment of the favour you have done him, he will stay for you if you come in sight of him. I follow him not but for his owne good as much as mine; I thinke you will find nought amisse in a desire so innocent. Iphidamantus, yeelding to the desire of his brother, went into his owne ship, and meeting the Mute whom he had sav'd, he made him understand by his signes, that he would faine goe into Polexanders ship. He asked him not his reason, because it had been so much losse of time, but set him a borde and made towards the north side of the Isle of Fez. Polexander pli'd to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, and as he was commanding his men somewhat he perceiv'd the Mute in action of a man transported with griefe and choler. He asked him the subject of his agitation. But the Mute turning his head aside disdainfully presented him the lesser of his two rich boxes, Polexander <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Assoone as he sawe the faire picture therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd; O glorious and onely relicks of my former happinesse, said he, deare treasure, which I have recover'd after so long a losse; is it to revive my hopes againe, that heaven hath permitted me this review? O faire picture me seemes thou answer'st me that my fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities are returned with thee, I doe as assuredly beleeve it, as if Alcidiana had spoken it from her owne mouth, and will consult henceforward with thee as with that fatall starre,

by whose direction I hope once to arrive at the inaccessible Island. After he had long regarded the portraict, he began to rethinke on the meanes to gaine the originall. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then many great thankes to the scornesull Mute, and causing his ships to seperate and take divers courses, he sailing alone, the third day discried the vessell of Alcidiana. He gave her chase two daies, and mist bording her between the Isle of Teneriffe and the great Canaries. But the famous Linceus adding by his arte a new swiftnesse to his ship that was an excellent sailer, had alwaies the best of the more slug vessel of Polexander, &amp; by favour of the night and winde, got herselfe at last cleane out of kenne. Polexander almost desperate at this ill successe, began to take on at fortune, the windes, the sea, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on Iphidamantus himselfe. But being all foure equally deafe to him, they gave no answer to either his injuries or prayers. It is true that Iphidamantus employed all his care and wit to content his brother, he search'd all the ports of all the Canaries, and carried by his affection as violently as by the storme, ran within sight of the coastes of Morocco, never dreaming what punishments were there prepar'd for him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. Whilst he thus forgot himselfe, and seemed to disvalue a treasure which was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to him more deare then his life, his Marines discri'd off at sea five or six Carvells and assured him that they were of Morocco. These vessells with full sailes came upon him, and put him out of those thoughts which had tane him up since he parted from Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He altered his course to content those that were embarqued with him; and though his great heart was not well contented with his providence; yet he chose rather to submit himselfe to this secret shame, and inward reproch, then to expose his companions to the hazard of either the losse of their lives or a second slavery. For all this, an irrevocable decree had ordain'd that they should once againe fall into the hands of the Moores, and in effect at day breake they found themselves begirt with their shipping. The Moores came towards them without shooting, and shew'd by that, that either they feared to lose them in the cloudy smoke of the Canon, or rather that they had resolv'd to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Iphidamantus essai'd to hearten his souldiers by a second oration, and would have perswaded them that this second occasion was no more dangerous to them then the first: But they seeing themselves closed in on all sides, and hearing every where resounding the name of Enoramita, and those of Abdelmelec and Mahomet, hearkned no more to him; nor thought of any thing but how by the meanes of a suddaine death, they might avoide the long and horrible tortures which to them seemed inevitable. They therefore thought no way better then to be killed in the fight, and for this reason only betaking them to their armes, and by it shewing a minde to defend themselves, by a meere dispaire they betooke them, to what neither the sense of honor nor the eloquence of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine could ever have produc'd from their astonish'd hearts, Upon this resolution, the Pilots presented the Moores two broad sides, and the gunners made their shot so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that at the first discharge of their Canon, they sunck a Carvell of the enemies, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother was put out of fighting. Those that were in the rest, unwilling to stay on their first discretion, so much disadvantagious to them, gave fire to their Canon, and all to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came thundering on the vessell of Iphidamantus. The fight was long and bloudy, and though this young Prince caried death and horror in every place where the conservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his companions called him, yet was he enforc'd to yeeld to number, and to see his victorious armes bound, that had broken the fetters of so many miserable bondslaves. The faire speches of his victors, and the assurances they gave him of triumphs already prepar'd for him in Morrocco, no way appeas'd the hardy and generous sorrow where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he exclaimed on the inconstancy of fortune, and yet (resolv'd to suffer the cruellest tortures) he intreated the Moores with their best alacrity to bring him to the King their Master. The Moores gave him no answer, for they heard a calling to armes, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descri'd a great vessell, which contemning the number of the enemies, came proudly to set on them. If any one travelling through Africa hath seene a great and furious Lio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, fly in on the hunters, and having dismembred part of them snatch from the rest the young Lion they had stolne from her, might imagine the horror and successe of this fight. At the first, two of the foure victor vessells soone changed their fortune. The Canon of the last commers shattered them in peeces, and the Captaine leaping out of his owne ship into one of those the Moores had left, overthrew and klled whosoever durst oppose
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54727:6"/>
him. He heap'd the dead on one another, and pass'd to the vessell of Iphadamantus, and seeing him bound, and by many guarded, dispers'd the company, slewe some, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the rest into the sea. Iphidamantus would not owe all his safety to this new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, but assoone as he saw himselfe with guards, caught up a sword which some had left by him, and though he were so strictly bound that he could not free his hands, yet he made shift to place some blowes on the Moores. His deliverer unbound him, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some impatiency in his victory, come brother, come said he let us scourge the rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of these Barbarians, who seeme to be arm'd for nothing but to oppose our designe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With these words, Iphidamantus knowing the voice of Polexander, I follow your good hap and courage said he, and since I have your protection, I defie all the malice and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of fortune.

together with his heart, leave thee the History of his fortunes and tell thee that one sad blowe hath freed thee from that noble and worthy Rivall, who, alone, could dispute with thee, the possession of Alcidiana. Accept of these two presents; and if it be a verity that the greatnesse of thy valour, would never triumph over those it had subdu'd, use not Almanzor with lesse humanity then thou hast done others.

Almanzor, O! Polexander, was extraordinarily, but surely most justly destinated to succeed the valiant Zabaym, who since forty yeers raign'd in that fair and delightfull country, which in the midst of the heat of the Torrid Zone, conserves a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall spring and continuall fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Zabaym having (almost to the losse of himself) lov'd the vertuous Almanzaira, who by an admired miracle, (in all Africa) was borne white on the banks of Zaira, forsook her for some considerations of love and jealousie, presently after he married a fair young Lady, who by the powerfull lustre of her eyes, and her enchanting wit, was capable to set the crowns of the whole world on her own head. Of this conjunction came Almanzor, who was bred up on the banks of Senega, with all the care that the love of the father, and ambition of the mother were capable to finde out for his conservation. He was but four yeers old, when Fortune, weary of her long favouring the Queens designes, overthrew the very foundations on which she had built them: She had a strange curiosity to know things to come, and to that end imploi'd her credit, her intreaties and treasure, to draw to her from all parts of Africa those whom she thought fit to content her desire: amongst a great number of deceiving Juglers, that were about her, there was a famous Dervis, which she had against his will enforc'd from his solitarinesse on the Mount Atlas, who being urg'd to tell her the fortune of her self and sonne, one day spoke to her thus: Happy Queen, I see not thy greatnesse threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by any of those accidents, by which crownes are often throwne from the heads of Kings. Thou shalt die in thy royall-fortune, and even those who now are jealous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie at thy glory, shall at last, come and petition thee for thy amity and protection. There is only one thing, without which, thou shouldst be exempted from the generall condition of mankinde; I know how sensible you are in that place where I must now touch you, but I should be ingratefull for all that you have done for me, if I should deal with you, as men do usually with Kings; and if fearing to disquiet you, I should suffer you to run to, and fall down a precipice, which by you may easily be avoyded. Know then, that this sonne, in whom (as lines in a centre) all your thoughts meet and end, and for whom there is nothing you would not undertake, will run the hazard to die by the hand of a woman. Hinder this mishap, and I warrant thee the immutability of thy fortune; so ended this Diviner, and instantly took leave of the Queen.

My inclination, which from my infancy made me an enemy to a Sex alwayes so cruell, or at least inconstant, found its proper element in the will of the Queen. I made me ready for this long exile, and to make it to me as secure as delightfull, I reserv'd to me of all my slaves, none but my Eunuches; the little Almanzor, and my self, forsook the pleasant banks of Senega, and the stately Palace which Zabaym had built on the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that great rock, to which the Portugals have given the name of <hi>Cape Vert:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a journey of some few dayes, we came into a Forrest, not far from the Sea, where the Queen had prepared a fit place for her sonnes retirement: we pleased our selves there, and liked the place so well, that we did ordinarily talk of the state and magnificence of the Court, with a kinde of contempt; our lodgings were bedewed round with lively and cleer fountains, and every where we found exercise for our courage, against the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54727:7"/>
Leopards, or other wilde beasts, we abode there above fifteen yeers, and during that time, hunting, or fishing were almost our sole recreations; sometimes meditation and letters tooke the place of their enemies; but the stirring and warlike humour of Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, drawing him to labour and action, rarely would suffer him to enjoy the rest and the sedentary life of a Student; yet when the violence of his exercise had brought him to his chamber, he would willingly heare me; and the subtilty of his wit piercing into things the most abstruce, he learn'd almost of himself, that which the most knowing Arabians could not without much labour make me comprehend.</p>
                  <p>One day, wherein (for our common disaster) I could not follow him a hunting, he was so earnest at it, that leaving behinde him both hounds and hunters, he lost himself in the Forrest, and was there part of the night, I was gotten on hoseback to go after, when I perceiv'd him afar off coming in very slow pace. O, what an alteration saw I in him, and how different from what he was wont to be! instead of that mirthsomenesse which he had usually in his countenance, and of that fire which sparkled in his eyes, when he had killed some Lion; I saw his face all clouded with sadnesse, mingled with anger, and marked how his eyes were all swolne with teares which he had lately shed, I aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as soon as he, and embracing him as I was wont to do, I told him I was glad of his sport; and yet withall, found fault that he held my requests in no more esteem. My Master, said he, (for so he called me) I finde my self most unfortunate, for the enjoying of so good a chase; I say, unfortunate, in such a degree, that to free my self from such an horrible mishap, I am resolved to die. I replied, is it to renew my disquiets? or to try the love I bear you, that you talke to me in so sad a language? What dream you on Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor? or what prodigious melancholy hath made such a change in you in so short a time? He answered, My Master, I shall never be so ingratefull to finde my diversions in your discontents, nor so distrustfull, as to put your affection to any new triall: I know what I owe you, and how well you love me; but to perswade me to live after the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that are befallen me, were to take pleasure and rejoyce at my shame. What Monster cried I, interrupting him, what herbe, or what Enchanter is there in these For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests whose hidden power hath caused so extraordinary an alteration? Almanzor, my deare childe, whither is your reason vanished, which gave you so cleer an insight in all things? Doth there remain no more of it then will serve for our destruction? Will you ruine my hopes, and recompence the pains I have undergone in your breeding, by a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, into which your resolutions will plunge me? Live, my deare Master, (answered he without being moved) live content, and let that wretch die, who by one only act hath made it appear that he possest none of those vertues you taught him. You have alwayes advised me to temperance and humility, and I finde my self in the extremity of pride and ambition: you have often told me, that freedome and generosity, were the first qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of an honest man; and I have comitted an act, the most poor and crafty that can be spoken. What should I say to you?

Alas, can I say what I saw with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ending my miserable destiny? I saw that picture so fair, and dangerous, whose origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is not lesse inaccessible then her place of abode, where, it seemes, the gods gave her birth for the destruction of brave men. You are now, (O Polexander) the lawfull pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor of this portraict; and grant, O Fortune, that it be not so deadly to you, as it hath been to the constant Almanzor. As soon as I knew his griefe, I tried to cure him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning it: if you love Diamonds, (said I) I have at my command far fairer then those you have found; and if this crowned picture make you affect crownes, I can satisfie your ambition, provided that by your vertue, you will make your self worthy to weare them. Ah my dear Master, (answered he) if my soul be covetous, it is neither of gold nor Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds;

and if it be ambitious, it is not to possesse indifferently all sorts of crowns; I love them, but tis on the head, or to say better, in the possession of that faire Princesse. What call you a fair Princesse (I replied) with a voyce that signified my displeasure. The picture which you see is nothing but the vaine amusement of some idle man, who joyning his colours to his proportions, would expose to our view, I know not what greable and pleasant fantasie, which never yet had being in nature, doe not continue your cunning (said Almanzor) I now conceive what hath been the end of your lessons and retirement. But my deare Master fortune is more ingenious then you; read this paper and you shall see that this is not the vaine strength of imagination of the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I tooke the paper and found on it verses, which had this superscription: To the incomparable Alcidiana Queene of the inaccessible Island. I read the praise of this Princesse, without the consideration of any thing, save the losse of my paines and time, the ruine of all the preventions of the Queen of Senega, and the sad, but infallible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of those predictions which had driven us into the Forest. I protest that greife and anger, tooke not only my speech from me, but with it my discretion; so that I had not enough, left me to conceale my discontent. Almanzor seeing me so transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. What (said he) is this picture so dreadfull to Philosophers, and made-up-men, as to hunters and children? Can the ridiculous fancy of a painter, stagger that great soule, which seem'd to have exhausted all the learning of the Doctors of Fez &amp; Thunis?

so many pleasures: I will discover to you such secrets as shall make you acknowledge how infinitely you are obliged to Nature and Fortune. He had scarce heard me, when throwing himselfe at my feet, and embracing my knees, my deare Master said he, I will live, if I may doe it without shame; but doe not abuse my credulity to retard my death; you cannot deceive me long, and in doing so, you will have done nothing but added another death to that I have already prepared me. Almanzor said I, I will never betray you; know then that you are borne to be a King, and are the Son of the victorious Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baym, who by his valour and conquests hath reduc'd almost into one Monarchy, all the estates which are watered by the one, and the other Nyle. At this day he reignes, and happily; and he constrained by the love which he bore you, to hide you in these deserts, he did me the honour to trust you to my fidelity. The generous Almanzor was not tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with the least pride to heare himselfe in an instant so elevated. He was on his knees when I began this discourse, and remained so after I had ended it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though I entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him often to rise, no, no, my deare Master said he, let us be still (if you please) the same that we were. Fortune that hath beene able to change my condition, shall never alter my nature. You have given me documents which are not subject to her inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I will keepe them till death, and if to be royally borne cause any alteration in my minde, it shall be only such as you will wish for. My dispaire is ended, and hope suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it, since (without too much boldnesse) it is permitted me to raise my thoughts, to contemplate the portraict of Alcidiana: And to put in practise those brave things that you have taught me. With this, he rose and taking me by the hand, my Master said he, two new displeasures trouble the peace and quiet which you give me. The remorse of conscience stings me. I feele, I know not what, that reprocheth me, the basenesse I acted in stealing the Picture of Alcidiana; and a jealousie that freezeth my heart, tells me that the true owner of this Portraict is a Monster, which should not be suffered to li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ave given him a full satisfaction, I will regaine by a just combate that which I can neither keepe without a just infamy, nor leave forever, without the giving my selfe over to my first despaire. You (may be) may imagine that my resolutions come from those impetuous and inconstant flyings-out that usuall accompanies youth; beleeve it not my deare Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for I would have you to esteeme me unworthy of your care and instruction; that the hope of ever seeing Alcidiana be taken from me, if I follow not to the death, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that I have propos'd. The Prince here staying, to let me speake; I told him that in lieu of imputing the altering his intentions to the imprudency and heat of his age, I would give him the title of a discreet man, if considering the greatnesse of his birth and the duties that were linked to it, he would sacrifice his love, his pleasures, and the thought of Alcidiana, to the welfare of so many people, who after the death of Zabaym, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected their happinesse and support from his wisdome and courage. And it is not because I will now condemne for a vice, that which lately I praised for a virtue; but there meet so many difficulties in what you undertake, that though I approve of the cause, I cannot allow of the effects. I beleeve that Alcidiana may be as faire as this Picture shewes her; nay I will goe farther, and on the faith of the Poet, that hath so much prais'd her, I yeeld that she had an excellent wit, a conversation incomparable, and that there is no lesse sweetnesse then majestie in her eyes; let us now see the reverse of this Medall, and without being too indulgent, or too severe to your passion, let us consider what you would undertake. You aime at a happinesse which none can attaine to: You seeke for a treasure unknowne to your selfe, and to all the world besides; and your enterprise seems to me no lesse unreasonable, then if you went about to make a way up to Heaven, to fetch thence one of the Goddesses we suppose there. Here Almanzor interruptingme, my deare Master I pray (said he) stop there. I conceive what you would say; but know, that, that which doth usually smother the desires of most men, is it, which increaseth mine. The difficulty excites my appetite. I would penetrate further then is permitted to my equals, and have made knowne my courage by the impossibility of those things I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, if I cannot doe it by the felicity of my successe. And now I will tell you by what chance the Picture of Alcidiana came into my hands, and thereby, make you confesse,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54727:9"/>
that there is a fatality in my adventure. You have heard from my companions the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our chase; I will only tell you what betided me after I was stragled from them.</p>
                  <p>The Lionesse which we had strook, lead us so quick, and so far, that my company and my dogs being left behind, I spurred on alone after her, and with much eagernesse, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, till her speed was too good for my horse, and so I lost her; weary then, and ill pleased with the chase, I alighted, and from the middle of that rock, whose trees rang'd one above another, make an admirable Piramis; I stood long considering the vast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the sea, which, by I know not what horror, full of Majesty, at one time, both astonisheth the understanding, and ravisheth the sense: I saw in the road a very great Ship, and afterwards a Shallop, which was run on the sand, curiosity, (which is naturall to me) and a desire to know who was landed on our shores, forcing me to leave the woods and the chase; I tied my horse to a tree, and by divers windings on the mountain came down to that little haven where we are wont to take boat for our fishing; from thence I perceived amongst those trees, which cover the Lions fountain, something extremely shining: At first I thought it had been one of those fair serpents which have their scales, as it were gilded; but the object growing greater, as I drew neerer, I distinctly saw that it was a man armed at all points; when I was some ten or twelve paces from him, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived he slept, and that he was unawares fallen asleep, because he had before him the picture of Alcidiana, and held in his hand the paper that I shewed you. I drew neerer to him as softly as I could, and by chance having cast mine eyes upon that divine face, (which henceforward must make my good or bad fortune) I stood so surprized, that it was impossible to take me off; the more I saw it, the more I desired to see it: From the pleasure of seeing, I passed to the desire of possession, and without thinking on the stealth, I was about the act, I was enforced by an Imperious and blind motion, to take from him this fair portaict, with the paper which the Knight had moistned with his teares. It fell out happily for me, that as I was about to take it from him, if fell out of his hands, as soone as I had them both, I fled. I was now gotten far into the Forrest, when my reason, got again into the place whence my transport had thrust her, What dost thou (said she) Almanzor? Hath the wise and valiant Almandarin so carefully bred thee up and tutored thee, that thou shouldest turn thief? consult with, and be advised by thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and she will tell thee that she is tormented with a cruell remorse. But thou dost but too well know thy offence, since it compells thee to fly, and makes thee fear, that this great Forrest is neither obscure, nor thick enough to hide thee. I confesse, (my deare Master) this consideration staid me on the sudden, and made me turn backward: but another thought more proude, absolute, and perswading my preoccupated ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination represented to me, my theft, as a conquest, and spake to me so disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiously of the sleeping Knight, that it made me passe for a thief that robs in the sight of all the world, that he may possesse without trouble, a treasure whereof he thinks himself unworthy. It continued on thus; twas for thee only Almanzor, that Love and Fortune ordain'd it; keep it without seruple, as the gods gave it thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition; and run and search both by Land and Sea, to find the place where raigneth the miracle which this picture representeth. Whilest this strange Counsellor advised me thus pleasingly, I walked a round pace, and got to the place where I had tied my horse, I leapt on him with haste and feare, that made me sensible enough of my fault, but the violent and delicious poyson, which by the sight of this fair picture had troubled my judgement, would not suffer me to make any reflection upon mine offence; it made me take pleasure in it, even then, when I condemned it, and took from me its hatred, in disguising the foolishnesse of it; I was gotten hither before I discovered it; but your discouse hath unblinded mine eyes, and I now see my action with all his blacknesse and deformities: I likewise make a solemne vow to be my self the avenger of this crime, and to enjoy neither rest nor contentment, till I have restored again this picture into the hands of the Knight from whom I stole it. After he had finished these different discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, he commanded one of his slaves to bring him a horse, and without lending an eare to any of my reasons, or to tarry till day, he parted from me, and returned to the place where he had found the Knight sleeping.

he knew that the man he search'd for, was again put to Sea: His sorrow was so much in seeing his ill without a remedy that had it not beene hindred by the strength and force of his slaves, he had then slaine himselfe, and made an end of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable destiny.

                  <p>Two daies entire he spake to me of nothing but his pretended theft; and if the thought of Alcidiana and her Picture, (on which his eyes were almost alwaies fixed) had not diverted his melancholy imaginations, griefe and shame had infallibly killed him. I knew not what counsell to take neither for himselfe nor me, when happily, what say I? When unhappily, for all Africa, I receiv'd letters from Zabaym and the Queen his wife. They sent me word that the constellation which threatned their Son, had been chang'd by the death of Almanzaira, and therefore to satisfie their mutuall desire and the requests of their Subjects, I should returne to the Court with Almanzor. I shew'd him the letters, and conjured him to suspend his passions and disquiets, that being recollected to himselfe when he should present himselfe to the King his Father, he might not bely the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which by my letters I had setled in them, of his wit and courage,. My deare Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (said he) for your sake, I will strive to hide all my defects, and make appeare the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Artizan by the beauty of the worke. But keepe me not long in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint; and since my love aswell as duty calls me whether you lead me, lets thither with the best haste, and acquit our selves quickly of that which we owe to others, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more delay, we may doe the like, in those things we owe to our selves. I admir'd the strength of this young wit, and breaking off for ever my savage conversation, tooke leave of our Cottages, and the Forests. I will not stand to tell you with what magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and joy Almanzor was receiv'd of all the Court, nor the ravishing delights that Zabaym and his Queen tasted at the sight of a Son, who (without flattery) for the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his aspect, the grace of action, and the beauty of his wit, was not outgone, I will not say by any African, but by the best compos'd of all Europe. Zabaym held him long in his embraces, and jealous of so rare a treasure, would not suffer the Queen to take him from his armes, nor the deare Son to render what he ought to the love, the teares, and impatiencies of so good a Mother. These first agitations being some what calm'd; Zabaym who long before had prepar'd all things to settle Almanzor in possession of his Kingdome, made his will knowne to his Subjects; and a little time after himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Almanzor to the famous Temple of Senega, and in the quality of Arch-priest and King, taking the Crowne from his owne head, set it on his Sons. After the applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, acclamations, and other pleasing disorders of great Assemblies had given place to silence. Zabaym addressing himselfe to his Son, with a high voice made them know his reason for what he had done. Since (said he) I came to this Throne by extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waies, and that the chances and adventures of my life are rather recorded among the miracles of our Gods then with the actions of men; I dare beleeve that my experience is of more value then all the debatements of my Officers, and that I may ranke my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular opinions before the Maximes of my predecessors. This being so, Almanzor, I am resolv'd to passe ov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>r all the distrustfull reasons of my Councellors, and put that in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution which I have long time deliberated. In the opinion of most men you are yet but an infant, but I know you too well to give so ill a judgement of you, or to beleeve that you have not ability proportionable to the burthen I have laid on you. I therefore give you without feare, that supreme power which my sword and paines have acquired me; and to open you a way to the conquest of all Africa, I resigne to you both my hopes, and Armies. On then (with so faire omens) beyond the one and the other Nyle, subdue the obstacles of our Mountaines and Deserts, penetrate even into Ethiopia, and make Africa which is now divided into so many Kingdomes, to be the inheritance of one sole man. I know you ought to be very fortunate, to bring to a good effect such great execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But infallibly you shall be so, provided, that your wisdome be not too cleersigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor your courage too blind. Fortune yeelds to whosoever will violate her, and would have that respect which is borne her to be mixed with boldnesse. Here Zabaym ended; and fixing his eyes on his Son, looked for his answer, that he might judge, whether he were worthy those hopes he had conceived of him. Though Almanzor had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54727:10"/>
pretentions directly opposite to those of his Father, yet in appearance he seemed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his conceptions, and to witnesse it, made him this answer: I know sir, that having the honour to be descended from you, I ought to be of more value then those who have not that advantage. Yet tis not alwaies an infallible necessity, that the excellentest things produce their like. But for feare of offending a judgement which without doubt hath in it something of divine, I renounce all distrust of my selfe, and goe (since it is your pleasure) to learne from time and occasions, if you be as good a prophet, as you are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Goe my Son said Zabaym in embracing him, goe, boldly, and submit thy selfe to those rigorous trialls; I promise thee henceforward, and if thou beleeve thine owne courage, be assured, that neither the Nyle nor the red Sea shall be any more put in the number of the bounds of Africa. Almanzor at last being freed from these magnificent importunities, thought of nothing more then of the meanes to be rid of the Crowne which Zabaym had set on his head, and to meet with the owner of Alcidianaes Picture-Fortune who is but too favourable where she resolves to doe a mischiefe, offred this young Prince a faire occasion to execute his designe.</p>
                  <p>Three Portugall Vessels were by a storme forced into the river of Senega, and that being a Nation so covetous and industrious, that they will even make a benefit of their owne misadventures, foure hundred men landed, and made an extreame spoile in some places not far from the royall Pallace. Almanzor, hastned thither forced them to leave their booty, and to take from them for ever after the daring to set foot ashore in any of those territories, beat them home to their shallop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some were slaine in attending his fearfull blowes (whereby the King made knowne his extraordinary valour in his first combat) others were drowned in getting to their vessells, and those which got abord, found there but little more safety; for Almanzor getting the mastry of two shallops, shipped in them some of his best souldiers, and himselfe advancing through the fire and smoake of the Canon, gave them not over till he had either killed or forced into the Sea, all that were in the greatest Portugall Ship. His followers borded the other, and after an obstinate fight, gloriously accomplished their Princes intention. These three vessells thus conquered, and many Portugalls taken prisoners, Almanzor called me, and asking me what I thought of this combat, my Master said he, I doe not aske you this question, to the end you should praise me, but to let you see what advantages and opportunitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After this transport, Almanzor stood a while silent, and on the suddaine embracing me, lets on, said he, lets on my deare Master where those felicities calls us which are not to be found in a Throne. Thereupon he called for the most part of the Portugall prisoners and using them as they had been his friends, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them all both their lives and liberties, if they would engage themselves to bring him to the Inaccessible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>sland. One of the Portugalls speaking for the rest: The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion saies he that you propose to us, for the regaining our liberties is an absolute deniall of it. Set us on things possible and we will execute them with the hazard of our lives. This bold and wise reply, exceedingly pleased the King, and obliged him to explicate his proposition. I am (said he) far from intending to engage you or your companions in impossibilities, no not so much as to will you to the discovery of a Country yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne: You know that the Isle whither I would saile, though it carries the name of Inaccessible, is not so, since it is discovered; and it must needs be true that a vessell which I saw on these coasts came thence not long since. The Portugall answered the King, that he spake nothing that was not most certaine; that the Island mentioned had beene discovered by a Pilot of his Nation, that it was but a hundred leagues from the Canaries, and that comming from Spaine they made it on the North of those Isles. That divers had been by tempests cast on it, or by chance arrived there, and that those which inhabit the Canaries had with all kind of industry and expences tried to make themselves masters of it, but their paines and endeavours had been without any good successe. Almanzor intreated the Portugall to relate to him what he had heard or learnt touching that Island and the Inhabitans there. The Isle, answered the prisoner, is so fertile, that those who have seen it, beleeve, that the ancients in consideration of it only, stiled happy those Islands which now we call the Canaries. The verdure and flowers are there everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the harvests and the fruits, are above the hope and desire of the most covetous, and the inhabitants live there in such a vigour, that at threescore and fourescore yeares old they may passe for young. There are many Townes. The Capitall is one of the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the World, and is inhabited by people, in whom, valour, politenesse, and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy are inseperable. The Princes which till this time have governed it, finding all abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, all pleasures and peace at home, have confind all their ambition within the limits of their Island, and have not beleeved that there was any thing else in the world worth their envy. Tis said, that now there reignes there a young Marvell, so full of charmes and virtues that she is the desire of all Princes which have knowne or have heard speake of her. Tis sufficient, said Almanzor, interrupting him; I desire nothing but that you will bring me as neere to that Isle as may. If you can land, the better fortune ours: but if it be impossible, I will have you promise me on your faiths that you will not forsake me for one whole yeare. The Portugall who thought not to be quitted on so easy tearmes, bound himselfe and his companions to serve Almanzor for a yeare in their vessells as faithfully as they had thitherto served the King their Master. Almanzor that would have no other suretie for their promises then their faith, set them at liberty, and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward adventured himselfe among them with asmuch confidence as he would have done amongst his owne naturall Subjects. The Portugalls made it appeare to him that they were truely generous, for insteed of resenting any shame of their defeate, they lost the memory of it, and all the time they were with Almanzor, they did interest themselves in all his designes with as much passion as if he had been their owne King. Before he set saile, he sent me for his Jewells which were of an inestimable price, and forbad me abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the seeing of Zabaym or the Queen. I did what he commanded me with as much celerity as griefe and vexation, and the same day came back to the ship wherein he was embarqued. When he saw me returned, we want nothing now (said he) but the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of love and fortune, let us promise to erect them Temples, that they may not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us in so faire an occasion: this said, he gave leave to those Portugalls which were not usefull for him to depart, and restored to them their liberty, ship, and goods: And himselfe presently got out of the river Senega and set saile towards the Canaries. We
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54727:11"/>
had now lost sight of the pleasant mountains of Cape-verd, when a vessell of greater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then then ours, saluted us a far off, with the discharge of his Canon, and commanded us to strike sail. Almanzor, instructed by his mariners what that noyse meant: answer him again, sayes he, that we will not, and let every one prepare to fight. This boldnesse no way astonished the Portugals, but contrarily, judging by this beginning, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of their voyage would be glorious and profitable, set themselves in an order, as well to take as defend. The greater vessell (as a man of war accustomed to overcome) shewed. I know not what kinde of fiercenesse, in coming neerer to us, and enough to have terrified some timerous spirits: But the Portugals, who were now in possession of making themselves every where terrible, contemn'd the pride of that enemy, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting them a broad side, gave them fifteen Canon-shot. Their approaches were more fearfull then they were mortall, although the two vessels, the aire and the sea seem'd all on a flame: After we had we had fought in some distance, we laid one another aboard, and then there began a combat between Almanzor and the Captain of the great vessell, which merits a particular relation. Never strength and addresse were found so equall in two combitants, and never did the greatnesse of courage sustain so long time two bodies so stricken with wearinesse, and infeebled with wounds. But why relate I a combat to thee, that knowest it better then my self; since it was with thee, Polexander, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor contested? As soon as the tempest had made an end of this duell, and that thy ship was carried one way, and Almanzors vessell another. This Prince commanded the Portugals to follow thee, if it were possible; and after this order given, went through all the ship, to see who were wounded, amongst his own, he found one of thy souldiers, that lay, as it were, dead; he had a great care of him, and when he saw him in case to speak, ask'd him what thou wert, and what thou lookest for in those seas. I wonder, said the souldier, that thou art ignorant of that which is known to all the world beside. He whom thou knowst not, is called Polexander, a Prince descended from the greatest Kings of Europe, and himself King of all the kingdomes he will look upon. Many are the causes that make him wander these seas: At this time he is in search of that famous Captain of the pirates, Bajazet, to force him to restore a picture which he hath stolne from him. Almanzor thought at first, that he was that pretended pirate, and that by some false intelligence Polexander had been peswaded that Bajazet had the portraict of Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana; he therefore drew it out, and shewing it to the souldier, marke, (said he to him) if this be not the picture which Polexander hath lost? The other viewing it well, cried out, see, see the fatall face, that hath been the cause of all that we have indured, and will yet be the subject of all those dangers which we are yet to run through. O! deare work of my hands, why are not we, or rather, why is not Polexander in that place where his love gave me the invention to limne thee, without the knowledge of Alcidiana: Imagine, great Prince, if after this declaration, Almanzor had care of thy souldier or no, truly he was so chary of him, that he caused him to be lodged in his own Cabin, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to be used as himself, entertain'd him continually, either in discoursing of Alcidiana, or of thee. When the souldier recompted to him thy great actions, you might have seen Almanzor stirred with a thousand agitations: sometime he blush'd, as if he had been asham'd of himself, sometime he sighed, as if he had envied so brave a life, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he grew cholerick with his destiny, and then talking, as if thou hadst been present; What Polexander (said he) and is all that is valourous, all that is famous, and all that is happy reserved for thee? O how well hath Alcidiana done, to have chosen so deserving an adorer! But what sayest thou, poor and unfortunate Almanzor? knowest thou not that, that Polexander is the the fatall Demon which crosseth thy intentions; and who without all doubt, will make all thy hopes vain and frivolous? Get out, get out, (infamous creature) from this vessell, where unprofitably thou consumest thy time, and finde out this cruell enemy, in what corner soever of land or sea, that fortune hides him from thee. See, Polexander, the different language that one same passion made thee poor Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor guilty of. He grew well this while, and love and jealousie giving him suddenly such strength, that in all likelihood, nature could so soon have brought him, he earnestly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought thy souldier to shew him where he might meet with thee. This Prince, said he, is continually at sea, and tries all means to recover the good which he hath lost: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54727:11"/>
he imployes the art and experience of Mariners to attaine it, otherwhile he gives himselfe over to fortune and the winds, and is absolutely resolved to perish, if the heavens have doomed that he shall never more see Alcidiana. Wandring thus on the Sea, thinke with thy self if it be possible for me to denote to thee a place where thou maist find him. Tis true, since the day wherein his incomparable valour saved the Canarians from the Portugalls, and for conserving the liberty which he got them, he accepted the title of their King, he hath sometimes come on shoare in the Isle of Teneriffe, and otherwhile in that which he calls Alcidiana. But his new Subjects have been forced to an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care of his person when he hath been above a day or two on land. I have told thee that one occasion that made him wander so far from the Canaries, was the desire to recover the Picture of Alcidiana. I will relate another to thee, which to him was not lesse considerable: He is in quest of a Pilot of that Queens, who is now at Sea, bound in her name to acquit a vowe, which every yeare the Princes of the Inaccessible Island are obliged to render to some unknowne Gods. When I was in that Kingdome, I learnt a secret touching this ceremony, which to you may seeme fabulous, yet among the Island<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers passeth for a verity which no man must call in question: Tis, that whosoever is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by lot to goe in the name of the King of that Isle to celebrate the yearely Sacrifice, failes not to meet in his returne, a bird as white as a swan, by whose flight steering his ship, he infallibly finds the right course to the Inaccessible Island. Polexander, who hath no other hope then in meeting with these Pilots, waites for them every spring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Canaries and the Gorgades. He was so fortunate the last spring that he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried the vessell of Alcidiana, but that good hap was but to encrease his afflictions, for he lost sight of her by the violence of the winds; and in spite of all industry was carried on the coaste of Guine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. After he had run the hazard of a ship-wrack among so many Shelves and bancks of sand which makes those coasts so dangerous, he found himselfe in the hands and at the mercy of Pirates, and without that prodigious valour, that makes all those enemies fall at his feet, which fortune raiseth against him, he had been now in the number of those brave slaves of whom the famous Bajazet composeth the principall part of his magnificence. Twas in that very place that he thought he had lost the picture of Alcidiana, but seeing it in thy hands, I begin to beleeve that Bajazet is innocent of that theft, whereof we have so often and so injustly accused him. At that word Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor interrupting him, not only told him by what adventure he got the Protraict, but let him know the reasons which obliged him to follow thee. And since thou hast such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution said the souldier; I advise thee to stand for the Canaries; thou wilt infallibly find there, what thou searchest, and wilt give no lesse contentment to Polexande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> then thou hopest for in the meeting him. Almanzor followed his advise, and steered thy Islands. If I had undertaken to write all the brave acts of the King my Master, I should now tell thee that he fought twice with the valiant Pirat Thalemut, and after he had as often given him his life and liberty, sent him back to Bajazet with this charge, to tell him that his great reputation, wrought in him an excessive desire to see him with his sword in his hand. I passe by the slight skirmish he had with the Moores, and the massacre he made of them when he heard that by the shot of a musket bullet I had lost my tongue and that he saw me all pierced with wounds fall as dead at his feet: I doe not speake of the delivery and freeing the faire blind Indian Lady, and of the bloudy fight he gave, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect her from the violence of the Spaniards. I conceale that miracle of judgement and courage, by which he resetled in his Throne the infortunate King of Zanhaga, and come to that sad and glorious day, in which leaving to him the title of conqueror, thou tookest from him that of being invincible. What Heroes have the fables of the Greeks invented, and what Conquerors hath Africk, Asia, or Europe produced, which are not infinitely below Polexander and Almanzor fighting together? Thou Sun which wert witnesse of this dreadfull duell, is it not true that all forgoing ages have not had wherewithall to compare them? And to be a spectator, didest thou not stay longer then thou wert wont on the pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ines of Teneriff? And thou O valiant and courteous Polexander, who that day by one combate gottest two victories; acknoledge that it was not easy to vanquish Almanzor, and that it was altogether a thing impossible to force that indomptable heart to confesse himselfe overcome. How often before he died hath he remembred thy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54727:12"/>
and how many times taking thy part against himselfe, doe not flatter me, said he, I confesse Almandarin, that Polexander gave me my life. And not to lye, thou didst give it him, and the gift thou gavest was accompanied with civility, sweetnesse, and markes of a high esteeme. When Almanzor covered with bloud and wounds, fell on the earth, and that he saw himselfe in that estate, to lose his life, or to aske it; in lieu of thinking on his conservation, he thought on Alcidiana; and addressing himselfe to her, instead of speaking to thee. Since like the gods, (cryde he) O Alcidiana, thou reignest absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the minds of those who have never seene thee; I perswade my selfe too, that, as they, thou beholdest our actions, and readest our very thoughts. Turne then thine eyes upon Almanzor, and receive as a pledge of his perpetuall fidelity, the life which he leaves without sorrow, since to thee alone it is sacrificed. I beleeve, Polexander, that thou hast forgotten what thou didst after this so high generousnesse of Almanzor. But I can well remember that thou disclaimest an assured victory, and giving the honour to thy enemy, thou art conquerour (said you) since our Duell, having for its ground the service of Alcidiana, he onely must be stiled the victor, that hath witnessed most love and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; And having said thus much, thou tookst thy leave of him, and to leave the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators incertaine of the victory, voluntarily forsookst both thy armes and the field. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor wronged not this courtesie, but confessed his defeate, and all wounded as he was, caused himselfe to be carryed on shipboard, with an intent to restore thee the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Alcidiana, and to yeeld himselfe thy slave. But his ill Fate casting him on the Isle of Fer, and his wounds much weakening him, he thought of nothing but to dye, and to dye lingring and slowly, that by his more suffering, he might the more satisfie his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. And for this, he forbad his Chyrurgions to dresse him, and to leave to posterity a most magnificent and glorious note of his love, rather then of his condition. He caused to be built that brave Monument which thou seest in the Iland of Fer, if ever the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that Prince hath made thee bestow any teares on his ashes. I sold all his Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to send into France, Spaine and other where, to buy those materials which I was to imploy in the structure of that Tombe. It was not halfe built, when Almanzor (who kept himselfe retyred and hid from the sight of any) came forth of his first abiding, and tooke possession of his last. The workemen wrought night and day, and yet in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Prince, they did nothing but lose time. His longings were at last satisfied, for his building was perfected, and his workemen as well as his Mariners sent home with so great rewards, that they filled all Europe with the Name and bounty of Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor. When he saw us two left alone, he shut himselfe up in his Tombe, and after he had conjured me to conforme my selfe to his conceptions; Almandarin (said he) I can now dispose of my life, and by a new wound free a soule out of bonds, that growes wilfull to persist in a shamefull and cruell servitude. But before I lose the power which our reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall friendship gives me over thy will, I would have thee engage thy selfe to me by that faith which thou hast never violated, and sweare to me, that after my death, thou wilt fulfill two things, whereon depend the comfort and happinesse I seeke after. Tis, that thou pluck out my heart, and take from me the picture of Alcidiana, which I cannot leave as long as I have any sences. Thou shalt carry them both to Polexander, and throwing thy selfe at his feete, petition him by writing, (since thou canst not otherwise) that he love my memory in regard of my love, and that he will forget my theft, and my jealousie; and seeing that he is infallably to repossesse the treasure which he lost, that he would deigne to present the heart which I send him, to that faire Princesse, for whom onely it would live, and for whose sake alone it hath wished to dye. Imagine great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, to what extremities I was driven by so cruell a commandement, and what blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies I conceived against Fortune, for depriving me of the use of speech, in a time when I had so much need of it. Notwithstanding it behoved me to resolve, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and forced by the teares, prayers, and furies of Almanzor, I promised him by signes to put his will in execution. I assure my selfe (said he) that thou wilt not faile of thy promises. Come neere then now, and embrace yet once more, that deere Son, who would aske thee pardon for the upbraidings of thy life, if he knew thee not too wise to impute those disasters to him, of which Fortune onely is guilty. Farewell my deere Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, live, and by undergoing my death with a true constancy, practise that faire doctrine
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54727:12"/>
which thou hast so profitably taught me, and with these words, he pierced himselfe to the heart with his sword, and by so speedy and bold a blow surmounting his haplesse fortune, he got that victory, for which she had so long contested with him. I threw my selfe on him, but too late, and stopping his wound with my hand, strove to stop the bloud which gushed out in great bubbles and clots, he thrust away my hand, and falling on his bed, with a countenance wherein you might behold a mixture of extraordinary joy and death got together, at least (said he) do thou Almandrian keepe thy pro: Hee dyed before he could finish the word, and left me with a powerfull example for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of life. I had not heart enought to make use of it, but my cowardise covering it selfe with a specious pretext of my faith, made me beleeve, that I could not kill my selfe, without suffering in hell those tortures which are reserved for the unfaithfull. I resolved then to live till I had fully executed the last will of the King my Master; and though my despaire oftentimes opposed me in it, I am yet so happy, that before my death I see my promises accomplished. There remaines some part of the will of that Prince not performed, but it is from thy noblenesse that Almanzor expects the execution. Be then sensible of his supplications, of his teares, and bloud! Polexander ended not the fluxe of his teares with the period of this sad story; but turning to Iphidamantus, who was no lesse afflicted then himselfe, and wooing him to teares and sorrow. Let us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile (my deare brother, said he) Let us weepe for the losse of Almanzor, and since tis not in our power to restore him his life, let us deerely preserve that which remaines of him. And in thus saying, he tooke the Princes heart, and fixing his eyes on it; As cold as thou art (said he) poore heart, thou yet retaynest thy first fire, and shewest by thy rich prison, that thou wilt still weare the glorious setters of Alcidians: be confident, that if I become fortunate thou shalt have a share of me, that thy vowes shall be accomplished, and that faire Princesse shall know how farre both living and dead thou hast religiously adored her. Polexander finished this promise, just as his trustfull Diceus, (for so they called him of his domestiques whom he best loved) entered his Cabin, and the excesse of his zeale and joy not permitting him to observe all the duties befitting his condition, he stept nimbly to his Master, and, Sir (said he) I am certainely blinde, or just now I have discovered the vessell of Alcidiana. Polexander lost no time in asking him questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but comming out of his Cabin, got on the upper deck, and by that propriety which seemes to be fastened to the eyes of all lovers, cast his sight presently on the vessell of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana. He knew her, and seeing her take a course contrary to his: tack about, tack about (cryd he to his Pilots) and at this time let every one testifie how much he affects me. His command, and the execution of it, was one same thing. But the winde that complyed not so well with him as they, changed not, but was the cause why his great ship made but slow way after that belonging to Alcidiana. He was all the rest of the day in wrestling against a North-East winde, and raging for being so neere his happinesse and not obtaining it. The night changed the winde, and gave it him so favourable, that he doubted not the taking of Linceus, though the darkenesse tooke from him the sight of his vessell. He might easily have overcome this difficulty, if a greater and more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull had not yet once more envyed his good fortune, in the very instant when he thought himselfe most assured. For at breake of day, instead of the vessell of Alcidiana, he saw a great fleet of Turkish Gallies, and Affrican ships: After he had mused a while, he called his brother, and concealing his resolution from him, we must said he seperate, and by divers courses try to make our way through so many enemies. Iphidamantus appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of his councell, because his friends and himselfe had mutually bound themselves not to leave one another till they were in a place of safety. Getting then aboard his owne ship, he found all those there in an equall astonishment. His presence heartened them, and the speech he used to them wrought upon their wavering minds the same advantage he got by his first Oration. Hereupon they armed themselves, and despising danger, in confidence of the valiant Iphidamantus, resolved themselves to what sad disaster soever fortune should prepare for them. The Mariners perceiving that the vessell of Polexander plyde to the South-west, took a contrary way, and taking downe the Christian colours which they carryed, put the halfe Moone in the place, to try if in this occasion a little cunning might not be more advantagious then power. The successe of their enterprise
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54727:13"/>
was conformable to their conceived hope. They were taken for Turkes, and, as such, were neither fought withall nor staied, but without any hinderance sailed through the fleet. When they were in the Van, they saw another Army composed of many great Gallions, and of all kind of vessells aswell with oares as sailes, over which waved the Standdards of Castile and Portugall.</p>
                  <p>Iphia mantus, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>vished with this encounter, tis now said he to his companions that we have no more cause of feare. See the accomplishment of our ordinary prophesies, and the Army which we saw, though far off from the place where we were prisoners, hath without doubt broaken our chaines and finished our slavery. Yet let us not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched to have seene the enemy so neere without fighting; shew them that we know how to make a retreate, but not how to fly. Whilst he spake thus, his ship got far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off the vanguard of the Turkes, and to tell them that he was none, set up the Crosse upon his vessell, and with his owne hands, in sight of the enemy threw the halfe moone overboord, and commanded to salute them with all his Artillery. The Turkes no sooner knew the trick that had deceived them, but they gave them from their fleet above two hundred Canon shot. Foure Galliots by the command of the Generall were sent out to seise on that Christian Vessell, but all the industry of the Turkes was but to their owne confusion; for Iphidamantus retired fighting behind the vanguard of the Christian fleet. Presently as it he had attended but that signall, they put themselves in Batalia. The Turke made his cressant without stirring from the place he had chosen, and both the one and the other receiving command to fall on, began the fight in a marvelous good order. The wind (as messenger of that absolute power, which almost continually causeth the best successe to follow the best causes) forsooke tha Turkes, and to have part in the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, came on the Christian side. This favourable change, was received as a certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of that daies good fortune, and encouraged the Souldiers to witnesse by their shouts, the impatiency they were in till they were at hand stroakes with their enemies. The great Gallions of Portugall which were in the front of the Christian Armie as so many forts, (whence they ruined the Turkes) began by the noise and smoake of their double Canon, to make the sea open even to the depths, and obscure the aire with enflamed clouds. The enemies grew therewith terrified, lost their order and were flaine unrevenged. At last all mingled, Gallies set on Gallies, Ships boorded Ships, in briefe all vessells little and great, of oares, and sailes, fought either in grosse, or seperated. It was there that the inconstancy of the chances of Warre appeared. Those who were lately Conquerors are now (in their turne) overcome, and such a one who had been made a slave, recovers his liberty by the servitude of those who had put him in fetters. By lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little this forest of Masts grew lightsome, the noise lessened, by the death of some, and the wearisomnesse of others, and both the fleets seemed to be but the shadowe of what it was at the beginning of the battell. The Christians were the Victors; and though the Turkes by their obstinacy in fighting, made knowne they knew not what twas to fly, yet at last they were constrained, and without their obduratenesse had confessed, that the power of earth is weake to resist the hands of heaven. The Sun was no sooner set, then the victorious Army content to see their powerfull enemies not dare to appeare before them, would not drive to despaire those they had put to flight, you could see no more of them, then some few scattred vessells from the body of the Army, yet in fight. Amongst others, Iphidamantus ship which had a good share in the glory of this day, was grapsed with a Turke, the combate equally entertained on both sides, left none to doubt of the valour of those that were assaied or those that defended. The Turkes were more in number then the Christians, yet had they been put to the worst without the incredible valour of their Captaine, who alone, made all the assaults of his enemies vaine and boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. The valiant Iphidamantus desiring to shew by some remarkable blowe, that there was no pride so high, which he could not abate, nor strength which he could not master, threw himselfe among the armes of the valiant Turke, and let drive at him so surious a blow with his sword, that he sent into the sea all that the other had on his head. The Turkes amazed at the fearfull blow their Captaine had received, resolved, not to stand wilfull in a combate which could but adde a particular shame to the generall. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation being as soone executed as taken, the two ships sundred; but Iphidamantus
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54727:13"/>
that would not overcome by halfes, followed the Turkes and boorded them againe. The combate began a fresh, more bitter then before; and the Turkish Captaine, flying after vengeance with an heroike fury; made Iphidamantus see that there is no valour like that which is seconded with choler. After a hundred times trying to finish this duell by some extraordinary blow, Iphidamantus, threw himselfe into the Turkish vessell and made his enemy recoile, but the Moore with a passe on Iphidamantus, stroake him with his Cimiter on the Caske with such a force that he made him fall at his feet. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions thought him dead, and the affright making them forget their honour and their faith, they left him to the mercy of the Turkes, and saved themselves by the favour of the night. Bajazet (for so was this victorious Turke called) quickly caused Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus to be taken up by six of his souldiers and carried into his Cabin. Whilst he tooke paines for the ease and solaging of his prisoner, and seemed to have forgotten the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall routing of the Mahometan Army, a tempest more carefull of his safety then himselfe, tooke him from among the Christians (who pursued their victory) and brought him to one of the Azorez, that he might there recollect those that remaine of his fleet. This place had been appointed before the battle for the Rendezvous of the Pirates of which he was the chiefe. The next day after his arrivall five or six ships came in, the next day eight or ten, and in this sort in lesse then six daies he had made a new Army. Streight he resolved to goe see, whether the Christians had not enterprised somewhat on the place of his usuall retreat. He gave them directions for the order they should keepe, in case they should be forced to fight by the way, and so weigh anchor from the Azorez and came out in the head of his fleet. Though his charge and the humour of those he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, was capable to take up an entire man, yet this generous Pirate reserved the better part of his time to give it to Iphidamantus. He forgot nothing of whatsoever he judged fit for the healing of his wounds, or for the satisfaction of his minde, and told him oftentimes that so brave a man as he never appeared more glorious then when he was constrained to suffer under a misfortune. That the chance of Warre being never in our power, we are to take it as it falls. That tis true victory was often accompanied with many advantages, but they followed many times without any merit; that he had heard spoken of many Captaines, whose death or captivity had given more cause of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy then of glory, to those who had either killed or made them attend their triumphall Chariots. Iphidamantus that made profession of true generousnesse was ravished with that in Bajazet, and giving himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the meane while this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pirate, had time so favourable that the fifth day he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It was a place which nature and arte had equally fortified. On the Easte side there was a Rock which extended it selfe to the sea by precipices and disgorgements of cleare waters.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54727:14"/>
The first part was full of little Chambers so industriously built that they seemed to be cut out of the Rock it selfe. From thence you entred into a Fortresse built with stones of that hugenesse, that the imagination of Iphidamantus could not conceive any thing so strong in all the Mechanicall Engines that was not far too weake to remove or raise them. Foure Towers and foure piles of lodgings covered like tarrasses compassed one Court of fifteen fathome in square. In the midst there was a Fountaine which cast out water through the throate of a Lion of brasse which in noise and casting his head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven made the mettle it selfe terrible. When you had gone through this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, you entred into a Garden, where, on the South side was to be seen a little Wood of Cedars, Palmes and Cipresse, and towards the west, another, of Orenge trees made into a Laborinth. The hedges of all the alleis were of Jessemines, Citrons, and an infinit num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those sweet trees which give the hotter Countries all the advantage they have over our climate. At the top almost of the Rock which was towards the East, you might see a fall of water of six foot broade, which as a peece of ice fastned on the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Mountaine was received in a great and vast bason. All the water fell into one pipe, and after it had been somewhile underground, was seen againe in this hanging Garden, and spouting out of the trunck of an Elephant which a Rhinoceros had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne, carried his force so high that you lost fight of it before it was mounted to his full height. This place was inaccessible on all sides, but to get to it, there was cut in the Rock towards the West a staire which by a hundred steps came to joyne with one of the corners of the Arch. Within this proude Building the Generalls of those Pirates had alwaies lodged since they became Masters of it, and as such, did Bajazet rest there as often as any tempest or other important consideration kept him in the Island. Under this great Arch there were raised two Platformes, on which twenty field peeces served for a warning to strangers that this place was forbidden them. On the flancke of these Cavaliers, ran out to great Bastions, which were as the two Arcenalls where were kept all the cast peeces and double Canons which could not serve them a shipboord. On this side was seen an artificiall Lake, into which they had on floates cast two pecces to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the plaine and open Country about it, and by this Lake only was there an entrance into that great enclosure, after the clensing of all the Artillery of these six different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. When Bajazet was within Canon shot, he staied his fleet, and according to the Maximes of his government, sent to aske permission from the Governour of the place to come in. Iphidamantus who till then had rested as ravished in the consideration of the outside of this Fortresse, was extreamely surprised to heare Bajazet speake thus. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Rover smiling to see his prisoner so admiring: Know said he, that he who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands these Pirates as I have done this yeare, is the sole man who hath power to put a Governour in that Fort, and who may the first yeare either change him or strangle him without giving an account for it. Assoone as this particular Governour is in full posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the place, and that the Generall hath put the armes and command in his hands, he never useth them with so much rigour against any as against his person who gave him the authority. And indeed by this Maxime only he preserves himselfe, for were he sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have but the least intelligence with the Generall, an ordinary death were not the greatest punishment he should stand in feare of. But when he hath past his yeare of probation, and can give contentment to the different humours of his companions; then they give him the title of Generall of the Land, that is, he hath an authority within the Fort as absolute, as mine is in the rest of the Island over the Pirates and vessells. Barbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roussa, so is he called that now commands in this place, and hath been neere forty yeares, the fortunatest Pirate of the sea, yet hath he but executed the commands of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and now is come to the place of Generall by Land, more by the care I tooke not to solicite him to doe ill, then by the affection he had towards his owne party. Leave them to wonder at the permission which I aske, and know that I have no more power in the Fort but what he gives me, who is under charge. And since I have now a minde to goe in, I must doe so, that he must first thinke it fitting. What I now have told you is but the least part of the pollicy of these Pirates. They have their Lawes and their Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes as well as the Estates the best governed, and I have noted that whereas, in those, one may often see many virtues degenerate into vices, here have I seen many vices very

much approaching unto vertues. I confesse that honour and honesty are enemies with whom our Pirates are seldome at truce or peace. I know that conscience is the first thing they put off, who would be Citizens of this Common-wealth, and that justice cannot be received among such persons as have no other enriching then by the losse of others, and make it their boasting to possesse nothing that was lawfully gotten. In a word, tis true, that here all morall virtues are condemned; but know, that what in a well governed State is effected by the respect borne to good and holsome Lawes, here, every one is kept within the bounds of his duty by the absolute power of him who is the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Every mans particular interest, here is insteed of justice, and though there be no recompence for those that live well; yet is there so generall a feare of punishment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the least faults, that it is the bindrance why every day some murther is not committed, or some treason contrived. You shall by and by see at the entry of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse a great many heads not only of meane Souldiers, but of such as have been in the place that now I am; of whom the justice, or to say more properly the mistrust of these Pirates hath made most bloudy and dreadfull examples.</p>
                  <p>Whilst Bajazet thus entertained his prisoner, those whom he had sent to Barbaroussa returned with the leave they went for. Assoone as he had it, he went on, and comming to the Lake with Iphidamantus, went into a boate which came thither to waft them. Iphidamantus was staid by Barbaroussa at his landing, and could not be received into the Fortresse till Bajazet had bound himselfe on his life to be answerable for him. When Iphidamantus was in the midst of the place, he marked the inside, and admired the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible strength that Art had joyned to Nature. Bajazet undertaking him, You have good cause, said he, to view well this place, for tis such a one, as you may well call it the Master-peece of all the Invention and power of man. These channels full of water which turning one within another, represent a sleeping Serpent, are great proofesof the industry and paynes of those that first contrived them. The Lake by which wee came hither, is onely filled with the water which by little and little comes from those chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels: and what I finde most strange in this worke, is, that by secret conduits and pipes hidden under ground, these Pirates can let flow all these waters over what part soever of the Island they please, and when any necessity requires it. I will shew you when you please the place, where by this devise all the campe of the King of Morocco was drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when that Prince thought to have brought the Inhabitants of this Island to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extremity. Bajazet ending his discourse to Iphidamantus, and receiving the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which came to tender their duties to him, ascended to his stately Palace. He made an honour to it himselfe, and lead his faire Prisoner to the lodgings he had provided for him. How will my Readers neglect those famous cabinets and proud chambers, where the curiosity and luxury of our Age, have so high and costfully laid open their charmes, after they have seene the description which I am obliged to make of Iphidamantus lodgings. This Prince first came into a chamber hung with tapistry of a cloth of silver, on a ground of gold, the best wrought, and richest that ever the Portugals have brought from Persia or China, the rest of the furniture was of the same stuffe; on this tapistry there were divers Armes of gold and christall, and betweene them pictures, some in tablets of chrystall of the rock with gold, others of rubies of Emeraulds: and glasses, whose borders covered with Diamonds, tooke away the light and lustre of their cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and were at once both the pleasure and the paine of the eye that beheld them. The roofe and the floore of this chamber had their different beauties; but let the ingenuous Reader supply what I cannot expresse, and imagine what Iphidamantus had over his, when his feet trod on that which Kings weare on their heads. There was no bed in this chamber. Bajazet through this brought him into another, which having nothing of the other, was more magnificent and delightfull. The floore and the wals were covered with a worke-made in compartments of Ebony and Ivory heightned with streakes of gold and silver, and enriched with Moresk-worke, and devices, cut on curious stones. Above the wainescot there were a great number of vessels of Jasper, Chrystall, Agate, Amber and Emeraulds, and of perfume boxes of gold, which made the pleasures of smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, envy those of the sight. From the foote of these vessels sprung a vine of gold, which ran over a frame of silver, the leaves were of gold, enammelled with greene, and the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54727:15"/>
bunches (to represent a white grape) were composed of pearels of different greatnesse, and severall beauty. The leaves of the windowes were of the wood of Cedar and Roses, and the panes were of Chrystall. The seeling was of a hollow mirror, made of many Venice glasses, so industriously joyned together, that by a miracle in perspective, you would have thought your selfe to be under a vault of an extreame highnesse. On one side of the chamber there was a bedsted of silver, with Persian coverings, the Cushions were of blew velvet, embroydered with pearles, the Tables and chaires all alike, and the foote-clothes sutable to the bed and seates. Bajazet left Iphidamantus with his Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and eight or ten Moorish slaves, who had all carquenets of silver about their necks and legs; but before he left him, he fell into this false Civility, which every Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man condemnes, and every well-bred man practiseth: He desired his pardon for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity he was to receive by so ill a lodging. Iphidamantus made no reply to his Compliment, but made him perceive his admiration of the others prodigious riches. Two or three howres after, Bajazet came to him againe, and after some discourse Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus besought him to relate by what conquest he had got together so great treasures, in comparison of which those of the greatest Kings were not considerable. You see by that (answered Bajazet) smiling, that the life of a Pirate is not altogether unworthy an honest man, since it doth equalize him with Kings. But you wonder at small things. When you have seene the publique magazins, and knowne the riches of particulars, you will be enforced to beleeve, that if we had as much ambition as treasure, wee were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to conquer the whole world. Another time I will tell you, how we came by this wealth. For the present, think on your rest, and the end of your cure. This discourse was seconded by many others, and those ended, Bajazet tooke his leave of Iphidamantus and withdrew himselfe. The two or three first dayes, the Pirates much troubled with their ill fortune, abode in a tranquillity not usuall to them. But assoone as the hopes of that which might after betide them, had made them forget the past disaster, they drowned their losses in wine; and to make up their late abstinence, redoubled their feasts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches. Bajazet, who was naturally an enemy to these riots, that he might not be a spectator, was almost continually with Iphidamantus. One day as they were talking of the adventures of Polexander, a Pirate called Achaim, came and presented to him, a man, who for his face and habit was taken for a Spaniard. After Bajazet had seen him, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaim intimated, that when the tempest had seperated the rest of his fleet and driven them as far as the Isle of Capevert, he met with this Spaniard. He will tell you, who he is (said the Pirate) and of the new world which a certaine Genuois hath lately discovered for the Kings of Spain. Bajazet very humanely entertained this Spaniard, and promising to send him to his Country, entreated from him the particalars of his voiage. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard finding his fortune beyond his hopes, thus satisfied Bajazets cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>iosity: I am said he of Arragon, and am called Michael Diaz. You have perhaps heard that the bold Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Columbus, promising our Kings to discover for them a new world stored with gold and pretious stones, hazarded himselfe, to make a way through the Ocean and after a voyage of threescore daies cast anchor at the Isle of Guana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

He there tooke possession of that new world for the Kings, Ferdinand, and Isabella. After he had made a league with the Cacique of the Island, and freighted his ship with gold, pearles, men, and other rarities, he returned into Spaine. I will not relate the honours he received from our Princes, and with what desires he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the Spaniards to attend him in the conquering this unknowne Country. I was one of them that accompanied him in his second voyage, and after an abode of eight y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the fleet, would not be advised either by Roldan Ximenez or Antonio de Torrez Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the men of warre, but is put to sea. Bajazet being satisfied in that he desired to know, dismissed the Spaniard, and gave Achaim charge to be very carefull of him. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaim tooke the Spaniard with him and spread through all the Island the newes his prisoner had brought: The Officers, aswell Mariners as Souldiers were so overjoyed with it, as if the extreame desire (they expressed) of possessing those new treasures, had been an infallible assurance of their getting them. Other Pirates giving themselves the liberty of things unworthy the mentioning, ran up and downe the Isle exciting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the conquest of these riches; and fancied to themselves every Spanish vessell to be a Mountaine of gold, their wise and valorous Generall had more judicious thoughts, for not being able by the relation of the Arragon, to compute, how many faile there were of the Spanish fleet, he would therefore send to discover their number that he might so fight with them, without running the hazard of being beaten: he called for one of his most expect and judicious Captaines, and giving him instructions in those things he intrusted to his prosecution, commanded him to goe aboord and set saile, without suddaine retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till he brought him certaine newes of the Spanish fleet. Trust (said he) none but your owne eyes. Number if you possibly can all the ships in their fleet, and by your spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy returne; doe so that we may have time enough to arme so many vessels as we shall need to fight with them. The Captaine failed not instantly to prepare for the execution of his Generalis commands. He first sought out Achaim, to be informed of the course he was to steere, and chusing those he would make use of in his voyage went out of the haven by the favour of a little gale from the Land. Bajazet the very next day assembled the principall Officers of his Estate, and confirming to them the newes Achaim had brought; I doe not thinke said he that we need deliberate long on this affaire. Our Lawes, our Customes, and the examples of all Ages taking from us the liberty of deliberation, reduce us to a necessity of fighting. Nor is it, to know what your thoughts are, that I have caused this meeting, but to agree of the meanes whereby we may atchieve, what we are bound to execute. Thalemut, a contemnor of whatsoever was divine, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of all brutishnesse, (interrupting Bajazet) Providence (said he) and Councell are as unnecessary to great executions, as incense and sacrifices. Only chance makes the successe happy or unfortunate. That, gives victories, and causeth overthrowes; and if we must be once more beaten, tis not all the wisdome in the world that can prevent or warrant us from it. Raiz spake, and advised, that an enemie, to be fought withall is not to be fleighted, but at such an enterprise, to take with you, all that was requisite, both of wisdome and courage, was not to leave to chance all the glory of what should happen, the rest were of his opinion; and after their custome, applauding the valour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of their Generall, retired, to provide what was fitting, to revenge themselves of the aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Bajazet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe at leasure for the rest of the day, visited Iphidamantus, and acquainted him what was resolved on. They were together till the night was far spent, anddeaving mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of warre for more pleasing discourse, fell in talke of their amorous adventures. Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet sighing at their remembrance, witnessed how unfortunate he was, and casting his eyes on Iphidamantus, as if he had been the cause of his passion; why is it not permitted me (said he) to lay open to you the woundes, which a too tyrannicall respect, and more violent considerations have hitherto kept hidden from the knowledge of men? Bajazet, could open himselfe no further, for in the same instant he entred whom he had sent to discry the Spanish fleet. He told him that he had not been far to fullfill his Commission, and that he had met with the Spaniards far on this side the Islands of Capevert, and (said he) if now you have a mind to them, there is no more time to be lost. They have the winde good, and their vessells are not so sluggish but that they make good way. For their strength tis not to be thought on, they are but thirty or five and thirty saile, and come on with so much security by a course which they thinke unknowne to all else, that they will trouble us more to find them, then to vanquish them. Bajazet, hearing this newes, would presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54727:16"/>
prisoner, and observing him as he had been his King; be pleased (said he) that I bestow some daies on the necessary occasions of my charge, and that I submit my selfe to a Law, which at the same time that it makes me commit an offence contrary to that respect I owe you, makes me withall doe pennance for it. Yes Iphidamantus, I am forced to leave you, and to content the insatiable avarice of a barbarous multitude, must forsake that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame happinesse, which Fortune had (as it were) miraculously sent me. No, no, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Iphidamantus, the mishap you feare shall not betide you. I will follow you where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever you goe, if it be permitted me during my imprisonment to dispose of my selfe. But my deare Bajazet let not the consideration of my captivity hinder me from part of your glory; and let not your Rovers feare that during the fight I might cast my selfe among the Spaniards and so deprive them of my ransome. I am contented to be bound in the vessell I embarque in, and that I only have so much liberty as will serve me for fighting. Ah generous Iphidamantus, (said Bajazet) why will you out of an alacrity hazard a life that should be to you so estimable? and why will you follow the Fortune of one so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, that seeing the Heavens too weake or too inexorable for him, hath for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation been constrained to have recourse to the power of Hell? Iphidamantus stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him at these words: I cannot dive (said he) into those reasons which oblige you to actuate what you doe, but contemplating Bajazet in himselfe and not in his Fortune, I should esteeme my selfe unworthy to live, should I be so cowardly to forsake you in your danger. I therefore intreat you not to refuse me the liberty I desire, and since the time presseth you, let us spend it better then in unprofitable contestations. You are of a race said Bajazet, to whom it is naturall to overcome, and an indiscreet resistance should not oppose it selfe to your glorious destinies. But let not your generousnesse put you to any trouble, we have more time for it then we need, goe to your bed, and give me leave to walke whether the noise of my companions calls me. Thus left he his faire prisoner and followed by thirty or forty of his black slaves, rid through all the quarters of the Pirates. He made those to march that were yet behinde, and staied on the Key of the Haven till he had seen-them all embarqued.</p>

Whence comes this change, said Iphidamantus? Would you fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifie your word to me? You have granted me my liberty till your return, do not then make shew that you repent you of it. I confesse, (replied Bajazet) my importunate solicitations offend you, and being so well acquainted with your valor as I am, it is to envie your fame, to advise your repose; with this he brought Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus to the Port, and shipped himself with him in a kinde of vessell, of which the English have been the inventors, and call them by the name of Barges. The fashion of these ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, is very long, and streight, and doth not only give the pilots the means to governe them without pains; and the better to resist the impetuousnesse of currents, but makes them so good sailers, that there is no Gally but they outgo in swiftnesse. This brave Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver got in a moment to the place where his fleet was at anchor; and having sent by his Vice-Admirall the orders he would have observed in this enterprize, by discharging a Peace of Canon, gave warning to his fleet, to waigh anchor.

The pirats were above threescore leagues from their place of retreat, when they descried a great Ship, which with full sails held course for the Hesperides. At this sight, they made all their vessells and the Sea about to resound with their terrible shou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Bajazet knew well how to chastice this insolence, and caused the guilty to be put into the reer-guard, and desirous himself to view and fight with this vessel, bid clap on all sailes. His excellent Ship had soon left all the rest behinde, and in lesse then two houres, came up so neer, that she was within Canon-shot of the other. Bajazet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to fall on ere he had denounced war, discharged some shot over; but seeing they answered not, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54727:17"/>
men, forbade his souldiers to shoot; the Pirats thinking that they had not so much as need of their swords to conquer so weak enemies, thought it enough to take chaines to binde them withall. They did so, and presently leaped into the others vessell, but they were charged, and repulsed so furiously, that they were constrained to forsake their chains, and to betake themselves to their swords. Bajazet fearing, lest their choler joyned to their accustomed inhumanity might cause a prodigious slaughter on the strangers, got amongst them, and though he could not save the life of all, yet did it for the greatest party. When he had mastered the ship, he commanded his Lievtenant to search her; the Pirate went under hatches, and hearing some talke in a Cabin abaft, went in; but he was forced to stop at the entry, his eyes were so dazed with the lustre of the gold and jewels. This Cabin was hung with a stuff made of feathers, so cunningly mingled with gold and pearls, that nothing could be seen more rich or more beautifull: from the top hung a Canopy of the same stuffe, kept up by great cords of gold, and bordered with little bells, covered with Diamonds, and other precious stones: In one corner of this Cabin, the pirate espied, (lying on carpets, as fair as the rest of the furniture,) a man of twenty, or one and twenty yeers, who by his Majesty and good aspect, seemed to be the sole ornament of that place; he had two men at his feet, which made shew of an extreme sorrow, and seemed to solicit him that was half laid to think of his safety; as soon as they saw the Pirate, they made signes to him to draw neere, and getting him to kneel as they did, made him to kisse the skirt of their Masters robe. This ceremony done, the eldest of the strangers asked the souldier who he was, and who commanded the ship that fell upon theirs. The Turk answered to all his demands, and loth to keep Bajezet longer from the sight of those rarities, went out to carry him the newes. Bajazet came presently down into this rich chamber, and civilly drew neer to him that seemed to be the Master of it. The stranger went not out of his deep musing by his approaching so neer him; but on the contrary, with a downcast look, and still laid, intimated that he was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of nothing but of his secret sorrow; one of those two at his feet arose, and making a reverence to Bajazet, with a grace, that savoured nothing of the Barbarian: Sir, said he, in Arabick, he whom you see here almost dead with sorrow, is called Zelmatida, and hath for his father, the great Inca, Guina Capa, son of the Sun, comforter of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and Monarch of the Fountains of gold; but all this greatnesse hath not been able to avert the misfortunes which have brought my Lord the Inca, into a contempt of his life, and the hatred of himself. Bajazet pitied the fate of Zelmatida, and more in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that, then of his great titles and magnificence, he came to him, and used some complements in Arabick: Zelmatida hearing the Pirate speak, and I king the man, broke off his silence, and made him understand by five or six words, that he was not a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

besought Bajazet that he would bring him to the sight of a person of that excellency. They both went into his Cabin, and assoone as they came in, Iphidamantus drawing to him by his extraordinary beauty the eyes of Zelmatida overcame his long sadnesse. He rose to salute him, and shewing him to his companions, twice or thrice pronounced the word of Isatida.</p>
               <p>These compliments were interrupted by the noise of the Pirates and report of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and Bajazet doubting what it might be, made Zelmatida to understand the cause of his voyage, and intreating him to rest himselfe, went with Iphidamantus, whether he was called by the necessity of his command. He was no sooner aboord his owne ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell then he saw whiten the sailes of the Spanish fleet, and that his owne had put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in order for fight. He changed a little in the disposing of the vessells. He put some in the vanguard which were in the battell, and going from one to another, encouraged the old Pirates by the glory of their past actions, and the young by the emulation they should have to equall their companions, and all, by the assurance of victory and the greatnesse of the booty. We goe not to expose our lives for some proud and brutish Master, who lookes on, with an insensibility, the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> losse of those who by their hazard and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell secure his idlenesse, and with their bloud maintaine his tyranny. If we have the day we shall not share the profit with any but our selves, and the fruits of our fighting shall not be devoured by those that tooke no paines in their gathering. Let this pleasant thought run still in your minds; and to stirre you up to do bravely say often to your selves, that your sufferings, incomodities and wounds shall have a fairer recompence then that which is justly reserved for Cowards, who for a small pay prostitute their courages and lives. This said, he put himselfe in the front of his fleet and lead them to the combate. The Spaniards on the other side discovering this powerfull obstacle, unexpectedly, were long before they could resolve what to doe. At last seeing their enemies drawe neere, they thought they must with iron defend that gold which they by iron had got together. They soone cast themselves in batalia, and that valour which is naturall to them, being enflamed by the extremity to which it was reduced, made them performe such actions as could not be compared but with themselves. At first they stood as ready for defence, and unwilling to mingle unlesse they were inforced, fought with their Canon. Bajazet, perceiving their intention commanded that with full speed they should fall on them. The Captaines quickly obeyed, and presently sunck three or foure little ships. Bajazet and Iphidamantus went to back them, and after a furious fight Roland Ximenes was slaine by the one and Torrez by the other. The Admirall Francis Bovadilla was taken prisoner but he died the same day of the woundes he received in the fight. The combate lasted till night, by whose favour six Spanish ships got away, the rest were ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The heate of the combate so long time disputed was no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cold, but Bajazet remembred Zelmatida. He found him in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s ship in the same state he left him. He asked him whether he would goe; any where, (said he) where I may finde death. This answer touched Bajazet, and made him resolve to get the Prince out of that place whose solitude more fed and encreased his melancholy. He so fitly made him the proposition that streight he accepted of it, and went presently to Iphidamantus Cabin, where leaving them together, he went to take a view of his men and vessells. He had lost many, but being accustomed to the like mischances, he bethought him of those were left, and comforting them for the death of their companions, by considerations answerable to their nature, he made them steere towards their owne Island, and gave the valiant Hally the charge of Vice-admirall. The night, after this bloudy fight, had its disorders and batteries. The weather altered, and the winde grew so furious that the victors failed little of running the fortune of the vanquished. They were foure and twenty houres in a tempest, and had they been neerer the Land then they were, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt they had saved nothing of that which with so much labour and bloud they had gotten. They were driven by the violence of the winde to a desert Island scituated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most under the Tropick of Cancer, and were constrained to lie there till the storme was past. They set saile with the first faire winde; and the second day of their navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54727:18"/>
the tempest began againe, and made them run a greater danger then they had escaped. The bold Bajazet, for all this, forbad his Pilots to stand for the Port they came from; and beleeving that the Elements were not harder to be overcome then men, he opposed the skill and strength of his Mariners to the violence of the contrary windes, and strove to make the very storme to be part of his victory. His daring or rather rashnesse had all the successe he could desire, and after a many daies and nights striving against the tempest, he came at last within sight of his Island with all his owne vessells and his prizes. He dispatched presently one of his men to the Governors of the Port and the Fortresse, and by the same letter letting them know the fortunate successe of his voyage, sent them word withall in what manner he would be welcomed home. This being done, he came againe to Iphidamantus and Zelmatida who were walking in their ship, and thence shewed them right against his Isle two ships that plaied furiously on each other with their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. The Princes seeing they were grapled, signified to Bajazet that they had a great minde to part them. Bajazet to please them, commanded his Pilot to make up instantly to those two vessells, and comming neere to one of them, he knew her, and told the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that she was commanded by Cid Hamet his principall Captaine. Iphidamantus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying the other! O (said he) that is Polexanders ship, tis his infallibly. But Bajazet not beleeving so great and so good newes, came up to the Combatants to see if Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus were not mistaken. At his neere approching them, he saw Cid Hamet fall. The losse of a man whom he knew to be so exceeding valiant, touched him neere and in such a sort, that casting by all consideration he threw himselfe into his vessell to be revenged. Iphidamantus followed him, and presenting himselfe first to Polexander intreated him to give his enemie his life. Polexander knowing him, yes brother (said he) he shall have his life, though his brutishnesse deserves to be punished. He might with one words speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have freed us both from a great deal of trouble we have had, and yet by a malicious obstinacy, he would neither tell me his name, nor his country. Tis the same we followed before we were severed; I found him among the Turkish ships, and thinking he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Alcidiana, used him with all the mildnesse you can imagine: But his arms and habite, made me suspect I was deceived; besides his vessell which carries for her devise the Phenix with a double <hi>A.</hi> confirmed me, that it was Lynceus, or some other of Alcidiana's Pilots, and therefore I would be no longer in this ignorance: I intreated him then to tell me who he was, but all my prayers and promises were in vain; I was therefore constrained to come to threatnings, and from threats to blowes. This Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian got among the great number of vessells that fought, and put me to trouble enough to find him out; at last I espied him standing out to Sea, I got after, and have still given him chase so hotly, that I have at last brought him to that passe in which you now see him. Iphidamantus she wing Bajazet to Polexander; His Generall (said he) whom you see there, will free you of the vexation you are in, and tell you wether he belong to the Queen Alcidiana or no. Polexander gazed on Bajazet, so did Bajazet on him; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long silent considering one another, Bajazet intimating to Polexander the great contentment he received in seeing him: Let Fortune (said he) hence forward, handle me as she pleaseth, without a murmure I will receive all her persecutions, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that since she cannot give me all the blisse I ask her, yet she hath at last given me a part of it. Yes, Polexander, you are, you and Iphidamantus, the two persons I have most wished to see, next to one whom my duty and affection commands me to set in the first place. Believe no more then (if it so please you) that it was the incivility of this Rover, which hath drawn you into these rude places, but the strength of my desires, and the power of my good fortune: For this wretch at your feet, he hath been alwayes at my command; and hath followed me ever since he was ten yeers old; and the reason why you took him for another, is certainly, by means of the vessell, which he took about a yeer since from a valiant commander, who lost his life before he lost his ship. In a trunck I found some letters, by which I understood, that that Captain belonged to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana, Queen of the Inaccessible Iland. I ever thought (said Polexander) smiling, that fortune laughed at my credulity, and that she only gave me false hopes, but to bring me to a most certain dispair. Here with he fainted, and losing all his strength in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made it appear, that the wounds of the soule are little lesse dangerous then those
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54727:18"/>
of the body; he came quickly to himselfe, and taking Bajazet by the hand, in one self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same time (said he) we have had a very contrary intention, for I followed you as my enemy, whilest you searched all occasions to make me your friend. But I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered and cured of that unjust pusuit, and desire your pardon for believing you capable of an ill action. Iphidamantus here interposing; Bajazet (said he) knowes the ground of your choler, and is not ignorant for what cause you accuse him for the theft done by Almanzor. Bajazet seeing Zelmatida coming neer, interrupted Iphidamantus, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that he would present him to Polexander. Our Heroë casting his eyes on him, was no lesse taken with the goodnesse of his countenance, then the novelty of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire; Bajazet told him who he was, and by what chance he fell into his hands. This little increased in Polexander a desire to know more, but unwilling that his curiosity should be uncivill, he at first offered him his service and friendship, and put off till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, the shewing his desire to know his fortune. Whilest these foure Horoës gave one another reciprocall admirations, Bajazets messenger returned with a branch of Palm, which was the usuall token that they sent the Generalls from the Isle, when for any notable victory they had deserved the triumph. Bajazet received it, and shewing it to all his fleet, gave a beginning to the warlike magnificences of his entry: The drums, the timbrells and trumpets resounded every where. The vollies of musquet-shot answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all that noise, and the Canons drowned both, till they were all landed; the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall made them all go in before him, covered with their armes, enriched only with the blood of those they had slain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so entring in, his Barge was followed by the Spanish vessels, as so many slaves waiting on his triumphant chariot. This pomp was short; for the nature of the Pirates, being such, that they knew no other pleasure but their private gain and prey, obliged Bajazet to cut off that which pleased him most, to do that which was most sure: He came then ashore with Polexander, Iphidamantus and Zelmatida, and went into a tent set up for him upon the strand. All the Captains of his fleet, whose wounds did not hinder their marching, came to see him, rather to glut their ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, then to receive the praise of their actions. When they were all in those places they were accustomed to command, and the souldiers which were not of the guard a ship-board, were all husht and silent. Bajazet came to the entrance to his Pavilion, and thus bespoke them: It is not our custome, my companions, to be intreated to fight, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> do we affect the vanity of being praised for our (therein) well performance. There are some which should be forced to take witnesse of their coming off, if they were bound to justifie their being there; but it is not so with us: for as we weigh not the approbation of those that love us, so we feare not the ill tongues of those that envie us. It is here a maxime, that either our enemies have made no resistance, or that we have not fought, when we come home without wounds. Now, I look on you, and that I not only see you as brave men should be, but that I behold you reduced to the half of what you were when we began this voyage; I confesse, how great soever our victory be, we have bought it too deare. Tis true that we have Spanyards enough amongst us to take when we please, that avengement which the sorrow for the death of our companions can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at our hands. Let us give (if you please) the rest of this day to survey our selves, and to take that rest which the desire of our returning to new toyle invites us to.</p>
               <p>To morrow we will see what our valour hath given us; the slaves and the riches shall serve for a second dressing to our wounds: But I little know what your worth is, when the greatnesse of your gain shall advise you not to take at all the least part of your good fortune. Night coming on when Bajazet had done speaking, made the Captains, and all the souldiers retire into their quarters; those which were wounded got to their beds, and the rest lost the memory of all their travells among their feasts and debauches. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Iphidamantus, and Zelmatida staid with Bajazet, and all four taking their way to the fortresse, were there received, after the Lawes of the place had been punctually observed, Bajazet lodged Polexander and Zelmatida, as richly as was Iphidamantus, and by the number, as well as the magnificence of his lodgings, made his guests confesse that he was above the condition of Kings. This illustrious Rover joyned to the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of their lodging, the delicacy of feasting, and the pomp of sights; day and night his slaves gave the Princes new delights, and sometimes on the Sea and sometimes on the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54727:19"/>
shore, represented sports and fights, wherein by a pleasant temper was seen the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of peace mixed with the bitternesse of war. These pleasures which were able to inchant sadnesse it selfe, did but sleightly sleepen the griefes of the Princes: They sighed in the midst of all delights, they had joy in their countenances, whilest despair was in their soules; and though they strove extreamely with themselves, to be pleasing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet the memory of their misfortunes surmounting all their complasencies, compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in despight of what they could, to make their perplexities to break forth. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, who thought himself the most unhappy of all men, and Zelmatida, who in his own opinion, was mishap it self, went every day out of the fortresse, and sought the most desart places of the Iland, to give themselves more freely a prey to the fury of their passions. Now, one day that these four Heroës were in one place together, Zelmatida suffered himself to be so much transported with his griefe, that not thinking whether he were alone or no: O Love! (cried he out) O death! how equally barbarous and cruell are you? These words awaking Polexander from his musing, it is at this very time (said he) that you must acquit your self of what you have ever daily promised; and let us at last see whether Fortune and Love are as powerfull in your world, as they are in this wherein we live. Zelmatida ashamed of what he had done, blushed, and answering the solicitation of Polexander, I intend not (said he) to deny you the recitall of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, since I willingly would lay down my life for you, if I thought my self wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the honour I should receive in losing it for your sake; I shall alwayes be ready to expose mine said Polexander, for the preservation of yours; but since you intend to oblige all us here, deny us not any longer the knowledge of your fortune. I am ready to obey you, said Zelmatida, on condition that Garruca speak for me, and relate to you that which he knowes better then my self. Polexander, who knew how hard a thing it was for a brave and honest man to resolve to speak of himselfe, granted Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida's request, who went presently, and taking Garruca, and causing him against his will to sit down, gave no time of quiet till he saw him in a way fit to content him. Garruca, that had no pleasure equall to that of publishing the ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>IF the great Zelmatida were not considerable but by the splendor of his birth, by the extent of the Empire of his ancestors, and by the abundance of gold, and precious stones, which are in their command; I would tell you of the Incas originall, the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing of their authority by the great Mango Capa, sonne of the Sun, the manner of their conquests, the sanctity of their lawes, the riches of their Temples, the pompe of their sacrifices, and the incredible magnificence of their Court; but all these things which might seem marvellous to you, because they should be new, are so low and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in comparison of the adventures of my Lord the Inca, that I should be an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to his fame, should I give them a place in my relation. Let us then put off to another time, the knowledge of our manners and treasure, and understand, that Zelmatida is son of the great Ioca Guina Capa, surnamed the Victorious, who not content with an Empire of fifteen hundred leagues long, fights daily, to give it no other limits then the bounds of the world. This Monarch having made a way through the mountains, which we believed inaccessible, made war with a barbarous people, who by the losse of an unhappy and bru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Beyond these people raignes a nation as remarkable for their beauty, as redoubted for their valour: They are warlike women, which now enduring the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men, and the infamy of the businesse of their sex, are alwayes armed, and have made slaves of those that would have been their masters. Guina Capa, to try whether
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54727:19"/>
they were invincible or no, entred their territories; and after two great battels, finding them worthy his friendship, concluded a peace with them, on condition that the Queen should give him one of her daughters. This fair and valiant Princesse came to visit her conqueror, but he had scarce seen the least part of her charmes, when he fell pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately in love with her; they were married in the presence of the two armies, and he willed that there should be nothing but of the warriour at the feast of this alliance. Some few dayes after the marriage, the famous Guina Capa repassed the mountains, and retired to refresh himself in the stately city of Cusco. Whilest he tasted these incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sweets, by the possession of the fair Amazon, he forgot not to think of his warlike affaires: Six hundred leagues from Cusco, towards the North, there is a great countrey, watered with a river, called Ancasmayu, that is, the blew River: the Inhabitants of that countrey, were rather cruell then valiant, they eat one another; and though from all time they had lived under the authority of a King, yet were they so wilde, and so much enemies to humane society, that they lived in the woods, and among the rocks, in cavernes, with Tygers, Lions, and Serpents, of which they made them gods. The Inca Tupac Yupanquy, father of Guina Capa, was the first that undertook their conquest, of purpose to draw them from their bruitishnesse, but after a war of many yeers, he found that he did but little advance his intention, and unprofitably wasted him time and forces. He therefore returned to Cusco, and sent thence Guina Capa, to try if the valour of that young Prince would not change the fate of his arms, and those of a nation as warlike as savage. Guina Capa began the war with so much courage and fortune, that after many battels, and an infinite number of skirmishes and sieges, he compelled the King of Quito to forsake the field. That Prince seeing himself out of all hope of succour, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey almost conquered, shut himselfe up in that city, which gives name to the whole Kingdome; and after he had killed with his own hands one of his wives whom he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved most dearly, he expired on her dead body, in bewailing the murther he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to perpetrate. The victorious Inca came into Quito with a triumphant traine, and finding this city worthy to be one of the seats of his Empire, beautified it with Temples, Palaces, Aqueducts, fountains and chanels; he had been above a yeer in this new Kingdome, when he was called back by the Inca, Yupanquy; he left some troopes in Quito, commanded a flying camp to the side of the mountains, and forgot nothing which he thought requisite and capable to keep those Barbarians in their obedience: but he was scarce gone out of their territories, when they revolted, and cut the throats of all his officers and souldiers. The Prince stirred by so wicked an action, returnes to Quito with new forces, and cut in pieces the most part of the rebels. The end of this sedition was the beginning of another; every yeer produced one: for this people, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the yoke, never failed to take up arms as soon as Guina Capa was out of the countrey. The Prince at last grew weary of so many insurrections, and resolved to war in such sort, that the Savages should be forced to petition for peace. To this end he commanded his armies to march as soon as he was returned from the Amazons country: and after he had sometime tasted the sweets of his marriage, departed from Cusco with those invincible forces which were particularly appointed for the guard of the Incas. The fair Amazon followed the King her husband, and would needs with him partake the incommodities and dangers of the war, as she had done the delights of peace. After a journey of some moneths, the Inca came to the frontiers of Quito, and suspending his ordinary goodnesse, strooke the Barbarians with terror, by the severity of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whosoever was taken with his armes in his hand, was either hung on the trees, or cast into the rivers. But to kill one part, and to defeat the other, was not to vanquish all; those people more savage and voyd of reason then their gods, got together again as soon as they were routed; and as if they had been strengthened by their overthrows, they returned to the charge with more fury when they saw themselves brought to a few, then when they were a good army. At last both parts growne weary of fighting, they made a kinde of truce; the Queen at that time, found her self great with childe, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, so contented the King, that during that time he forgot all the ill successe of his war. The Incas Amautas, which are the Princes appointed for the service of the gods, assured him that he should have a son, and that the birth of that sonne, though accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

with many tragicall accidents, should be the entire conquest of Quito, and of many advantages, illustrious and behoofefull for the empire of the Incas. Guina Capa no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting of these predictions, left the Queen in the stately Palace of Quito, with four thousand men for her guard, and returned against the rebels with a hundred thousand fighting men: He pursued them even to their cavernes, and the precipices of their rocks, and after a slaughter of two thirds of them, enforced the rest to lay down their arms, and be subject to his lawer. When he had reduced these Savages to peace and obedience, he commanded a cessation of all hostility; and to win them more easily deprives them not of any of their ancient liberties, save of their men-eating, and sacrificing them to Idols; by little and little he drew them from the woods, and made them build houses: He gave them Legislators to govern, and Priests to instruct them in the worship of the true Gods: And desiring to make their servitude not irksome, told them, that the Prince whom he intended should command them, was not a stranger, but a Prince borne amongst them, and might call himself their countreyman. He meant, the childe the Queen went withall, and to keep his word with them, would that the Queen should lie in at Quito. The Savages, rather more cunning by their misfortunes, then won and made more pliable by the Inca's milde treating, gave him thanks for his favours, but in a little time after, they made known by their horrible and bloody actions, that they were the same men they had been. The Queen daily expected her houre of delivery, when these inhumane villains made themselves masters of Quito. They streight ran to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, slew the guards, and meeting with Guina Capa ran him thorow divers times, and left him for dead in his chamber. They had no more respect either for the sex or beauty of the Queen, then for the Majesty of the King: but pulling her out of her bed, they drew her unworthily and bruitishly by the haire out of the city, and exposed her to the rage of two Tigers, which (accustomed to such sacrifices) followed those Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and were adored as their tutelary gods. Those beasts which better deserved the name of gods, then those barbarous villains did of men, stopped by a power truly divine, began to crouch and fawn on the Queen, and having nothing of their first nature shewed either a feare of, or a respect to that body which for a prey was thrown to them. Those signes of humanity (it I dare say so) were not alone the cause of those bruites asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment; for they kept themselves as guards about the Queen, and tore in pieces who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever durst come neer her. This while, the Princesse who had but life sufficient to bring her childe into the world, died as soon as she was delivered; the Tigers took it, and licked the Infant, and by their pitifull howlings seemed to say that they were much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for not being able to succour it: In the same instant appeared a great troop of men armed with great targets, bows and arrows; the Tigers were no way afraid at their sight, but letting them come so neer, till they had discovered the Queens body, they withdrew, and ran out of sight among the rocks. Those which were in the front of that troop, having noted the action of the Tigers, began to cry out, that their great Prophet was to be believed, and ran to take up the body of the Queen; they laid her on their targets, took up the little Inca, and gave him to some women that were in the midst of their troop. As soon as the childe was dressed, those unknown men turned their backs to Quito, and witnessing by their shouts, the excesse of their contentment, marched al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Before I go further, be pleased that I let you know the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of the generous and deplorable Amazon; but what need is there, that I should tell you since the illustrious and unfortunate life of my Lord the Inca, may make you cleerly see, that no other then he could have so tragicall and fair a birth? It was Zelmatida, who before he was borne, gave both love and terror to the most furious animalls, and was the object of Prophets, the desire of Kings, and the hope of nations. But I perceive not that I wander, and leave the charitable troope which carryed away my young Prince. Suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Those who so opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came to save my Lord the Inca, were sent thither by the great Quasmez, who raigns over the one and the other sea, and whose Empire extends it self from the territories of Mexico to those of the Inca's. As soon as those men were on the mountaines, they chose

twelve of the swiftest among them, and sent them to their King with the newes of their returning. Goe, (said the Captaine of the Troupe aloud) and relate to our Prince what you have seen, assure him that his praiers are heard, and that we have found the body of the dead Princesse and the newborne Child in the pawes of mercifull Tigers. These posts departed and performed their Commission with an extraordinary diligence. The others, the while marching by little Journeis for feare of endangering the health of my Lord Inca, got through the Mountaines and entred into the Country of one of the Ca ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques tributary to Quasmez: When they had made a daies Journey or two in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, they began to publish, that the Child which they conducted, was he by whom (as their g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This newes was no sooner knowne among the people, but all strove who should doe most honour to Zelmatida. In all places where he passed, the Inhabitants brought him presents, and bowing their faces to the ground, seemed to expect their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection from a little Infant that was not able to defend it selfe, nor to oppose the least injuries that any would enterprise against him. Those which with so much respect car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him, after many daies journey in this fashion, at last arrived at the Court of Quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez. Assoone as he heard of their arrivall, you might see breake from his countenance an unusuall joy, but it is unpossible to tell you how much he expressed, when his people delivered the Inca into his hands. He looked on him, he kissed him, and embracing him as strictly as he had been his owne Son; O cause (said he) of my future rest, (though he understood him not) I hope one day to see the end of my afflictions, since the holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretor of my Gods hath promised me, that the returne of my happinesse is to be the masterpeece of your valour. The Queen his wife, who was present at all these things, would not suffer Zelmatida longer in the armes of her husband but tooke it and carried it away, and taking all the care that a good mother ought to doe of those she brought into the world, kept him neer her to his age of twelve yeares. He grew so tall and so strong at that age, that Quasmez began to have him taught all the exercises that the children of Kings are accustomed to learne. His excellent inclination had soone drawne dry all the knowledge of his Masters, and confirmed the old Prince in all the hopes he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him. There was no game of strength, addresse or disposition wherein he carried not a way the Guirlands that Quasmez ordained for the Victor. Though this good King saw him endowed with all the quallities he had often wished him, yet lived he not with that quiet of mind which should be given him by so excellent a breeding. The more he saw the King grow, the more was his melancholy and disquiets redoubled. His shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed discontents when there was no cause, and without cleering to my deare Master when he requested him, what subject he had for it, he consumed himselfe in uselesse sorows, in lieu of staying the time prescribed for the accomplishing the prophecies. The King was in his fifteenth yeare, when five or six hundred Mexicans leaving the Forts they had built on the Mountaines which cut that space of Land which is between our two Seas, came far on into the Kingdome of Quasmez. Their incursion was no sooner knowne to the Inca, then he petitioned the King his Father to permit him to goe against those ancient enemies, and learne them to be contented with their usurped Territories. Quasmez made no great difficulty of it, but gave him foure thousand of his best Souldiers to accompany him in this expedition. Be pleased to imagine the content the young Prince received, to have the meanes to give them a triall of his courage, and to know by his apprentisage what he might after expect from himselfe. He departed then with the foure thousand of Quasmez men, that he might not discontent him: But when he knew the small com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of his enemies, his generousnesse would not suffer him to take them at advantage. He marched right to them with all his troopes, and assoone as he came to a certaine place from whence they discovered a great extention of Land, he perceived that the Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans began to entrench themselves in a little valley. He sent to them one of his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to intimate that he would not fight with them because he was the stronger; though the History of former warres had tught him that they had not made use of that modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Prince of whom I speake (said the Souldier) will never follow your ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nor shall your cruelty oblige him to an action destitute of mercy. Assure your selves then, that he intends to fight with you, not to murther you. Besides he hath a better o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

of you then of his neighbours, and beleeves, you are valiant men, since you have not feared under the conduct of your King, to spread your selves so far from the ancient bounds of Mexico, and to run so many hazards to subject to his Scepter the Provinces of so many Caciques. The thought of this hath obliged him to deale nobly with you; and therefore intreates you to signifie to him what number you are, that he may send back part of his forces, and so comming to an equall combate, you may know by your defeate or victory, if with justice or no you are got to be Masters of so many Nations. The Mexicans received this defiance as a cause to increase their reputation, and their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine who was a young Prince and Cousen to Montesuma, finding therein where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to satisfie his vanity, sent the King word that he was ready to meet him halfe way on condition that he would stand to the tearmes of his defiance. That they were but five hundred in all, yet they would not refuse the combate if they were to encounter but with two thousand: It seemed as if fire had flowne out of the eyes of the King when he received this answer. Our of the foure thousand he had, he chose five hundred whose service he intended to make use of in that expedition, and gave them by his words and his example more courage then they had either from nature or the exercise of armes. He commanded the rest to retire, and that they should not come to the skirmish till they saw their companions either dead or prisoners. Being thus severed, Zelmatida commanded his five hundred Souldiers to march, and the Maxicans, quitting their entrenchment, came to meet the King with all the resolution that Souldiers could witnes. These two troopes did not confusedly fall on pel mel mingling themselves but fought a long time by little squadrons and assoone as the haile of arrowes was passed, every one betooke him to his dart and halfe pike. The King making his way where ever he came slew five or six Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans before he came to their Captaine. When he met him, he thought of nothing but how to vanquish him, and though he found an extreame resistance, yet he taught him, that there was no proportion either betwixt their valour or strength. He hurt him with seven or eight thrust of his Javelin without receiving any wound but one on his left arme, and at the last blow overthrew him at his feet and without difficulty disarmed him. The Mexicans seeing their Captaine fall, betooke them streight to their heeles, and of some two hundred that remained, there were not twenty that put themselves in case to die like men of courage. The Souldiers of my Lord the Inca moved by his example gave the rest of the enemies their lives. They made haste yet after those that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking them, bound them two and two together. On the word of the Commander of those prisoners, the King with his owne hands tooke off the cordes he was bound with, and perceiving him to lose much bloud, stopt it presently by the virtue of certaine words which are well knowne to all the Souldiers of our Countries. This remedy yet not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same power to hinder weaknesse and fainting as to stanch bloud, the Mexican Prince could no longer sustaine himselfe on his feet. The King caused him to lie downe on the earth, and leaving a guard with him, went onward to rejoyce with those of his who only stood spectators of the fight. They witnessed by their shouts, and the arrowes they shot into the aire, the joy they had for this victory, and came in a good order to meet the Victor. When they came together, it was he that could first kisse his hand, and shew most his affection and wonder. The King told them in few words how the businesse had passed, and after he had praysed the valour of his enemies, commanded some of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to carry by turnes the Prince of Mexico. He had no sooner setled things in those partes, but he dispatched to Quasmez the swiftest of his Souldiers, to carry him newes of the good successe of his Army. Whilst this post went to Quasmez the King disposed of his troopes in such a sort that you might see something (which I know not) both of warre and triumph. He seperated them into foure batalions, made two of them to march before him and two after, and in the midst put the Mexicans, that they might be conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by those that made them prisoners. Their Captaine was carried by six Souldiers, and somewhat distant, and after him you might see Zelmatida, almost as bashfull as if he had been led in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The people threw on them both their wishes and benedictions equally, calling then the Authors of their liberty and good fortune; The Queene met them at the Pallace gate; and not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the countermand of the King her husband, a hundred times alowd, blest the houre that our King was brought to them. He retain'd in memory these words, and thinking on them since more seriously then hee did then, began from thence to entertaine some great suspitions, and so fell after into strange disquiets. The day of the Triumph being pass'd; Zelmatida had a great care of all his prisoners, and sending to the Mexican Prince, as soone as he was well, meanes sufficient to pay his own ransome and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, confessed withall that it appertained to so great a courage to vanquish and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. The Inca that had gotten from Qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After this, hee told them they might take their owne way where they pleased, without the feare that any of the subjects of Quasmez could hinder their returne home. The Mexicans knew not what to say at this excesse of noblenesse, and their Prince retayning and suspending a while his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vain-glory; Truly (said he) to the King, if the great Montezuma knew your worth he hath not a Crowne on his head that he would not partake with you, to get him such a friend. Zelmatida was not long without returning him an answere to his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He entertayn'd that Prince as his brother, and sent him presents, which absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gain'd him, and made him resolve to love his vanquisher. Two moneths after hee left them, the King heard from him by two Mexicans, which were of the Prisoners. They presented him a ceremonious Letter which the Prince writ to him, with a many vessells of Gold, and many habiliaments worthy the delicacy and luxury of the King of Mexico. He gave the Messengers new presents to out-goe those of their Prince, and writ to him back with so much freenesse that he intirely got the love of that Mexican Prince. I should be too long to tell you the other brave imployments wherein the King hath since that time beene engaged, or to tell you subsequently all the acts he hath done; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies hee hath overcome, and the admiration he hath given to many Caciques, whom he enforced againe to the yoake which they had shaken off. He was not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove seventeene yeares old, when the powerfull constellation which had domination over his life, drew him from the delights and idlenesse of Peace, wherein he spent his best yeares; and presented him a famous occasion to make knowne his courage. This happened from a refusall that Sodomond Cacique of the Province of Cenusia had made to Quasmez, of the payment of a thousand emeralds. The good King which never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke warre till he used all meanes to preserve peace, sent his Ambassadors to Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, to represent the injustice of his refusall, and the miseries he was drawing on, by the violating his Faith on an infinite number of Innocents. The Ambassadors found him at the Emerauld mynes. They mildly acquitted themselves of their Commission, and forgot nothing that might make Sodomond capable to acknowledge his weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the strength of Quasmez. But this bruite reflecting neither on the one or the other, gave the Ambassadors an ins<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For my selfe that am not only borne free, but a Prince as himselfe; I can no longer endure that he should use me as a slave, and terme me his Tributary. The Ambassadours growne angry at his insolence, replyed, that if he were free and a Prince he owed it to the generousnesse of Quasmez, and if he would renounce the quality of a tributary, he ought at the same time give over the title of a Prince, in as much as he possest the later but on condition that he should performe the former.</p>

But (said they) those that give you these pernicious counsells, represent not to you the inconveniences that are inseperable to them. Come againe to your first thoughts, since you thinke you have pleased your selfe so well in following them, and remember, that the tribute of a thousand Emeralds being the sole meanes that the Cacique your Father could finde to preserve to himselfe his Mine, you cannot deny the same tribute, without running the hazard to lose the same Mine. Sodomond would heare them no further, but commanded his guard to take them, and bury them alive in the bottome of the Mine of Emeralds. The same day that Quasmez heard of the cruell death of his Embassadors, he had newes that many of the hundred Caciques his tributaries, wonne by the policy and promises of the King of Mexico were joyned with Sodomond, and hoped to make up an Army of a hundred thousand men. This newes much afflicted the good King, not for the feare of having so many enemies on his hands, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion and pitty he had of the ruine or death of so many innocents which should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be found covered with the desolations of Warre. This charitable thought would not out of his minde, but made him ponder night and day to finde some meanes to smother this revolt in the birth. Zelmatida seeing him more melancholy then he was accustomed to be; My Lord (said he) command all us young men of your Court to take armes and to expose our lives to avenge you on the disloyalty of your enemies. I am the least of those of my age, but if you vouchsafe to trust me with the justice of your quarrell, and the good fortune of your armes, I promise to bring you Sodomond and his complices dead or alive, and by exemplary chasticements pluck for ever out of the mindes of the other Caciques the seeds of revolting. Quasmez weighing what my Lord the Inca might doe by that which he had already performed, gave consent to so just a petition, and giving him an Army of an hundred thousand men, conjured him to assay all the waies of sweetnesse and agreement before he came to a battle. You will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der certainely at this, that in so little time Quasmez could bring a hundred thousand men into the field, and this wonder may arise from your judging of the customes of our world by that of yours. But I know so much of your manner of living to tell you that tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there. Amongst you there are none goe to the warres but gentlemen and beggers, the first to get honour, and the last to rob and ransack; the rest, which are commonly the richest, stay at home, and contribute but very little to the charge of warre, attending the successe with as much quiet as indifferency. We have more laudable and generous customes. We are all borne Souldiers, and upon the least occasion, are found ready to march. There are none left in the Townes and Villages but women and children. Old men and young, rich and poore take armes, and because they are made equall by their valour, they goe all with a like affection where their Prince and party calls them. I make no doubt but this declaration hath ceased your astonishment, but I am sure that the rest of my discouse will give you another that shall be far greater, as it shall be more just. Prepare your selves for it presently and by the miracles that I shall relate to you, judge to what a point of greatnesse Zelmatida had raised <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Inca having mustered his Troupes, and put some order amongst so great a number of combatants, marcht directly to the Province of Cenusia. Sodomond came to meet him, and offered him battell with his owne forces, and those of all the other rebells. Zelmatida to obey Quasmez would not accept of it, but on the contrary sent new Embassadors to Sodomond to propose to him most advantagious conditions of peace. But when he saw that neither his offers nor threatnings touched the Barbarian, he resolved to fight, and let fly his bloudy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. He went streight through all his Army, and accommodating his speech to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Soldiers, filled them with valour and indignation. Presently Sodomond whose pride had taken from him the knowledge of his strength and courage, bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54727:22"/>
who tore him in peeces. The end of this combate was the beginning of the battell. Twenty rebellious Caciques had formed with their men, twenty batalions, and had disposed of them so, that they had but one front. One of these Caciques, a very experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Captaine, had so ordered his Troupes that they might not be defeated but one after another, or rather to give time to a routed batalion, to fly without being pursued, and after they had new ranked themselves behinde the rest, to frame a new batalion. Macaraib, (so was this Captaine called) came in the head of the first batalion, and was the first too that, Zelmatida sacrificed to the just choler of Quasmez. His Souldiers made some resistance, but being entred into and broaken, some of them were slaine, and the rest to reunite themselves got behinde the last batalion.</p>
                  <p>The second conducted by Abrayba, the third by Terracequy Cacique of the Isle of Pearles, the fourth by Torrucia, and the fifth by Procorosa scarce stood at all before Zelmatida. He tooke these five Caciques alive, and causing them to be chained, sent them into his Campe: Tamanama lead the sixth batalion; It was a Prince in the flowre of his age, very faire and valiant, who caried on the crest of his headpeece a handfull of haire which the Princesse Coriza had given him for a token of her affection. He came up to Zelmatida with a warlike pace, and love raising his courage, he promised to himselfe to cut off the head of Zelmatida, and to present it to his Mistris. Zelmatida that was almost of the same age, was moved with his sweet countenance and manhood, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to make him his friend, resolved to save his life. He fought with him then, but in such a manner, that he gave those, who stood spectators of the combate, good cause to thinke, that he had no great desire to overcome him. Tumanama perceiving that all his power was too weake to atchieve his generous intention, and how Zelmatida would not make use of the advantage he had over him, retired five or six paces, and setting the point of his Javelin in the earth. Brave warriour (said he) to the Inca, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me not of the honour that many a combate hath given me, and imprint not on the front of a Prince, who would be thy friend, the shame of being vanquished. I know that being inwrapt in the rebellion of my brothers, I should be so too in their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But, doe for the love of the faire Coriza, that which thou wilt not for mine, and know that the remorse of violating my faith, is a greater punishment then that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall thy Armies threaten me. Zelmatida, taking this young Prince by the hand, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thy friendship (said he) upon the same conditions thou presentest it me. Live then victorious, not of thy enemies, which is but a common glory, but of thy selfe which is the greatest of all victories; and since thy conscience will not suffer thee of a party whereinto some discontent hath lead thee, take that then which she proposeth thee, and give thy companions an example how they should acknowledge their faults. Tumana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mafelt himselfe so redevalbe to Zelmatida's courtesie, that turning his armes against his Allies, he joyned his batalion to the Troupes of Quasmez, and ran furiously to set on Bononiama chiefe of the seventh batalion. I should be too tedious should I relate to you the defeate of the other Caciques. You may know, that of thirteen remaining, five were flaine by Zelmatida, two by Tumama; and the rest taken prisoners. More then threescore thousand were killed, and with the losse of their lives paid for the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies of their Masters. Quasmez lost there twelve or fifteen thousand men, but by the victory he obtained brought into the number of his slaves many Princes, which before by meanes of a small and inconsiderable tribute were absolute Lords of their estates. Of those, Zelmatida brought him twelve prisoners, with thirty thousand of their Subjects, and gave him a particular accompt of what he had done. Two daies after his arriva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You have in your prisons, Princes, whom you may retaine as slaves, or put them to death without injustice, for humane Lawes would that Malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors should be punished. But if you give them their lives, and forget their faults, shall you not doe an act more glorious for your selfe, and so much the more just, the neerer it resembles that mercifull goodnesse wherewith the Gods support us, and pardon our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences? Beleeve me, send back these wretches to their owne homes to doe pennance for the fault they have committed against their faith as well as against your Majesty. And
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54727:23"/>
to leave them an eternall sorrow for it, free them from the servitude of tribute which they were wont to pay to your Crowne. Quasmez was so exceedingly movedwith the extreame noblenesse and wisdome of Zelmatida, that the very next day, he called before him all the Caciques, and mounted on a Theater with Zelmatida, commanded a Herauld to proclaime the deliverance of the prisoners. The Herauld after silence made, spake thus: Quasmez, Soveraigne Monarque of the Lands between the two Seas, of the Mines of Emeralds and of gold, and of the fishing for pearles, after that by the victories of his Son, he hath made slaves all the Caciques which were before but tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him, declares, that he gives them all their liberty which justly they had lost, and discharges them and their successors from all the tributes to which their Provinces were engaged. Thinke with your selves what the joy was as well of the Princes as their people, after this Proclamation: They all fell on their knees, to signifie their resentment of this grace, and when they were risen againe, engaged themselves to pay double the tribute that Quasmez had taken from them. Eight daies together they celebrated a feast for this peace, so glorious to the Conquerors, and so profitable to the conquered; and the Caciques being all returned to their severall homes, filled their Provinces with the praises of their deliverers. Quasmez this while tormented with an unknowne griefe, languished in the midst of his triumphes, and the more cause of content he found in the person of my Lord the Inca, the more still his displeasures and disquiets increased. At last the Gods (touched with the humility and the zeale which accompanied the prayers of that religious Prince,) heard him then, when he began to leave off all hoping. One day while he was talking with Zelmatida, there came one to advertise him, that the great Prophet Tisnatidez, whom he tought so many yeares dead, was newly arrived, and desired his permission to see him: Quasmez no sooner heard this newes, then he commanded that he should be brought. The while lifting his eyes and his hands to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; Great Gods (cried he) I confesse I have of late murmured and distrusted your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence! I have offended! but you know that never crime was more remissible then mine, since I committed it not in doubting of your all-sufficiency, but in thinking my selfe unworthy of your protection. The King was not a little troubled to see Quasmez in such extraordinary transports, without his knowing the cause, but he was not in it so long. He saw enter into the place where he was, a man of the age of fourescore yeares, white as a Swan, leane as a Skeliton, clad with the skin of a wild Beast, and girt with a great chaine of gold. This old man regarding the King, with eyes that shewed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy, and without saying ought to him, addressed himselfe to Quasmez, and speke thus: I know great Prince how many times you have beleeved me a lyer, or to say bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, how often you have not beleeved your selfe enough happy to hope for that good successe that our Gods have promised you by my mouth. But the long time that you have passed without seeing me since the losse of the innocent and unhappy Xaira, hath caused you to thinke nothing which I had not foreseen, and for which you may well be pardoned. And our Gods have not so much remarked what you spake, through the diffidence you had of your selfe, but that they tooke notice (through your frailty) of the greatnesse of your zeale, and the opinion you had of their all-powerfullnesse. For this, they promise you, this day, the accomplishment of all your desires, and they advertise you not to feare to expose this young Prince to the hazards of a most difficult enterprise. By him the prison of the infortunate Xaira shall be burst open, the hopes of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies deceived, and your Realme more flourishing then ever. At this word, turning him to the Inca, goe (said he) whether the goodnesse of the King invites you, who hath been to you in lieu of a Father. The enterprise to which you are destinated is perillous, but it is one of those that is preserved for such as have your courage and fate. When the Prophet saw that Zelmatida gazed on him with amazement; no, no, (added he) you are not the Son of Quasmez but by adoption and love; and though he hath bred you as his owne childe, yet tis another that was the Author of your life. Doe not aske me who he is, he only knowes it to whom nothing is hidden, and who taught me the time and the place where the guard of this King should finde you. Content your selfe that your birth is illustrious, and that another day leaving the name of Zelmatida which Quasmez hath given you, for another which shall not be lesse famous, you shall attaine the Throne
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54727:23"/>
of an Empire which shall be as great as the Earth, if it were not ordayn'd in Heaven, that it must soone fall into the hands of a Nation which is yet unknown to us. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this misfortune befall, you shall fill both the one and the other World with the same of your great actions, and shall restore to the virtuous Monarch that hath bred you that incomparable treasure which his enemies have as vainly as perfidiously forc'd and stoln from him.</p>
                  <p>Whilest this old Prophet spake thus, Quazmez wept at once both for hope and fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e. The love he bore to his owne blood, strove with that he bore to the King; and no sooner had he put himselfe in case to thanke his gods that they had heard his prayers, but that he afflicted himselfe for their being heard. He fear'd all the perills by Sea and Land, and some times even wished he could forget the thralldome of his daughter, that he might not be constrained to expose my deare Master to such dangers that his affection imagined beyond all humane ability. At last the authority of the great Priest interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, Quazmez was forc't to consent to this separation. 'Tis true that the great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of a King contributed much to this resolution. He burnt with impatiency to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> cleer'd of what he was to act, that he might know the name and qualitie of those that gave him life. Quazmez and the Queene his wife, twice or thrice swounded at this parting, and dividing all their apprehensions, for two affections wherein they found no difference, saw themselves brought to such a strait, that they wished continually that the King would depart, and yet could not endure that hee should go away. The great Priest desiring that Zelmatida might not los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> a time that was so favourable to his enterprize, put an end to his fruitlesse griefes, and made him resolve to be gone. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida presently left the Pallace, and notwithstanding all the sadnesse and affliction that his noble disposition threw on him, to leave those personages to whom hee was so much oblieged, he tooke what servants he thought fitting and began his journey. The great Priest conducted him many daies by waies unknowne to him, and made him goe through all the kingdome of Quazmez, entertayning him with nothing else <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ut with the brave adventures that were reserv'd for him. When he was on the frontieres of Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, he brought him into a little wood, overhung and covered with two great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and led him into a Cave, which was the usuall place of his abode. After they had rested there a while, the venerable old man, drawing aside my Lord the Inca, it is here (said he) that I must leave you, and let you perfect an act, for whose good successe I can contribute nothing but my prayers and teares. Yet, before we part, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit my selfe of the promise I made you, and acquaint you what the gods have deign'd to make knowne to mee touching your byrth and adventures. I would I could buy with my blood and the rest of my life, as perfect a knowledge of all that concernes you, that I might free you from the travell and paines whereinto I foresee you entring. Content your selfe with what is permitted you to know, and without further enquiring know that you are the sonne of a great King, and a Queene excelling all others for endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The rest shall be some time yet concealed from you. Whilest the High-priest spake thus, he perceived by the actions and disquiets of my Lord the Inca, how much the desire to know the truth of his Originall troubled his spirits. To take him out of this torment, he thus continued his discourse: Understand that Quazmez had a daughter, the fayrest that ever trod on earth, almost at the same time that you were borne. He had beene above twenty yeeres married ere he had any childe. This crosse neverthelesse did but increase that piety which to him is naturall. Instead of complayning for his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, he made his recourse to the gods, and to make them favourable to him, redoubled his prayers and Sacrifices. In the greatest heate of his devotions, his Queene found her selfe with childe, and brought such a generall consolation to all the kingdome, that it seemed with the byrth of her childe there were to be borne some felicities, which were not to be found on Earth. They called that which she went withall, Given of the Gods, and when he was borne Quazmez receiv'd him for such. And as soone as hee was permitted to carry it out of the chamber, he tooke it in his armes, and carried it himselfe to the Temple and to the Altar of his gods. He sacrificed to them an exceeding great number of all kindes of beasts, to render them thankes for the birth of that daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: he consecrated her to them, in giving her the name of Xaira, and to this present
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54727:24"/>
added such offrings, that people goe at this day to see, as the miracles of piety and royall liberality. His paternall love stayed not at these good workes; but it had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity for the time to come, and would knowe to what Fate the gods reserv'd this little creature. I found fault with this desire, and advised him eyther not to diminish his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, or to increase his misfortunes by foreseeing them. Besides, since the mournfull accident (that made me forsake the World) and which my skill made me vainely foresee, since I cannot avoyd it; I had made an oath to containe my selfe in the ignorance of man, and not to make my selfe doubly miserable in searching to know more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Notwithstanding all this, the commandment of Quazmez, and that secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination which easily makes us seeke after those things we have sometimes affected, constrain'd me to consult and overlooke my forsaken bookes, and observe the Starres with the same pleasure and the same observations as I look'd on them before my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune. But what indignation, what malevolence sawe I not in Heaven against this poore Innocent? Truly there is not a starre of any disastrous aspect that was not turn'd against Xaira. I knew it, and if I dare say so, knew infallibly that that Princesse was threatned with five or sixe all extraordinary accidents. I sawe her stolne away in the cradle, nourished by the hands of the King her fathers greatest enemies, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to serve one day for a Sacrifice to the cruelty of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These prodigious objects so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed me, and absolutely mastred my sences, that without an ability for farther inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I forsooke my speculation to throw me at the feete of the Altars, and besought the gods that they would divert those dire portents which would induce some miscreants to doubt eyther of their goodnesse or providence. After I had perfected all preparations requisite for the receiving my gods, and to be filld with their inspiration; I felt their presence, and heard their voices, which speaking within me, said: Know that within this moneth shall be executed the blackest and most detestable treason, that ever perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Subjects can perpetrate against their Soveraigne. Quito, now triumphant, shall be the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let some try to finde her and give her, her last honours, and let the new borne Infant be taken up who comming from the wombe of his mother shall be received by the pawes of pittifull Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. By the valour of this childe. Xaira shall be restored to her Father, his enemies shall be punished for their inhumanity, and the greatest Empire of the world shall be the reward for the miseries and virtues of that Princesse, who must be unfortunate for her owne glory. The gods, having thus spoke to me, left me, and I found my selfe much comforted. Assoone as it was day I came to Quasmez, and concealing from him part of what I knew, intreated him, that for his owne quiet, and the content of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he would cause the Princesse to be nursed in some safe place, and to put so many guards about her that it might not be in the power of any of his Subjects, much lesse of any stranger to see her. The King would know particulerly what I gave him this coucell, but beseeching him to cause Xaira to be brought, before I passed further, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded five or six of his principall Officers to goe fetch her from the Queen. As they who were thus commanded were about to obey him, they heard a great noise, and at the same time saw the Queen enter into Quasmez chamber all undressed and so transported from her selfe, that had she not hapned on the Kings bed, she had fallen in a swound on the planching. Quasmez astonied as well by the Queens swounding as by the councell I late gave him; knew not whether I would conceale from him the death of his wife in shewing the feare I was in for that of his Daughter. And in this doubt, he bewayled his wife as if she had been dead, and looking on me now and then, with his eyes full of teares: I feare (said he) my Father lest the gods be incensed against me to see that I have neglected them, to bestow all my cares and affection upon a creature. I had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>This tragicall beginning was ended by yet more bloudy actions. Foure men with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54727:24"/>
stating eyes, and foaming mouthes presented themselves to Quasmez, and speaking all at once: Since (said they to him) we have not been vigilant enough to preserve our happinesse, we will not be cowardly enough to out live it. And in so saying they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the pointes of the arrowes they bore in their hands upon themselves, and sticking them with violence into their throates, so amazed us with their desperation, that they tooke from us the meanes to succour them. They fell all foure dead at my feet, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me in the opinion I had of the losse of the Princesse. The King, transported with griefe and choler, threw himselfe out of his bed, and went into another Chamber, to give time to his guards to take away the bodies of those desperate men, and to stay the madnesse of the women that would follow their example. For my part, I staied by the Queen, and seeing her recovered, gave her by my discourse some kind of consolation. I told her that she must force her selfe from this sorrow, and not be the cause of the losse of the Father after that of the Daughter. The love which she had still borne to Quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>z, was sufficient to overcome all her other affections, and to suspend for a while the thought of the rape of Xaira. After I saw her so well recollected, I intreated her to walke to her husband, and to endeavour by her perswasions to make him constantly to endure and suffer the losse of the little Princesse. She punctually observed all that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed her, and so winningly gave Quasmez this bitter potion, that he tooke it with a great deale of patience. I saw then that it was time to apply the plaister I had provided for that wound, and I therefore told them that the will of the gods was, that their Daughter should be nursed up by their greatest enemy. That the designe the Miscreant had to wrong them, should result cleane contrary to his intention. That they should not engage nor trouble themselves to make any pursuite after those that had stolen her thence, since nothing but ill would come of it. But (said I) if in this disaster, as well as in the rest of your life, you will conforme your selfe to the will of the gods, without a murmure, patiently undergoe, what they have thought fit to be done. I promise you, from them, that one day you shall see your Daughter in that great fortune you reserve for her. There is (by a prodigious accident) a childe to be borne, from whose valour you must expect, not alone the deliverance of Xaira, but withall, the enlarging and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of your Throne. If the presence of a thing that should be so deare to you, can sweeten the bitternesse of your losse, I know by what meanes you may obtaine it. Till then, I speake so loude, that all might understand me, but at that word comming more neere to them, I told them in their eare, that they should presently cause to march to the City of Quito three or foure thousand of his most hardy and affectionate Subjects, and after that I acquainted them with that which I had been taught from the mouth of the gods; They were pleased to be advised by me, and to follow my counsell and execute this enterprise, made so good an election, that those whom they sent to Quito, found you as I foretold; and tooke you thence so fortunately that without any perill they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered you into the hands of Quasmez. This Prince would willingly have kept his losse from the knowledge of his Subjects, but being instantly spread abroad, and knowne even to the furthest par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He published therefore through all his Provinces, that which I had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of Xaira, and to assure them, discovered to them somewhat of his designe on you. This newes was the cause that all those who saw you in the hands of the Souldiers that brought you, doubted no more of the truth of my predictions, and consequently, though you were but an infant gave you all the honours they conceived they ought to their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer. That which remaines for you now to know, is, not what you should doe, for you understand that already by what I have told you; but the place where your valour must be seen, and the meanes whereby you may come off with renowne. Know then that you must goe as far as to the foote of a great Mountaine called Popocampecho. You may easily know it by the flames it sends forth day and night. There shall you find against whom to exercise your courage. Tread under foot all difficulties, and when you shall have overcome your enemies, march on till you come before a City that gives name to the great Kingdome of Mexico. Twill be in that place that you shall need to use all your strength; but if you doe not betray your selfe, I assure you that you shall come off victor from the combate which you must there undergoe. Yet, among so many good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,

I see a disastrous accident may betide you, but I dare not make it knowne to you, so openly as is fitting, for fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you love your owne content take heede you trust not to any thing but your owne courage, and without thinking how to conquer any thing new, have no thought but for the recovery of what you have lost. Above all make but little stay at Mexico, returne to Quasmez with his Daughter, and if you will not be all your life time worthy of pitty, faile not, before the Moone hath been six times at full to be at the place where you were first taken up from the pawes of the pitifull Tigers. Beleeve me my deare Son, remember all my advertisements, and in so doing, you shall be more great then were ever your predecessors.

The Hie-priest stopping at the end of this champion, stood long times looking on my Master, and on the suddaine (I know not what divine fury agitating him) he lifted his eyes to Heaven, and as if he had remarked that the misfortunes which he foresaw, could not be avoyded, he began to weepe on Zelmatida, gazed upon him with as much pitty as if had been ready to dye, and left him without the power of speaking to him one word.

After hehad staied there a little while, without occasion to defend himselfe against any thing but coales, and burning flints which breaking out of the entralls of the Rock were throwne on him by the force of the flame, he withdrew a little farther from so incommodious a station, and entered into a hollow way.

This bloudy adventure, did not only fill the Prince with astonishment and pitty, but animated him to deliver the prisoner. He was hindred by the arrivall of foure men, who through fury, or basenesse pursued one of those single men. His noblenesse stirring him at the sight of so foule an assasinat, carried him among the combitants, and causing him to take the part of the weakest, he made him the strongest, by the death of two of those murderers.

whether he might undertake with justice the revenging the vanquished, he would needs fall on the vanquisher. But the wounded man withholding him, doe not (said he) avenge an ingratefull person, who to satisfie a brutish passion hath violated the most holy Lawes which are amongst men. And after he had said so, he crept or rather drew himselfe along neere to the enchained Lady, and casting on her his halfe dead eyes, tis you (said he) incomparable Coriza, who by your charmes, stronger then duty, bloud and obligations, have reduced me to that cruell necessity of betraying my benefactor, and to throw by that respect I owed your virtue. Whilst he spoke thus, the Victor came neere, and accused him of many horrible crimes; but the other insteed of answering to his accusations, shewed him the fettered Lady, as to tell him, that the excuse of all his faults was written in so faire a face. Neverthelesse he asked forgivenesse from his Conqueror, and so falling downe, yeelded up his life on the feet of the faire captive, either to have the comfort of kissing them at his death, or to witnesse by this act of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, that he desired pardon both for his love and boldnesse. In the meane time the party victorious, threw himselfe at the feet of the Lady, kissed her fetters, washed them with his teares, and with downe cast eyes, you (said he) shall be most just if you make me undergoe all the rigour that the most unworthy and most ingratefull amongst men deserves. The Lady interrupting him, Tumanama (said she) neither accuse your selfe nor me of your ill fortune. Your generousnesse and my confidence suffered us not to suspect a man who by so many actions made us to know him to be as discreet as trusty. Yet O faire Coriza (answered Tumanama) you have not failed to be exposed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of a cruell captivity, and to endure all the outrages, that the bruitishnesse of a Monster had a will to exercise against your virtue. At the names of Tumanama and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riza, Zelmatida recollected his spirits, and comming neere these two lovers, would see before he spake, whether this Tumanama were he, whose friendshippe he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by those generous waies which I have not long since related to you. He therefore look'd on him, and knowing him, what (said he) shall Zelmatida be so unfortunate that his deare Tumanama will not know him? These words brought Tumanama back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine from the deepe meditation wherein he was in undoing his Mistesses chaines, and made him turne his eyes on Zelmatida.</p>
                  <p>After he had earnestly looked on him, he knew him, though the lightsomnes of the place was not sufficient to make them well knowe their countenances: and rising to embrace him; O my deliverer (said he) hath the providence of the gods brought you into these Deserts to save my life a second time, and to preserve to the faire Coriza this unworthy cause of her afflictions as well as of her love? Zelmatida embrac'd him often times before he made answere, and hiding from him the truth of his voyage, told him that the service of the King his father oblieged him to goe to the Court of the King of Mexico unknowne; he came thither by chance, where five men would have murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him whom he had kill'd. But tell me (said he) by what strange accident the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse Coriza came to be in that estate I found her, and why you have flayne a man who seem'd to take on him her defence? That story is long (reply'd Tumanama) yet I will not forbeare to relate it as succinctly as I can. But first bee pleased that I unloade my faire Princesse of those chaines, with which the perfidious Maranita hath shewed her more his bruitishnesse then his affection. When he had said thus, he kneeled down, and was in that posture till he had broken all the faire Coriza's bonds. This done, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Zelmatida to the Princesse, and adressing his discourse to her; See said he Coriza the generous Prince, that for your sake forgetting my revolts and insolencies, would not only give me my life and preserve my honour, but withall disdain'd not to receive me into the number of his frends. You see what he hath done for your deliverance; give me leave to relate to him by what mishap you came to have neede of his courage, and that I may justifie my selfe for the death of the traytor that fought for you. Coriza here began to speake, and told Zelmatida that the perplexities wherein she was, gave her not the liberty to satisfie the obligations in which she was bound to him, as well for her owne conservation, as for her lovers; but (said she) untill a better fortune give mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler meanes to acknowledge your favours, accept the recytall of my mishappes for a beginning of my payment. Here Tumanama began, and making use of the permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54727:26"/>
that Coriza gave him; I was at the point (said he) to Zelmatida, to receive, not the recompance of my services, for they are not considerable, but the greatest proofes of the goodnesse of Coriza; when as Maranita whom I had bred up as my brother, and made partaker of all my secrecies as the best of my friends, resolv'd himselfe on a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so bruitish, that it is not possible love should be the cause of it. I had sent him to accompany the Princesse and to receive her, out of my commands, but he most perfidious, having long before combyn'd with some others like himselfe for the taking away of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riza, surprized her one night and carried her away from the midst of her guards and chayning her, as you saw, brought her into this place, with an intent to goe further even to the Court of Montezuma, to finde there a Sanctuary for her perfidy. The news of this attempt being brought me, imagine (if possible you can) the complaints I made, the blasphemies I threw out against the providence of our gods, and the horrible actions my despaire made me resolve on. I flew after the ravisher of my blisse, without the knowledge or my advertizing of any of my subjects, and fearing no danger but that which threatned Coriza. I ran through the Woods and Mountaines, and got into the countrey of my greatest enemy. I was so happy in my search, that yesterday at Sun-set I descry'd Maranita's troupe. That object transporting me with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>; I neither consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the number of my enemies, nor the inequality of the combat I was about, but desperately fell in among the traytors, to have atleast the contentment to die in the sight of my Coriza. Maranita, eyther not induring to see mee, or persecuted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of his Conscience, made ten or twelve of his associats to turne on me, and kept forth his way whilest I strove to rid me of those that would stop me. I spent all the rest of the day, to bring them in case that they should no more contest with me for my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and party of the night to follow the ravisher. You saw how I found him, and you must now informe me who were those that fought with him, and what oblieged you to fight in his defence, Therewith Coriza spake. Zelmatida (said shee to her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) cannot satisfie your demand. I alone knowe the true cause of that combat, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because it was done in my presence, but that by my endeav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ur it was undertaken. You shall know that among those whose service Maranita made use of for my rape, there were two, who not being able to see mee without loving me (at least they strove to perswade me so) gave me their fayths that they would free mee from the hands of that Traytor. But they asked me for my ransome, that which I could not grant them. I feyn'd yet, to consent and did so dex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ee mee from the tyranny of Maranita. I call'd then for my two lovers, and having conjur'd them to leave me no longer at the mercy of our common enemie; I perswaded them so effectually, that presently under some ill pretext they quarelled, and fell on him. Truly on this occasion he shewed a great deale of courage. Two of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies he slew, and though his owne had not come to helpe him, I beleeve hee had beene able enough to have dispatch'd all the rest. Amongst the five bodies you see ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there on my right hand, are my unfortunate lovers. This while those that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the conspiracy, desirous to revenge their deaths, let drive at Maranita, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stoutly repuls'd, they were constrayned to take them to their heeles.</p>
                  <p>Maranita transported with fury, followed them, with those of his owne party, and was an houre before I saw him againe. For my self, I was not in a little trouble, for I saw an occasion present it selfe, to get me away, and when I would have put it in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I knew, that by reason of the chaines on my heeles I was not possibly able to goe. I threw my selfe then on the ground againe, and calling oftentimes Tumanama to helpe me, I would needes try whether my fetters were not strong enough to free me from my slavery. I had already many times beate them against my face, when I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Maranita retiring before foure men, who doubtlesse would have made him smart for the death of their companions. This new combate staied my fury, and made me hope to obtaine by other hands then mine owne, the end of my captivity. And true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for the succour you gave him (said she, regarding Zelmatida) the traytors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had avenged me on the Author of their treason. But twas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the punishment of his crimes, from the hand of him whom he had the most offended, and that he should fall, under the victorious armes of my deare Tumanama. This Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse could no longer continue her discourse, nor the Princes stay longer by her, for at that very instant they perceived a Troupe of armed men like the theeves that run through the Realme of Mexico. Zelmatida and Tumanama, attended by some servants, went to meet them, and without giving them time to bethinke themselves so furiously charged them, that a part of them were left dead on the place, and the rest got away and saved themselves in the wood that is at the foote of the burning Mountaine. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida seeing that these petty incounters were so easily put over, perswaded himselfe that the Hie-priest had made matters far more dangerous then they were, but he soone changed his opinion, for he saw a man higher then he by the halfe, who made the same noise in running as a man would doe armed after your fashion. This Giant carried on his shoulders a club, heavy enough to braine by his weight many men at once. He lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up this mighty logge of wood against Zelmatida, and threatning him, yeeld (said he) or prepare thy selfe to suffer the punishment I reserve for those of thy quality. Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida insteed of losing time in vaine replies, imployed it in purging the world of a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster who alone was able to make it desolate. He darted a long Javelin at him which fell luckily at his feet and gave him a great wound. The Giant roring as an enraged Lion, threw himselfe on my deare Master and had almost overthrowne him; but his agility serving him insteed of strength, he passed this great stroke in slipping aside, and gave the Giant a blow far more dangerous then the first. The Giant feeling himselfe so wounded recoyled to take his ayme and kill his enemie with one sole blow of his club. But seeing it a vailed him not, he betooke him to other weapons and gave my Lord the Inca divers blowes which he could not avoyde. He was wounded in many places, and had been in danger of his life, if desperately throwing himselfe on his enemy he had not luckily stroke his head through with his halfe pike. The Giant, with the blow tooke his death and fell at the feet of his conqueror. About that time the day arose and Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida weakned with his travell and the losse of bloud was enforced to lay him on the ground. Coriza ran quickly to him with two of his slaves, and weeping told him, that whilst he fought Tumanama was like to be murdred by other theeves, and that he was exceedingly wounded. In that extreamity the gods made knowne that they watch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies for the safety of extraordinary men, for within a little after Zelmatida saw many men and women comming out from among the trees and bushes which grow on the descent of the mountaine. These people seemed to be very much affrighted, for such as had taken the boldnesse to come downe lower then their companions, fled presently after with as much feare and hast as if indeed they had been pursued. Zelmatida looking on them, beckoned that they should come to him, but whether they tooke no heede to it, or were too much afraide, once, they would not come out of their fastnesse. This while Tumanama was no sooner recoverd from his fainting occasioned by his wounds, but he besought Coriza to informe him whether my Lord the Inca were dead: He is not, said the Princesse, but his prodigious valour hath triumphed over that terrible Giant as well as on his other enemies. If it be so, replied Tumanama, bring me to him, to the end, that taking that excellent man for a witnesse and executor of my last will, I may before my death pay some of those obligations for which I stand engaged to you, and give you a defender that may free your virtue from the oppression of any miscreant. Coriza melting into teares at the discourse of her lover, helped to raise him, and taking him under the arme, led him where Zelmatida was laied downe. Imagine, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment those two perfect friends received in their interviewe. Tumanama hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being able to speake. Zelmatida (said he) to my deare Master; the Gods reserve you for so many other faire adventures, that I am most assured, that this last shall not give an end to your life. Therefore I conjure you by our sincere amity to take Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za into your protection, and to put her in possession of those estates that I leave her, as a token of my most humble servitude. He could not continue this discourse for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invironed with the same men that had so long looked on Zelmatida from the toppe of the Mountaine. They began all to gaze on the two Princes; and to shew their asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment by their gestures and their cries. Some went to visit the bodies of those that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54727:27"/>
were slaine, and the first they met withall was the Giant. At sight of him, their cries or to say more properly, their howlings redoubled. Some of them after they had turned the Giant on all sides came running to the Princes and inquired, which of them 'twas that had been able to fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ish so hard an enterprise? Tumanama weake as he was, failed not to raise himselfe to speake to those Villagers, and tell them in what manner Zelmatida had vanquished the Giant. Instantly they threw themselves on their knees round about my Lord the Inca, and kissing his feet and his hands, cried out, that the fearfull Popocam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecho had received a chastisement for his offences, and that one of their gods had taken the shape of a man to avenge all Mexico. Scarce had they finished these words when men, women and children came and cast themselves at the feet of Zelmatida, and kissing the earth, give him all the thanks they could. Zelmatida intreated them not to goe on in their Idolatries, and told them that he was no god, but a man, who having almost shed all his bloud, was even ready to expire if he were not the sooner relieved. These words increased the wonder of the country people, and made them more earnestly to search for their remedies. Some ran one way, others another, and those of the better sort staying to assist Zelmatida and Tumanama, carried them to certaine houses which were at the foot of the Mountaine towards the Sun rising. Tumanama being lesse wounded then Zelmatida was recured in few daies, by virtue of the herbes of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mountaine, and desirous to observe that which my deare Master had prescribed him, tooke his leave of him assoone as he could, and departed towards his owne home to fast there those delights which the possession of the faire Coriza could give him. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida, who was honored as a god amongst those rusticall people, was looked after with so good successe, that in fifteen daies (by virtue of those herbes they applied to them) his woundes were all closed up, and cured. I cannot relate to you the love those Mexicans shewed him, nor their well treating him. Amongst all their kindnesses he still mused on his journy, and thinking on the predictions of Tisnatidez, imagined the event of things cleane contrary to that which hapned. If (said he to himselfe) a combate whereof the Hie-priest told me not, but as of an accident scarce considerable hath brought me to the extreamity wherein I am, I must presently resolve, to perish in that which I am to undertake at Mexico. I remember well his very words. There (said he, speaking of the burning Mountaine) you shall finde against whom to exercise your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. And when you have overcome your enemies; goe on, neere to a Towne that gives name to the Kingdome of Mexico. It wil be ther that you wil have need of all your forces. What extraordinary forces should the gods send me (continued Zelmatida) to be a victor yet on the second occasion, since in this first I have met with none which have not been almost overcome? This consideration lasted no longer then his sicknesse. Assoone as he could walke, he forgot what was passed and feared, not what was to come after. Yet staied he sometime with those people to get his perfect health and strength, and to exterminate that mischievous brood of Robbers. He therefore got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, followed by all the inhabitants of the mountaine, and marched into the thickest of the woods and the depth of the caves to finde out those publike pestilences.</p>
                  <p>In eight daies he executed of them two hundred, and discovering the last place of their retreit, he besieged them, and after two or three affaults, seeing they were too well entrench'd to be taken, he permitted (the poore people whom these monsters had so long time persecuted) to burne them, and for ever to destroy the seede of them. When he sawe that there was no more to doe for the safety of the villagers, he thank'd them, for the respect he had there found, and by a speech that drew teares from all that were about him, promised his assistance whensoever they should stand in neede of it. He thought by this, that he had bid them farewell, but he was much deceiv'd, when he would have beene gone: They told him, that for the good he had done to all the country, they were bound to conduct him where his valour should receive the reward it had deserved. This new promise of honour displeased him extreamly; but well hee might strive to put it off, and feigne important designes to alter the resolutions of those people, 'twas all to no purpose, and when he thought to have stolne from them, hee found it as much impossible. There was nothing then but patience; goe he must, and be content to conforme himselfe to the will of his rustica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54727:27"/>
The day of their departing agreed on, there assembled at least five or six hundred accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred after their manner; that was, from the gyrdle to their knees cover'd with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of divers colours, Hats of flowres on their heads, and bowes and arrowes in their hands. They were ready to dislodge at day breake, and as soone as Zelmatida was ready, they put themselves in order and marched by sixe and sixe before him. They sung in such a tone as was never heard, and leaping, and dancing in such postures, enough to make a man die with laughing; seem'd to leave nothing undone which could be wish'd for by their deliverer. One amongst them that had the stature of a Gyant carried a Lance made of an entyre tree, at whose end hee had fixed the head Popocampecho, and underneath were hung his armes in manner of a trophy. Zelmatida followed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two men that Tumanama had left him. Fifteene or twenty of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocampechoes companions, whom they had kept alive for this tryumph, were bound in chaines of gold, and came after my deare Lord, compell'd by the bastonadoes of their guard, which were often redoubled in remembrance of the miseries they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly endured by them. During all the journey, the King passed not by any place that was inhabited, where he was not received with all the honour that they could have given to Montezuma himselfe. Those that liv'd on the high way prepar'd Sacrifices for him, and presented themselves with the same respects and ceremonies as they observ'd before their gods. Those which abode further off came to attend him as hee passed with presents, and all gave him the title of their Deliverer, as if in the death of Popocam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecho he had exterminated all the Monsters of Mexico. After many of such pleasant dayes travell, the King espied a towne farre greater then all the rest he had seene in his journey. He asked the name of it, of the most eminent of his troupe, who told him that it was the capitall City of the kingdome, called Mexico, and that they conducted him thither to be presented to the Queene Hismelita, who in the absence of Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma did performe all the royall offices. The king hath commanded me to tell you that this newes amaz'd him, with such an apprehension that he never met with before. He knew before the end of this day that this feare had beene the certaine presage of his imprisonment, and a secret advertisement which he received from the gods, to observe all those things which they had anounced to him by the mouth of their hye-Priest. But in lieu of giving this explication to his feare, he condemn'd himselfe as a weake man; and taking rash resolutions, scorn'd all the perills which he was to run through. This done, he began to take notice of the marvelous seituation of Mexico, and before hee came on that long causeway, which crosseth the marshes where it is built, stay'd in a Playne so covered with flowres and trees, compassed with so many channells, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with so many sources of living fountaines, that he confest there was nothing more delightfull to be seen. He had walk'd a little while amongst those trees, when they which marched in the van, stopped, and caused the rest to doe so too. The reason of this stay was soone knowne, as well by the shoutes of some as the talke of others. The most forward came to the King and told him that Hismalita was set downe in that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe with all her Court, and should seeme was expresly come thither to receive him. Presently Zelmatida commanded that all those that were before him should open their ranks, and range themselves in file on both sides the way. It was as soone done as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and then the king sawe the Queenes Troupe; when hee imagined that they saw him, he tooke a javelin, and marched up to that Princesse with such a grace and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that in the judgement of all those that were with Hismelita, they were found to be beyond comparison. I have heard by others more particularly then from my deare Master of this interview. I will therefore make an essay to relate to you what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of it, though in so doing I goe beyond the bounds prescrib'd me.

As soone as he had done his obeysance to her, he intreated pardon for the insolent traine wherewith he was inforced to come before her, and concealing his condition and Countrey, made himselfe taken for a kinsman of the last Cacique that Montezuma had brought under his obedience. He told her that his duty and ill fortune equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining him to leave his Countrey, he was come to serve Montezuma; and that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing neere to a Mountaine that throwes forth fire, he had been set on by theeves, and had killed some of them, since when, at the intreaty of those who conducted him, and besides, seeing an expresse commandement signed by the hand of the King he had made some stay there, to purge the Countrey of those villaines; and that after the end of that little warre he would have rebetaken himselfe to his intended journey, but that it was not in his power to rid himselfe of the people that came with him. That he had been compelled to present himselfe before her in the estate she saw, and (weighing his being forced) he beseeched her humbly to consider him as a prisoner, that doth nothing but by the command of another, rather then as one indiscreet whose vanity makes him not know himselfe. Hismalita, replied, that for his delivering Mexico from a Monster, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med indomptable, there were not honours nor triumphs beyond his desert. That the pesants of whom he complained, had done nothing but what was commanded them: And that he should expect more glorious assurances of the magnificence, and love of Montezuma, then the rusticall intertainement of the inhabitants of Popocampecho had made him shew of, in witnessing to him their sensibilities of what he had done for them. These discourses gave place to others; and the Queen after she had dismissed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that encompassed her to behold this meeting, retained no more but Zelmatida and his two followers. The Court, thus remained freed, and had a long time its eyes fixed on my deare Master, as on an object worthy of admiration. Hismalita had never a Son, but she had foure Daughters, who though not much resembling, were neverthelesse perfectly beautifull. Zelmatida gave them almost the same compliment he had given their Mother; but he had no sooner cast his eyes on the tallest, though she was not the eldest, but a second feare almost put him from himselfe, and left him no longer to doubt of the cause of his first. The accustomed civilities being ended, the Queen commanded my deare Master to tell her what the misfortune was that had obliged him to abandon his Countrey, and by what miracle he became able to vanquish Popocampecho. He had not power enough over his soule to obey her; for he spake with such remarkable diversions, and deportments so far unlike those which were expected from him, that Hismalita tooke heede of it, and all the Court beleeved that he was thus confused, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had not been accustomed to live among that pompe and luster wherewithall great Princes are invironed. He intertained the Mother, and looked on the Daughter, he smiled insteed of answering the Queen when she asked him some serious question, and he was heard to sigh in recounting some adventures wherein he had all kind of advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. The end of that day being for my deare Master an unpleasing conversation; the Queen commanded him to follow her. He came along to her Pallace, and for all that could present it selfe for his object, he gave not over his musings. When he was in the Queens Chamber he impatiently wished that he might entertaine that young Marvell that had so easily overcome him. An occasion offered it selfe, for Hismalita being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to dispatch two posts which the King her husband had sent her, retired into her Councell Chamber. By her absence, Zelmatida abode in the most delectable company he could desire, and found a facile meanes to content his new passion. The first that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a word to entertaine him, was she, who in so little a space of time had caused so great a change in him. She had a far better wit then her sisters, and her conversation was so sweet, that it is to be beleeved, that had she had lesse beauty then she was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, the charmes of her minde were strong ynough to winne and arrest eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally whatsoever he were that deserved the quality of an honest man. Her high humour had till then kept her in such a contempt of our sex, that she beleeved not, men were worth the paines to be overcome. And though she were in a Court which from all times had been the seate of pleasure, of love, and all galantry, she yet lived with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible severity, and reserving all her light to her selfe, she did not only laugh at the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity of those of her age, but insteed of borrowing from Art strange attires and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54727:28"/>
she would not endure that nature should freely serve her selfe of the greater part of her owne.</p>
                  <p>Living in this manner, it required the same spirit and the same knowledge that my Lord the Inca possest, to have the same passion. He made it appeare from that evening that his Love was of that nature which instantly deprives men of all judgement. For I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zatida (so was the Princesse called) asking him some question, he found himselfe speech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse when he would have given her an answere. Shee noted in his face, I know not what of a man transported with joy; and who the more makes knowne his irregular passions by his unprofitable strivings to conceale them. And although Zelmatida would never be wonne to beleeve that this young Princesse loved him, yet a thousand proofes too visible, have made me ever thinke otherwise; and I am certaine that the residue of my relation will make you of my opinion: This Princesse then unwilling that the losse of a person whom she already esteemed as one of hers, should be knowne; told him that understanding from himselfe a part of those adventures had befaln him, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions wherewith fortune had crossed his virtue; Her sisters and her selfe would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly know the rest, and that they intreated him to give them that contentment; and not condemne for too much boldnesse a curiosity which grew only from the esteeme they had of him. My deare Master, from thence, taking occasion to begin a discourse that might serve for his Love. I have (said he) too much proofe of the Justice, or rather of the hatred of the gods, to beleeve that there hath ever any thing happened in my life may be worthy your esteeme or curiosity. 'Tis for you, and those incomparable beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about you, that those powers reserve all that can be call'd glory, value and admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Men are for no other end in the world but that you might have slaves; and that the Altars which you have merited, may be perpetually laden with offrings and sacrifices. O how happy may they esteeme themselves who have purity enough to be offered in so famous an oblation I but who dares vaunt of so much purity? Izatida, foreseeing what would ensue on this discourse, broake it off; and reviving the first, You may have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of speech (said she to Zelmatida) but you cannot deprive us of that opinion which the publique voice hath given us of your valour, and we know well (I speake for my sisters and my selfe) how to distinguish your humility from that which fame hath made us to admire in you before your arrivall. What could report speake in my behalfe (reply'd Zelmatida) who being b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Izatida (who question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse knew what he intended) reply'd; I have never heard that a man of spirit would so absolutely give himselfe into the hands of fortune, but that he would reserve a meanes to be reveng'd when he found that he had her in his power. You have hitherto done such things that they are so many witnesses whereby that enemy hath made you acquire more glory then shee hath been cause of the losse of your repose, and by consequence hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you more then ever she tooke from you.

                     </gap>t there are not many felicities which your virtues may not with reason pretend to. This discourse had longer conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, if Izatida's sisters had not interrupted her, and by their jealousies, as it were, ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from Zelmatida the occasion to make himselfe knowne to be no lesse winning in his conversation, then he was redoubtfull in his combats. This while the Queene had perfected her dispatches, and then returned where she left her daughters with Zelmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and from thence going into her bed-chamber, gave her new Guest the good-night. As soone as he was gone forth, ten or twelve Officers came and accompanied him to the lodgings provided for him. He was brought into a chamber so faire and richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, that if he had not too well remembred the losse Izatida had made him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections hindred him from enjoying that rest which his valour made him finde in the very midst of his Enemies. Sometimes he entertaind himselfe with Izatidaes sweete eyes, sometimes with the whitenesse of her complexion, then with the beauty of her stature, and after with the colour of her hayre. But when he passed from the allurements of her body to those of her minde, he was no more capeable to feare the disasters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall

Quasmez high-Priest had threatned him. Prophet (said he, so lowd that he was heard by his followers) give me leave to accuse you of injustice in your councells. Why would you have me to defend my selfe when I see no enemie to assaile me, if you give not that name to the sole Author of my lives felicity? Certainely you little knew the power of Isatida's eyes, when you thought me able enough to resist them.</p>
                  <p>But what said I? No, no, you had a perfect konwledge of it, and well foresaw my captivity, when you foretold me that I should be victorious in this last combate if I were alwaies my selfe. You were not ignorant that that would be impossible for me, since to behold this wonder, and to be master of himselfe, was to trenche upon the wisdome of the very gods, and to act something beyond their miracles. In the like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course he passed the rest of the night, and without comforting himselfe with any of those hopes wherewithall Lovers are accustomed to flatter themselves; made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resolution then to force Xaira from her prison, and himselfe to abide eternally in that of Isatida. In this thought he called his servants. Those that they had given to serve him, dressed him whilst he entertained himselfe only with his passion. He was in this melancholy till the Queen was up, and when he knew that she was ready to goe to the Temple, he came forth to accompany her. Hismalita obliged him to spend most of the day with her, and the houre being come at what time she was used to walke, she brought him into those faire Meadowes, where he saw her the first time, and her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were with them. Isatida who that day had begun to borrow something of art to make her more lovely, appeared to the Kings eyes, as if beauty it selfe seated in her Throne, imperiously commanded him neither to doe nor thinke any thing but for her. As soone as those who carried the Queene and the Princesses had set them downe, Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida was engaged to be with Hismalita, and constrained not to discourse with Isati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da but with his eyes and thought. The Queene intertained him a long time with the state of her affaires, and the secret factions that the jealousie of divers Caciques, and the arrivall of some unknowne men had hatched among her Subjects. The nothing-to-the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpose speeches wherewith Zelmatida interrupted the Queenes discourse and the councells out of all likelihood which he would have her accept as the safest, made him so unlike himselfe, that Hismalita had small cause to take him for that famous Heire of Quasmez who had made himselfe dreadfull to all the Potentates of our world. And to say truth, who would ever have thought, that this great Prince who till then had never any passion but for fame, who had so absolutely renounced all the pleasures of youth and sence, and who by the strength and solidity of his deliberations had astonished the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest Councellors of the State of Quasmez, had been capable of such an alteration? Yet he was so, and added so many extravagancies to those which had already weariedH is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malita, that she diverted her speech to some others that were neere her, to have no more on her hands, a man, that was such ill company. This disgrace, was, to him, very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable, for by that, he had sooner the liberty to speake to Isatida, and to continu e the discourse which he had begun the day before. He drew neere her, and unheard of any body, tooke so fitly an occasion to make her know his sufferings, that in lieu of those or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary neglects which are most commonly the first answers of those that are spoken to in the dialect of love; he received from Isatida only words of civility. All the rest of the day passed in the like entertaines, and (if I may speake it) before that my deare Master left that amyable Princesse, he had cause to beleeve that her discretion much pleased him. The night comming on, the Queene returned with all her Court, but more satisfied with Zelmatida's valour then his wit. On the other side, the Prince, not being able to repent the overture of his affection to Isatida, was willing to let some daies slip away, to give time to that Princesse to accustome her selfe to his passion. In the meane while, the continuall converse he had with her, made him discover so many new inticements, that he had been indeed mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe received with so much sweetnesse, and his discourse listned to, with so many signes of satisfaction, that had he been lesse scrupulous then he was, he had been a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

language; he let his passion so much transport him, that he made her a more ample and expresse declaration then any of his former, and that shee might not condemn him of boldnesse or daring, assured her that he was the sonne of a King. This audacious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was in all likelyhood to have a contrary successe then it had, but the Prince his infinite love, and the purity of his intention deserv'd not a lesse favourable treatment. Isatida blush'd at the freenesse of my deare Master, and rested some while silent, but comming at last from her bashfullnesse; I shall be glad (said she) to see whether you be capeable of that perfection whereof you vaunt your selfe. I accept of your service, and promise you to put your patience to the test.</p>
                  <p>See how Isatida express'd her affection to my Lord the Inca: but (said she) tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that you are ignorant how rigorous the conditions are, by which I give you leave to serve me. It behooves you to have an asseduitie without example, that your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects goe even to Idolatry, and that Death it selfe be not powerfull enough to breake your silence, And more, take it for most certayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Things being on these termes; the King bethought him of Quasmez, and at the same instant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to imploy Isatida for the delivery of Xaira. One day therefore, finding an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to speake to her, without any over-hearing, he entertain'd her long time with the obligations he stood engaged to her, gave her new assurances of his inviolable fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and making, as I may say, his heart to come on his lippes, constrayned Isatida to confesse in her selfe that it was impossible not to suffer her selfe to be overcome by the perswasions of a Lover so discreete and passionate. When Zelmatida sawe her so well prepared: If I may be permitted (said he) to forget my selfe for a little time, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in my good fortune, aspire higher then I ought; be pleased faire Isatida that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire from you a new favour, to assure me that you have not repented of those which you have already bestowed on me. Isatida stopping him as he was going on with this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, told him that those words which he imployed to prepare her to accept his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, were so many injuries done to her friendshippe: That she conjured him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that there was nothing, whilest he was as sage and respectfull as hitherto hee had beene, which he might not without vanity promise himselfe from a person who made a particular profession to be just; That he should not therefore feare to make known what he desired from her, and that he should assure himselfe that his request should bee absolutely unjust or else be granted him. Zelmatida, unwilling to shewe of too much boldnesse or too much feare, lest any of them might seeme too much affected, and by consequence vitious, thought that he might adventure. He besought therefore with his usuall grace a favorable audience from Isatida, and obtayning it, told her in few words his engagements to the King Quasmez, made knowne the principall accidents of his infancy, the revelation of the high-Priest, the rapt of the Princesse Xa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

she perceived he affected it) but with much a doe, the conversation of Isatida. Yet she made him no shew of her ill humor, but caused him to be continually watched by her trusty spies; and as soone as she knew him to be with the Princesse, she still found some pretext to take him off. Garruca could not goe on with this discourse, for divers of the Pyrats entring into Bajazets chamber, and telling him that they had unshipped and stowed all the riches they found in the Spanish shippes in their Magazines, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him an Inventory of them. After he had seene it he lock'd it up, and told the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that when they had given the dead the honour they merited in their lives by their brave actions, he would cause the store-houses to be opened, to distribute and partake with the living, that which their valour had given them. The most aged of the Pirats having praysed the justice of Bajazet, told him that all things necessary for the funerals of their companions were ready, and they only waited his command to beginne the Ceremonies: Bajazet would willingly have put it off till the morrow, but loath to displease, he dismissed them with an assurance that within an houre he would come forth of the Cittadell.</p>

The houre being come wherein this pompe was to begin, you might have heard resound the noyse of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and Timbrells throughout all the Island. Bajazet then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe to be armed, and comming out of the Fort, went to joyne with the other Captaines and Officers, as well by Land as Sea. One amongst them read to him a List of all the dead Captaines, and in few words, made as it were an abridgement of the life of every one, and besought him in the name of the Pyrats to assist at the funeralls of so many valiant and happy Mussulmen. Bajazet, in generall, thank'd all the assistants for the honour done him, spoke of the dead in advantageous termes, and after repetition of the principall points of their lives encouraged evr'y one to contemn all dangers when the good of the common cause came in question. Bajazet finish'd his Oration just when the three Princes came to him, and concealing the true cause of their arrivall, beseeched him to bee pleased that they with him, might give what they beleeved was due to the memory of so many vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men. We shall not, my companions and my selfe (answered Bajazet) those alone that rescent the honour that you will doe us, but the Soules of those that we are now interring will rejoyce at it, and if you please to add your suffrages to your presence, we doubt not but they will worthily satisfie the interrogation of the two Angells, and be delivered from the torment of the grave. Polexander understanding not well the meaning of these words, beleev'd that they were some mysterious words in the Religion of Mahomet, and resolv'd to remember them, to have their interpretation at the first conveniency. This while Bajazet put himselfe in the front of the pyrates, and so came to the place where lay the bodies that were to be buried. All things being ready at the comming of Bajazet, every one began to march in his ranke. The Captaines chosen to carry the corps, tooke their places, whilest their Talismans and their Dervises put themselves in the order they were to keepe in their marching. These Mahometish Monkes carried in their hands lighted tapers, and sung with a sad note these words. <hi>Ialihae, hillala Mehemet, ressullaha, tungari bicberemberac,</hi> whereby they would say; That God is God, that there is no other God but he, and that Mahomet is his sole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and only Prophet. At those words, others answered them in a different tone, and pronounced these words: <hi>Alla rhahumane ashamubula, alla illa alla huma alla.</hi> By this prayer which they make for that dead, they say that God is mercifull, that he will have pitty on the deceased, that there is no other God but God: After these Priests went divers Souldiers armed after their fashion; they carried Launces in their hands, on whose ends were the Turbants of the dead, with horse tayles. Next came those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54727:31"/>
that carried the bodies of their companions in bieres made like square chests, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great clothes made of cotten very white. The manner of the Mahometans is, to carry their dead to be buried the head foreward, and so were these, and there was to be seene on the fore-end of their bieres other turbants covered with feathers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with lighted candles. Bajazet, all alone followed those bodies, and some thirty paces behinde him, marched all those that had command under his charge.</p>
               <p>The Companies of the dead Captaines followed, but in an other order then they had kept till that time. Every Souldier carried his armes reversed and witnessed as much greife as if he had been the neerest kinsman, or the most affectionate of the departed. There was one Souldier of every Company who trained an Ensigne on the ground, and behinde him came fifteen or twenty Souldiers, who bore shattered lances, broken oares, and colours of white taffata whereon there were red crosses. At last, some Moores led in their hands, very brave horses, which had their saddles turned the upside downe on their backs. All this Troupe marened very slowly and in great silence, whilst the Dervises continued the forsaid prayers. Their place of buryalls was chosen in a little wood, which was some five hundred paces from the Fortresse. As soone as the Priests were come thither, they rancked themselves about the graves and ended their prayers. The Captaines, the while set the bieres on tables right against the pits. They tooke off the clothes and boords where with they were covered, and then every one might see the dead wounde up in such sort, that they had the face and the feet out of the wynding sheet. The Priests tooke the little peeces of paper that were on the stomacks of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased, and after they had made a composition of Saffron and water of Orenge flower wrote certaine words which the Moores believe to be powerful and mysterious in their Religion. These words being writ, the Dervices hung the scrols with black silke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neckes of the dead, and said a long prayer, by which they asked from God and Mahomet that the soules of the defunct might be delivered from the punishment of the Angels. And therewith the Dervises set the bieres on the ground and with clothes of cotten let them downe into the graves, seven or eight foote deepe. They threw in some habillements and some of the colours which they bore to the interment, as a marke that the dead had gained them. Afterwards they covered the graves with many great planckes, that had been prepared of purpose, and raised on them with turfes and stones, Tombes of some six foot long and foure hie, and three in largenesse. During this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the Priests gave not over their prayers to obtaine of God that those dead might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer pertinently when they should be examined by the two black Angels. This cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ended, every one departed with diverse actions of thankfullnesse, and Bajazet being disarmed on the place, returned thence, in the company of Polexander, Zelmatida and Iphidamantus. Bajazet asked them, if they were not well satisfied in the honour that those of his Religion gave to the dead. Zelmatida confessed, that the ceremony pleased him, but Iphidamantus went further, and besought Bajazet to tell him, what those Pirates did beleeve should become of their soules after death; and why they made so many prayers to obtaine from God that the dead should be delivered from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the two Angels and the torment of the grave? That which you aske me (answered Bajazet) is so peculiar to the Mahometans, and held so great a mystery in their Religion, that you ought to have been bred, or to have long time lived among them, to give you an accompt of it. Yet I will endeavour to satisfie your curiosity. And though I am a weake Theologitian I dare assure my selfe to cleare you of it, since I most particularly informed my selfe of that point, when the necessity of my owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence engaged me to accept the charge which I now undergoe. Know then that all those who beleeve in Mahomet, hold for an Article of faith, that the dead are liable to give an accompt of their actions in this life, and that they are to give it before two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely rigorous Judges; and those are two Angels, the one is called Mongir, and the other Guaneguir. The first carries alwaies a club of iron, the second holds with both his hands certaine hookes exceeding sharpe, and they are both black. Scarce can a dead man be in his grave so long as since we buried our Captaines, but the two Angels come. They command the dead to arise, to kneele, and to cover his body with his soule, so as during his life time his soule was covered by his body. As soone as the deceased
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54727:31"/>
hath given satisfaction to these severall commands; the two Angels begin to examine him on divers points of his beleefe, and on the principall actions of his life. That is: Whether he hath constantly beleeved in Mahomet, whether he hath endeavoured to doe good workes enough to keepe him from those black and dreadfull Countries which they call Algenas Alsaitanas. They aske him an infinity of more questions, as, whether he hath observed the ceremonies of the Zala, whether he hath been a great Alm'ner, whether he hath not failed to fast his Radaman, which is the same that the Christians call Lent. If he have paid all the dues that he owed to the Ministers of Mahomet, and in short; if he hath never broken any of the commandements contained in the Zuna of that great Prophet. When as the dead, (that hath then no more liberty to lie) hath given an accompt of his life, and that the black Angels are satisfied; They leave, and vanish from him. Presently after there appeare to him two others more white then snow that rejoce with him for his good deeds, and promise him eternall recompances. They lay him as he was before the comming of the two first Angels. One puts his arme under his head to serve him for a bolfter, the other in the same manner keeps up his leggs, and both of them guard him, entertaine him, and promise not to forsake him till the day of Judgement. But if it happen that the deceased, condemned by his owne conscience stand mute before the black Angels; or gives them an accompt like an ill steward that knowes not what he hath done with the goods that were intrusted in his hands: Mongir, gives him so great a blow on the head with his club that he alwaies carries for that purpose, that he drives the poore crimenell more then fifteen foot deepe into the earth. And presently Guaneguir making use of his hookes fixeth them on the wretch, and drawes him by force out of the ground; nor doth this exercise end, for as soone as the dead is plucked out of his hole by the one, the other knocks him in againe with his club; and so continuing this double punishment, they never leave him in rest nor ought to leave him till the day of Judgement. Bajazet giving the Princes thus to understand the secrets of so extravagant a Religion, astonished them. Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus likewise turning to Bajazet, I confesse said he, that your people here are very charitable, and scrupulous to be of a profession, sufficiently contrary to the rules of a devoute life. You are deceived (said Bajazet, The Zuna of Mahomet gives us a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to warre with those that are enemies to his law, and to hold for goods lawfully gotten all that we can take from them by our utmost force, or otherwise. Besides you tooke no notice that in the relation I made you of the interrogatory of the two Angels, you heard me not speake of any theft or murther. After this doubt cleered, Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus replied) I have no more to aske you, but I finde that Mahomet was very provident in fitting the mysteries of his religion to the humours of those that should embrace it, and so tempered all things, that according to his accommodations a man may be a great murtherer, a great theefe, and a very honest man, and altogether. It is prophanely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken said Bajazet to give the attributes which abuse hath made abhominable, to permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and glorious actions. Mahometans never steale. They content themselves with the taking from the enemies of their Prophet all meanes they have that might hurt them; and by a new kinde of vindicative Justice they chastice those that bandy themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law which God hath visibly sent from Heaven to the earth, and published by the mouth of Mahomet. Though by these words Bajazet seemed to be very passionate in defence of the Alcoran, yet he uttered them in a certaine negligent manner, that it made the Princes thinke he beleeved not all that he spake. In talking of these curiosities they came where they used to lodge. Bajazet, according to his custome gave the three Princes their dinner, and during the repast, related to them divers secret ceremonies which made up the principall mysteries of the Religion of Mahomet. They were taken from the table by the shouts of the Pirates, and the noise of the brazen drums. Bajazet knowing that the Princes were resolved to end the day as they had begun it, told them, that they were about the election of twenty new Captaines to fill up the places of the dead; and that there would be something passed in this meeting worthy their seeing, Hereupon Bajazet tooke his leave of them, and went to the place where all his Army attended him. Polexander and Zelmatida more to please Iphidamantus then to see things so unworthy their high and sad thoughts, went out of the Fort, and came into a great
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54727:32"/>
plaine which was appointed for the mustering of the pyrates. They sawe presently that at a signall given the Army divided it selfe into Regiments, and so stood till Bajazet had taken the whole view of them: streight after the Regiments joyn'd, and made up foure batalions. The Officers that were wont to give them the Oath, came to the head of the troopes, and after five or six words spoken made them raise such a shoute, that it lasted neere a quarter of an houre; This noyse being ended, the Sergeant-Major gave another word, and presently the batalyons marched, and in marching separated into Companies; the one halfe tooke to the left hand and the other to the right, and both of them by their evolutions, making a crescent, shut it up at last and represented a perfect ovall. Bajazet and all his officers were inclosed in the midst, while all the Captaines left their companies, and that according to their age or merit they came neere to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet, they brought him a horse, on which he was no sooner mounted but he made a signe that he would speake. At that action all the troopes drew and pressed so neere, that men and armes touched, and there being a generall silence, Bajazet began thus: My Companions, we are not reduc'd to the cruell necessitie of that people which are govern'd by Masters that know not the Lawes, or know them but to violate them. Here neither the fantasticknesse of the Soveraigne, nor the interest of a Favorite, nor the consideration of byrth, nor the necessitie of affaires give commands to those that deserve them not: Our valour and services are the only staires by which we mount thither, and the most ambitious amongst us would think himselfe guilty of a weakenesse that he would not pardon in his owne brest, if he had had a thought to gaine his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions eyther by bribes or promises. But we must avow for our honour, that as there are no corruptors amongst us, so there is not one that will be corrupted. Let us this day renew so ancient truth, by the election we are bound to make. Let us give our Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to great Services, to many wounds, and to long experience, and since the honour to command is the destin'd wages for the actions of the heart, let us fill the vacant pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with those that we shall thinke most worthy. I know 'tis very hard to give a voice for some one amongst this infinite number of brave souldiers that encompasse us. But why doe we frame to our selves these difficulties? Our lawes prescribe us what to doe: If two be equally worthy of a charge, let the eldest be chosen. Those with whom their age leaves the contentment of hope, ought not to envy others the comfort of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced.</p>
               <p>Bajazet, for speaking thus, was no lesse admired for his wisedome then he had beene at other times for his courage. All the Rovers witnessed their admiration by a certaine humming of their voyces passing amongst them; and the three Princes ravished with the eloquence of this illustrious Corsary, avowed that he deserved to be, not the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of a Troope of Theeves, but the absolute Master of all the people of Africa. Whilest they thus entertain'd themselves with the prayers of Bajazet; he that thought on somewhat else, was dismounted from his horse, and caus'd his troopes to be ranked that they might give their voices after the accustomed manner. Every Company carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ticket to their Captaine, and every Captaine delivered with his owne (which was worth foure) into the hands of his Collonel: the Collonels were bound to put all these billets into order, and to meete together to conferre the one with the other. These cockets, being filed together, were carried to the foure chiefe of the Councell. Those Officers reserv'd none but those wherein were writ the names of the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Souldiers, and went presently to deliver them to the Generall. The power of the Generall appeared particularly in this occasion. He had liberty to choose amongst them all, those that pleased him best, and his Suffrage was of so great esteeme, that when he had chosen them, they were reputed more old then the others, though indeede they were the younger. All these particularities being observ'd in this last election, and Bajazet neither augmenting nor lessening the age of those that were named, drew twenty little scroles where were the names of twenty Souldiers, which were mounted to the dignity of Captaines in the places of those that had beene buried in the morning. These preferrements pleas'd them all, and the news being presently carried to the ships, you might see on the one side the ayre enlightned with artificiall fire-works, and on the other darkned with the smoake of the Canon. During this noyse and confusion,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54727:32"/>
the Generall assisted with all his Captaines went through his Troopes, to finde out those that had changed their condition by this election; but those old Souldiers receiv'd it with countenances that testified enough that they put no difference betweene their present fortune and their passed condition. Those who had beene their Captaines came and tooke and told them that hence forward they were companions. It is above twenty yeares since you gave us that name reply'd the new Captaine; besides, we that never saw you command any thing that was not just, have receiv'd your injunctions as proofes of your wisdome, and not as signes of your authority.</p>
               <p>Bajazet admired this reasoning, and said alowd that there was great apparence, those Captaines would command admirably well since they knew so well how to obey: And therewith tooke the Baudricks and Colours of the dead one after another and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented them to their Successors. Our lawes command (said he) that you make us an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridged relation of your life, before wee give you the last markes of the command whereto you are lawfully called. They, without any astonishment did what they were enjoyned, and spoake of things so strange, and so ridiculous, that Bajazet, as well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed as he was to their manner of life, had much a doe to refraine from laughter. The rest of the day and all the night following were spent in playes and feasts. But the three Princes being retyred with Bajazet, sate downe at table; and presently after, Polexander causing every one to depart the roome, tooke Garruca and made him seate himselfe by him, and this generous Favorite knowing well what the Prince desired of him spoake thus.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I Will, since it is your pleasure, begin my discourse where it was interrupted, and will continue it by the jealousies and suspitions of Hismalita. This Queene had melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fits and disquietings, which amazed all her Court, and made the wisest avoide all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of seeing her. She endured not Zelmatida but by constrayning her selfe. Shee sought every day some pretext to be rid of him, and the consideration of this stranger made her to hate her owne blood; she gave to Isatida divers proofes of an anger that was the more to be feared because it was lesse broken out. Whilest this secret hatred crossed the felicity of those innocent Soules, and made them feare all that their amorous imaginations could frame the most horrible and fearfull; Fortune came to assist Love, and by a pranke of her wonted inequalitie, would doe service to virtue, deride the cruell policy of Hismalita, confound all the providence of her Councellors and Divines, and contribute her assistance to the accomplishing of things that had beene so often promised to my deare Master. She corrupted (if I must use that word) those whom the Queene most trusted, that so Zelmatida might be in safety and discover all the designes that they set on foote to destroy him. Many of Hismalitaes domestiques, wonne with the sweetnesse, the courtesie, and the liberality of this Prince, advertis'd him of what was deliberated in their Mistresse cabinet, and beleev'd that to be trusty to her, was to be unfaithfull and traytors to their gods and themselves. Amongst others Galtazis (who in the body of an Infant had the wit of a man, and as very a dwarfe as he was might bee called, not the defect out a miracle of Nature) was the first that gave Zelmatida intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the bloody resolutions that Hismalitaes feare made her take against him. This little one had beene given to Isatida when Montezuma conquer'd the Estates of the Cacique of Zampoallan, and presently grew so passionately amorous of the Princesse, that he every day blessed his misfortune and captivity, since through it he had attayned to the glory to be the slave of so faire a Mistresse. Hismalita that almost in all things shewed a jealousie of her daughter had taken him from her, and imagined that by her savours and caresses she might so gaine him that he might serve her for a Spie. But this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54727:33"/>
generous little courage abhorring all basenesse and treachery, continued constant to what he had promis'd Isatida; and had it not beene by the expresse commandment she gave him, to feigne, and make a shew of extreame love to Hismalita, he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have died, then done things so contrary to his thoughts. When Zelmatida came to Mexico, Hismalita lov'd nothing more then this dwarfe, and beleev'd him so much hers, that she feard not to discover to him what she had of most secrecy. But hee that knew well on what conditions he gave himselfe to that Queene, judiciously advertised his true Mistrisse of all that most imported her, and by his good Councell, made her to take hold of such occasions to please Hismalita, that the jealous Mother was constray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in despite of her selfe, to confesse that Isatida alone gave her more delight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation then all the rest of her daughters. Now this little-one, in all things following the inclinations of Isatida, very often without knowing them, had scarce seene my Lord the Inca, but he lov'd him, and so extraordinarily that he thought him only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to serve his faire Mistresse. Zelmatida for his part, was extreamly pleased in the conversation of this little-one, and seeing how judicious and faithfull he was, feared not to let him know his affection. Galtazis seeing things happen to his wish, interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himselfe in this Love, and contributed thereto not much lesse then Zelmatida himselfe.</p>
                  <p>And now, knowing from Hismalita, what feare the presence of this stranger threw on her, and learning some of those predictions on which all those jealousies were founded, he as soone gave my deare Master notice of it, and concealed not from him, that, in the end the Queene infallibly resolved to have him murthered. The dwarfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating thus much, advised him to absent himselfe for a while, and by a necessary flight avoide those cruelties that accompanied the jealousies of Hismalita. But Zelmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, embracing Galtazis, and laughing at his feares and councells; My friend (said he) since by a Lawe imposed on nature, all things must have an end, O how happy am I, to have met with so faire an occasion to perish in! I shall not die of a vulgar death, but shall have this advantage over all other men, that my death shall beget an envy in all those that can lay a claime to any generositie. Galtazis knowing the great spirit of Zelmatida, I confesse (said he) that you are worthy to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> my faire Mistresse. Goe on invincible Prince and feare not but the gods will turn away those disasters that threaten you. This little-one, after he had thus confirmed my deare Master in his resolution, left him, and went certainly to make it known to Isatida. The Inca having now thanked the Sunne, to whom he had a particular devotion, though he knew not yet that he was the Author of his Race, bethought how to gaine Hismalita by some eminent service for feare to lose Isatida. Yet among these different cares, he forgot not to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that Quasmez asked his daughter from him, and accused him for not being enough gratefull to him; He therefore sought out Isatida with an intent to speake to her yet once more for Xaira; but the Princesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ut him off the displeasure of petitioning twice for one thing. For as soone as she could with freedome speake to him. I am to give you an account (said she) of the matter you intrusted me withall. I have enquired after the Princesse which you seeke with so much passion, and perceiving that my Governesse made some difficulty to speake to me. I did often times by embraces woe her to tell me if she had heard any thing spoken of Xaira. Whilest I sollicited her with so much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse, she used such actions as made me beleeve she went about to discover some great secrets to me; for on the suddaine, she changed countenance, and so great a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling seized her, that she was a long time before she could answere me. At last she recollected her selfe, and swore to me that she had never seene the Princesse X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ira. But as if she beleeved that her oathes were not sufficient to make me credit it, she accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them with so many sighes and teares and other signes of affliction, that but for you, I should have repented the asking her the question. Yet Zelmatida let not this make you despaire; you are assured even by the mouth of a Prophet that Xaira is living, you are expresly come into this country to free her from prison, you are he who infallibly must give her liberty; let time then agitate and the superiour causes, and thinke not that the wills of the gods eyther advance themselves or recoyle as it pleaseth the fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticallnesse of our vowes. The king perswaded by Isatidaes reasons, admired the power
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54727:33"/>
of her wit, and became daily so idolatrous of it, that it is not a small signe of his excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent nature, that in so generall forgetfulnesse of himselfe, he constantly remembred how much he was oblieged to Quasmez. Some fewe dayes after this conversation which had caused Hismalita to lose the rest of her complying, or rather of her dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, she received two generall intelligences equally sad and deplorable, which made her betake her selfe to other thoughts then how to be avenged of my deare Master; The posts that came in hourely, reported news that Montezumas was eyther killed or at least taken prisoner in the towne of Tevich, and that the Cacique Coatelicamat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with those of Zusolia and of Tlamacolapan and many other Provinces, were comming with an army of two hundred thousand combatants to besiege Mexico.</p>
                  <p>This unexpected insurrection, for which they were unprepared because it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dreaded, joyned with the death or prison of Montezuma spread such a feare in all the spirits of the Court, that Hismalita giving way to this first fright was at the point to abandon Mexico and to retire her selfe to Vacipale. In this extreamity they were forced to have recouse to Zelmatida whom the Mexicans called the eye of Vitcilopuchtli, which is the God of providence, and the right arme of Tezcatlipuca which is the God of battailes. In effect they looked on him as a God, where the power of all the two thousand they adored was enclosed; and when he went through the streets, men by Troopes followed him; and Mothers shewing him to their children, threw into those innocent soules the seeds of adoration and love. Hismalita who by a weaknesse very ordinary in the most part of Princes, put off her passions according as was councelled, and had not love nor hatred but what her Ministers inspired withall her insensible na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, put off to another time all that her hatred had intended, and fitted herselfe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Zelmatida by faire apearances. You might have seene her then instantly altered, and from fierce and insupportible as she had alwaies been to him, she becam eso com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and submisse, that my Lord the Inca hath since confessed to me that he pittied so shamefull a weakenesse, at the first councell she held, after the newes of the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment of the King her husband and the inroades of her enemies, she sent for Zelmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and intreated him to be present. He obeyed her, to witnesse to Isatida, that in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever concerned her, he would neither finde backwardnesse nor difficulty. As soone as he was in the Councell Chamber, and that he saw Hismalita attended on by so many men of state, he made shew by his action that he was ready to execute all that they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to command him. Hismalita called him forward gave him an honourable place, was a long time in commending his valour, and rendred him new thanks for his services done to Mexico. Then she enlarged herselfe on the hopes they all had of him; and speaking of his age with admiration, told him that Tescatlipuca had not endowed him with such rare qualities to have them as it were concealed in vulgar occasions. That he was infallibly destinated for great executions; and though he were very young they were obliged to beleeve that he had no lesse wisedome then courage: And that she therefore conjured him, in case that Mexico were beleagured, to command those war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers which she should chuse for her defence, and to make appeare in the publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, the same valour which he had shewed in that of some particulars. That in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence she promised him not only in her owne name but in that of Montezuma and his successors, all the share that he would desire in their fortunes. Zelmatida retaining till this occasion that wisdome which seemed to be borne with him, answered the Queen that the honour to serve her was an advantage for whose acquisition there was nought which a man of heart should not undertake. That he would accept it with an extreame contentment, but that he humbly besought her to dispence with him for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she would use him, since he had neither experience nor other partes which were necessary for so great a charge. All the Assembly was much satisfied with the modesty of this answer, and thought it fit to resolve of nothing that day, but that they should meet againe the next morrow to conclude all things. The next day then, was the great Councell held. Hismalita and the old Princesse which could not follow Montezuma were present, and after divers contestations, the Queen not only partaged the affaires of the warre, and the leading of the Troopes, amongst six of the most experienced Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54727:34"/>
that were about her; but also (for all the resistance my deare Master could make) shed eclared him Generall as well within as without the Towne. When he saw there was no apearance of gainesaying what was resolved; I'le obey (said he to Hismalita) since tis your pleasure, but on condition, that I undertake nothing till I have consulted with those that are more experienced and wiser then my selfe. The old Mexican Princes, that were naturally proud and by the merit of their actions, found themselves much pleased with the Kings Declaration, and assured Hismalita, that she might rest herselfe in quiet, and contemne the descent of a small number of seditious persons: His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malita was easily perswaded; and after she had received Zelmatida's oath went out of the Councell with him, and to establish him in his command, made him to be carried through all the City, with the same magnificence, they were wont to carry their Kings on the daies of their triumphes. This necessary and troublesome ceremony being done, my Lord the Inca shut himselfe in private withall those of command under his charge. Presently he got made the description of all the Kingdome of Montezuma and the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of Mexico. Then he desired to know the places already possessed by the Rebells, and those they were to come by. When they had made kno wne to him all this, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed himself of the number of Souldiers, of the quantity of ammunition and of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the Towne. He put off till the morrow the mustring of his men of warre, gave command to one of his Livetenants to visit all the publique Magazins, and to send to all particular houses to see what provisions they had. Hismalita the while, and the same day, went about to see the defects and the advantages of Mexico; and from that morning set them on worke every where with so much diligence, that he made the Towne capable to sustaine a siedge of two yeeres. During all these great businesse, he forgot nothing of that which a perfect Lover owes to her he affecteth. He saw Isatida punctually twice in a day, and saw her with so much the lesse nicety, because he feared not Hismalita's Eunuques. The kinde wellcomes he received from the Princesse and the teares with which she confirmed her innocent and true affection, gave him a courage able to have conqueted the whole world. There is no doubt (said he) but that the gods take pleasure to heare the vowes which are just. I have often praied them for some oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to expose my life for your service, and to deserve some way a commendation from your mouth: They have heard my prayers; and the rebellion of your Subjects, in not so much a signe of their hatred to you, as it is to me a proofe of that love Heaven beares me, Tis in your mame Isatida that I undertake an employment far above my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. But all shall be possible whilst I have your protection and assistance. Confirme there the honour which the Queene your Mother hath done me, and be good enough to perswade your selfe that I will acquit my selfe worthily of the charge that is imposed upon me. If you beleeve thus much you will oblige me to lose that ill opinion I have of my selfe, and by that happy deceipt, you will make me like those who transported by the force of their imagination, have alone gotten battells, and made their way through ruine it selfe. Whilst Zelmatida spoke thus affectionately, Isatida looked on him her eyes halfe shut, and unable to answer, she being so neere touched, stood, as one that was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther halfe awake nor well asleepe. At last she came to her selfe, and seeing my deare Master at her feet, conjured him to have more reason then her selfe. After these few words she held her peace, and was yet sometime silent. But when she could speake indeed, she made it well appeare by her discourse, that the truest love is accompanied with feare, She imagined difficulties which could not betide her otherwise then by the apprehension of those dangers to which she saw her lover exposed. After that love had expressed all that hath, of tendernesse, feare and disquiet; Reason became Mistris, and shewed Isatida how far her councells and feares were unjust: She condescended to these remonstrances, and was constrained by her good disposition not only to consent to what the King desired of her, but oftentimes to entreate him to forget what was passed, and to be yet once more the Defender of the empire of Montezuma. Zelmatida that knew very well how to husband with a great deale of discretion, the wit and favour of Isatida, and who, for her sake feared so much, that most commonly he avaided the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of entertaining her and beleeved that he ought no more to wrong her facility. He therefore retired, and twas well he did so, for he was no sooner in his lodging, but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54727:34"/>
Hismalita sent for him. He went to the Pallace, and understood that the Quene was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into her Cabinet with the chiefe of her Councell. There was order left for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and that was the cause he attended not at the doore. As soone as Hismalita saw him, she arose to receive him, and seating him in a chaire next below her owne: Tis fit (said she) that we make you a partner of the ill newes which are newly brought me, and that by the Picture which the King my Lord hath sent me, you should know the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate into which his great heart and unfaithfull fortune have precipitated him. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the gods, he is not dead as I feared, but the perfidious Tyrant of Thevic detaines him prisoner, and so unworthily useth him, that as I understand by his posts, he wisheth himselfe a thousand times in a day in the stately Tombe that he hath caused to be built for the glory of those Monarques from whom he is descended. His cruell enemy threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens him continually with death, and to make it more full of griefe and infamous, he thinks to bring him to the spacious towne place of Mexico, and to execute him in the sight of his wife and children. But wretched and unfortunate Hismalita! thine eyes shall never behold this horrible spectacle, or thine armes shall not be strong enough to pluck thee from so sad a destiny.</p>
                  <p>After a showre of teares shed by the Queene in ending this complaint, abode a while in silence and her eyes shut, at last she opened them, and extending her hands to Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida; deare stranger (said she) or rather some visible god that art descended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the safety of Mexico, be favorable to my just prayers, hearken to those of all my Subjects, looke on the fetters and bondage of Montezuma! and suffer not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Coatelicamat (confidering his powerfull offences) to have cause to confirme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his abhominable intentions. Goe on with your weapons drawne, to meete this Monster, make him to feele the weight of that arme under which the mighty Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Popocampecho fell, and by the like stroake avenge a wife unjustly persecuted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge those children whose innocence would make the most barbarous to relent, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge millions of Soules which are guiltlefly tormented, and avenge the gods in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging your selfe; Zelmatida blushing at the flattery and impiety of the Queene, was twice or thrice about to answere, but judging it a crime to contest with them, he tooke another Subject to talke to her, and comforted her for the imprisonment of Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, in promising to expose his life for his delivery. I accept of all your offers (replyed Hismalita) and feele from them I know not what hope that seemes to assure me of the returne of my prosperities. But bethinke you as well of your owne conservation as of ours; beleeve lesse to your courage then judgement; execute not that by your selfe, which your Souldiers may performe, and lose not us by your too much hazarding your selfe. There is no danger to be run (answered Zelmatida) when a good cause is defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and that Justice goes along with our armes. The disloyall Coatelicamat shall feele that remorse and those terrors wherewith traytors are tortured, and his unfortunate end shall be an eternall and most fearfull warning to all Rebells, to keepe those Lawes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable which the gods have ordayned them. This discourse ended Zelmatida and some of the Mexican Princes went forth from the Queene, and resolved that instantly they should advance to meete the rebells. The two or three next dayes were imployed in the viewing and mustering of the Troopes, and the king found that he had above a hundred thousand men. Of those he left part for the guard of the City, and as soone as he had taken leave of Isatida, marched out of Mexico, with all the presages that might assure him of the victory.</p>
                  <p>After he had put his Army in batalia beyond the lake, he tooke the way of Culhua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, which is foure miles from Mexico, and sent forerunners to learne newes of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and knew at their returne, that the Rebells marched as men that knew how to make warre, and that on the hearing that they were come out of Mexico, their vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards had entrenched themselves in a village, whence it was very hard to force them. Zelmatida, very glad of this news, kept on his way, and made his men march day and night. Some Thevician Couriers came to meete him, and began light skirmishes. The Inca caused them to be undertaken, to the end to advance his troopes the most he could when he came to certaine Hillocks which covered the bourg, he encamped, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to lodge there all night. At day breake he resolved to force the enemy, and therfoe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54727:35"/>
chose out of his Army ten thousand of his best men, and of them composed five batali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he led himselfe, where he intended they should fight, and after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven such order every where, that it was hard if the onset thrived not, he made all to fall on at the same time. Those which were led by Zelmatida, willing to make appeare their deserts, mastered the intrenchment, forced the barricadoes, and though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselves very well within the Bourg, yet at last they became Masters of it. They flew all that had not time or cowardise enough to save themselves by flight. This first exploit, succeeding so happily; Zelmatida, thought it fit to pursue the enemy. All his Troopes were resolute on it, when there came news from Hismalita, by which my deare Master understood that the Cacique of Zempoallan was within a little journey of Mexico, with above thirty thousand men: Hereupon he assembled the Councell of war, to know what was expedient to be done. There were divers opinions, but upon the intelligence received that the Cacique of Thevic, and five other Princes were but a daies journey thence, and came with above foure hundred thousand combatants, they made Zelmatida resolve to retire, and to goe and oppose that inundation which came by the way of Zempoallan. The next day, at day breake the army dislodged from the bourg, except foure thousand men, which Zelmatida left there to amuse the Enemy. But the Mexicans, who for the most part are heartlesse, and who fight not but when they are assured by their great number; no sooner saw the Theviciens but they forsooke the bourg, and came to seeke their safety in the grosse of the Army. By this Zelmatida un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the defect of his troopes; and changing his first Councell, intended to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing that should be difficult with a people that obeyed not very well, and fought a great deale worse. Well then imagine him encamped on the side of the lake, in a great plaine, that on the North hath the towne of Culhuacan, on the South, that of Iz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacpalam, on the East that of Mexico, and on the West that of Tlacopan. Having lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Army in places so advantageous, and made good all eminenties that might annoy his enemies, he came to Hismalita, and stayed not longer then he was enforced to take new commands, and consult of a meanes to hinder the joyning of the troopes of Zem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poallan with those of Thevic. This done he visited Isatida, and seeing her in an afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that could not be augmented: Madam (said he) I intend not to condemn your sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, since that nature and reason it selfe cannot give you more just ones. But if the desire to serve you deceive me not, and did not make me hope for more then I ought, assure your selfe that you shall yet see the King your father on his Throne, and all those enemies that from all parts come to pillage this brave City, shall be soone sacrificed to those teares which their perfidiousnesse hath caused to fall from you. Isatida could not answere my deare Master, but speaking to him with her eyes, which all dying as they were, were yet capable to revive him; she made him know that the imprisonment of the King, nor the debordment of their enemies was not solely the cause of her affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>Zelmatida was constrained to leave her sooner then he intended, and to get him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to his Army, which aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ighted at the comming of the Theviciens, would have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the field and retyred into Mexico. But the Princes arrivall confirmed and retain'd them in some order. Presently he went to descry the enemy, and unwilling to give them time to lodge presented them battell. This boldnesse did not alone astonish the Theviciens but withall gave a terror to the Mexicans. But the last tooke heart by the beliefe they had that Zelmatida was a god to whom nothing was impossible, and the worst Souldier amongst them, animated by the Prince his presence, made himselfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that he was become extreamly valiant. When the Inca perceived all that multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude prepared to fight, he would needs hearten them to it, and an oration fitted to the humour and spirit of all that were there, perswaded them that there were no forces able to resist them. The Cacique of Thevic, carried away by the unruly notions which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ge to reigne gives the amoitious, made his Army march to meete with that of Mexico. As soone as they were in that case, that they could not goe off, but must fall to handy blowes; Zelmatida made his first troopes give on, but they found such a resistance, that they began to give back, when he sent others to assist them. Wheresoever Zelmatida appeared, the Theviciens were defeated, but every where else they were masters, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54727:35"/>
knew so well how to presse the Mexicans, that without the conduct and valour of Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida they had beene all cut in peeces. He endured the shock of three or foure thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, slew the Cacique of Themocolapan, and made so glorious a retreate, that in the judgement of the very enemy, it went for a victory. See in what manner the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viciens remained masters of the field, and block'd up Mexico by Land and Water. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day the king made sallies, wherein his prudence and valour going hand in hand crowned him with the more glorious palmes, by how much he had the worst Souldiers, and fought with the best and in great number. Hismalita was not in a little trouble to see the cowardize of her Souldiers, and knew not what way to witnesse how much she was oblieged to Zelmatida; but being dextrous and crafty, she thought she could not more powerfully winne my deare Master then by giving him the meanes to see and entertaine Isatida. This conjecture being confirmed by her confidents, she notedly increased her former affection to the Princesse, and tooke more care then ordinary to discourse and to have her in her company. She even some time made her to be dressed before her, and desiring that she should be alwaies richly attyred, caused to be made for her both roabes and dressings of such value and so artificially wrought, that the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if they did not therein contest for the prize, yet did they for their well suting with the Dyamonds and Pearles. Zelmatida enjoyed all these felicities; and knowing Hismalitaes intention, bethought him to make the Seige last long, that his good fortune might be the longer lasting. He forgot not for all that any thing that could give him the name of a great Captaine, and not hazarding but when 'twas, to good purpose neyther himself nor his troopes, wearying the enemy, and made them repent of their enterprize. He from time to time also proposed to Hismalita divers waies of finishing the seige, and advised her to joyne the Inhabitants of Mexico with the men of warre, to force the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy and make him resolve on a battell. But the Queene that would not hazard any thing before she had heard news of Montezuma, conjur'd him to suspend this good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, and attend the succours which would infallibly be sent her from those Provinces which were not revolted. The King easily consented to it, and blessing in himselfe the blindnesse of Hismalita, was ravished to see that his fearefull Enemy, seemed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the occasions that might please him. Now, one day being with her, there came one to signifie to him, that there was at the Gate a man sent from the Cacique of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vic that desired to speake with him. Zelmatida, that would not in the presence of the Queene make use of his authority of Generall, intreated her permission for the entrance of the Thevicien. Hismalita, who in this novelty imagined to her selfe some overture of peace, was willing to see him. Zelmatida therefore sent two of his guard to receive him, and to conduct him to the Pallace. Streight after he came and was presented to the Queene.</p>
                  <p>As soone as he had made his entry, with incivility enough, he demanded leave to deliver his charge, and that he might see him who commanded the men of warre. His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malita shewing him my deare Master; See (said she) the Man you seeke. At that word Isatida changed colour, and if all the company had not beene attentive to the Herald, no doubt at that time the change of her countenance had discovered the secret of her heart. This while Zelmatida came neere the man, and told him that he might speake boldly, since the Queene did him the honour to thinke it fit; the other told him he was sent by Accapouzalco, Cacique of the rich City Xochmilco, and Soveraigne of the mynes of gold, and of the lake of delights, to defie ten of the most valiant men that were among the Mexicans. The king tooke pleasure in the boldnesse of this Barbarian; and how many (said he) will this invincible man have with him? My Prince (replyed the Souldier) makes too little esteeme of men, to make any account of their assistance; he alwaies fights alone, and alone carries the victory. He will have no more seconds in this little occasion then he hath had in the greatest; and conjures thee, if thou be as brave a man as thou art reputed, that thou wilt make one, and choose to thy selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thy friends ten, nay twenty which are worthy to assist thee in this combat. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida began to laugh at this proposition, and was a long while ere he could get the Queenes good will to accept of the challenge; at last he had it, and sent back the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld with an assurance that the next day he would be without the towne with his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54727:36"/>
friends, to give his Master a little exercise. Imagine into what trouble and perplexity those words out Isatida, and what disquiets she underwent all the rest of the day. As long as she was with the Queen, she was in those anxieties and constraints as are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable. she looked on Zelmatida with eyes that witnessed at once both her anger and feare.</p>
                  <p>The close of the day was the end of that torture; she withdrew into her owne lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings as soone as she was permitted, and began to figh at liberty. Oftentimes she accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed my deare Master that he loved her not, since he feared not to displease her, and sought without her permission occasions to lose himselfe. He left her not long in this ill humour, but came to her as soone as he had left Hismalita. When he saw how coldly she intertained him, and by a serious aspect intimated how much she was displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; he came neere her with a great deale of submission, and witnessing his feare to her; shall I (said he) be enough unhappy to have brought you to doubt of my respect or my faith? I confesse I have somewhat enlarged my selfe beyond the boundes of my servitude, but Isatida what language would you have used to your slave, and with what face durst he to have presented himselfe before you, if he had refused so faire an occasion to serve you. The Princesse that could not be angry with a person in whom she discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red dayly more signes of love, respect and generosity; I will not (said she) treate you so rudely as your disobedience deserves; and I forget (for this time) the boldnesse that you have taken to dispose of your selfe without my consent, and am not angry that you have met with so faire a Subject to make you yet so considerable. But I permit you not this combate but on condition that you undertake it with ten of your friends; and more, if my prayers be heard, that is, if you returne victorious, I command you upon paine to run the hazard of my indignation, not to engage your selfe ever in any dangerous enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise till you have advertised me of it, that I may see whether I ought to permit you to put in execution. Zelmatida (answered) that since he had the honour to see and to tender her his service and liberty: He had relinquished and put off all power on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and reserved only that which was to serve her eternally. Be pleased then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I will never undertake any thing without your permission. Nor had I accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the defiance of Accapovealco, if on the suddaine when I cast mine eyes on yours, I had not knowne that you gave me your consent, and that your all-generous soule gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me secretly a favour, which was not permitted to be asked you. But Isatida, give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver these troublous objects, and reflect on my new felicities. Doe you not admire the goodnesse of Hismalita, and the affection that she shews me even in those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I still thought to have found her my enemy? The Princesse made well knowne by her answer that she was not accorded with my deare Master, and a little casting down her eyes; Zelmatida (said she) you have your weakenesse as well as other men. You beleeve with too much facility those things which you desire with so much passion. The favours which you receive are too great not to be suspected. I know Hismalita, and finde that she hath done too much to perswade my selfe that she will follow her now inclination. Feare may be hinders me from judging aright, and tis possible I may wrong the best Princesse of the world; but you Zelmatida are the cause of it; see then if I have not subject enough to hate you, since that for your sake, I live not as I ought, &amp; that by little and little I become unnaturall to make me seeme good. Our Lovers spent most part of the night in this conversation. Isatida in dismissing Zelmatida told him that he ought to leave to him that doth all with justice the ordering of things to come, and to expect from his goodnesse such events as should be worthy him. In the meane while he should retire to take that rest whereto the combate he was to undertake the next day obliged him, and that he might assure himselfe that either her prayers should not be heard, or else be very advantageous to him. Zelmatida that used to obey the Princesse without long consideration or delay, gave her the good night, and so went to his bed. By day breake he was up, and had already walked above two houres in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den into which opened the windowes of Isatida's chamber, when one of the principall Officers belonging to Hismalita came and told him that the Queen desired his presence. He went to her, and she found him with the same assured conntenance that she had seen he daies before; and admiting in her selfe the great heart of the Prince, grew angry
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54727:36"/>
with her selfe to have as many causes to hate him as she had to love him; she had a minde to entertaine him, but that one came and related that the Gyant had been twice already even at the gates of the towne. This news was the cause that joy and sadnesse dividing mens mindes, represented to some Zelmatida victorious over the Gyant, and to others the Gyant triumphing over Zelmatida. But he that thought on nothing but of doing acts worthy his love, left the Queene, and comming into the chamber of Isati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, found her all in teares. He besought her to ratifie the permission which she had given him, and not beleeve his enemy to be invincible. I know (said she) why you use this language to me: No, no, I doe not thinke the Gyant invincible, yet have I not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, a thousand reasons to be afflicted. The perill to which you are going to expose your selfe, would obliege me to it (I say) were you a person but indifferent to me; since for my sake only you are engaged in this combat, and by consequence in spite of my selfe become guilty of your death, if it happen that the chance of warre give the advantage to your Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Indeede knowing your courage, and having heard related so many marvels of it, I should have cause not to apprehend the event of this duell if all things were equall. But when I consider that you goe to contend with a Monster, as tall againe as your selfe, I cannot receive those reasons that perswade me that I doe you wrong to have you feare him. My Lord the Inca, by these words felt himselfe bound in new chaines, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daring to take the boldnesse to aske from the Princesse the least favour in the world, told her that before night she should be oblieged to prayse him, alive or dead. Whilest Isatida betooke her selfe to her prayers with her Governesse and dwarfe, Zelmatida went to take his armes, and accompanied with one only Squire went out of Mexico, and came to the causey where the Gyant stayed for him. The walls of the City were ranged with men and women, to see by the successe of this combat what the fortune would be both generall and particular. The lake was covered with Canoas and other vessells full of Theviciens; and the place where Zelmatida was to fight, was a square expresly made on the great causeway, for a corps du guard, and in case of necessitie to serve for a place of defence, and to fight with those that after they had gotten the cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way would enter into the towne. Zelmatida appeared there, rather armed for the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph then for the combat. He wore a head peece covered with a great many feathers, which came on his shoulders and covered part of his face. His armes were halfe naked, and for all defensive armour had only a Cuirasse of quilted cotton, and a buckler of gold, on which to signifie the extremity of his love, he had caused to be painted the mountain Popocampecho, all on fire, and round about the buckler these words engraven: My heart preserves all his owne. He had a quiver full of arrowes, a bowe hanging as a scarfe, and two long Javelins, armed at the ends with golden pikes. For the Gyant he was more extravagantly covered, and more advantageously too. He had the whole skin of a very great Tyger; the muzell of the beast served him for his head-peece, and the rest, tyed in five or sixe places, was for a good Cuirasse. He wore a bowe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and a great club. As soone as he saw Zelmatida within shot of his arrowes, he shot two at him that had pierced him through and through, if he had not dextrously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided them. My deare Master in comming neerer, darted at him one of his Jave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ns, but it rested hanging in the skin of the beast that armed the Gyant, and could not wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d him. He knew then that fighting after this manner, he should not make an end of his enemy; he therefore came close up, and passing upon him, thrust the halfe of his Jave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin into his right thighe, and by that would tooke away his strength of upholding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The Gyant retyred to be reveng'd, and to brayne his adversary with one only blowe; but his rage taking away his judgement, and my deare Master returning upon him, ran him through the second time. The paine of this new wound, made the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster foame; and he threw himselfe on Zelmatida to have stifled him in his armes, and cast out his left hand to have catched him by the hayre, but the Inca avoiding his hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierced his arme, and left the Javelyn in the wound. This great wound made the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant mad: he threw his club away, and uncovering all his body, cast himselfe on his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Zelmatida seeing so faire an occasion, tooke his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>owe and let fly an arrow, which passing under the Gyants left arme (which was then lifted up) stroake him right at the heart.</p>

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54727:37"/>
With this the Monster gave a great cry, and catching his vanquisher in his armes, bore him to ground with him; he fell on one side, and Zelmatida on the other, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, that meeting the head of an arrowe he gave himselfe a deepe wound: the Gyant died presently, and by his death strooke so strange a terror into the hearts both of the Thevic's and Zempoallan's Army, that had the Mexicans beene men of valour, there is no doubt but that very day they had given end to a Seige which began to make them practise by force that sobrietie which is naturall to them. As soone as they had stynched the blood that Zelmatida lost by his wounds, he returned into Mexico, with all the pompe that so great an action could be attended. He was not only admired of Hismali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta and of all the Court, but his enemies themselves were forced to acknowledge that whilest he defended Mexico they had little hope of taking it. In the City they spoake more advantageously. The people blessed the day in which that valiant defender came thither, and from the defeate of one sole enemy, promising to themselves the like of three or foure hundred thousand more; foolishly called on to the fight those whom they durst not see, but from the top of their walls. As soone as Hismalita heard the successe of the combat, she made shew of an excesse of joy, which makes me say, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable power of the virtue of my Master, overcame the ill nature of that Queene, and made her capeable of a good action. That which makes me thinke so, is, that he was received with an extraordinary freedome, and that all the evening she spoake of nothing but his victory, but cry up often times in exaggerating the generositie with which Zelmatida would overcome his Enemy. Let us leave here (if you please) the vulgar resentments, and entertaine our selves a little with those of Isatida. Though the Queene her mother knew she was not well, yet had she not the patience to have her absent, but sent an absolute command that she should dresse her; that nothing of sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse might be intermingled with the publique rejoycing. Isatida came where she was expected, but at her entry they might perceive in her lookes such a kinde of coldnesse, that she had beene generally condemned if the pretext of her sicknesse had not repressed the indiscreete zeale and reproaches of all the people. She never cast an eye on her victorious servant, and by that entertainment so little expected, taught him a faire les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that humility of minde, wherewith we should receive those disgraces that betide us, then, when we thinke we have least deserved them. He was much troubled at it, and detesting all the honors they did him, put this day into the number of the most unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in his life</p>
                  <p>Presently he called to minde all that he had done, nay all that he had thought on since he left the Princesse. And seeing that the witnesses of his Conscience set his minde at rest, he tooke this indifferency of Isatida as a remedy which she had found to allay that vanity which possibly so many happy fortunes joyned together might have caused in him. As soone as Hismalita was retyred, Isatida that tooke notice of her servants dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, sent him word by Galtazis, that she desired his company to her chamber, that she might know from him that which her indisposition had not suffered her to behold. Zelmatidaes heart leapt at this welcome command, and was so transported with it, that his wound opened, and notwithstanding all that they could apply to it, bled such a great quantity of blood, that the Princesse tooke notice of it, and grew as pale and feeble as if her owne blood had run from the wound of my deare Master. He came neer her, and taking her by the arme to assist her; You see (said he) how my heart it selfe gives you a testimony of its fidelity. It hath alwaies feared, that my words were by you suspected, and that you doubted of the assurances which my mouth for its part gave you. It knowes that it is an interpreter artificiall and cryed downe, and that all ages have attainted it of treason and flashood. It is long since too, that it hath stroven by all meanes to make it selfe knowne to you. At last Fortune is come to his ayde, and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating things which seemed impossible, hath given it that which it could not obtayne from nature. 'Tis (faire Isatida) that it speakes by my wound, and the drops of blood that fall thence, are so many words by which it makes knowne to you its infinite love; and protests that my mouth hath said nothing to you till my heart had given it a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse commandement. Isatida, comming to her selfe, whilest my deare Master spoake to her thus passionately, could no longer hold that little anger, which she had resolved
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54727:37"/>
he should undergoe. I must confesse (said he) that you have a great power over our m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>des; surely, we sh ould not thinke it strange that you overcome Giants, since you shew your selfe of suffi ci ency to vanquish that which is naturally invincible. Triumph then (Zelmatida) since you deserve it, triumph over my choler, as well as of the second Popocampecho. But be not like those unfortunate Conquerors that have found their grave in their triumphant Chariot. Goe, thinke on your woundes, and when you are in case to be seene, I will tell you the cause of my anger: In the meane time I command you to feare it no more; it is now as unable to hurt you as the Giant you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. My deare Master would needs perswade Isatida that his wounde was nothing, not considerable; But as soone as the Princesse opened her lips to repeate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment she had given him, he obeyed according as was accustomed; and that sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was an ill farre more sensible then that he had received in his combate. After his being in his Chamber, they closed his wounde, and though indeed it was but little, yet for all that it incommodated him extreamely. The next morning he came forth, and had almost the whole daies liberty to see Isatida. He besought her a thousand times to tell him the cause of her anger. You beleeve (said the Princesse to him) that I have no cause to complaine; But know that I have subject enough, since against my command and your promise, you have not feared to hazard that which is mine, and to fight alone against a Monster, who thought himselfe strong enough to defeate a whole Army.</p>
                  <p>My deare Master seeing the pleasing indignation of the Princesse, shall I beleeve (said he) that any thought of me could at any time possesse a minde so much divine as yours? Certainely though hitherto I have found goodnesses in you which are no where else seene: Yet did I not imagine them so infinite that they could extend to the care of my preservation. But I know whence this tendernesse comes. You looke on me as the worke of your owne hands, and would retard my losse, since you beleeve that your power would suffer some diminution, if you should suffer to perish the least thing that is if it bore any marke of yours. This nimblenesse of wit (answered Isatida) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you put off any thing that might hurt you, hinders not me yet from being offended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that I beleeve not, but you esteeme litle of my friendship since you make no more difficulty to put me into a perplexity. I know what you can say to justifie your action, and will not give so much to my fancy, but I will give more to your considerations. Therefore I forget what is past and looke no more on your last actions, but on that side where they are to you most glorious and honorable; But if ever it happen that you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my intreaties, and doe not tie your selfe scrupulou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of their Commanders, fled confusedly even to the Frontires of Zempoallan. The Caci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que of Thevic failed not the next day to make shew of more then foure thousand boates on the Lake, in the least of which there were foure men, and with them encompassing two third parts of the Towne, caused a generall affault to be given.

                  <p>Doe me the honour to beleeve (said he) that the Cacique of Thevic will not trench on the life of Montezuma, and chiefely in a time when the ill successe of his affaires threatens him with an approching ruin. If he be wise, he will not be obstinate in a siedge so disadvantageous to him, and if he be so imprudent to continue it, we shall soone bring him to repent it, so that by one way or other it will behove him to looke to the safety of the King your Father, that it may be a meanes to preserve himselfe; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing to the King his liberty, by that way may buy both his owne and his peoples free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Isatida, whose love made her easie to be perswaded, beleeved firmely all which Zelmatida told her, and doubted not, but that by his assistance Montezuma might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the hands of his enemy. Zelmatida perceiving that the Princesse gave eare to his reasons, and was willing to be comforted, told her, that among so many unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as were in the world, he was the man alone that every day saw his hopes to grow lesse and lesse, and that labouring for the safety of another, laboured at the same time for his owne perdition. I must no more doubt (said he) but that my happinesse shall be of no longer continuance then the captivity of Montezuma. His reestablishing shall be my ruine, and the same moment that settles him againe in his Throne shall drive me far off for ever from the happy place where all my felicities are enclosed. Take no heede (said she) of common mishaps, and since tis beneficiall to us to beguile our selves, let us not be more cleere fighted then we have beene hitherto. For the rest, call to minde that in delivering Montezuma and protecting Hismalita you fight for Isatida. If what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide from her be capable to worke on you, assure your selfe, that your paines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell shall have their reward. These Lovers had continued this pleasing discourse, but that one came to advertise Zelmatida that two Heralds sent by the enemies desired per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to see him. He came presently forth and going into the Temple of the god of battells, he there met Hismalita. He intimated to her the comming of two Theviciens, and besought her to heare them. They were streight brought in, and one of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting a great Role to Hismalita, told her that the Cacique his Soveraigne Lord sent her that Declaration written with the bloud of those that were slaine before Mexico. The Queene who for divers considerations wished for nothing but peace, caused the writing to be unfolded, and commanded one of her Officers to read it. The man having a perfect knowledge and well versed in the Charecters of Thevic, deciphered them thus.</p>

                  <p>GReat injuries exciting great resentments are not satisfied but with extraordinary re venges. The Theviciens and as many other Nations as I lead, oppressed by such as call themselves their Fathers and Defenders have beene constrained to take armes, for their common deliverance and have not feared their owne losse, so they might crush by their proper downfall the cruell authors of their calamities. Heaven hath at this time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared it selfe in a cause so just, and the ambitious Montezuma is fallen into that servitude which he prepared for so many free Nations. I hold in my chaines this prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the change of Fortune: I make him feele how insupportable that disaster is to serve his enemy, and to be brought to the necessity of undergoing the rigours of a mercilesse Master. But the weight of his fetters, the horror of his dungeon, and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miseries, are but the beginning of his tortures. I reserve others for him after I have burnt this proud City, the retreat of Monsters that devoure the flesh, and drinke the blood of the poore. In the meane while, since by thy valour, O too much blinded stranger! the punishment of the Mexicans crimes is yet procrastinated, and that I must content my selfe with a part of my vengeance; know, that even to morrow, all the prisoners of most importance, which I have taken with Montezuma, shall be sacrificed to the god of Justice and Liberty, to take them off from the race of men.</p>
                  <p>Hismalita arose from her seate, and transported with choler, snatched the Roll out of the hands of him that read; she gave it to Zelmatida, and withall, what (said she) will your great courage suffer the royall dignity to be thus troden under foote, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that seditious persons and traytors dare, unpunished, violate the eternall Lawes by which the gods have established their owne power, in confirming that of Mona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She had scarce ended these words, but she heard a muttering of voices, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the resounding of trumpets, and presently saw on the scaffold the wretched Montezuma, who clad in his royall habiliments, had his chaines on his legs and hands, and witnessed by his trembling and lamentations, that he was never worthy of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which he was now about to lose. At this sight Hismalita growing furious, tore her hayre, plucked in peeces the Diadem she had on her head, and was with much adoe held by the Princes that were about her. What ye Mexicans (cryed she) will you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that the hangman shall lay his abhominable hands on the sacred person of your King, of your visible god? What is become of that faith you swore to him on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, and in the presence of the gods? Doe you no more remember that you have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him for your Master, for your Father, for your Life? and at his coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; all falling on the Earth, offered your selves as Sacrifices ready to shed your blood for his preservation? She would have continued her remonstrances, but a new object of griefe, depriving her of understanding as well as speech, put her some time from her selfe; she came againe with being much troubled, and came againe to her more sorrow and anguish; for she sawe foure Priests take Montezuma, and despoyling him of his robes, bound his eyes and layed him along on the same table, where the other prisoners had lost their lives. The excesse of her resentment rendring her speech, Hangman (cry'd she) strike not the King, see mee here ready to receive the blowe, come, come, glut your rage upon the unfortunate Hismalita, and in so saying, she fell as dead among the armes of her women; and fortune would have it so, to the end that that Princesse by the violence of her afflictions should learne to be no more insensible of the misery of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. She was no sooner swounded but the boates of Mexico fell on those of the Thevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens, and during their fight, one man alone forcing his way, in spite of so many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ascended the scaffold where Montezuma was ready to be executed; threw five or sixe of the Priests into the lake, overturned the Altar and the Idoll, and unbinding the King of Mexico, changed his scaffold into a theater of tryumph. The Mexicans seeing so glorious a beginning of the enterprise of my Lord the Inca (you may well thinke that any other then he, could not have performed so difficult an action) rushed in on their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and fearing no more death, fell on them so vigorously that above a thousand boates, and more then sixe thousand Theviciens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The enemies woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and fettered which they drew along the streetes, were sufficient proofes of those victories which she might doubt of; yet imagining that her happinesse was too great to be true, she could not beleeve it till she sawe Zelmatida; who, leading Montezuma by the hand, came to restore to her that other precious halfe of her selfe, and bring againe all those prosperities and glories she had lost. As soone as she had resettled Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma in his throne, and left him with his Queene and daughters, he departed without saying any thing, and causing the trumpets and other instruments of warre to sound eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, drew out of the towne all those that were of age sufficient to fight. He made them to be fylde along the causseyes with an extreeme diligence, and put them into batalia in the sight of the enemies. The Cacique of Thevic knew the designe of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seiged, and in spite of the terror that the name of Zelmatida gave him, prepared himselfe to fight, and did all that could be expected from a man that was as valiant as he was ambitious.

At last the grosse of the Army moved, the battalions joyned, and their arrowes gave

place to more mortall weapons; I will not make you a particular description of the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, nor anoy you in remarking what the Mexicans performed. Let us fixe (if you please) on Zelmatida, since 'tis his victory that you would knowe, and not that of his enemies. This Prince then searching out the ambitious Cacique of Thevic among his troopes, was compelled in finding him to come to handy stroakes with many hardy Theviciens, whom he overcame not without much hazarding himselfe. At last, being already all bloody, and weary with so many brunts already sustained, he met with Coatelicamat, that was driving before him a whole batalion of Mexicans. he put himselfe betweene the Runawayes and the Cacique, and comming up to him, his pike in his hand. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cique (said he) this is the day that thou must undergoe the punishmens for thy disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie. The Cacique without being dismayed at the threatning, knew Zelmatida, or at least doubted that twas he. Contrary then to the custome of miscreants, his courage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by the remembrance of his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>imes, and the neerenesse of the perill, made him lose the feare of it. He came resolutely to Zelmatida, and Zeimatida received him with an intent not to spare him. The combat was long and furious, but it was reasonable that the justice of heaven should have his ordinary slowenesse to chastise so sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Zelmatida quickly clapt his foote on his bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, and ayming his Javelyn at the others throate, repent thee (said he) if thou wilt have me give thee thy life. Coatelicamat, with a constancy as great as his ambition; answered: I will never repent me, since I never doe any thing till it first seeme just to me. For the life that thou promisest me, I laugh at it, for I see it is not in thy power; but if thou wilt doe me any favour, tell me what thou art, and whence thou comest. Zelmatida swore to him that he could not content his curiositie, since he could not tell of what country he was, nor of what parents borne. At that word, Catelicamat lifting up with fury the arme that was left him, as if he would have striken some one; Impostors (cryed he) they are your eyes that have beene the authors of my crimes. You assured me that I should one day see my selfe seated on the throne of Montezuma, if I could escape the thundring arme of the Inca. In saying this last word, he plunged his hand into his wound, and by that violence tore out his Soule that would not yet have abandoned his body.</p>
                  <p>The death of Coatelicamat was the entyre ruine of all his army. The Mexicans had their wills of them, destroyed them cleerely. They pierced without resistance the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est batalions, and went on, beating those disordered troopes till late in the night; the flaughter was horrible, and of that prodigious number of men which came to the Seige of Mexico, there was not above fifteene or twenty thousand that saved themselves. Twelve thousand were taken alive and brought into the City to be sacrificed to the gods of the Estate. Zelmatida did his utmost to hinder so great a Massacre, but knowing that he had to doe with Barbarians, who place their pleasure and glory in spilling the blood of their adversaries, he left them and returned into Mexico with two thousand, that remayned of the sixe thousand men whom he had made the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The old men, the women, the children and the Souldiers, that were left behinde for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the towne, losing all memory of what they owed to Montezuma, received Zelmatida as their king, and called him the victorious, the father of the people, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of Mexico, and the only hope of the State. These glorious Titles were followed with offrings and inestimable presents. All that particular persons had gathered of gold, silver, pearles, costly habiliments and other excellent moveables, were throwne a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It was told him that Montezuma had sent for her, and that she should be that night with the Queene. What a friend had that fatall Messenger beene to Zelmatida, if he had given him his death when he brought him this unwelcom newes! My deare master had not suffered but one death, when since that unfortunate day, he is passible of all, and passible without seeing any end of them. He was not content with an answere to him so fatall, but enquired after the causes of that novelty, but learning nothing that could give him satisfaction, he retyr'd himselfe to his lodging, not to take any rest, but to increase his vexation by the agitations of his Soule. The day following so sad a night, was far more sorrowfull. My deare Master could not see the King nor the Queen, and that which afflicted him more, he could not possibly either know where the princesse Isatida was, nor to see any of her attendants. It was late night when Galtazis came to him from Hismalita, and signified, that her religion, and certaine vowes which she and her daughters had made during the imprisonment of Montezuma; oblieged them to a long retyrement, and she therefore besought him that he would not thinke it strange, and would not beleeve that without very great and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full causes, they would deprive themselves of the contentment of seeing him.

We will not resolve, nor you, nor my selfe, to keepe her during both our lives; and those others which we shall chuse as the most faithfull for this important deposit, may be (tis possible) the first that shall deliver the Maiden into the hands of our enemy.

Tis fit that the death of one single person should save the lives of a whole Nation; and that we secure our owne and our Empire, by cutting off those that are to deprive us of them! O never have so horrible a thought (replied Montezuma) it is expresly forbidden us to lay violent hands on the Virgin. She ought to be more pretious to us then our owne lives, and I have learnt from the very mouth of the great Mirzenia, that in the very same instant that this Innocent shall die, I shall meet the full period of my daies. Know then, what we must doe (answered Hismalita) let us send her to my Brother, and conjure him to keepe her for us as carefully as he doth the valiant Inca, which those of Quito put into our hands after the death of Guina Capa. We shall have cause to live at quiet when this misfortunate Protectresse shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I should be of your minde (replied Montezuma) if Mirzenia had spoken to me but of one stranger, but I take notice of two in his prediction; and when I shall beleeve that Alisma may passe for one of them, I must yet feare a second. And that second is no other then that invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible stranger, who may terme himselfe more then I, the absolute Master of my Empire. To put him to death, besides that it is expresly forbidden me, I cannot consent to it, since I have no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I am not (said Hismalita) swaied by these considerations unworthy of a royall soule, but I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the menaces of Mirzenia. Make me see, that that stranger cannot die without the losse of our selves, and I will make you soone knowe, that Kings ought not to have any consideration but for themselves, and as they are above all the services that can be rendred them, they are so too above all the conceptions that nature gives to common persons. May the gods this very day accomplish all their threates (said the King to her) rather then I consent to those mischievous Maximes! No, no, the stranger shall never perish by my will, nor shall the life that he hath given me be the cause of his death. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Galtazis after he had thus faithfully related the discourse between Montezuma and Hismalita, advised him to stand on his guard, and not to trust so much in the goodnesse of the husband, but that he should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies armed against the malice of the wife. My deare Master thinking lesse on his owne conservation then that of Isatida; but, Galtazis (said he) where is the faire Mistris? What doth she with Hismalita, is it impossible for me to see her? And should she be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Virgin mentioned in this impertinent prediction? To all this said the Dwarfe I can give you but little satisfaction. My faire Mistris is more strictly guarded then her Sisters, she lies with the Queene her Mother, and goes not out of her Chamber. She weepes, she sighes, she pities your misfortune more then her owne; and knowing

in what perplexity you are, she sends me to entreat you, either that you will goe out of Mexico, or secke not the meanes to see her. As for that which belongs to the prediction, I cannot tell you whether Isatida be the Virgin so necessary for the conservation of Montezuma; but I will tell you that I most passionately wish it, for if she be the Maiden, I feare not any more that terrible anger which I read in the eyes, and all the actions of Hismalita. For other things, prepare you selfe for the honours that Montezuma resolves to conferre on you, and faine so well that he may not perceive that you doe dissemble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will informe you to morrow, if I can, the councells which the night shall give to my faire Mistris.

At last reposing all his affaires in that providence which had never forsaken him; let us suffer Zelmatida (said he to himselfe) and prepare our selves for all the injustices that fortune is capable of: provided, that the hope to see Isatida again be not taken from us, we may vaunt our selfe sufficiently strong to overcome all things. These speeches and others the like intertaining him all night, he rose without taking the least rest. He was no sooner out of his bed, when five or six of those old Princes (who during the siedge of Mexico had beene witnesses of his noble actions) came to him, and said, that Montezuma had sent them to accompany him to the triumph that all Mexico did owe to his incomparable vaiour: Zelmatida, much surprised at so great a change, begun his discourse by very obliging demeanures, and continued it by as humble thanks which he besought the Princes to present to Montezuma. I know (said he) that all that which comes either from gods or Kings, ought to be received by men with as much amazement as glory; and tis a most proud humility, to reject their presents, under pretext that they doe not deserve them. The king yet I hope will have so much goodnesse, as not to constraine me to a thing which I refuse not because I am unwotthy of it, but I would refuse it, because my condition of a banished man, and the calamity of those that brought me into the world, permit me not to be fortunate. Those Princes used a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The weake King (if ever there were any) going from one extreamity to another, came himselfe to the lodging of my Lord the Inca, and after he had asked his pardon for his retirement, told him, that he had not kept himselfe alone two daies, but to the end that he might passe all the rest of his life in the others company. Your generousnesse which is not lesse knowne to me then to my Subjects (said he) assures me that you have already forgotten those faults that my necessity brought on, and that you will not impute them to neglect or ingratitude. Zelmatida unmindefull of Galtazis advice, thought that Montezuma spoke to him really and truely, and on that opinion finding himselfe to be extreamely obliged to his courtesie: My Lord (said he) I will beleeve, since you will have it so, that my services have not been altogether unprofitable to you. But to have me perswade my selfe that they are equivalent to the recompence which I receive by the honour you doe me, is to forget who I am, and in what manner Kings are accustomed to converse with men of my ranck. Montezuma would faine have found out some complements to have gone beyond those of Zelmatida, but nature, that had not so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He tooke Zelmatida by the hand, and drawing him almost by strength out of his Chamber, put him himselfe in the royall Chaire. Well my Lord (said Zelmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da) in rising out of the Chaire, I will receive this honour since tis your pleasure; but I beseech your goodnesse not to exact any more from my complying. It appertaines only to you to triumph, since twas by the virtue of your Subjects, and the fortune of your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The King (besides) desirous to make knowne that this triumph was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared but for Zelmatida; commanded all those to march on that had beene chosen for

the pompe and shew, and taking my deare Master by the hand, walked on foote to the Temple of their god of Battels. He caused there to be celebrated, the bloody Sacrifice of the immolation of Slaves, and streight after were seene not only rivelets of blood glyding from all corners of the Temple, but also the bodies of the poore Theviciens carried by hundreds to the places appointed for their buriall. This abhominable devotion being ended, Montezuma returned to the Palace as he came, and made an exceeding great feast for Zelmatida, where all the Caciques that were in his Court, assisted the Princes of the blood, and the chiefe knights.</p>
                  <p>When the tables were taken away, the rest of the day was spent in musick, playes, and many other kindes of galantryes, which plenty, peace and voluptuousnesse, had made the Mexicans Inventors. The night had her particular rejoycings. Hismalita gave Zelmatida a ball, and brought in Isatida and her sisters in such ornaments, and with such charmes as were capable to vanquish meere insensibility. Zelmatida in lieu of fayning as Galtazis had advised him, and to suspend his love to give place to his wisedome, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as distracted at the sight of Isatida. He left Montezuma that then stayed with him, and passing through the company without heeding whom he thrust, got thither where his passion transported him. The Princesse perceiving it, not only blushed, but was so farre offended, that fayning to haue some what to say to the Queene her mother, she turned her back to her unfortunate slave, and left him to make a long and cruell penance for the fault which he had committed against her commandement. Montezuma noted both the one and the other action, and Hismalita, finding in it new cause of distrust and hatred, had not power enough over her selfe to dissemble it. Her ill humor broke out in such a fashion, and principally against Isatida, that my deare Master had almost lost all respect, and had even a will to accomplish that part of the prediction which spoke of the ravishing of Isatida. He was neverthelesse restrayned by the feare of displeasing the Princesse, but he caused in himselfe so great an Effort by this constraint, that with the excesse of griefe, he fell as it were dead at the feete of Hismalita. O how that Queene (if I deceive not my selfe) prayed, that he might never come to himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine! But her malice was not heard; for just heaven who sawe no offence nor crime in the passion of my deare Master, sent him supernaturall strength to supply that which nature had lost in him. Montezuma ran first to him, and causing him to be taken by some young knights, witnessed by his assistance that goodnesse is not incompatible with weakenesse. Zelmatida, recovered from his fainting, and ashamed of what he had done, beleeved he could not better justifie himselfe, then in supposing some strange ill. He therefore complayned, and asking pardon of the King for his disturbance, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly besought his permission to retyre. Montezuma consented, and to shew how deare that Prince was to him, broke up the assembly, and gave command instantly that the high-priest should cause prayers to be said in all the Temples for the health of my deare Master. Zelmatida who till then lay buried in his usuall musings, awakened from so deepe a flumber; and how (said he) to the three Princes, have you beene able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the company of one so troublesome. Garruca knowing the intention of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, arose, and but for Polexander, who stayed him, had beene gone, that he might not be constrayned to continue his discourse. Thereupon Bajazet spoake, and addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himselfe to Zelmatida; You have cause (said he) to deprive us of the content which the relation of your adventures gives us. For our silence is a signe that we have not that feeling of it which we should. And truly we are eyther jealous of your fame, or insensible of brave actions, since that so many miracles as Garruca hath made known to us, seeme to have no more touched us then would the recitall of some vulgar acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Zelmatida blushing at the pratling of Bajazet tooke Garruca, and making him sit downe againe, goe on (said he) and speake of me what thou wilt. I shall finde it more supportable then the explication Bajazet gives of my words. Polexander, unwilling to speake any thing to Zelmatida for feare of some new interruption, intreated Garruca to continue his discourse. He would have obeyed him, but in the instant a noyse of drummes and trumpets hindred him, and made Bajazet send to know the cause of this novelty. The slaves which were on the Guard came and told him that there was newly arrived in the Island a man with an extraordinary attendance, who desired to speake with him.</p>

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:54727:42"/>
Bajazet sent to the Captaine of the Fortresse, that he should doe his charge, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken his pledges, he permitted the stranger to enter. These done were done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in an instant, and Barberossa brought the stranger to his Generall. The good aspect of the young man was not the cause alone that drew the Princes eyes upon him. He was clad after such a fashion, that a man must have beene voyde of all curiositie that would not earnestly have regarded him. He had an habilliment imbroydered with gold and silver, made in so particular a fashion, and so becomming, that you could not have seene any thing fayrer. He wore a kinde of Helmet after the ancient manner, on which waved a great plume of feathers of all colours, and about his neck he had a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of gold, in which was written in letters of Diamonds [Alcidiana gave it.] Two the like circles served him for garters, and to those were fastned two long chaines of gold, which were carried by two dwarfes. As soone as he came before Bajazet, he presented to him a linnen Roule, and before he unfolded it; I am (said he) the slave of Alcidiana. The richnesse of my chaines may let you know the greatnesse of her that makes me weare them. I goe from Country to Country to publish her mervailes, and for feare lest the incredulous and jealous should accuse me of flattery, I alwaies carry her picture, to make all eyes witnesses of those truthes I proclayme. A tempest throwing me on this Isle, I had neere neglected to come on shore for feare of prophaning the beauties of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana, in shewing them to Barbarian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But when I understood it was the seate of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bajazet, I presently set foote on shore to lay open to his eyes, all that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and the Sun ever yet made most worthy of admiration. Unrole then that linnen cloth, and see, or rather imagine in seeing an Image, though imperfect, of that divine Queene, what thinke you should she be her selfe? Bajazet ravished with the discourse as well as with the faire presence of the slave, unfolded the cloth that he held and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered so faire a picture, that he was forced to cry out, that Art had gone beyond all that Nature could doe. You blaspheme (said the slave to him) for if ever fortune bring you a shore on the Inaccessible Island, and that you have a sight of Alcidiana, you will cry out more justly, O how farre hath Nature gone beyond all that Art is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce I My exclamation (replyed Bajazet) is an effect of my astonishment and not of my incredulity.

The Slave would have gone on with his discourse, when Polexander pale and trembling, as a man in the cold fit of a violent ague, presented himselfe before him, and kissing the fetters he wore; yes (said he) O most happy Pallantus! I am the unfortunate Polexander, whom desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny judgeth not only unworthy to review thy incomparable Mistris, but also to carry as thou doest, the markes of her glorious servitude. The Slave after he had some while considered Polexander, threw himselfe at his feete, and against his will kissing them.</p>

Her indignation had beene satisfied by putting you to this affliction, if the impudency of her Subjects had not oblieged her to take from you, for ever, the contentment of seeing her. What (said Polexander) was it not enough for me to be punished for my offences, without engaging me to beare the iniquity of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? No (answered Pallantus) the faults of your friends being mixt with your owne, hath set you for a marke to which aymes all the most rigorous justice of Alcidiana. The errors of Amalthea, the solicitations of Pisander, the teares of Amintha, and the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar love of a people made foole by your valour, have brought my Queene to forbid you the comming into her kingdome, and to condemne you to death, if you ever chance to violate what she hath forbidden. O errors! O solicitations! O teares! O popular blindnesse! (said Polexander) how much am I beholding to you? that have obtayned for me a favour that I value not much lesse then the love of Alcidiana. Yes faire Queene (he added) casting his eyes on the picture of Alcidiana, yes, I will die of that death to which you have condemned me, and will die, if I can, without displeasing you by diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Polexander stopping at these words, seemed to expect Pallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus answere, but perceiving that the Slave repented him of what he had spoken: Goe not about (said he) by your word to disguise the passions of your Princesse. Remember tis she alone to whom you owe both your respect and complying, and that in mincing those things which her Majesty commands you, you violate the purity of your faith, and make your selfe unworthy of those faire chaines which your unsoyled loyalty hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired you. Say then boldly that Polexander must perish, and that Alcidiana her selfe hath designed to pronounce his Sentence of death. But Pallantus, to the end that none may doubt of the will of that Princesse, conceale no longer my just condemnation; let me see the termes that begot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I will satisfie you answered (Pallantus) since Alcidiana will have it so, and that at the same time I make her beauty to be adored, I cause her power to be redoubted. In saying this, he unfolded a great volume sealed with a golden Medal, where was the portraict of Alcidiana on one side, &amp; on the other a Phenix on a Cedar, with foure words that may be thus expounded [Only like my selfe.] Pollexander tooke this vellome with a kinde of adoration, and rendring particular homages to the picture of Alcidiana, he read his condemnation with such a tone, that made them well judge, his life was not so considerable to him as the glory of that Queene.

But although crimes are not crimes when they be not voluntary, and by consequence our Subjects, not criminall, since they offend without an intention of offending: Yet the complying with their errors, and the little care they had, not to be deceived, made them at last guilty.

                  <p>Polexander, after he had read this Declaration, kissed it, and shewing a secret joy of his ill fortune, restored the volume into the hands of Pallantus. The illustrious slave, seeing so incredible a resignation, from a man whom he looked on as the miracle and astonishment of his Age: Truely (said he) those that vaunt of knowing you, doe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wrong to your virtue; It is exceedingly above their relation and discovery, for my part, I confesse, that till now I have beene ignorant in that which hath beene most admirable in your life. Let no man talke to me hereafter of that invincible courage which by many heroicall actions hath acquired you the love or the admiration of all men. Let that magnanimity be forgotten, which hath made you refuse those Crownes that have beene offered you, to render them to those from whom fortune had plucked them. Let us thinke no more on that generous humanity by which you have entred into the greivances of your enemies and participated with their disgraces. In a word, let there be a perpetuall silence of all those eminent virtues which you practise in your prosperity and let none admire but at the strength of that soule that makes you receive with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction the unjust Judgement of a passionate Judge, and to run to a death that you have not deserved. Alcidiana shall pardon me if she please, in saying, that she knowes not what she condemnes, and that Amalthea hath not only beene wise in abandoning all reason to follow so worthy a subject, but that her error should give a desire to those that feare to die, as the vulgar of her sex. Polexander, unwilling to answer to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Pallantus speech; tooke from the latter end, his cause of reply, and asked him, what that Amalthea was, who at one time he seemed to condemne and absolve. Tis a yong Princesse said Pallantus, lost with love, and one with whose losse Alcidiana much touched, hath commanded me to search all the Islands that inviron hers. If by chance she be fallen into the hands of Bajazet, you will render a signall service to my Princesse to restore her. Presently Polexander cast his eyes on Baj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>zet to entreat him in the name of Alcidiana to cause Amalthea to be searcht for amongst his slaves. Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet prevented his petition and told him that ever since he had beene chosen Generall of the Rovers, no man had taken any woman but that he presently set her at liberty. Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus having no other businesse in that place, would have taken leave of the Princes, that so he might not give that time to his pleasure, which he ought to the service and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Alcidiana. But Polexander staied him, and intreated that he would bestow on him the rest of the day, that at more leasure he might instruct him of somethings that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the service of his Queene. Pallantus durst not refuse to give the Prince that contentment. He therefore staied with him, and signifying that he desired his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny apart.

They went forth together out of the Fortresse, and engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in so long and so pleasing discourses, that it was two houres within night before they returned.

This exercise was done part by day, and part by torc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Polexander came in a little after it was ended, and as if he had received some newes that obliged him to depart instantly, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himselfe to Bajazet, and speaking to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> seriously, tell me (said he) on what conditions are men accustomed to have their liberties from you? When you are ready to depart (answered Bajazet) I will set downe your ransome: Let it be then presently (replied Polexander) for if your service stay me not, I should be glad to be no longer heere. Yet (said Bajazet) you will be pleased to give us some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Besides Pallantus, whom you have retained, intends not to set saile by night, and I know you would not leave him in the hands of Pirates. This jeasting, being well liked on, gave occasion for others, which diverted the Princes, till they were called to the Table. They were intertained as before, that was with so great magnificence, that Pallantus not knowing what to admire among so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 words">
                        <desc>〈◊◊◊〉</desc>

to say that Fame which seemed to flatter when she published com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things, was exceeding envious and sparing in relating such as were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.</p>
                  <p>Polexander hereupon speaking, you would have (said he) farre more cause to finde fault with report, if you knew as well the virtues of Bajazet as you doe his power and riches; His fortune seemes to you wonderfull, and tis in that which heaven is to him most injurious. But although he affects to conceale himselfe even from his friends, yet I have neyther had so little curiosity, nor so small credit, but that I have learnt the most important actions of his life, I will one day relate them to you. Let us for this time goe on to what more concerns us, and seeing that the continuance of Zelmatidaes adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot be deferred to another time, let us give it the rest of the Evening. Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida did what in him lay to contradict Polexanders proposition, but being pressed by I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidamantus and Bajazet, you (said he) shall be obeyed; and Garruca who is not of the wisest, when I am to be spoken of, meanes not to refuse you a thing in whose relation he takes more pleasure then he can by it any way give you. Iphidamantus and Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet told Zelmatida, that he should leave to them the liberty of judgeing of those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and since himselfe, otherwise distraught, gave so little heede during the first nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, there was no appearance that he had taken notice whether of the two Garruca or his auditors had received most contentment. Brother (said Polexander to Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus) suffer him to beleeve what he list, so that he permit Garruca to relate and us to hearken to him. Herewith he arose from table, and taking Bajazet by one hand, and Garruca by the other, went into Iphidamantus chamber. Zelmatida in lieu of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, got to walke on the Terrafles of the Castle, and left them all the liberty they desired. When every one was placed, Polexander imposed silence, and Garruca be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning a new, thus ended the adventures of his Master.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE sicknesse of my Lord the Inca (which I may say without ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was both fayned and true) was not of long continuance. His desire to revisite Isatida being more powerfull then all the vowes and sacrifices of the Mexican priests soone gave his health againe. All the whiles he kept his chamber, Montezuma was not a day without seeing him, and by a thousand different testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of franknesse and affection made him see that he rather sined through weakenes then malice. And as soone as he saw him well commanded that through all Mexico, they should begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their feasts and rejoycings which had beene forbidden, and willed all his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers to call back, by new shewes and gallantries, those pleasures which the sicknesse of my Master had banished from the Court. For a whole Moneth together there was nought seene in Mexico but daunces, feasts, playes, sacrifices and other demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of joy. But excuse me (if you please) from their particular relation, and indeede the misfortunes whereinto we are now getting will not give way for me to dwell on the description of those vaine and deceit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Rather prepare your selves for the recitall of more sad accidents and actions; the most barbarous, that feare, supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cruelty were ever able to produce. Montezuma, unbeguiled and redeemed from his old Errors by Zelmatidaes conversation, and charmed with his incomparable qualities, began not only to laugh at the predictions of his Divines, but to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that enraged fury where withall Hismalita solicited the death or banishment of my deare Master. Yea, he had already declared himselfe for the Inca, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Queene his wife to esteeme of him as of his sonne, when a new accident made that poore King to relapse into his vaine terrors, and the cruell machinations of Hismalita; see how arrived this disaster. Zelmatida perceiving that Isatida was almost continually with the Queene her Mother, and that it was impossible for him to see and speake with her, resolved to get through this impossibility, and to finde m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This businesse he deliberated on with Galtazis, and being not able to be hindred by the inconveniences which that Little-one could lay before him, told him f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therefore with the Dwarfe, that one evening he would get over the Queenes garden wall, and hide himselfe at the end of a long ally where Isatida was wont to walke alone. He was not long from putting this designe in execution, but did it so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, that being discovered and followed by Hismalitae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Zelmatida imagining that Montezuma suspected him not, besought him to make knowne what he would have done, and to repose all on him for the chastizing of the attempters. The king embraced him, and thanking him for his offer; no, no (said he) I will not hazard the defence and strength of mine Empyre for the punishing of a few traytors. Let us rest quiet, and leave to common persons these no more honorable exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. With these words he dismissed Zelmatida, and shutting himselfe up with the furious Hismalita and her cruell ministers, tooke resolutions answerable to the worth of their mindes. It was resolved (as we have seene by the events) that Isatida should be put into the Castle of the Lake, and that without making much noyse on't, they should oblige Zelmatida to quit Mexico. The night ensuing this unhappy councell, was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to put it in execution, whilest Zelmatida, ignorant of the ill intended against him, and nigh desperate with anger, and the captivity of Isatida, melted himselfe into teares, in the Palace gardens, and durst doe nothing but threaten men and praying the gods: Hismalitaes ministers tooke Isatida from her chamber, and conducted her with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernesse and the Dwarfe to the Castle that was appointed for her prison. This was not done so secretly but that Zelmatida was advertized of it by breake of day. Doe not aske me (if you please) what his resentments were, comprehend them by your owne, if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the like disaster put you into the like despayre. The same day Montezuma assembled the Citizens of Mexico, and declaring to them the outrage offered him, represented to them the continuall cares and disquiets wherein he was engaged for the preservation of his estate. That nation, inconstant, bruitish and fearefull, if ever there were any cryed out that the theeves were to be pursued, and without making any distinction of persons, to punish all those that should be found guilty. Montezuma, seeing things brought to the point that he desired: I am not (said he) so carelesse of your preservation, that I am yet in an estate to feare ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

My daughters are in a place of surety, and free from running the hazard of being stolne from me, they shall enjoy all those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleasures which they had with me. After this Declaration, all those poore people retyred, blessing the wisedome and providence of their King. These faire shewes were good enough to deceive the common route, but among men of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the affaires had another face. Zelmatida more cleere sighted, and more interessed then the rest, presently knew Montezumaes intention, and knowing not what to doe to succour his Princesse and relieve himselfe, saw himselfe brought to the cruell neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of not daring to make his sufferings to be knowne. By himselfe he wept, he sigh'd, he cursed both heaven and earth; sometimes he resolved to strangle Hismalita. Then he intended to rety<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But 'twas to much purpose for him to make these generous propositions, he was too faithfull an observer of Isatidaes law and will to put them in execution. It behooved him therefore to be patient, and to try if he could doe that by cunning, which he was fobidden to undertake by force. Perceiving then that Montezuma bore him not so ill an aspect that it should be taken notice of, nor so good as to obliege him to the often s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To this end, as soone as twas night, he got into a boate, and hulling on the Lake, lay there till breake of day. Many a time he ran the hazard to be slaine on that Lake, and was forced to carry a great b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54727:45"/>
the Lake eve ry night, and to discover all places of that fatall? Castle. Now one night when he had resolved to goe a shore on a point of land, by which there was an entrance into the Fort, he saw comming out a man, who after he had made them retyre who had accompanied him, put himselfe alone into a boate, and began to rowe with an incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible swiftnesse.</p>
               <p>Zelmatida, that had well learned that art in a very little time, followed him; and overtaking him almost in the middest of the Lake, thrust hard (of purpose) on the other boate. The man in it, growne angry by the incounter, asked my Master what he was, and why (violating the expresse commands of the King) he durst in the night stay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lake. Zelmatida, that had more minde to gaine then to fight with him, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was of Tlacopan (which is a little Towne scituate on the banke of the Lake) and who, being about his affaires late at Mexico, was then getting homewards. The way you take, answered the other, and your language, give you the lye, and intimate to me sufficiently your ill intention. You are infallibly one of those who dared to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the lives of the Princesses; and therewithall threw a dart at Zelmatida. My deare Master happily avoided the stroake, and in lieu of avenging himselfe; whoever thou beest (said he) that hast wronged me, both by thy words and actions, know that I resent it not, since intreating me as thou hast done, it witnesses thou knowest me not. I confesse (answerd the other) that at the first I knew you not, but I doe now, and give the Gods thankes, that their providence rather then chance, hath brought me to a place, wherein I have liberty, to discover that, which till this time I have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayn'd to keep hidden. Zelmatida, thinking, he had been taken for some other, replyed, I am not he, whom thou imaginest. Yes (sayde the other) you are the very same, and your speech as well as the action lately done, is to me an infallible testimony of it. Yes, you are the worthy heyre of the great Quasmez, you are, I say that Zelmatida to whom I ow my liberty &amp; life. Zelmatida being unable to call to mind a person that knew him so well, came as neere to him as he could, and after a conjuration to tell his name: I am indeede (said he) Zelmatida, but I remember not that I have yet ever beene so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to oblige you for your liberty or life; yet I owe you both (twas replyed) how ill soever your memory be, it can neither forget my name nor fortune. I am that same Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman, who, driven by a desire of glory, entred into your territories with five hundred of my companions, and from your owne hands received a condigne punishment for my so much daring. I was vanquished and taken prisoner; but I must confesse to your glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that never man so generously treated his Enemies as you did both me and my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. The remembrance of it is still with me; but not daring to signifie it to you for feare of your losse, I have waited till some occasion might offer it selfe, wherein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fayling of my dutie to my Lord the King, I might by some service acquit my selfe of the favours you have done me.</p>
               <p>After Axiaman had made this generous declaration to Zelmatida, he came into his boate, and acquainted him how he came to know him, and what reasons had induced him not to make any demonstration of it. For other things (said he) you are in that place of the world where you are the most feared, and I assure you, that were you knowne here for what you are, your life would have its period before the next day: but Zelmatida (said he) if my obligations to you, may free all suspitions which my byrth and condition may give you, and if you beleeve me of honesty enough to be trusted, I beseech you by the liberty and life that I owe you, I conjure you by your own safety, to let me understand what might be the cause that hath made you leave the Markes of your greatnesse, to abandon your throne, and to put your person into the hands of a Prince, who sometimes would have given the halfe of his Empire to whosoever would have brought him your head.</p>
               <p>Zelmatida stopping Axiaman; my deare friend (said he) the beleefe that our Divines have gotten to themselves through the superstition of weake spirits rather then by the truth of their predictions, exerciseth at this day its tyranny over the councell of Kings as absolutely, as over the Assemblies of the common people. The most wise amongst the Caciques preoccupated with these vaine errors, have no more hope; neither in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of their Ministers, nor in the valour of their Armies; but regulating all their

The pity to see so good a Prince in so strange a phrensy hath caused me to come alone into this Kingdome, and heere makes me live unknowne. Tis true I had gone hence long since, if a cause sufficient to stay me eternally. forced me not to put all things else in oblivion rather then to part hence. And I must tell it thee Axiaman, and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I make thee the depositary of my fortune, of my life, and of mine honour. Axiaman hearing Zelmatida talke thus, threw himselfe at his feete, and embracing his knees, no, no, my Lord (said he) I recall that indiscreet request I made to you. Discover not so great secrets to me.

Zelmatida raising up the Prince, I know Axiaman (said he) better then Axiaman knowes himselfe, and I thinke that neither hope nor feare, which can doe all, shall be ever able to make him guilty of an ill action. Heare then, deare Axiaman my deplorable fortune, and have pity on a wretch to whom both life and death are equally funestous: I am come to Mexico to seeke out a treasure which Montezuma hath stollen from Quasmez, and in lieu of finding it, I have lost my selfe. That eternall and sovereigne power, which raignes over all men, hath made me loue I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satida, and my will yet more absolute then destiny, hath imposed on me a necessity of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her all my life, and to conceive of her as of something farre more to be valued then either the Empire of Quasmez, or that of Montezuma. Axiaman, staied not to answer till Zelmatida had made an end of his discourse, but interrupted him, and said that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to know no more of it, to be satisfied of many things that were passed, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the causes of Isatida's imprisoning. I aske you no more (said he) your businesse on the Lake, I have discovered that designe, and I see whither you would goe, but to cut you off from a fruitlesse labour, I will tell you newes, the most pleasant that you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in your ill fortune, and tis, that I am the sole man intrusted by Montezuma for the guarding of Isatida. On the suddaine the Prince gave way to be transported with his first conceptions; But presently reason and noblenesse opposed themselves against the fury of those pernicious Councellors, and represented to Zelmatida, that he ought to exact from Axiaman nothing that was unworthy of either of them. He suppressed therefore in himselfe the unjust requests that he intended to make him, and sighing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; Is it possible (said he to Axiaman) that you are Isatida's Guardian? I am so (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied he) and judge you to what Montezuma's opinion of my fidelity obligeth me. That's my despaire (cried Zelmatida) that Montezuma hath made so good an elect ion. All the waies to get Isatida are shut to me, and I may obtaine from the most brutish and cruell of all the Mexicans that which I neither can expect nor desire, especially from you.

I will endure all on condition to have yet once the happinesse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my faire Princesse, and to know from her owne mouth what she hath resolved of my life: I will get me farre away from Mexico amongst places not habitable to end my deplorable destiny. Axiaman, resolute to give my deare Master that contentment; tis, enough (said he to him) I know that Zelmatida can doe nothing that is not worthy of himselfe: Be then (my deare Lord) to morrow at this houre, at the foot of the great Tower of the Castle, and assure your selfe that you shall see Isatida, if she expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it not. Zelmatida a thousand times embracing Axiaman, and calling him as often the Author of his reviving, tooke leave of him and retired to his lodging. He could not shut his eyes all night; but to execute what he had resolved, he went out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber at breake of day, and was at the rising of Montezuma. After diverse discourses, he fell on that of his house, and inventing to the King divers most important newes, told him, that he was called home by his Father, and that the Cacique his Uncle, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Daughter, with him, would make an end of all those differences which had almost ruined their Family. Montezuma seemed to take no great pleasure in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and put it off till an other time. Thinke with your selfe whether this day that was to be followed by so happy a night, seemed not long to Zelmatida. He would a hundred times have made himselfe beleeve that it should be eternall; But his impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were at last satisfied and the night came on as darke and irksome as he could wish it. At the precise houre he came to the place assigned him, and without any long stay, he not only saw Axiaman come to meet him, but in the same instant was conducted to Isatida's chamber. Scarce had he strength enough to walke, joy had so much transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him; but as soone as he saw that high and divine object, the small vigour he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained forsooke him, and left him as dead, at the feete of that faire and sad Princesse. She wept to see this extreame constancy in a personage so deare to her; and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her Governesse to bring water, threw it herselfe on the face of her Lover. He came againe, and seeing that Isatida held him by the hand, he failed but little of losing his life indeede by this new excesse of contentment. He came to himselfe by little and little, and abiding on his knees, strove oftentimes to say something to the Princesse, but he strove in vaine. Isatida desirous to pur him out of trouble, what (said she to him) Zelmatida, you afflict your selfe for seeing me in this place, and that fortune doth not conforme her selfe to your desires. This is not the first day you have complained on her, and my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment is not the sole subject that you have to accuse her of injustice. Aske the gods for revenge; they are above her, and when they please they can take from her that absolute power, that makes her so redoubted in the world. If you entreat them with a free heart, they will heare you, but that you may seeke them as you ought, that is, with a minde voyde of all hatred, choler, and all other impurities, it behooves you to leave Mexico, and not to irritate any more by your presence, such persons as have not lesse cause to disaffect you, then they have power to avenge themselves. At the end of these words, she wept againe, and would have raised Zelmatida: But he remaining as before: I will obey you (said he) with a dying voice: Yes Madam, I will hence, and of all those injuries which I have received in Mexico, I will remember none but those which are in common with you. I forbid you that resentment, answered Isatida. What? w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yes; Yes, and I will that you love them, and that you looke not on them as Princes obliged to those violences which are inseperably annexed to the condition of Kings, but as on the Father and Mother of Isatida. Go then, and seeing Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iaman is so much your friend, let him sometimes heare from you; and with that word she left her unfortunate Lover and retired into another chamber.

With that he fell againe as dead, and Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was faine to take him up in that case and carry him to his boate. He staied with him till he was out of his fainting, and when he saw him recovered, he would have spoken something to have comforted him; but Zelmatida thinking on nothing but the good he had lost: Isatida (cried he aloud) Isatida, you have left me, and insensible of it that I am, I have not yet expired.

interruption, but seeing he gave not over; My Lord (said he) Fortune, who hath tried you by prosperities, will now see whether you are proofe against disgraces. Let her know, that what weapons soever she makes use of to assaile you, she will still rest with the shame of being overcome and to have found you invincible. I invincible (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Zelmatida) and Fortune overcome? Alas I give her all the honour she can expect by my undoing; and since she hath the power to banish me from Isatida; doubt not, but she is too powerfull for me to conquer. Axiaman judging that Zelmatida's griefe was too ingenious, not to draw from all kindes of discourse, causes enough to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it, tooke leave of the Prince, and remitting him into the protection of the gods, withdrew into the Castle. Zelmatida remained till day breake on the Lake, and putting a shore on the caussey to give no cause of talke to any body, and staied there yet above two houres looking on the hight of the Towres of Isatida's Prison. At last, he returned to the Pallace, and going to Montezuma, besought him for leave to be gone. Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zuma lead him to his chamber and made him dine with him. After dinner he went to the Pallace of birds, and by the way made him a thousand offers (at least in shew) to put him from his journey. But my deare Master was constant in his resolution to be gone, and remercying Montezuma for his proffers, desired him for all recompence to permit him to depart. Since it is not in our power to keepe you longer (said the King to him) we consent, though with griefe that you forsake us. But be pleased that first we acquit our selves of what we owe to your valour, and yet enjoy your company three daies longer. Zelmatida told the King that he would obey his command. Thus his departure was resolved on, to be the third day, and Montezuma tooke for a colour of this stay, the new honors he would doe to Zelmatida. Tis true, that during those three daies, my deare Master was served as if he had beene King of Mexico. The Grandies of the Kingdome came in ceremony to visit him, the people went all in a crowde, and after they had thanked him for all that he had done for the safety of Mexico, presented him the most rare things that either Art or Nature had bestowed on that rich Province. Montezuma and Hismalita added to these Presents, others, rich enough and precious to glut any man that had pined for Gold, Pearle and Diamonds. All these apparent favours were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny punishments to Zelmatida. He did nothing but sigh all those daies, and nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted him, but the hope he had that after his departure, Isatida should have more milde and kiude usage. The night following, the third day being come, he would yet once more see the Prison of the Princesse; and to that end put himselfe alone on the Lake; and when he perceived the Castle through the darkenesse; faire Pallace (cried he) place, sacred by the presence of the most perfect creature that Heaven ever shewed to the Earth, be more faithfull then they that unjustly possesse thee. Keepe the treasure which I leave thee, and know, that her preservation is thine owne. If thou chance to consent to the falsenesse of thy Masters; I will returne in spite of all Mexico, to chastice thy disloyalty, and to bury the pride of thy Towres and Pavilions underneath their owne ruines. From this transport he fell into another. He repeated the name of Isatida hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of times. He called on Death as often, and I doubt not but he would have given that to himselfe, if he had not feared to disobey the Princesse. At last, the day of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture arriving, he tooke leave of Montezuma, and went out of Mexico accompanied with all the Court and the most part of the people. He went to lodge at Tlacopan, where he was received as he had been the King, and the next day (followed by two men that Tumanama had left him, and fifty slaves to carry his baggage) he tooke the way of the Province of Cotosta which is fifty Leagues from Mexico towards the East. He had already travelled two daies and two nights, when he fell into an ambuscado which infallibly Hismalita had laied for him. He was assailed in a vally by a great many theeves, and enforced to use all his endeavours to defend his life. Tumanama's two men were there slaine, and fifteen or twenty of his slaves. He himselfe there received divers sleight woundes, but he did such things in this encounter that are beyond humane beleefe and went beyond the force even of Giants. After neer a whole daies resistance, he became Master of the field, and retired into the next Village with the remainder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Traine. He was compelled to abide three or foure daies there, that he might not anger or inflame his woundes, but he underwent in that place a greater hazard then he escaped in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54727:47"/>
field. Two nights together his lodging was beset by unknowne people, and assayled with so much fury, that but for the helpe which the Inhabitants brought him, it had beene certainly mastered and entred. These last assaults causing him to reflect on the first, he judged they could come from none but the expresse command eyther of Hisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita or Montezuma, and by consequence that he could hardly avoide Death. His high courage made him respect this danger as he was wont to doe others, and made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to surmount it in making shew that he contemned it. He came forth therefore in the open day from his lodging, and buying some slaves in stead of those he had lost, gave the Inhabitants of the Bourg to understand that he had not gotten himselfe so many Enemies, had he not saved all Mexico from the fury of the Theviciens and other Rebells.</p>
               <p>Those few words wrought such an Effect in the mindes of those Mexicans, that they all went into the field with him &amp; left him not till he came to Cotosta. Tendilly who was Governor thereof for Montezuma, came forth to meet him, and did him so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary honors, that if Zelmatida had been capable of feare or suspition, he might well have doubted that Hismalita was contriving some new plot on him. And indeed his Death had been unavoydable if the very party who was to murther him had not preferred the life of this Prince before the hope of a great fortune. He came into Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida's chamber whilst he slept, and awakening him, my Lord said he arise and save your selfe, there are here twenty men sent to kill you. The Prince, casting himselfe out of his bed, tooke a Javelin which he carried as he travelled, and turning himselfe to the stranger; where (said he) are those traytors. Doe not stay nor amuse your selfe (replyed the stranger) by fighting with them, but follow me, and know that thou hast not a greater Enemy then our Governour. Zelmatida beleeved the man, got out of Cotosta without giving notice to his slaves, and forsaking the common way, slipped yet once more from the rage of Hismalita. He got into the Deserts of Calcicoëca with his guide. Ten or twelve of his slaves escaping the hands of Tendilly, fled from Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They had not beene there two houres as they told me, when I arrived with the first vessell that touched the firme land of our world. But be pleased to let me make a necessary digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to cleare you of some things which doubtlesly you have stumbled at; and that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Inca my Master in the Deserts of Calcicoëca, I relate to you my adventures.

Nature bestowing on me nothing good but an incredible desire to see o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countries then mine owne, and other manners then those of my country-men; I stole from Cusco at the age of seventeene yeares, and went thence with certain Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants which traffiqued along the coasts of Chily. We were driven from the land by a tempest, and after we had beene above fifteene dayes at Sea, we were shipwracked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a desert Island which is farre from the maine Land. Those that could save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by swimming got to the Island, but finding it Desert and not inhabited, they saw well that they had not escaped their first shipwrack but to fall into a second. Of twelve that remained of us, sixe died in foure daies, and the two next dayes ensuing, five more followed them. When I sawe my selfe alone, and equally depressed with griefe and hunger, I ranne to the top of a Rock to find within the waves the end of my afflictions; but at the same time I descryed a great vessell in full sayle comming right to me. I gave the gods praise for so unhoped a succour, and descended to the haven to meere it. That ship had great sayles made of Palme-leaves, and many huge Anchors of wood, and seemed so unwiedly and heavy, that it was scarcely shooke by the Tempest. It came at last into the haven, and I presently besought the ayde of those were in her, and by signes having made them understand the wofull estate into which I was brought, I got them to succour me.</p>
               <p>They tooke me very humanely into their vessell, and after they had given me to eate asked me the name of the Island. I made knowne that I was throwne on it by a tempest, and that they should not finde therein eyther man or beast. They were it seemed very

much grieved at it, and abode all the rest of the day in their shippe, not knowing whereon to resolve. At last they put to Sea againe, and taking to their first course, were more then thirty daies without seeing land. They arrived the three and thirtieth at the Island Junagava, and being knowne there, made a solemne Sacrifice on the Shoare, and a feast to all those of the Island that would be assistants. I learnt in a small time the langu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They set sayl as soone as they could to get into their owne Countrey, but as they were within sight of Zebut, they were descryed by a Pyrat of China called Ocya Acem. He set on them, tooke them, and putting all in chaines, stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on for China, and there sold them, and me amongst the rest, and by that misfortune I saw that great Empire, which to say truely is farre more rich and admirable then the Inca's. Twas in that delightfull Countrey that fortune began to be weary of afflicting me. I there recovered my liberty which I had lost, and the charity of that Nation was so great that in lesse then two yeares I was Master of six great shippes, which the Chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses call Juncks. I got from the Governour of the maritine Townes a permission to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick to Liampao and other Ports. I was acquainted in sayling with the Portugalls, and their communication, causing me to remarke in them a subtlety of wit, a politenesse and valour which I had not met with in any other Nation. I gave my selfe over to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable desire of travell, and resolved to see that Countrey which bred so generous a people. I therefore sold my Juncks and my Merchandize, and putting all I had into golde and pearl, I embarqued my selfe with a Portugall called Duart Tristao, and sawe all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the east Indies where the king of Portugall is Master. I stayed some time in the stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Meca, and during my abode there, I bought two Arabians, who taught me the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage I speake, and gave me the knowledge of the Empire of the great Signior. I pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the fortresses of Diü and Goa and finally arriv'd at Lisbone. I was presented to the great King Emanuel, and abode two whole yeares in his Court and that of Ferdinand and Isabella kings of Castile and Leon. It was there that I understood how a Genovois called Christopher Colombus had discovered a new world, and by the description they made to me of it, I knew it must needes be the same where I was borne. Presently I was touched with a desire to see my deare Country. I therefore put to Sea with the sonne of that happy Genovois, and arrived with him in the Island of Hayti, he gave me a vessell to goe to that of Cuba. After that I had stayed some time there and learnt the customes and language of the countrey, I returned to the young Columbus and by my intreaties obtained from him a pretty good ship, but it had not any Cannon. I embarqued with an intention to get into mine owne countrey, but the winde drove me to the Port of Calcicoëca, a little after that the slaves of Zelmatida arrived there. I humanely received them, and understanding their adventure, put what they brought in a place of safety. I asked them news of the kingdome of the Incaes, when loe a great noyle comming from the land broake off our conversation, and made me come out of my Cabin to discover what was done on shoare. I saw two men pursued by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a hundred, and defended themselves against so great a number. The tallest of those two hardy combatants made shewe of an extreame valour. I sawe how he ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with those that followed him, and dispersing them by his incomparable blowes, gave not over killing till he was call'd back by the cryes of his Companyon. But what need I tell you all that passed on this occasion? Tis ynough you know that Zelmatida was the invincible warriour who alone fought with so many madde men. The inequali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his combat, and the desire to assist so valyant a man, drewe me out of my vessell. I landed with thirty of my mariners, some arm'd with weapons of fire and the rest with halberds and pikes. I march'd right to the murtherers, and gave a discharge so to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that my musketiers shot downe twenty of them, and so terrified the rest, that they tooke themselves to flight. But their Leader who was the same Tendilly of whom I have before tolde you, compelld them to returne to the charge. When I saw that they came on againe, I came neere to Zelmatida, and presenting him one of the two swords which I had brought: Inca (sayde I to him) not thinking to speake so well, avenge thy selfe now of these Barbarians, and knowe that in employing this iron
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54727:48"/>
which I put into thy hand thou shalt give as many deaths as blowes. Zelmatida admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the new weapon, would faine see whether it had as much virtue as lustre. He cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ten or twelve of my musquetiers to advance, and putting himselfe in the Front, went to meete Tendillyes Souldiers. He strooke at the first, and seeing with what faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity his sword entred the bodies of his adversaries, beleeved it to be some inchaunted weapon. The Traytor Tendilly was in the midst of his Company, who cryed out that they should lay holde on that mortall Enemie of Montezuma, and the future Destruction of all Mexico. His souldiers, affrighted with the shot, gave no eare to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mands, but imagining to scape death by getting further from the harquebusiers, they tooke no heed that the fatall bullet strook them as mortally a far off, as neer. Zelmatida angry to have so good armes and finde so poore resistance, ranne to Tendilly, and comming to him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most strooke off his left arme with one blowe of his Sword. Tendilly fell downe, and asked his life from Zelmatida. The Prince seeing him in so ill a case; keepe it (said he) since thou lovest it so well, but learne to make better use of it. He presently left him, and turning to me, whoever you be (said he) whether man, or god, who are come to assist me with armes sufficient, not only to exterminate these poore theeves, but all the men in the World; make an end of what you have begunne, and taking me from a place wherein I have as many Enemies as Montezuma hath faithfull Subjects, deliver me from this vexatious necessity, eyther of losing my selfe, or destroying of others: This speech, full of judgement, joyned with the brave aspect of the speaker, and the brave actions he had newly executed, assured me that Zelmatida was something more then a man. I told him that I had a ship in which he might imbarque himselfe, and by that meanes be secure from the fury of so barbarous a Nation; and there withall shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him my vessell. He left his Enemies, who had no minde to stay him, and giving them the honour of the field which he had wonne, marched towards the Sea, and we all presently went aboord. Those which I had before taken into my ship, no sooner saw Zelmatida, but that they beganne to make great shoutes of joy, and threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves at his feete. He praysed their fidelity, bewailed the death of their companions, and promised to reward their affection. Which done, he turned him to me, told me his name and his quality, and in few words acquainted me, why he had been pursued by the inhabitants of Cotosta. Hereupon I commanded to weigh Anchor, and by the favor of a fresh gale, our vessell got from the shore.</p>
               <p>I demanded of Zelmatida whither he desired to goe; he answered me that he could wish to get to one of the Ports of the kingdome of Quasmez, and told me, that if he deceived not himselfe, we might come thither i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I commanded my Pilot to take that course, but the winde that most commonly opposeth Navigators, drove us farre into the Sea; and after a voyage, or (to say true) a tempest of many daies, made us luckily enter into an arme of the Sea, which like a great channell opens into the Isle of Cuba, and makes a safe harbour against all windes: we gave thanks to the gods for so wonderfull a deliverance, and strove to get to a kinde of fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

all with good sence and judgement. At last he asked him what he was; the other reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was a Mexican borne, and noble by his condition, Tecuitli an affectionate servant to Montezum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have well noted there was something great in the said Zelmatida. I doe not demande thee what important cause hath made thee an exile in this Iland; the knowledge I have of Montezuma's affaires, gives me already all that which thou canst instruct me in. Ha, (sayd the prisoner) who ever thou be that hast had the honour to enjoy the glorious light which parts from my visible God; how comes it that thou turn'st thy armes against those that are borne the Slaves of his greatnesse? Thou shalt knowe the cause another time, answered Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida; for this present, thou must tell me where the Prisoner is whom thou hast kept these many yeares. The Mexican made him no reply to that question, but throwing out a prodigious cry caught up my Sword, and turning it on himselfe had dyed on it but for Zelmatida. The Prince taking notice of his great loyalty, live (sayde he) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to Montezuma the faith thou hast sworn him. I will have intelligence of what I search by some other way. In the meane time, thou art free and maist either stay with us, or be gon, if thou think'st us unworthy of thy company. How unfortunate am I (cryde the Mexican) to have so great an obligation to the Enemies of my king? but I will not betray my faith (sayde he) turning towards my deare Master, nor yet abuse thy noblenesse. Zelmatida more and more ravisht with the mans brave mind, tooke off himselfe the cordes, wherewith he was bounde, and offring him his hand, I will not force thee to love me (sayd he) but if thou knewst how I have been treated by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezuma and Hismalita, thou wouldst seeke Masters more worthy to be served. We must accuse for their faylings (sayd he) their condition rather then their nature. They sinne of custome innocently and to betraye them because they reward not our fidelity is to reproach the Gods that they knowe not how to make a good c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Zelmatida desirous to try whether he could drawe any thing out of him, but (sayde he) it is no great matter of fidelity to conceale things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known. There is the lesse reason to aske any thing of them, replyde the Mexican, howsoever never hope to get from me that which I am bound to conceale. Thou art Master of that which we have so long time and so carefully kept, and thou must now bethinke thee what thou wilt doe with it. Zelmatida let him goe when he saw there was nothing to be had from him, and beleeving for certaine that Alisma was shut up in that Fort, intended to deliver him from his long captivity. The night hereupon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he caused divers branches of Trees to be lighted, which in that Isle serve for torches, to begin his search withall. He tooke himselfe an exact review of the Fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>He had already gone round about the Fort, and already feared that all his paines would be to no purpose, when he saw arise out of a place under ground, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of little fires, which having stirred a while about in the ayre, cast themselves into the forme of a crowne over his head, and as if they had beene aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Zelmatida, astonished to see so many flying lights, turned him towards me, and asked me what this prodigie meant? Nothing, but what's happy (said I) but if you will follow my advice, command those to be gone that beare the lights, and follow those guides that offer you theirs. My deare Master tooke my councell, and throwing himselfe first into the vault, saw all as light there, as if it had beene full of torches. He sawe nothing in it but those wandring fires, which after they had made many rounds, fixed themselves at last to the roofe of the Cave. Zelmatida this while went from corner to corner to finde some doore, and searched so neerely, that at last he found one cut out of the Rock. This dore opened not inwards, nor outwards, but moved downewards and was sustayned in the midst by two Tampins of the stone it selfe, which kept it equally ballanced; He thrust it accordingly, and presently all those little fires, came off from the roofe and entred by that opening. He followed them, and finding a little round winding stayre cut out of the Rock, would needes see whither it lead. He descended it by the light of his flying

guides; and when he was come farre downe, found a square roome, and thought he heard one lamenting. He turned his eare that way the voice came from, and saw at one of the corners of that dungeon, a man laid on the Earth, which had his two legs put through two silver rings, his body gyrt at the middle with a great chayne, and his armes bound behinde him. This object, which could not be seene without horror, moved the King to pitty. He came neere, and looking earnestly on him, saw in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance somthing that was both Heroick and venerable. This constancy increased the Kings compassion, and wrought in him a desire to free him from so cruell a Prison. He asked him whether his name were not Alisma, and whether or no the Rebells of Quito had not sold him to Montezuma? At these words the poore captive lifting up his eyes, gazed on Zelmatida as on his Releaser; who ever you be (said he) who by your aspect &amp; language seem not to be of the number of mine enemies, &amp; who already knowmy name and fortune; beleeve it 'tis not without the particular providence of the gods, that you have beene brought hither. Thy continuall showres of teares hath moved their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and since I have alwaies beleeved that they were not in heaven but to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the good works that were done on Earth, they make me this day see that I was not deceived, and that I should not die with the griefe of being faithfull to my Master. It is above fifteene yeares that I have lived (if to die a hundred times in a day be to live) under the weight of those chaynes wherewith you see me loaden, yet all the extremity of those tortures which my hangmen hourely renew, hath not vanquished my patience, nor make me discover those secrets wherewith I was intrusted. I cannot tell you by what miracle my Soule hath beene able to endure in a body so afflicted as mine, since I have had none other foode then a little Maiz and water, and some ill fruites which twice a day I am forced to eate, by the souldiers of this Garrison. But what misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would be comparable with mine, were it not for the company that these little Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuyës have afforded me, who more pittifull then men, come in to me as often as my keepers doe, and mingle their living lights with the obscuritie of this Dungeon. And you O the only man whom I have seene since I have beene in the power of Montezu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, if you feare the gods, and take pleasure in well doing, tell me by what force or cunning you have beene able to enter this place so strongly fortified and guarded. My Father (answered the King) I fled from the persecution and ambushes of Montezuma, when a tempest threw me in the Port. I have beene so fortunate, that I presently delea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Garrison, and made my selfe master of the place. Most certainly tis the gods, who as you told me, mov'd with your teares, have vouchsafed to avenge you on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity of the Mexicans and their complices. This resolute old man, finding I know not what remainder of joy, which the length of his afflictions had not been able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume, assured my deare Master, that he never despaired, but that he hoped yet to make the Rebells of Quito, and the ambitious Mexicans to feele what a just indignation could inflict on them.</p>
               <p>Whilest he spoake thus, the king handled his chaynes and tryde to undoe them, but seeing he could not doe it alone, he commanded me to put to my hand and to helpe breake them. We did it by the meanes of some instruments we sent for, and set the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Alisma at liberty. The long time which the good old mans legs had beene ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, and, as it were, shortned in his fetters, would not permit him to make use of the liberty was given him. It was impossible for him not only to walke, but well to stand up. Zelmatida, perceiving his weakenesse, held him up on the one side, and my selfe on the other; wee helped him up the stayres of his prison, and carried him to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xican Captaines lodging. As soone as the violence of his payne was lessened, and gotten out of his fainting, occasioned by the change of ayre, he asked for something to eate. Zelmatida gave him of the best he could finde to comfort his heart; when his body, weakened through fastings, watchings and tortures, was somewhat strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by those sweete and nourishing remedies, he fell asleepe and continued all the rest of the night in such a repose as was a very new thing to him. Zelmatida lay downe all clad, on some coverlets he sent for from the shippe; and awaking every foote, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to be informed of the old mans health, and other whiles to know what was done in the Fort, remained till breake of day without giving any intermission to his disquiets.

Zelmatida tooke notice of that agitation, and fearing some sicknesse in Alisma, intreated to know if he desired any thing that might comfort him. My sonne (answered the old man) the best remedy you can give me, is to tell me who you are. Father (replyed Zelmatida) to my great griefe, I can make you no an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to that question. I know not who I am, though some have assured me that I am the sonne of a king. The great Quasmez, Prince of all those lands which extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the deserts of Quito, to the Mountaine of Popocampecho hath bred me up as his successor.

Alisma, hearing these brave adventures, fell on his knees as feeble as he was, and lifting his eyes and hands to heaven; I give thee thanks (said he) who ever thou be, that presidest in the government of the World.

               <p>My deare Master, who had an extraordinary care of him, made him then take some repast, as himselfe did, to resist those griefes and disquiets that continually vexed him. This little meale ended, Alisma would try if he could walke.

You know Alisma with what affection I have alwaies desired that nothing should passe in all my commands, either for the affaires of peace or businesse of war, but that you should be privy to it: and for my part I know with what affection you have alwaies been industrious for the good of my Crowne.</p>

But what cause soever I have to rejoyce, I misse not some interior motions that seeme to presage the deliverance of my wife shall be deadly to her, my selfe and the child. If you knew me lesse then you doe, I should feare least you might have some ill opinion either of my judgement or courage: but I know you will take nothing from the estimation you make of them both; though the fearfullnesse that shewes it selfe in my discourse may seeme to perswade you that I am no more my selfe. I feare not death, Alisma, nor need I other witnesse then you. I have long since prepared my selfe for whatsoever the gods are pleased I shall suffer.

But I give you not this Present with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the thornes which are inseparable from it. I mean, that you shall never pardon those people whom I lately subdued, if they ever goe about to shake off the yoke they have received, or attempt any thing against the oath they have made me. Guina Capa made me this speech with a great quiet of minde, and putting into my hands the royall Javelin which he carried in all ceremonious actions, commanded me to keepe it well. Tis not without cause said he that I charge you to have care of it, for I would have you know that on it depends the fortune of my Son, if I have one; that of my Wife if she survive me, and your owne if you become my successor.

Can I remember thy cruelties without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my selfe into the number of so many valiant men whom thou hast destroyed?

               <p>The Quen was drawn through the street of Quito, and (out of the town) expos'd to two Tigres, who by a prodigy of the goodnes of heaven changing boththeir nature &amp; custome, became pittifull and honored their prey insteed of devouring it. I have learned from some that were present at this marvelous Spectacle, that that wofull Queen was delivered among those Tygres and that she died as soone as her child was born. There were that added another miracle to the former; and twas that the Tigres had not onely compassion but charity for the little creature, &amp; that after they had lickt it and defended it from those that would have killd it with their arrowes they forsooke it not, till they saw the Infant in the hands of a troop of men who seemd to be come thither of purpose for his succour. Those who were supposed to be the Subjects of the King Quasmez, carried away the body of the Quene and her childe, and since that tyme I haue done my utmost endeavour to recover them both; but notwithstanding all the care I have taken, and all the promises I have made by my Embassadors to the just Quasmez, it hath not avayled me to recover, nay not so much as to know what was becom of them.

In a small time I found my selfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with an army wholely composed of such men as would preserve nothing to themselves after the losse of their Princes: and in that warre giving my selfe none other title then the Avenger of the royall blood of the Incas, I never thought on any one of those Advantages which the King my Master had left me. I weighed not the becomming a King, nor that I had to deale with so many enemies, so that the whole world might know with what contempt of my fortune and life, I pursued those tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors which triumphed on the death of the King and the miseries of my countrymen.

Instantly I entred with my Army the country inhabited by the traytors, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming (to my great greefe alas) the innocent with the guilty, commanded that all should be put to fire and sworde. Whole townes were burnt, the fields laid waste, and in briefe the whole kingdome of Quito became a mournfull Theater where disloyalty on the one side and vengeance on the other made shew of what they had most tragicall. In the terme of five or six yeares that the Gods fauoured my attempts, I reduced the Quitonian traytors to the necessity of searching in dens and the precipices of mountaynes roome and places to hide themselves from my good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.

These new Enemies made me alter my resolution, and to march right to them, to hinder their joyning with the Quitonians. I drew then my Troopes from the Mountaines where they held the Rebels besieged, and stayed behinde with a body of foure thousand men to hinder the excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those we had set at liberty. On my third dayes march, I fell into an ambush that those desperat traytors had layd for me, and though I saw my selfe beset on all sides, yet I happily freed me, and cut most part of the Quitonians in peeces. The heate of the fight so transported me, that without consideration of the fault I committed, I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the run-awaies, and so farre that at last I saw I was alone in a great Forrest.

I fell very low, and found my selfe so amazed with the fall, that It was a pretty while ere I came to my knowledge: At last I recovered my wits, and saw I was in a very spacious place, and in some places very light: I looked all about, and discrying not those that hid them there, I confesse I was somewhat astonished; I then thought of nothing but how to come out of that Caverne, and searched so much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I then thought on the King my Masters Javelin, and returned for it into the first Vault, I found it in the place where I fell, but at that instant; I know not what thought of death seising on my minde, I was unwilling that a thing so precious should after my death come into the hands of my enemies. I therefore resolved to leave it there, and to hide it in a cleft of the Rock, which I saw there fit to preserve so deare a pledge or gage,</p>
               <p>With teares then I tooke leave of a Present which the love and memory of my deare Master made so extreamely to be valued of me, and so buried it in the intrailes of the Rock; which done I yet passed into the greater Caverne, and from thence into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther far larger, where me thought I heard some talke, and comming in thither, I met not only those two which I had pursued, but many others of their companions who rushed upon me with fearefull howlings, and spite of my resistance binding my hands and feet, carried me out of that Cave. I heard, or I beleeved I heard in going out of that place, the voice of a man either very sick or very weake, who, calling me by my name, Alisma (said he) my deare Alisma at last thou art fallen as well as my selfe into that snare which our common enemies have these many yeeres laied for thee. At that time I amused not my selfe much to weigh those words, but during my pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, my memory retaining them, hath not onely many times repeated them, but making me call to minde those terminations which are proper to the language of the Inca's, would perswade me though without reason, that none but Guina Capa was utterer of those complaintes. When they were made to me, I was not permitted time to give an answer, for those by whom I was taken, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their howlings and blowes, carried me out of the Caverne, and travelling night and day came at last to the Mexicans campe. There they set me downe, and loading me with new chaines, presented me to him that commanded Montezuma's Army. The generous Cacique (who is the same that hath hitherto kept me in this place) received me with a great deale of humanity, and intreating me oftentimes to take my misfortune patiently, said that he would bring me to a place where I should have intertainement worthy my loyalty and condition. He was as good as his promise whilst he remained in the Kingdome of Quito, but after he had got againe all that I had taken, and cut in peeces all those Troopes whom my disaster had made desperate, he brought me to Mexico. There was I most ignominiously lead through the streets for a spectacle to a brutish Nation, and more cruelly exposed to all tortures that the fury of Hismalita and weaknesse of Montezuma could invent to draw from me those truthes which were more important to me then my life. My silence, and the scorne I had of their torments, neer madded them, and but for I know not what reason that hindred them, I perswade my selfe they were resolved to put me to death. After I had beene a yeere prisoner at Mexico, I was taken out of a Castle that is in the midst of the Lake which invirons their City: Zelmatida interrupting Alisma at the remembrance of that prison: Ah (my Father said he to him sighing) how well doe I know that fatall abode! but goe on I pray, that we may quickly leave this Island, and giving our selves over to be lead by our just anger, may at once fall on Mexico, and run with the same pace to our just ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.

Doe not imagine that in making you this donation I intend to free my selfe from the paines and perills of so long a warre, or that age having made me fearefull, I resolve to end my daies in a secure idlenesse. No, no, Zelmatida, I will (if the gods grant me life) conduct you not only to Quito but to Cusco, and dye with my weapons in my hand, in establishing you in Throne of our Kings. Let us on then as soone as possibly we can to begin this holy warre: Let us on to dig out the fatall Javelin of Guina Capa, that the sight of it may serve us to gaine to us their affections, and to make us to be followed by those who undertake not in affaires any other part then what their owne interests prompts them to.

I am most assured that he will give us an Army sufficient to avenge the blood of Guina Capa, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to conquer the Provinces of Quito but even the very Realme of Montezuma. Let us run headlong on nothing I beseech you (answered Alisma) and let us not doe that wrong to the memory of the great Guina Capa, to beleeve that his Declaration and Seale will be no way advantagious unto us. Essay we rather to get into the Province of Quito, and when we shall be in possession of the good which my Lord the Inca hath left us, we will then supplicate the just Quasmez to assist us with his forces that we may keepe it. Zelmatida having consented to the will of Alisma, came and tooke me and testifying to me his resentment of the service I had done him, intreated me not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake him, and that we might presently embarke to get us on the Coasts of our world. I leave you to thinke with what content I gave care to a request so pleasing to me. I not only promised that great Prince to conduct him whither he would goe, but protested to him that if he did not refuse my service, I would not abandon him whilst I lived. My inclination (said he) that makes me incline to your company, will have me take you at your word; but the cause that commands me to preferre your contentment before mine owne, forbids me to use the power which you give me over my selfe. These speeches were seconded by many other, and concluded to depart without delay. Our ship had received some wrong at sea, but the Marriners meeting with that which was needfull for her new trimming, that they put her in case to feare nothing but Land and fire. This while Zelmatida called for the Governour of the place, and seeing him in a deepe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; Your loyalty (said he) and your courage are capable to make you beloved even of men that esteeme farre lesse of virtue then either Alisma or I doe; We should therefore sin against our owne consciences if in some sort we did not recompence your excellent qualities. Common men esteeme not brave actions but when they are done by themselves or by those of them most affected. But we are more just, and respect virtue in the person even of our enemy. This consideration obligeth us to give you that which the chance of warre tooke from you, and to leave you free in your Port, with all those who are now our prisoners.

               <p>He could not refrayne from teares in ending these words. Alisma embraced him in bidding farewell and wept too. In the meane time Zelmatida sent to his shippe for all those whom he had caused to be chained, and when they were come, caused their fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be taken off, and delivered them to their Captaine.

The Mexican pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that he would not fayle, and with that we went aboord. Though the winde and calme tempered one with another, seemed to have as much affection as our selves to the successe of our voyage; yet being ignorant of what course to steere in so vast a Sea and so unknowne, we were neere two moneths as well in crossing that great extent of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in coasting the long point of land which advancing far into the Sea, runnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long that Isthmus of fifteene leagues only in breadth, which is as the middle of Quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez kingdom. At the narrowest place of that Isthmus there is a Port, the fayrest, safest, and greatest of any I have seene in my voyages. Into that we fortunately entred after we had many times tryed the incomodity of navigation, and leaving there our shippe, with those of our Mariners which were the worst souldiers, we tooke the rest, gave them armes and landed together. Zelmatida knew the countrey no better then those that followed him. It therefore behoved us to finde some Savage to be our Guide, and to employ our fire and sword to make us way through the Mountaines, Precipices, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests and other places, to us inaccessible. We travelled foure dayes in those Desarts, and on the fifth came to Careca, which is a pretty towne, where the same Torrucia kept his Court, who was by Zelmatida taken prisoner in the warre of the twenty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Caciques, and a little after set at liberty.

Zelmatida had scarce heard this discourse but the fire getting up into his face: Lets away (father said he to Alisma) lets away and serve the most just and best Prince that the Sun hath ever brought into the World. Before Alisma replyed, I spoke, and seconding with content the conception of my deare Lord.

Zelmatida embracing me for joy, my deare Garruca (said he) thy advice is so generous, that I should be unworthy to live, if I deferred the executing of it. Alisma who would have beene glad that nothing had opposed his first designe, asked Zelmatida if he remembred not his promises? I shall never forget them said Zelmatida, but long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I made them to you, I was engaged to serve Quasmez preferrably before all others.

The next day we made the like Journey, and the third had not been shorter but for an accident which happily fell out for Zelmatida and Quasmez too. Wee descended a Mountaine from whose top we had discovered the Towne wherein Quasmez was beseiged and the Amazons campe, when suddainly came on us a troope of women who incompassing us commanded withall that we should yeeld. Zelmatida and Alisma ravished with the beauty of their enemies could not take a resolution to offend them: They therefore obayed, and presenting to them their weapons obliged my selfe and my companyons to give them ours too. This is not enough saide the Principall of that faire Company, you must now follow us and yeeld your selves prisoners to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Telesmana Queene of the warlike virgins. You shall not be disobeyed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Alisma. For we are both my selfe and my companions so much obliged to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesmana, that we are ready to suffer all that she shall pronounce against us. This saide; Zelmatida was the first that presented himselfe, and consenting to have his hands bound endured Alismaes smiling at it, and that I might manacle my selfe. Those redoubtable enemies, put us in the midst of them, and so brought us to their Campe. They under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood at their entry, that Telesmana expected Embassadors from Quasmez, and that she was to receive them with all the magnificence that she seemed to make shew of on the like occasions. These news were very pleasing to them, and made them resolve to take hold of that occasion, and to present us to the Queene, whilest she was in the state of doing justice; and presently they hastened towards the Pavillions of Telesmana. I must confesse to you; that in no one of all the kings Courts that I have seene eyther in the one or the other world, I have not taken notice of any thing so stately, so rich, so admirable, and in a word, so royall, as the Guard and the Quarter of that valiant Queene. It was almost a league about, and twice so long as large, compassed with a di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ch filled with water, and with a pallisadoe of high stakes. There was but one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, where two thousand Amazons were day and night in guard. We entred the second Campe, and passed through foure thousand warriers that stood on each side in file even to the Queenes lodging. After that she who commanded our Conductors, had beene with the Queene to give an accompt of the successe of her journey; she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and brought us into a great Tent, which was as the Hall for Telesmanaes guard. Thence we went into another that shone exceedingly with gold and diamonds. There stood three rancks of Amazons, armed with halfe-pike, so neate and curiously gilded, that they were fitter for a day of triumph then a day of combat. We past by those fayre warriers, and presently saw the worthy Mistresse of so illustrious Subjects. She was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with a great number of Princesses and other Ladies, and seated on a throne of massie gold, covered with rubies, pearle and diamonds. It was ascended to by six de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of gold and silver, and over it hung great plates of gold, joyned together all thick set with precious stones, and disposed in such a fashion, that the Sun casting his beams on it, made the Queene to seeme indeede as another Sun. Our guards brought us to the foote of the Throne, and commanded us to kneele to be examined. The counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and grace of Zelmatida and Alisma, though the inequality of their ages made them farre different, caused almost a like admiration in all the Assembly. The Queene could not refrayne from turning her eyes on them, and though she saw them not well, yet confest that it was great pitty to destroy such men whose brave aspect gave suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent testimony of their mindes, and the greatnesse of their courage. Yet she would be satisfied, and therefore commanded Alismaes Guard to bid him stand up.</p>
               <p>The generous olde Man arose, and all bound as he was, after five or six steps came and kneeld at the feet of the Princesse. When he had cast up his eyes, and that Teles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana had looked on that warlike aspect which his gray hayres made venerable, she shewed a great deale of greife that she must be constrayned to condemn that man to death, against her owne naturall sweetnesse. Notwithstanding it behooved her to goe against her owne inclynation, and to resolve it. Yet before she would give the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, she tolde him, that if his courage did not bely his countenance, he should shewe it on this occasion, and patiently undergoe the disaster whereinto he and his companions were then fallen. For know (said she) that by an irrevocable Decree made by me above sixteen yeares since, I have condemned all men that should fall into

my hands to be burn'd alive. The respect due to my sex which that of yours hath violated in mine owne person and my childrens, compells me to avenge my selfe on men with more rigour then any doth ordinarily inflict on his enemies. But let them for all accuse their owne inhumanity, that was the first cause of it. Yes cruell and inhumane as you are, yes Monsters that make Nature to blush for producing you, you have been so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous as neither to have mercy on a woman whom the gods caused to be borne the fairest and wisest Princesse of the world, nor on her infant yet a part of her selfe, doe not wonder then if after so many and so great wrongs I betake me to a just venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and make no difficulty of massacring the innocent for feare of letting escape any one that is guilty. Now you know my resolution and your owne destiny, tell me who you are, and what sad fortune hath cast you into the hands of my women? Alisma, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet we must confesse that this last treachery is horrible, for we beleeved her not false enough to corrupt our best friends, and to provide Goales and tortures for us where we came to seeke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and protection. Yes great Queene, we came into this Kingdome to finde a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary against fortune, and have heere some helpes against our enemies. I name not these considerations, to wooe your pity, nor doe we love life so well to preserve it by wiles. You have commanded me to say who I am, I will obey you, and by that obedience make you confesse, that fortune is yet a more cruell enemy then I have spoake her.</p>
               <p>I he City of Cusco claimes my birth; I am honored by being descended from the race of the Sun, and to be Grandchilde to the coelestiall Mango Capa. If since the death of the great Guina Capa you have beene pleased to heare related the misfortunes that followed the losse of that Prince and your incomparable Daughter, I doubt not but you have heard of the name of Alisma. The Queene much moved at that name; how said she, are you that Alisma who called your selfe the Avenger of the royall blood of the Incas, and that have beene thought dead above twelve yeeres? I am the same (answered Alisma) and owe the honour of seeing you to the valour of that Prince (in so saying he shewed my deare Master) who after many yeeres of fearefull slavery gave me at once both my life and liberty. The Queene unable to suppresse the perplexity wherein she was: Must I (cried she) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After this, she commanded Alisma to kneele againe, and Zelmatida to arise and answer in his turne; and did it of purpose to see whether in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him she might not save the other. Zelmatida arose, and standing fixed, lifted his eyes to behold the Princesse: She gazed on him as earnestly, and presently striking her hands together; O gods (cried she) is it not an Apparition I see? Certainely I have either lost the remembrance of my Daughters face, or this is the same she had when I delivered her into the possession of Guina Capa. After this exclamation, she held her peace, and kept her eyes long fixed on my deare Master. Atlast, not longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Those words caused a great confusion in the Assembly, but Telesmana imposing silence, commanded my deare Master to tell her who he was. Great Queene (said he) you enjoyne me that which the unfortunatenesse of my birth permits me not to give you satisfaction in. To this present, hath it beene to me impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to know my Parents or my Country. This worthy King whose justice and integrity makes him beloved even of the most impious, the incomparable Quasmez (I say) whom you have beleaguered (pardon me if I say without any just cans<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Heere Zelmatida held his peace, and expected without any shew of feare what Telismana would pronounce touching his life. But the Queene had not then time for

it, a suddaine noise of trumpets and other instruments wherewith the Amazons heartned themselves for fight, being heard through all the Campe. The shouts and tumlts of those warriours joinde with the noise of the trumpets gave not over, till the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of those rejoycings were come into Telesmana's Tent. They put us on one side of her Throne, and presently we saw enter Quasmez Embassadors. They observed all those ceremonies used in such Audiences, and came with a gravity mixed with respect to the Queen's Throne. She stood up to receive them, and witnessed by her actions that she was full of contentment but that it was accompanied with some disquiet. By chance, the chiefe of the Embassadors casting his eyes on Zelmatida, was seised on with an ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

His desire not to be long in doubt of a thing that was to him of so great consequence, made him gaze on the Lord my Inca with as much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestnesse as he could. Now, he looked on him; then cast his eyes on Telesmana as if he would aske who her prisoner was, and then back againe on him, and doubting no more but that it was Zelmatida: Great Queene (said he to Telesmana) the gods the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The spectators of eyther sex made resound againe their joy and wonder, and her Pallace was all in rejoycings and confusion, such as I thinke the History of all ages cannot give us an accident comparable with it. The Queene, when the tumult was over (entertayning the while Zelmatida particularly) sent to command every one to take his place, and when all were ranged, she went againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her Throne, and pronounced these words aloude: The supposed death of the great Guina Capaes lawfull Heire, wrought by the malice of men, wonne me not only to make a lawe which condemned to death all men that fell into my hands, but likewise to denounce a warre against the King Quasmez, my brother and ancient Ally. But this finding againe my sonne by the helpe of men, I will; That lawe be for ever abolished, and putting a period to the war I undertooke, I acknowledge my selfe answerable to Quasmez, and give him most particular thanks for so charitably gathering together the remainder of my desolate house.</p>
               <p>When she had thus made knowne her will, she descended from her Throne, and taking Zelmatida by the hand, gave Alisma and my selfe the best entertainment we could wish; Quasmez Embassadours, ravished with so incredible and such an unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted revolution of businesse, did their complements to Zelmatida, as to the rightfull successour of the Incaes; and besought Telesmana that she would be pleased they might send their Master these good news. I my selfe (said he) will be the Messenger of our common happinesse; let therefore some one of you returne to Quasmez, and without giving him intelligence of what hath happened, tell him that I am on the way to visite him. The youngest of the Embassadours had that Commission, and presently departed to put it in execution: A little after the Queene went out of her Campe, holding Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida by the one hand, and Alisma by the other. Quasmez Embassadours were on each side of her, and the Queenes guard crowned with chaplets of flowres, encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that illustrious company. In this manner we marched to the gates of the City, where Quasmez expected us, and in the incertainty he was, failed not of that extreme quietnes of minde, which even the most miserable find in the testimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and firme confidence every one ought to have in the goodnesse of the gods. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesmana at her comming to him, presented Zelmatida, and after their salute; See (said she) the cause of the warre and the cause of peace. See what hath made me take up armes, and that which hath made me lay them downe. I know just and charitable Quasmez that Zelmatida is my sonne as well as yours; and if your love and care have made you taken for his Father, blood and nature oblige me to declare my selfe his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Let it suffice, I tell you the Queene of the Amazons was a moneth with Quasmez, and after she had witnessed to him an extreame resentment for those obligations she was bound to him in the behalfe of Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida, she with a royall pompe and convoy tooke thence the body of the Queene he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida, who followed her by Quasmez appointment, after two daies stay in that town was importuned by Alisma, to goe to the Caverne of the Javelyn. He consented and we three parted thence with our ordinary servants, beginning that journey, which the generous old man had beene so long desired. We travelled night and day, and tooke but little rest till we came to the Cave that concealed so many marvels. We found not the entry so easy as Alisma had told us, but contrarily, as soone as we came neere it, were set on by a great Troop of Quitonians, who by their howlings &amp; enraged actions signified an extreame apprehension of our arivall. Zelmatida, making use of the good Sword I gave him at Calcicoëca (which the Amazons had restored to him) slew so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those desperate people that what he did even passeth all likelyhood.

Yet at last he got it, but he was much astonished when he returned to Zelmatida and sawe him busied in delivering a Prisoner. He ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the man, and presently letting fall the Iavelin out of his hand, cryed out, am I asleepe, or doe I wake? Is this a truth or a illusion that I see? my Lord, my deare Lord, is it your selfe or your shadowe? doe you know your Alisma, or wot you who tis that vndoes your bonds? Zelmatida was about to ask Alisma the reason of his asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: when said the Prisoner takeing the generous old man by the hand, tis even I Alisma, who after so long imprisonment and a hundred times escaping the death prepared for me, see my selfe freed by the valour of this brave yong man. Doe you live then my Lord, replyed Alisma? Have you escaped the rage of your enemies? Have the Gods preserved you among so many Executioners? shall I beleeve it? Yes, O, yee just Gods I will, said he, falling on his knees, and acknowledging more and more that your incomprehensible providence governes by unknowne meanes the accidents of the worlde. I will employ all the remaynder of my life in publishing your miracles, and give you worthy actions of praise and thankes by continuall sacrifices. This said, he arose, and turning to the Prisoner, see (said he) your sonne, shewing him Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida and speakeing to Zelmatida, Behold your father, the greate Guina Capa, to whom you owe your royall extraction. Thinke if you please with how many admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and transports this knowledge was followed. Guina Capa on the suddaine beleved not a thing so incredible, but in spite of all reasons that kept him from it, he felt in himselfe, that he was obliged by the solicitations and tendernesse of nature to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Zelmatida for his sonne. The Prince rejoycing at the life and liberty of the King his father, kneeled downe, beseeching him the permission to kisse his hands, tolde him that he asked the Gods no more, since they had granted him that thing which of all else in the world he had most earnestly prayed for. Guina Capa holding Zelmatida be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his armes, witnessed how much he loved him; and Alisma presently stepped and presented to the hands of that great King the Iavelin he had formerly given him. Guina Capa tooke it, and withall told him, that the Gods who deprived him of one Empire were too just not to bestow on him a greater. And with this he tooke Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida and leaning on him went out of his prison by the way that the yong Princesse had made him with the hazard of his life. Some of the Amazons knew him, and giving him what belonged to his quality, deputed foure from among them to carry this strange newes to Telesmana. Those runners went thence and with an extreame diligence came to Quito. When they had intimated to their Queene that Guina Capa was living, they did what they could to make her beleeve it, but she would not, but rather imagined that twas some Impostor, who deluding Alisma by some resemblance he had with Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Capa, made himselfe to be so taken indeede. But when he came she was forced to change her opinion, and to acknowledg him for the true Guina Capa. Whilest she was in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e excesse of her joy and wonder, one of those who passe for Prophets among the Quitonians came before her, and desiring audience: You see (said he) great Queene, the invincible Guina Capa: the credit which I have with the Quitonians, and the threats that I have used to them on the part of the gods, in case they enterprised any thing against the life of that Prince, have compelled them (spite of their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect him, and not to hearken to that barbarous fury which sollicited them to put him to death. He himselfe shall beare witnesse to what I say, and assure you, that excepting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54727:55"/>
the displeasures of his long captivity, he hath received no ill treatment from the Quito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. Guina Capa confirmed what the Priest said, and related to the Queene all the hazards he had run. Telesmana made him a recitall of Zelmatida's adventures, and by what meanes she came to knowe him. Alisma interrupted this discourse, and besought the King his Master to tell him, if since his imprisonment, he had never seene any of his owne Subjects. Only you (answered the King) and if you can remember it, twas I that bid you farewell when you fell into the Caverne which hath so long time beene my Prison. I would faine have perswaded my selfe to beleeve it, answered the generous old man, but the assurance I had that you were not among the living, made me reject that phansie as often as it was presented. Prais'd for it be the Gods! and thou also O <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Quitonian Prophet added more matter to Alisma's dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>se; and discovering secrets to come, there remaines (said he) yet a misfortune that must shortly afflict these Princes; but if it can be quelled, the Empire of the Incas shall be more flourishing then ever, and the Reigne of Guina Capa become a Reigne full of glory and happinesse.</p>
               <p>Telesmana, Guina Capa, and Zelmatida receiving in appearance nought of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction but that which was advantagious to them, abode at Quito many moneths. Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were sent to Cusco, and others to the King Quasmez. In the meane time, the rest of the Quitonians wonne by their Priest, came voluntarily and threw them at the feet of Guina Capa and intreated pardon for their revolts. The King, the most good and mercifull that ever was, forgot what was passed; and tooke nothing so much into his consideration as the reparation of the ruines of Quito, and to make happy the Quitoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Telesmana would not leave that Prince, till the Troopes which he had sent for from his Kingdome were arrived. All that time passed in playes, feasts, and other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.</p>
               <p>Tis true that two remarkable afflictions interrupted the publique joy. The first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the funerall pompe wherewith Guina Capa conducted the body of the Queene his wife into the stately Temple of Quito: and the other arose from the death of the good Alisma. That faithfull servant seeing the happy successe of his Masters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, received thence so violent and extraordinary transports, that they might say the excesse of his joy consumed the little strength that remained in his body worne out with the travells of warre and his long imprisonment. He fell sick, and without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparent cause, was neere a moneth in losing the functions of life one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Guina Capa and Zelmatida asisted him as their Father, and ran the hazard of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him, so great a feeling had they of his losse. These causes of sorrow being past over, the Father and Son continued their kindnesse they had begun to Telesmana. Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida in the opinion of his Father and Grandmother wanted nothing. But his felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depended not on Crownes. I am compelled to leave the continuance of Guina Capa's adventures, and the marvells that attended his returne to Cusco, to bring again on the stage the violent passion of Zelmatida which I have in a manner buried in the recitall of so many admirable adventures. My deare Master had Isatida alwaies in his thought, and since he left her, never talked with me of any thing but of his hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing her. And for all the delights of Quito, and the great hopes to which he was carried by the King his Father, he endured incredible tortures. He grew desperate for being among those pleasures, and called himselfe coward and traytour for having been capable of any delight in the absence of Isatida. To expiate that crime, He resolved to leave Quito and to throw himselfe into new troubles. They would have me (said he to me one day) go to Cusco, and forgetting Isatida prisoner, take possession of the Throne of the Incas. If I follow this councell I make my selfe unworthy of the honor which the fairest Princesse of the world hath done me, and rightly deserve that the glory of freeing her from prison be for ever taken from me. But my deare Garruca, I will not indure to be dazeled with such false lights; for the charme of worldly greatnesse which troubles weake spirits can doe nothing on a soule that is full with those of Isatida, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting

to me thus his resolution, he prepared to be gone, and that Guina Capa and Telesmana should give way to it, represented to them that without ingratitude, he could not stay longer from giving thankes to Quasmez for so many favours he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him. Telesmana could not approve of that journey, but Guina Capa who hath the same generosity and thoughts with his Son, gave him the permission he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and with a great equipage sent him to Quasmez Court. Zelmatida was received there not only as the Son of a great King, but as the only Son of Quasmez. The joy for his returne was generall, and the good Quasmez with the Queene his wife, seemed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But he that found himselfe guilty of the displeasure which those good Princes would not make him any shew of; one day, thus spoake to them: I know whereto your affection and my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bindes me. I owe you my life and my fortune. Beleeve not that I am so wicked as to forget that I likewise owe you the Princesse Xaira. Thereupon he recounted to them all that he had done at Mexico; and after that long discourse, know (said he) that I am going presently to free that Princ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Quasmez and the Queene did their utmost to divert him from so perillous a journey: But Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida falling at their feet, either (said he) take from me the life you have preserved, or permit me not to respect it as a continuall race of cowardise and ingratitude. No, no, Zelmatida must perish, or Xaira must be set at liberty. The day after this, he tooke leave of the two amiable Princes, and without any other company save Bereamis, some slaves, and my selfe, marched right to Mexico. Whilst he was on the way, he continued in so ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>raordinary a melancholy that it began to be troublesome to me. But twas soone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowne to be the presage of my deare Masters eternall affliction. As soone as we came to the Frontires of Mexico, we so disguised our selves that we could not be knowne, and so kept on the most unfortunate and saddest journey that shall ever be made. We were all so disconsolate, that it seemed we were going to execution. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida had disquiets which tooke away his strength of travelling, yet would he never stay. He wept every moment and sometimes being recalled from his musings by the redoubling of his griefes: Isatida (cried he, pitifully) how doe I feare the malice of those who have alwaies envied your virtue and my happinesse! The neerer I come to the place where you should be, the more my affrights and afflictions are augmented. If nothing most dismall had betided; the hope I have to see you, had not beene crossed by those feares and horrors which inviron me. His sighes often tooke away his meanes of speech, and the dispaire to which he had given himselfe over, failed little, oftentimes of killing him by the way. At last he came to Mexico, and understood as soone as we were entred, that all the Court was in mourning for the death of Isatida. What became of the King thinke you at this sad newes? It happened not to him that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all men which are surprised by an unexpected accident. He caused not the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that frightfull newes to repeate the name of Isatida, nor did he aske him whereof she died. But on the contrary, in lieu of questioning or complaining, on the instant his sighes, teares, and wonted griefes stopped. He gazed on us with his eyes open, and wandring and at the same time, his excesse of sorrow becomming absolute Master of his senses, there was left him nothing of all the functions of life, but that which during a long swounding gives a little signe that the party is not yet dead. After, what we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied had recovered him, he commanded me to goe through the Towne to learne of what sicknesse Isatida died; and intreated me that in acknowledgement of that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he bore me, I would be able to give him an accompt of all that he should aske me touching that dismall occasion. I left him with Bereamis, and went to get intelligence of a thing that was already but too much knowne to me. By chance I met with a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier; and growing acquainted with him, I began to set him on discourse of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse death, and he told me all the particulars. Presently I returned to Zelmatida, and assured him that nothing had passed in the death of Isatida but what was common to all. That she had beene but a while sick, that after her death, she had beene enclosed in the stately Tombe of the Kings of Mexico which is in the great Temple of Vacipala. That her losse had beene generally lamented; and that Montezuma and Hismalita, came ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly from Mexico to Vacipala to the Funerall of the Princesse. What hence forward
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54727:56"/>
hast thou to doe in the world miserable, Zelmatida cryed the King? Die now as one desperate, coward and disloyall as thou art, since thou hadst not the heart to expire as an honest man. But if thou be not altogether ignoble, leave not unpunished the death of the most accomplished Princesse of the world. Avenge that Innocent whom thou hast murthered. Cover Mexico with men of armes; and by a generall desolation, make that great King nothing but Isatidaes Sepulchre.

effect that which doubtlesly some houres shall or at least some dayes which you will needs add to my miserable life. I made no answer at all; but Bereamis, representing the wrong he would doe his reputation to kill himself, in lieu of resolving on a revenge worthy himselfe and his Mistris, knew so well to make him waver by so many different reasons, that he wonne him, and brought him out of the Temple. When we were returned to our lodging, and that we saw him fit to heare us, we strove to lenify his afflictions, and a little to divert his cogitations, intended to get him to depart the next day. But when we proposed it to him, he forbad us to speake of it, and was eight daies intire, to hearken after nothing but his griefes, and to doe nought else but moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten with his teares, the gold and pretious stones on Isatidaes tombe. At last over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by our importunities he resolved to be gone. Yet upon this condition that wee should not speake to him either of Kingdomes, nor of warre, nor other matters that might divert his sorrow; and wee on the contrary told him, that he could not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently lament his losse, and so by little and little flattering his affliction, wee tooke of all that it had most dangerous and made us capable to be hearkned to. From Vacipala e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Port where in coming from Cuba we had left our vessell wee had none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discourse but of Isatida. Zelmatida recounted to us all the Graces she had living; then told us the charms of her conversation &amp; anon the vivacity of her wit. He extolled the knowledge she had in what ever was good, and forgot nothing of all that which might make her to be beleeved for more then mortal. At last after we had long traveled with much affliction wee came to the Port I last spoke of. Our Mariners ravished with joy to see us after so long absence, ran to salute Zelmatida, &amp; to expresse their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, but he looked on them as strangers, nay even as enemies, and could scarce abide the prayers they made for his preservation. He went aboord, and entred into the same Cabine wherein Bajazet first saw him. I acquainted the Mariners in few words with all that which had befalne us, and then went to Zelmatida to know what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Let's be gone (said he) and lose our selves farre enough from a World where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I finde nothing but new causes of despayre. Let us fly from the unfortunate Quasmez, from the happy Guina Capa, and never more see those that may hereafter give us a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of consolation. In a word let us seeke out death. I perceived by his speeches that to irritate his melancholly was to lose him. I therefore commanded my Mariners to steere for the Island of Hayty, and did it of purpose to finde amongst the Spanyards some diversion that might be sufficient to cure the despayre. of my Master. In the meane while I was still with him, and intended for feare of offending not to speake a word, but when he should command me.</p>
               <p>Our shippe was no sooner in full Sea but the winde shifted and made the Saylors feare a great Tempest: For, how could our voyage be happy, when the good fortune of my Lord the Inca forsooke him at his comming forth of Quito? It continued foule all night, and the day following we lost sight of land; and our Martiners, now no more Masters, abandoned the shippe to the mercy of the Sea. The king was insensible of whatsoever was spoke to him. But when one told him that we were certainly like to perish, and that there was no more hope of safety; I aske nought else (said he) and am where I have long wished me; the only thing that grieves me in this accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my desires, is to see that so many honest men had rather perish then to forsake so miserable a wretch as I. Those words drew teares from the most insensible of our Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors; and we all told him with one voyce, that we thought our selves too happy to be in such an estate as not to survive so good a Master. If my Soule (said he) were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving a new affliction, your love and friendshippe would redouble my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre. Whilest we were thus talking, our vessell was sometime driven towards the East, and then to the South. At last the Tempest ceasing, and our Mariners perceiving themselves in that fearefull extent of Sea which separates the old World from the new, came and told me that they were not farre off from Cape Vert; and that it be hooved us, to try to land there. They had already fitted their sailes for it, when they descryed Bajazets fleete, and being afraid of that encounter, steered for the Canaries, yet were we assayled as you have eyther seene or heard, and forced to yeeld; not so much by the courage of our vanquishers, as by the shew of Zelmatidaes obstinacy not to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54727:57"/>
At this word, Gurruca speaking more softely: a see (said he) to the Princes the principall part of our Kings adventures. I have passed by many excellent particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and clouded the raies of his heroicall life, by my simple relation, but you are enough cleere sighted to discover the splendour of his actions through the obscurity of my lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. This accomplisht Favourite, ending in this manner his relation, left Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Iphidamantus, Bajazez, and Alcidiana's slave, in an admiration so great, that they could no otherwise expresse it but by their silence.</p>
               <p>They then arose, and went to finde Zelmatida, who was still walking on the terras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Castle. They heard him complaining, and now and then invoking the name of Isatida. I live (said he) and thou art dead. O weake and traytrous Zelmatida I How long wilt thou be a faith-breaker? Polexander came first to him, and witnessing to him the part he tooke in his grievances, and the admiration of his whole life: Doe not suffer (cried he) your sorrow to governe you so absolutely that it makes you forget what you owe to the memory of Isatida. Tis fit that Mexico should know by her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ruine, rather then by that of her enemies, how much Zelmatida is to be feared. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine then by a vengeance, that should last as long as your selfe, a passion eternall, and give to the prophesies of your Prophet an explication worthy the virtues of Isati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. Bajazet and Iphidamantus, who were of the same opinion, advised to the same purpose; and amongst the praises they gave Zelamtida, did all they could to winne him from despairing of Isatida's life. The chances of the world (said Iphidamantus to him,) have such strange revolutions, that every day our feares are as much deluded as our hopes; and I know by mine owne proper adventures, that we accuse the heavens for the death of those we love, whilst yet their goodnesse is doing miracles for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their lives. Fortune is thus pleased to crosse our contentments, and to play with that false providence whereby we would imitate the Sages. Zelmatida comming from his musings at the discourse of the Princes, yet replied to it as little as if he had not understood them; but answering his owne thoughts: Yet I live (said he) and my co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize hath made me criminall, that all the Mexicans deaths with mine owne cannot expiate my last faultes. But whither doe my vaine imaginations carry me? Must I yet thinke on the world? I, who came into it but only to dye, and who endure life, as a long and violent torture, to which the justice of heaven hath condemned me, at that very instant when I tooke a resolution to leave Isatida. These discouses had beene se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by many more, and the sad thoughts which these infortunate Lovers communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to one another, by an amorous infection, had furnished them with new matter of entertainement, but that a furious winde arising, threatned them with one of those tempests to which all the Coasts of Africa and the neighbouring Isles seemed particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to be condemned. This tempest accompanied with lightning and thunder, took soone from the Princes the sight of the heaven and the starres. The aire seemed all on fire. The sea carrying his waves even to the places where the thunders framed, strove to quench the flames. The shores roared, and the Isle it selfe trembling under the feet of her Inhabitants, seemed to breake those eternall bonds which had fastned it to the Center of the earth, and would by her flight steale from the fury of that conflagration. In effect, they saw fire fall from heaven in divers parts of the Island, but the raigne as suddainely following it, smothered the ill in its birth. Our foure Lovers having far o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enemies to contest with then the toilsomnesse and varieties of that Climat, retired to their chambers, and having no other witnesses of their actions but themselves, gave their griefs all the liberty that constraint and civility had tyrannically taken from them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Olexander seeing his intention crossed by the violence of the tempest, could not sleepe all night. He accused innocent things for the ill which his passion made him suffer; and imputing the ordinary agitations of the windes and the sea to the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Fortune, perswaded himselfe that Nature and Heaven, Demons and men, looked on him as their common enemy. He threw even on Alcidiana's a version the cause of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and ascribing to her by an amorous Idolatry, that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power which is reserved to the Divinity: I feele (cride he oftentimes) I feele faire Queene the effects of your anger. The Elements who are no lesse sensible then men, search out occasions to please you, and affect the glory of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your servants. They are armed to destroy me. They are affrighted with the threats of your declaration; and looking on me as a traytor pursu'd by your justice, they feare least that in favouring me, they may become my Confederates. At that word he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred he had lodged Alcidiana's slave in his chamber, and that thought smothered the rest of his complaints. But the generous slave beginning: Leave (said he) your complaining on Alcidiana and Fortune. They seeme to be your enemies, but I doubt not, at the last, they will discover what they have concealed, and declare themselves for you. I know some things which in spite of your scruples, all your distrusts, and all the conceipts touching your selfe, shall be able to comfort you. I expected wee should have gone from this Island, to have acquainted you with them: But if the storme compells us to stay, I will relate to you some particularities which have never come out of my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse Cabinet, and which are not knowne but to her selfe, Amalthea, and Me. Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, that could hope for nothing, answered the faire slave, as if he had doubted the truth of what he spoke; and beginning to him a long recitall of all the misfortunes had betided him, strove to perswade him that he was only borne but to be miserable. The slave harkned to all these adventures with an extreame attention, and answered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with so much judgment, that he brought Polexander to doubt of some things, which till that time he held most veritable, and certaine. Whilst these two different slaves thus entertained themselves, the day broake, and with the day the tempest redoubled. But the bad weather could not hinder the Rovers to come out of their Quarters, and assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at the entry of the Fort to invite Bajazet to the dividing of the booty. He came from his chamber, and thinking not that what he went about worth the paines of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertising his Guests; came where he was expected. As soone as he was in place where his Army might hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e him, he spake thus: This is the day my companions that you shall receive a part of that which your valour and industry have deserved. Nothing shall be partaged by authority or favour. Every one shall have that which by justice he can hope
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54727:58"/>
for; the priviledges shall be considered. Therefore who ere hath any just pretentions let him present himselfe without raysing any tumult, and make them knowne to those who are appointed for their Examination.</p>
               <p>After he had left all the Piratts in this pleasing expectation, and ordayned sixe of the eldest, to receive their petitions, and inquire the merit of those that presented them, he went with the rest of the Captaines right to the Magazines. By the way he met Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus, and stopping to give him the complement, asked him whether he had so much curiosiy as to see the Magazines, and the riches which his valour had given them. Iphidamantus answering this civilitie with his accustomed sweetnesse, told Bajazet that he would waite on him. They went then to the storehouses, and wondred to see so much treasure: Those that kept it presenting the Inventory to Bajazet, did not only cause his wonder to redouble, but made every one that heard it read, beleeve himselfe more rich then all the Princes of Africa. Presently Bajazet called a Councell, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve in what manner they might preserve the value of so many rarities, without discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting the Souldier, or losing the most part of so fayre Jewels. All those of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell being of divers opinious, at last stuck to the opinion of Bajazet; which was, that they should take out of the old Treasure and the new. all that they could finde or money coyned to divide it among the Souldiers, and if that were not sufficient, they might add to it some Ingotts of gold and silver, that they might have cause to confesse that they had given them more then they ought to have promised themselves. Bajazet, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so generall a consent in the Captaines, and desirous besides to signify to Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, the esteeme that he would all should have of his courage, arose, and taking his friend by the hand, spake thus to all the Assembly: Tis at this time my Companions that we joyntly acquit our selves of a part of the debt we owe this valiant Christian. You have divers times already solicited me to give him that liberty which he hath so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously deserved. I approve of your justice, and am of opinion that it be done as soone as possibly may be. But to accompany that action with some thing illustrious, let us give him some considerable Present, to make appeare to him that we make a far greater esteeme of men of valour then of great riches; and may be by that meanes we may so winne him, that he will have no desire to forsake us. This generosity. being approved in apparence by all them that heard it: Bajazet arose to goe chuse amongst all that was rarest amongst the treasure, some piece worthy of his liberality and Iphidamantes vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Scarce had he gone two steps, but he was staied short by the insolence of one of the Assistants. Thalemut an old and valiant Pirat, but the most brutish and insuportable of all those that beleved not God and feared not man, was the cause of this tumult. Long before this time had the beauty of Iphidamantus bred abhominable thoughts in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell; and that prodigious affection breeding in him a jealousy of Baiazet, he durst not t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>w that his Generall amplified too much, as he list Iphidamantus merits, and made shew of an extraordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ffection to have presents presented: he was not able to containe himselfe, nor to give bounds to his fury, he therefore came streight to Baiazet, his mouch even foming, and his eyes on fire: and art thou not content (said he) putting his hand on his Cimiter to robb us of this slaves ransom? But that thou wilt have us pay for thy infamous actions with that which we have gotten by the expence of our lives? If thou be so amorous of this womanish fare, buy his honour with that which is thine owne: and doe not I know not under what vaile of feigned noblenesse, make the salary of a prostitute to be inroled with the reward of so many valiant men: At that word Baiazet wholy transported from himselfe, and Iphidamantus unwilling to live longer then to be avenged, set hands to their Swords never considering into what danger the credit which Thalemut had with his companions might throw them. Never saw ye two men equally offended, run more alike to be revenged. The one would prevent the other; and each beleved that how great soever the reparation of this iniury might be, yet it could not be satisfactory unlesse it were done by his owne hand. On the other side Thalemut threatned aloud, and seing the dispute of those two valiant men, gave him time to doe any thing collected from the silence and coldnesse of his companions an assurance that his boldnesse pleased them. These two occasions
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54727:59"/>
swelling him in pride, gave him the daring to strike a blow with his Scimiter at Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers head, and with such a violence, that without heavens particular providence, they had seen expire by an infamous weapon, one of the most glorious lives of the world. Bai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Will you be this Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians second? Whilst he spoke thus, more then twenty or thirty of his Captaines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose themselves betwixt him and Thalemut.</p>
               <p>When hee saw they went about to pacify him, in few words hee made knowen his just griefe to them, and by his eloquence thought to obtayne the liberty of avenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe on his Enemy. And in that impatiency he was (not enduring the excuses wherewith the pirates would have moderated his anger) tis in vaine said he, (I will hearken to no consideration to the preiudice of mine honour, since my interest can win nothing on you. I command by the oath of fidelity you have made me, by the respect you owe to my place, and by the fresh memory of those victories I have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten you, that you will not suffer me to live wronged. Next if there remaine in you any desire of your owne preservation, get you from before me, and keeping off this Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that cannot be else so by reason, make your selves not guilty of a crime whereof you are yet innocent.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he ended these words, but those Barbarians stood astonished, and instead of continuing their requests, grew silent, and gave him way. And Iphadamantus (without any unjust obstination) unable to take from his frend the liberty of doing what he resolved, put off his revenge to another time, and somewhat retyred with all the Pyrats that were about him. The roome where this disorder happened was so spatious that it was fit enough for fight. You might have seene all the spectators playstered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the walls, and as unmoveable and affrighted, stood impatiently expecting the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of so important a quarrell. Thalemut was at one end of the Hall, and Bajazet at the other. They ranne at one another. Bajazet, his Cymeter in his hand, prevented that abhominable Corsary, and bore him a blow that in all likelyhood should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft his life. The resolute Pyrat put it by, and threw himselfe on Bajazet, with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that made Iphidamantus feare the successe of the combat. Tis true, if Bajazet would have beene carefull of himselfe, he had not runne any great hazard, but lying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen with his body at all times, the sooner to decide the difference, he could not avoide a great wound, which Thalemut gave him on his right side. We are to judge equally of all things, there was a proportion in these two courages; but despayre had reduced Thalemut to sell his life at a high rate, and Bajazet, to take a way the cause of a new se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by the death of his Enemy, threw himselfe on headlong. Let none any more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the Poets for inventing so strange blowes that their falsitie is visible; I dare say that in this combat was seene one so prodigious, that the history being very true and very scrupulous hath made me fearefull to leave it to posterity. Yet tis most certaine that Bajazet gave Thalemut such a back-blowe with his Cymiter, that taking him on the right side, he almost cut him in two, as if he would have sought for his revenge even in the heart of his enemy, and follow into his Center the abhominable bruitishnesse of that Monster. The fearefull sight of so great a blowe, comming from ae man extreamly wounded seazed on the harts of all those Barbarians, and confirmed them in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had: that Bajazet was somewhat more invincible then the rest of men. And in lieu of fearing the like handling and by consequence wishing no good to the Author; they never shewed more affection to the Vanquisher then at that time, norlesse sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the party overcome. With one voice they proclamed Thalemut guilty, and by usuall formes of their justice presently attainting and condemning him of treason and felony, adjudge him dead as he was, to have his head cut off, and to be placed in the number of those that were set as incorruptible guards at the entry of the Fortresse. Bajazet the meane while not able any longer to resist the weakenesse caused by his so much l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Prince thought him dead; and transported with his friendship, spake words sufficient to have caused him to be murthered by the Pirats. They yet with mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring let him alone, and seeing Polexander &amp; Zelmatida haste thither went to meet them

as to cleare themselves, from the death of Bajazet. Those Heroës witnessing no such an occasion, their sweetnesse of nature as well as the height of their soules, tooke their friend, themselves, and assisted by Alcidiana's slaves, Garruca and Bereamis carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him into his chamber. Polexander, afterwards taking his brother aside, inquired how this mischance betided; but Iphidamantus dissolved in teares; and could give Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander no other information of the businesse but what he could get by his sorrowes and sighes. At last, perceiving how much it afflicted his brother; he forced himselfe, and told him in few words the cause of the combate betweene Baj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>r him to be lost since wee have yet time enough to save him. Polexander reserving to himselfe those resolutions he had taken to avenge the death of his friend intreated his brother to make use of all his credit he had with the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates to assist Bajazet, and not leave him to the mercy of those Barbarians, who (may be) would be glad to be rid of him. That Prince had an excellent Chyrurgion with him, called Diceus, who twice or thrice by his art and remedies had saved his life. On his care, he beleeved he might intrust the life of his friend, and therefore called him, and signifying the feare he was in for the helpe of Bajazet, commanded him to looke on his woundes, and to neglect nothing that might be available for his recovery.</p>
               <p>Diceus expected no second command. He unclad Bajazet, and by the helpe of other Chyrurgions laid him on a bed. The greatnesse of his woundes much amazed them; yet unwilling to make shew of what they conceived, they stanched his bloud, and did it with the promptitude that was admited by all them that were present. Though this lessing of paine was very great, yet was it not enough to bring Bajazet from his fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. He came not to himselfe till two or three houres after his first dressing; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening beginning to know those that were about him, amongst others, he knew the three Princes. He would willingly have used his accustomed civilities, but Diceus forbad him to speake, and intreated his friends to retire, for feare that in their desire of comforting him, they might aggravate his malady. The first night passed in feare and disquiet and the two daies following gave no lesse sorrow to the Cortaries, then to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander and the two other Princes. The third day Bajazet rather chusing to dye then not to see his friends, intreated Diceus that they might come to him. To give him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, Diceus promised to send for them on condition that he spoke not at all or at most but five or six words. The Princes who were (in one) next to Bajazets chamber, to the intent to see what passed, went to see him as soone as they thought by Diceus order, they might fitly doe it. Scarce had Bajazet seene them, but that he expressed a joy not to be hoped for from a man so sick and wounded, and intreating Polexander to come neere, spoke to him a pretty while in his eare, after which, he raised his voice, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to excuse himselfe to Zelmatida, but the Prince unwilling to give him that time, he held his peace, and a while thence calling by their names five or six of the principall Rovers that were come to visit him, he spake to them in this manner: My Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, since in the estate I am, I cannot promise to serve you any more, I have entreated Polexander not to forsake you. You cannot doubt of his courage nor experience. The only thing you are to feare is that he loves you not enough. But be assured of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. He hath promised me to doe in all as my selfe, if he find that his government please you. Make your selves worthy of a protection far more powerfull then mine, and be confident, that you will have no cause to lament my death. But (said he) turning to Polexander, I yet aske you one favour, and tis, that you will let me know in what case I am, and be not so cruell under the shadow of pity to let me dye without setling my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. I have such things in my minde that the rest I expect in the other life depends ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely on them; and I protest as being ready to give up my soule, that if I dye without time to discharge my selfe of one thing I never yet told, I shall dye desperate. There hapned then in the persons of those Pirates, a novelty that their nature might make passe for a prodigy. They were moved to pity, and as if from wild beasts which they were wont to be, they had beene suddainely turned to men, they felt themselves sensible of griefe, and wept in beholding the constancy of Bajazet.

this sad newes in the Army, and knew to paint it to the Souldiers in such lively colours, that the desire of booty, was neither their only nor the strongest passion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they found themselves capable. Their shouts of joy were changed into lamentations, their laughter into teares, and the hopes of their safety being on the suddaine utterly extinct, they were strucken with the apprehension of a thousand different tortures. Yet, since it was the custome during the sicknesse of their Generalls, that the Pirates incam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and abode day and night in a body of an Army, they stirred not from the place where Bajazet had left them in going to the Magazins. Notwithstanding to give them some refreshing during so long a toile, it was advised to execute all that Bajazet had appointed. Tis true that the largesse was a great ease to their sorrow, and brought them to themselves by the greatnesse of the present liberality, and promise of a second that should surpasse the first.

Yet as weake and pained as he was, it was but little more perceived then in the Princes. They were so cast downe with griefe and feare, that it was hard to be judged who was the sickest, of them or Bajazet. When they were about to take open the greatest tent, there was not a man in the chamber, whose feare gave him not seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conjectures, though they were all sad ones and deadly. The Chyrurgions were not the last that doubted of the vertue of their remedies, and power of their art, since Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet had had withall a Fever above thirty houres. They already heard him talke idely, and now and then sigh and lament: Sometimes he seemed to threaten, and then that he tooke leave with a great deale of sorrow from some one whom he called his soule and his life. By reason of this they du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet they gave not over to finish what they had begun, and when twas done, neere all the Chyrurgions confessed that they had seene signes of a dangerous wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t if bsides the Fever, there happened not some other thing, he promised himselfe to save Bajazet. Whilst every one according to his severall passion, was of the one or the others minde, the wounded man came out of his swound, and began to sigh so often that they well judged some great thing afflicted him. As soone as they saw him well come to himselfe, they gave him something to strengthen him, and perceiving he had a minde to speake every one retired to take from him that desire. All the night passed in this manner, and the next day till evening they thought he would have dyed. He knew it well enough and fearing least death might prevent him, commanded paper and incke to be brought. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida and Polexander intreated him, and the Chyrurgions threatned, to divert him from those strainings which they foresaw he must undergoe if he began to write. But neither of them could doe any thing. There was no remedy but to give him what he called for; but he had not writ above two or three lines, but the extreame pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He grew setled againe and resolute to what he had undertaken, and making a little Roll of the paper in which he had writ, drew from under his shirt a Picture boxe that was enamelled with green, incarnation, and white. As soone as he had opened the boxe, his strength failed, the cover fell out of his hand wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Iphidamantus was the first hat ran to him; who putting his arme under Bajazets head for ease, saw the Picture in the box. The sight had almost done him as much hurt, as to Bajazet. He made shew of a great alteration, retired two or three paces, changed co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and as if he was become Bajazets enemy, had no more care of his recovery, and was a long while in withdrawing his eyes from that portract. Those that tooke of the novelty, at first wondered: But ignorant of the true cause took Iphidamantus transport for an eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

me beleeve what they see. Bajazet, then opening his eyes as if he had awakened with Iphidamantus words; and comming to himselfe: just heaven (said he) with a dying voice, must it needs be that after you had obliged me in occasions such as I most desired not, you would forsake me in the principall? Permit not, if it be your pleasure, that I perish under the burthen that orewhelmes me! Iphidamantus, as well as Polexander and Zelmatida was deceived in the explication of those words. They tooke them as if Bajazet had a desire to live; but that passion which cannot be praised in a brave cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, was too much contemned by him, to cause thence the least lament in the world. He shewed an anger that his weakenesse had surmounted him at that time, and strove againe to take the little paper, and the cover of the box which he felt in his bed. Faine would he have shut the box, and put in the little Roll he had, but Polexander helped him since Bajazet found himselfe unable to doe it. As soone as he had put backe the box where 'twas wont to be, he cast his eyes on the Princes, and holding his hand out weakely to them; see (said he) how fortune playes with us and our hopes! But what? It is no lesse injustice to complaine of her cruelties, then here is of weakenesse if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her when she smiles. Whilst he spake thus, Diceus was behind Polexander, who intreated him to hinder Bajazet from further talking: Polexander wrought so, that Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet tooke notice of Diceus, and so fitly that it tooke effect. Indeed, the generous sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man apperceiving it, I am still (said he) and so on all hands that your eyes aske my si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Yes my friends, I grant you that favour as I would doe you greater, were I in the same case I was three dayes since. During this sad converse the night came on, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one thought it best to leave Bajazet to his rest. There were no more but the Princes and five or six of Bajazets most affectionate servants that staied neere him, His Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions watched with him till day breake, and thought it fit to take off the second dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Polexander, Iphidamantus, and Zelmatida came in, when they were on that reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, They intreated Bajazet patiently to suffer the paine they might put him too, and assured him he should soone be in far better health. Bajazet only smiled at that discourse, and let the Chyrurgions doe what they pleased. Diceus, himselfe, having seene the dangerous wound, was in as little hope as the rest: And the Princes seeing in what extremity their friend lay, could not so well containe themselves, but that they let fall some teares as often as they turned their eyes on him. He alone was the man least sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of his hurt, and who looked on the dressing of his wound with so great a strength of spirit, that you might have said, he saw some strangers body dressed, or that his owne was impassible. Whosoever came neere him, he presently comforted, and by his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary remonstrances, left them nothing to say that came prepared to resolve him for death. The day ensuing this dangerous night, was no more favourable to him then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After so many ill houres, the fourth and fift dressing gave his friends, the hope they had lost; and Bajazet himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed that he found some kind of ease. He would not lose that good moment, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prayed that instantly some should advertise all his Captaines, that before his death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ose things which were necessary for their common safety, and his particular conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. His command was executed with an extreame diligence, and two houtes after his chamber was full of those old Corsaries, who by their long services, had attained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the charges of the sea and war. Bajazet seeing them about his bed, caused the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to be opened, and shewing to all a constancy that death it selfe was not able to shake, in this manner spoke to them: I have not (my Companions) sent for you to be witnesses of the consent I bring to this inexorable necessity, which wills, that I forsake with the command that you gave me, the felicities I promised my selfe from your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But when a man hath lived some time among you, this vulgar magnanimity loseth the most part of his luster, and wee learne that the contempt of life and death, is but the first essay of courage, to which yet, you beleeve there is due not the meanest praises. I dye then, without telling you, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

on me, I will disclose to you only two, since I cannot bury them with me, without lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that repose which accompanieth the eternity of the second life. The one is the griefe to dye before I had acquitted me of the extraordinary obligations by which you have plucked me from the outrages of fortune, and made me conceive high hopes in the very extremity of my despaire. The other (which not to lye to you would make me wish for a continuation of life, if that wish could preserve me) is, that I dye ingratefull and perjured, and leaving in danger an innocent which my fury hath ingaged, my death makes me guilty of her losse, and throwes on my memory the curses of all faithfull soules. Tis in your power my friends, to free me of these troubles, to hinder the crimes which destiny would have me perpetrate to disengage my faith, to save mine honour, and in briefe that after death, I may live, love and fight. Promise me then, but sweare it to me by the holynesse of your great Prophet, that without any further particular infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of those things wherein I would engage you; You will execute them under the command of Polexander and Iphidamantus. Interrupt me my friends, and give me if you please the last proofe of your generous obedience. Bajazet, could goe no further, the vehemency of his action having exhausted the little strength that was left in him. He was therefore constrained to lye downe againe, and to shut his eyes to stay his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that began to be dissipated. Polexander and his brother that were at his beds head, gave him some ease, and intreated the Pirates by their usuall generosity not to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate longer on so just a request. Bajazet opened his eyes at the speech of those two Heroës, and witnessing by his sighes, how impatiently he waited for the Rovers answer; either hasten (said he) by a favourable blow, that lingering moment that must give an end to my feares and wishes; or graunt me that which I aske you, that so without any despaire I may endure the flownesse of that clocke which must strike the houre of my departure. The Pirates unwilling that their Generall should againe solicit them: at once lifted up their hands for a signe that they accorded to what he requested them. Those that were neerer to him spake for the rest, and told him that God was too just to heare the prayers of Mahomets enemies, and to deprive the Alcoran of so great and so zealous a Defender. Bajazet smiled at these consolations, and though by a little sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the head, he shewed that he could no more abide to be flattered with the hope of life, yet he failed not to thanke them for their wishes, and intreated with a great deale of civility that they would goe take that rest which his being ill had so often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. And in so saying he embraced them all, one after another; and at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, remember (said he) that nothing can dispence with you for that which you have promised me. They swore againe to fullfill it, and for feare of being troublesome to him, went out of his chamber, and retired into their Quarters. Bajazet having none but Polexander, Iphidamantus, and Zelmatida with him, lay sometime regarding them, with eyes that spake better then he could doe, the griefes which the necessity of their seperation brought on him. But perceiving that thought quickly drew teares from his eyes, he left it, and turning to the two brothers: It behooves me (said he) to make a profession of my faith before you, and tell you that the extravagant opinions of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, have never drawne from my soule the beleefe which I sucked with my milke. The holy Abrineias and the vertuous Andromeda have given me thoughts far more pure and unlincked from flesh and blood then are those preached by Mahomet: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that the errors of my youth, and the blindnesse of humane condition hath corrupted that first purity, and to satisfie my sences I have dissembled my faith, and concealed those motions which were expected in my obedience by the just jealousie of a God that would not have our owne interests to be more powerfull then his glory. But without declaring my beleefe more particularly to you, know that I hold with Abrineias, that the true Worshippers are those that adore in spirit and truth that God which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend.</p>
               <p>Let us now come to such things as to me are most considerable next the salvation of my soule. I love passionately (my brothers) I love a beauty so high by her birth, and so miraculous by her vertues, that all that which the feare of the eternall justice can exact from me, is, to leave her, and not to despaire.</p>

the power of an old Tyrant, such persecutions most assuredly makes her wish for death every day that enlightens her. Tis for her deliverance (my deare brothers) that I have taken the boldnesse to engage you without your consent, and to give the Pirats a word which I have not yet received from you. Be pleased not to condemne a liberty that not only shewes how generous I esteeme you, but withall, that I beleeve how since thence alone the wretched have neede of your assistance, it must be inferred that you hold your selves necessarily bound to succour them. I am therefore assured that you will accomplish that wherein I have engaged you. Alcippus, that will shortly bee come back, will informe you of that which my wound and other considerations per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits me not to tell you. I beseech you stay here for him, and when I am dead, take from his mouth the meaning of those things I have written, and inclosed in the boxe you have seene.</p>
               <p>Bajazet felt such a payne in finishing this discourse, that hee gave not leisure to the two brothers to answere to his propositions. Diceus and the other Chyrurgeons ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to him, and seeing no naturall cause for this unexpected accident, told the Princes, that Bajazet's wound was the least of his sicknesse, and that their applications strove in vaine to cure him, since it was growne remedilesse by the agitations and troubles of his minde. Bajazet this while lay on his bed as dead, and had hee not beene reliev'd by remedies more availeable then those of Physick, hee had begun a slumber which should never have ended. The three Princes seeing the Chyrurgians despayre, were brought againe to their Laments and Teares, and staying, as tyde to Bajazet, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to beguile both their knowledge, and even to doubt of what they saw. At last hee came from his swound, but it was with such dreamings and ravings, that the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation produceth, when it hath received some violence. 'Tis sufficient (said hee) not knowing what he said; that your virtue and beauty hath begot my passion: It hath no neede eyther of your consent or complying to preserve it; even that which hath given it being will make it lasting. 'Tis free from the power of time and fortune; and by a prodigie worthy your soveraigne puissance, those effects that usually ruine other affections, serve only to establish and confirme mine. But where are you faire Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse? Barbarous villanes have forced you away, and if the lightning that shootes from her eyes did not by a severe chastisement prevent their abhominable designes, you should be the deplorable prey of their infamous desires. Ah Monsters! come not neere a Miracle which the heavens admire, and nature hath made, to rayse her power above all others. Respect (yee prophane) this visible Divinity! acknowledge the sanctity of the place where you would commit your Sacriledge! and yee abhominable Tyrants, dare you deprive her of liberty that should command the whole World? Hold yee hangmen, or my just fury—At the end of that word; hee would have risen and lifted up his arme, as if hee had beene about to strike; but Polexander, Iphidamantus and Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida held him, and knew by this strange and judicious raving, that the illustrious Corsairy was extraordinarily persecuted by that Tyrant, whose violences they all three felt, almost equally.</p>
               <p>Polexander first spoke, and to settle this troubled minde, sayd, what he thought most powerfull to give a period to its disorders. Bajazet yet lay almost an houre, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well come to himselfe, and shewed by his discourse that hee remembred not what hee had said. He even knew not of his swounding; and beleeving he had slept, excus'd him to the three Princes, that he had given way to the force of sleepe. Those Hercës being extreamly glad to see so violent an agitation followed by so sweete a repose; told him that he had watched long enough to be overcome by sleepe, and advised him to end the night as he had begunne it. The Physitians and Chyrurgians thought that they might give him some ease if they tooke off the dressing which had already beene twice foure and twenty houres on his wound. They therefore dressed him, and finding all signes of infallible recovery, told him, that there was nothing now to be wisht for, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Art or Nature, for that both had equally well laboured; and that it depended on none but himselfe to be absolutely out of all danger. With that Iphidamantus spoke, and embracing Bajazet with the tendernesse of a true brother, if you love us (said hee) beleeve us rather then the motions of your minde. They are but flatterers and traytors,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54727:62"/>
that would undoe you in feyning to love you. They present to you your misfortune farre greater then it is; and employing your noblenesse against your selfe, make you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that you are reduc't to that point, that you have neyther heart nor faith, if you are yet capable of hoping and living. Stop your eares against these Impostors; beleeve your friends, and be confident that you have no malady absolutely incurable. Your Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians promise the curing of your wound, and I will doe as much for your amorous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. You adore the beauty of the person that makes you despayre, and some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to fill the history of your life, restoring to you that worthy Subject of your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, will give you more content then you thinke to have lost in losing the hope of reviewing it.</p>
               <p>Bajazet sighing often at Iphidamantus words; It will be very hard for me (said he) not to suffer my selfe to be perswaded by his eloquence that doth not lesse charme the Eyes then the Eares. I will beleeve you my deare Iphidamantus. I cannot doubt of the truth of your promises, without distrusting a power which I set immediatly under that which is infinite. Zelmatida, who had beene a long time silent, seeing that Bajazets despayre was not cleane voyd of hope, suffered himselfe to be overcome by his ordinary imaginations and expressing them by words as sad as themselves were; 'tis for thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone deplorable Prince (said he) to whom there remaines neyther hope nor comfort. The most miserable are not deprived of that. Thou only, as a prodigy in Nature as well as in Love, thou despairest not, and yet livest void of any the least hope. Thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est none but death can give thee any rest, or at least insensiblenesse of sorrowe, and yet goest thou drawing out a life through the one and the other World, and dar'st not take that last resolution which farre lesse miseries then thine have put into the hearts of the most cowardous and fearefull. Polexander turning his eyes on Zelmatida, with such lookes as seemed to condemn the injustice of his complaints, told him without speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that despaire as well as hope was <hi>a genus</hi> under which divers <hi>species</hi> were inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. That that despayre was the sweetest, which depriving us of all hope, and unlink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us absolutely from all life, resembled those unpoysoned potions, which by little and little freezing the blood and the Spirits, and confounding death with sleepe, make those beleeve whom they kill, that they doe but slumber. See Zelmatida what manner of one yours is (said he) but mine is of a kinde farre more prodigious. It proceeds from hope it selfe. It divides my Spirit, and as I might say, teares it in peeces; imitating those cruell executioners that, at once, torment all the members together, and doe so, that of many tortures, they frame one dreadfull, that hee which suffers, dies as many times as his body hath parts. Diceus imposing these Lovers silence, too ill handled by their passions, intreated Bajazet to take a little rest, and to give to the remedies and Nature, time to perfect that which they had so well begunne. The two brothers and Zelmatida, taking this spoken as well to them as to Bajazet, tooke leave of him, and retyred into their ordinary lodgings. Bajazet passed the night without eyther dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet or raving.</p>
               <p>The next day the Princes visited him, and found his countenance so good, that they no more doubted what Diceus had promised. The following dayes gave them new as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances; and being no more in trouble but for themselves, they felt their ills growe worse by degrees, as Bajazets diminished. But Polexander when he had no more the diversion which that Princes wound gave him, he cast himselfe altogether on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his owne. He represented to himselfe, that there were no kinde of obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles where withall his desires had not beene crossed, still as he overcame them; and that for the height of despayre, he attempted a thing which neyther wisedome, nor courage, nor force, could ever bring to passe. These melancholy thoughts, which for some yeeres had beene the sole entertayning of his minde, made him distaste all kinde of pleasures, and have an aversion to all company. And since he was in the Pyrats Island<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there was not a day passed in which he had not beene among the rocks and deserts of that place, to give himselfe in prey to the fury of his disquiets. He went forth all alone, and leaving himselfe to be guided by two passions equally blinde, lost himselfe so, that he was constrained to passe the night, eyther in the deepe bottome of some precipice, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Ah Polexander (answered Pallantus) perish, but doe not murmure. Alcidiana is a Divinity, which is no lesse just when it punisheth, then when it recompenceth. Her virtues are exempted from those faults which proceede of humane frailty, she doth well to pursue you as one guilty, since your passion having offended her virtue, by a little too much liberty, hath oblieged her to chastise you by distance and silence. But O! How advantageous is this to you? for to consider matters well; is it not true, that since you cannot be belov'd of Alcidiana (for men must not pretend to that happinesse) 'tis an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame glory to you to have enforced that divine Queene to have recourse to extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes to disdeceive her people, and make them knowe that she lov'd you not. Make a long and a serious reflection on a matter of so great weight, and you shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confesse, after you have well thought on it, that the hatred Alcidiana shewes towards you, is farre more obliegeing, then the indifferency which shee hath for al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But that I may make you more capeable of these Mysteries, I will relate to you some of them, and drawe (as I might say) the veyle from before those secrets which have never been discovered. Whilest the faire slave talked thus, Polexander was walked on to the Sea shore, and staying there the better to heare him, wonne him to begin the recitall of those wonders which promised him so much comfort and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Pallantus not perceiving that the affection he bore to Polexander, was incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the fidelity he owed his Princesse, began in this manner a relation not lesse glorious for that divine Queene, then advantageous for out Hercë.</p>

sav'd us. To what may not Polexander pretend? since that if We reigne over our selfe and subjects, we owe that double Empire to his courage. But what said I Amintha? No, no, we reign no more, Polexander is the person alone which hath right to govern in this Island. Fortune hath put us into his discretion, and the liberty wee so much brag of, is not ours, since we owe it to his victory. Deplorable Alcidiana; give over this impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious minde, and these insolent contempts, with which thou hast hitherto regarded all men. It behooves thee to learne to honor them, and after thou hast disdain'd so many Kings, to accustome thy selfe to respect a stranger and acknowledge him to be thy deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer. Polexander could not endure that Pallantus should continue his discourse, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting him, made shew how much the reproaches of Alcidiana were mortall to him. Truly (said he) Pallantus, thou hast not deceiv'd my expectation, though thy words seemed to promise me great cause of hope and consolation; I have ever yet beleeved that the divine wit of Alcidiana was not capable of being deceived. It hath presently noted the falsity of such things as some flatterers have published of me, and discovering in the bottome of my Soule, an extraordinary pride and a prodigious ambition; it hath well beene perceived that all my actions were criminall, and that I wore not the maske of virtue, but to make way for my crimes with the more cunning and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Pallantus thinking Polexander had too fayre a Subject to talke for himselfe, to be silent, interrupted him as tother had done: and having most humbly intreated him for his attention.</p>
                  <p>Doe not hope (said he) that I will goe on a jot further, if you doe not promise to hearken to what I shall tell you, with that constancy that generous men attend even when they are innocent, the judgement of a Judge that pronounceth the Sentence of death. Polexander, knowing that he had suffered himselfe too easily to be led away by his passion, intreated Pallantus to pardon him that heate; and swore to him even by Alcidiana, that he would not violate any more the silence prescribed him. Pallantus would not doubt of an oath which hee beleeved inviolable, for Polexander, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this manner the recitall of Alcidianaes opinions. As soone as the Queene had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reproaching her selfe, she addressed her speech to Amintha, and desirous to obliege her to an answere: What shall we doe (said she) betweene two extremities, to us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually dangerous? If we have not an extreame resentment of the Combat, wherein Polexander engaged himselfe for our conservation, wee shall live esteemed the most unworthy Princesse that ever yet with ingratitude hath payed the Services that have beene done her. And if those of this stranger be confessed, as our importance obliegeth us, we not only uncloathe our selves of all that Nature hath given us of high and great, but bring our selves to the infamous necessity of living and dying slaves. Amintha, who hath alwai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s testifyed how much your virtue wrought her to love what imported you, answered the Queene, that how great soever the dangers were, they were never such as cowardly mindes imagined them. That the two extremities which her Majesty spoake of, were equally to bee feared, but that 'twas easie to avoide them. That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those two vices there was a virtue, that by a stable firmity neyther lean'd to the one nor to the other, and which by a just domination raigned imperiously over them both. That she should take hold of that virtue, and not looke on her selfe as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, or as a slave, but as a powerfull Queene, that being serv'd by a person infinitely belowe her selfe, could not imagine in him, eyther so much pride to demande exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive recompences, nor so much weakenesse to complayne, though he should not receive eyther great or little. Alcidiana, finding not in Aminthaes answere the satisfaction she looked for: If (said she) all things were in that order which heaven prescribed them, I could make use of those expedients you propose. But if I abide in that mediocrity what will not a people say, which blames all that crosses their fancy; and who weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all rewards and labours in a false ballance, neither beleeve the one nor the other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable, if they be not conformable to what they have prejudged. Yet let us imagine that my Subjects will be more discreete and judicious then those of other kingdomes. and let us beleeve that they will even approve the resolutions I have taken to acquit me of that which Iowe to Polexander: Doe you thinke that Polexander dazelled with the victory he hath newly gotten over his Enemy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Madam (said she) be pleased that without losse of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which I owe to your Majesty, I tell you that these feares are not considerable since they proceede not from a peacefull and reasonable Soule, but from a minde full of scorne and sorrow, and by consequence loaden with such motions as perplex it.

Alcidiana wanting power over her selfe to resist Aminthaes Councell, made all her feares give place to a compleasancy. From that very day, if you remember it, she sent to visite you, and gave you as a token of extraordinary favour the priviledg to enter the Pallace. You came thither, &amp; as if your victory had been to you a cause of mortification and shame, you presented your selfe to the Queene with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and a trembling, which was noted by all the Court. Alcidiana, who first percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, imagined (yet without any likeliehood) that your anger for being unrecompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after so great a service was the cause of your alteration, and that error recalling all the precedent; she grew in choller against you and her selfe. What (said she unheard of any) Fortune then hath made me to be borne a Queene, and Nature hath bestowed on me those qualities she hath refused to many other Princesses, to the end that becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slave to a stranger, I should have a more lively feeling then others, how rude that necessity is which forceth us to leave a Throne and enter into servitude. Amintha, well judging, that Alcidiana had great agitations, came neere to you, and heartning your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish'd minde, by the actions of thanks, which shee gave you in the name of all the kingdome, made you by little a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>d little to recouer both the use of speech and discourse. I recount to you these small incidents, since in the estate you then were when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is not to be beleev'd that you can now remember them. Know then that you blush'd at the prayses Amintha had given you, and that you spoake of your Combat not only as of an action not to be thought on, and by consequence that neyther deserved honour nor recompence; but as of an attempt which should rather drawe on you the indignation and vengeance of Alcidiana. Amintha seeing things growe to that passe which she had foreseene; turned towards the Queene, and drawing her out of her musings; your Majesty (said she) may be pleased to free Polexander from the strange error wherewithall he is preoccupated. I had thought till now that pride was the only source of all pernicious beliefes, but this Prince makes me see that humility produceth some that are not lesse dangerous. He perswades himselfe Madam, that the Combat he vndertooke for your Majesty, may have offended you, and that he then began to be faulty; when he had so much boldnesse to declare himselfe your Champion. Alcidiana quickly imagining what was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o too. Streight, Amintha cast her Eyes on you, as to invite you not to suffer so injust an explication, and to make your selfe the Interpreter of your owne thoughts. But understanding that you were too much interdicted to undertake that answere; shee spoke for you, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the dexterity of her wit in so nice a businesse: I know Madam (said she to the Queene) that our actions are no otherwise innocent or criminall but as they are agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to those sacred personages, whom God hath pleased to appoint, to command, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and judge us; and that those visible divinities, endowed with those lights we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy not, seeme no lesse to be elevated above us by the greatnesse of their wit, then they are by that of their byrth. Your Majesty yet may give me leave to suspend a while this verity, and to tell you with all the reverence and humility enjoyn'd me, that you have given that interpretation to Polexanders words, which hee would already have disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed, if the Law of duty and respect had not closed his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

contradict your opinion. It seemes (replyed Alcidiana) that Polexander understands our language well, to have no neede of an interpreter, and that if hee were of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, he would case you of the paine you take to defend him. Amintha that needed not to have any thing twice spoken to make her understand it; looked on you, and calling you to your owne defence. 'Tis in your choice (said she) to contradict me, or to make it knowne to the Queene, that I have said nothing but what shall be confessed, You then began to speake; and, as I have heard from Amintha, spoke in such a fashion that Alc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I acknowledge (said the Queen to her) Polexander is a brave man, he hath an extreme sweetnesse in his conversation, and his modesty denoteth the solidity of his Wit. But when I thinke on that which he hath but lately done for me, I confesse to you that his sight much troubles me, and as long as I see him, me thinks, I know not what voice whispers in mine eare: Doe not boast any more Alcidiana, neyther of the greatnesse of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Looke on this Stranger, thou owest to him all those things that give thee that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and glory. I doe my utmost to rid me of an opinion which I well see you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne: But the more that I would perswade my selfe that I owe nothing to Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the more doth the happy estate wherein I am, and the ruine of mine Enemies make me know, that when I shall be to him the most ingratefull in the World, yet cannot I be otherwise to him then the more oblieged. Amintha, that thought it not fit to leave this yong &amp; fair Princes, in such perplexitis as might much wrong her: It wil not be hard for you (sayd she) to reconcile two enemies that will not yeld in any thing to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Tis fit that those generous thoughts wold preserve you in that independacy where heaven hath put you, should raigne as absolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ely as ever they have done. It behooves likewise, that you give some roome and place to those that speake to you of Polexanders Combat, and that by a just regulating, having put all things in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they ought to observe and keepe, you consider the service of this Prince, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o many homages which he hath done to your state and merit; and not as ayde which the necessity of your affaires hath compelled you to implore from his courage. In a word, you ought to looke on Polex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

Alcidiana having not power to be so soone capable of Amintha's councell, though she thought it extreamly reasonable; told her, that she needed a great deale of time to be disposed to follow her advice. And indeede she was five or six dayes, without being able to suffer your presence, or resolve for your departure. Time at last plucking from her minde, all her feares and scruples, she came againe to her former mirthsomnesse; and causing to shine againe in her eyes that celestiall fire which had been hidden for a time, witnessed that her disquietts were at an end, and that her Soule had found againe that former peace it injoyed before Syziphus revolt had made it to you so considerable. Amintha noted this change, but her respect not permitting her to make it appeare; she wayted when some word or action of Alcidiana would give her the liberty of speach; And she got it in the great Garden of the Pallace. For one day the Queene walking there, tolde her that after she had well examined her councell, she was resolv'd to follow it. But (sayd she) this secret must rest betwixt us two, and let us consult together, in what manner we shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us of a Debt that ought already have been payde. Your Majesty, answered A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha smiling, have not to doe with a Creditor that presseth you. The glory to have serv'd you, is the only payment which he expects for his paines; and if your Majesty will beleeve him, he will perswade himself as he hath done already, that his services merit no acknowledgment.

                     </gap> on this alone depended the preservation of my authority, and the felicity of my life; I forgot all the rest, and think my selfe much troubled, when the care of my Estate, and the remembrance of other services that have been done me, divert me from this pleasing meditation. I confesse Amintha, that in this I am cleane contrary to my selfe, and that this change threatens me with some strange mishap. But I will prevent it if it may be prevented by any humane pollicy, and give end to my unrests in exiling from me the person that is the cause of it ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>l. If your Majesty (answered Amintha) will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to leave soothing, and give me leave to lay before you how your deliberations undoe one another, you may easily free your selfe from that perplexitie which your too n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The difficulty (Madam) is to worke the greatnesse of your mind to give way that a stranger (after he had with successe enough, most beneficially done you service) should receive some little part of that honour which you would have to be wholly restored to your selfe: And to give his valour the recompence which your Majesty beleeves he hath deserved.</p>
                  <p>Indeede (said Alcidiana) there are but those two points in question. Now that your discourse hath diverted my thoughts, I see nothing more facil nor more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, but when I thinke a little on the execution of these things, I see so many obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and frame to my selfe so many difficulties, that my minde cannot so settle on it, but that in stead of disintangling them, it becomes worse incombred in it selfe. Scarce have I well framed an intention to submit me to your judgement, but I meete a second thought that opposeth the first. My Will strives with my Will, my feare curbs my desire, and to speake freelie to you, I would willingly without ingratitude bee unthankfull to Polexander. Amintha who (may be) would engage the Queene to make a more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple declaration of her intentions; Will not your Majesty (said she) thinke mee too fancy if I take the boldnesse to aske you, whence proceeded these strange contrarieties? Doe you not feele in your selfe, a certaine desire and feare that causeth this ebb and flood in your Will? That's it (answered the Queene) that I could never yet come to acknowledge. These disorders are not begotten by any cause at all, at least not by any whereof I am sensible. The wise Radiotez, who hath so often spoken to mee of the trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>les and passions of the Soule, hath taught me nothing that hath any resemblance with my afflictions. I have forgot nothing of his Lectures, and know very well, if I deceive not my selfe, in what manner hatred and amitie are bred in us. But when I apply that which I know, to the affaire with Polexander, I finde that as I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hate him, so have I no inclination to love him. Polexander not daring to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, for feare of violating the Law that was so necessarilie enjoyned him, sighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowd when he heard these last resolutions of Alcidiana. But the faire slave seemed to take no heede to it, and thus continued his discourse: After the Queene had ended this declaration, she stayed a while gazing on Amintha. Amintha on her part looked on the Queene and said nothing, and so eyed her, that Alcidiana saw well she required a more ample manifestation of her minde. But she, shewing I know not what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing anger. Expect no more of me (said she) I have laid open my heart to you, if you be not satisfied you must finde fault with the want of my wit and not of my affection. I perceive well that I unfold not my selfe cleere enough. But how or by what meanes can my discourse be lesse perturbed then my thoughts? Or how can I expresse that in order, which I conceive but confusedly. See; all that I can recollect most neate and intire is; That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

all times when you have a will to it. And that shall be instantlie (replied the Queene) with a countenance that witnessed her satisfaction, and in so saying, shee turned to the Pallace, sent for her chancellor, and made him seale a gift of the Principallitie which Syziphus sometime possessed. She with her owne hand filled up the blanks which shee expressie had caused to be left for a Name, and blushing at every letter she writ, made it be seene she had extremely constrained her selfe to finish the Name of Polexander. She did me the honour to be chosen to carrie you that Expedition. I presented it to you when you thought of nothing lesse; and I admired the Grace wherewith (after your refusall of so royall a Present) you accompanied that refusall with all the thanks, all the acknowledgments and all the submissions that the gift of some great Empire could exact from a minde extremely generous. The Queene, who (as I have told you) had beene extraordinarilie troubled at her engagements to you, was ten times more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed when she knew that you would receive no recompence. She was alone when I presented her the Grant which you refused. The blood rose in her cheekes at it, and her extraordinary beauty, borrowing a new lustre from a red so sweete and lively, she appeared to me as beauty her selfe, environed with her lightnings, and holding in her hand the thunderbolts wherewithall she knowes how to humble the most insolent hearts, and overcome the most invincible. Sometimes shee stood to consider what I had brought her, and afterwards, lifting up her eyes and looking on me, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a contempt which was yet winning: What doth Polexander then hope for, since he hath refused that which might bound the desires of the most ambitious amongst men? I fell on my knees assoone as she began to speake: and extreamely desiring to answere her demand: Madam (said I) if your Majesty vouchsafes the least of your slaves the glory to speake to you, I will relate the very same words Polexander used, to make me knowe that he was unworthy of those extraordinary favours he receiv'd from your magnificence. And with that I held my peace; but the Queene commandig me to continue my discourse, I did it in these termes:</p>
                  <p>Sure Madam, it were needfull that either by miracle the stranger Prince had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired me with a part of his admirable qualities, or that he himselfe were here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to your Majesty the graces and charmes with which he intymated to me the confusednesse whereinto your incomparable favours had thrown him. A hundred times he kissed the happy vellom, enrich'd by the name and portract of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and testified even by some acts of adoration, that all that came from your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, as well as your self having some participation with divinity ought to be considered with that reverence we beare to things coelestiall At last, when his admiration and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie ended and that he had recov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>red his speech lost by the contemplation of your virtues. 'Twere fit (sayde he) deare and too-happy Pallantus, that my words were of an inestimable price, to have the merit to be imployed in that thankfullnesse which the wonderfull liberality of your divine Princesse exacts from my acknowledgment. But when I consider that there is no proportion, betwene vaine words and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, no lesse solid then eniment, my own shame ties my tongue, and forbids me, even those things which reason and duty command me: I would presently go and throw my selfe at her feet, to make her see the confusions and disorders of my minde; and to beseech her most humbly to receive as the actions of thanks the least unworthy that the greatnesse of her liberalities can expect from my resentment. But since it is a happynesse, which without a pride as monstrous as that of Siziphus, tis not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to hope for: I entreat you Pallantus to imploy in my fauour the priviledges of your glorious servitude; and throwing your selfe for me at the feete of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mistris, to assure her that the glory to have employed my arme in her service and the honour to be in her remembrance, are to me so high and pretious recompences; that the Crownes of the chiefest Kings of the world were not illustrious enough to be compar'd with them: Let her therefore (if sheep ease) desist from adding so many rewards one on another, and that by their number aswell as value, she do not reduce me to that necessity of not being able either to acknowledge or to support them. Go Pallantus, deliver back into the hands of her Majesty, these last tokens of her mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence; and for feare least she impute that to pride which I doe out of a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of my selfe; intimate to her that those things which seeme the most vast and the farthest extended, have bounds beyond which they cannot passe: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, that even ambition the most inregular, hath sometimes met with that which hath contented those insatiable desires which the possession of many worlds seemed not sufficient to have glutted. This verity being too wellknowne to be controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; let her Majesty not disdeigne to let fall a looke on a wretched stranger, and understand that having never hoped for any thing from fortune, he findes himselfe now raised so high that he cannot without being dazled, looke on the bottom of that pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis then for want of power to possesse, or desire any thing more, that I must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily remaine as I am, And therefore give her Majesty most humble thanks for those new, benefits which her unwearied magnificence sheds on me, and do it as I have now told you, not out of a vanity of refusing, but an incapacity of receiving them.

You were the first that spake to me of this Polexander, you gave me the curiositie to see him, you begot in me the desire to make use of his service, and at last to become indebted to him.

Amintha made a very lowe obeysance, and departed with a firme beleefe that Alcidiana, had not that perfect indifferency wherewith she had spoken to her some few daies before. You know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I, the reasons she used to get you to accept the Principalitie of Syziphus: But I know better then you what Alcidianaes thoughts were, when she heard you had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it. What (said she, thinking no body heard her) it is not then the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Present that hath made him take it? 'Twere Aminthaes intreaties, that made him like of it? but I am overjoyed that my debt is so well acquitted, and that I have no more cause of obligation for this stranger. Amintha was in the right, to make him goe

                  <p>When she had said thus, she was silent; and after a great sigh, but how (said shee) shall I know that Amintha hath faithfully related to me those words, she said to him? Is it not to be beleeved, that to make him receive my Present, she hath told him, that twas my will he should give me that tryall of his obedience, and that 'twas by it alone that he could avoide my indignation?

But I hold you too generous to stick at the estimation of what is offered you. If there be any thing great in this gift, if there bee any thing that ought to come neere your ambition, tis the dignity of the person that sends it you: Deliberate no more then on what you have to doe; for as tis impiety to refuse what the Gods give us, so is it insolency not to receive what is reached to us by the hand of a King, Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana would be out of your debt. Bee not so overweening to wish that she should bee still beholding: in a word be assured, that your offence shall not be lesse prodigious then that of Syziphus if you persevere in your refusall. Pride hath beene the losse of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallity, let the same thing make you refuse it; howsoever Alcidiana will bee obeyed. Dare you have the impudence to gainsay it? See the reasons (continued the Queene, raysing her voice) that Amintha hath made use of to winne Polexander to receive my Present: and if it be so, as I doubt not of it, why should I give that to Aminthaes intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which is only due but to the merit of my Gift? But whence come these disquiets on me? What matters it whether my Present or Amintha hath acquitted me? One way or other I am so, and Polexander is to me too indifferent to desire from him that which I never asked from any one of those whom my benevolences have enriched. See what the discourse was which the Queene thought she had by her selfe: Tis your part now to give it the interpretation it may receive without wresting. But what comfort soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it brings you, keepe it to your selfe for this time, for at the least diversion you throw athwart my memory, many things will escape it, which might serve you for excellent remedies against those ills that afflict you.</p>
                  <p>Two dayes passed after this, during which time the Queene lived as if you had beene wholly blotted out of her memory. Amintha came to her with her wonted assiduitie, and tryed divers waies to get her to speake of you, but all in vaine; for Alcidiana a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding those occasions with her incomparable dexterity, made this wise confident beleeve that she was resolved to treate you with the same scorne as till then shee had used all other men. Whilest these two rare wits did what they could to deceive one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; the news of the famous combat betwixt your selfe and the brother of Syziphus came to the Pallace. It was told the Queene with such circumstances, and to you so honourable, that all the hearts of the Court declar'd themselves for you, and twas who could finde best words to expresse most, the admiration he had of your valour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse. The Queene her selfe was constrayned to breake the vow she had made, and to speake once more of you. 'Tis to be confessed (said she alowde) that this stranger hath a great deale of good fortune. Amintha that would not lose so faire an occasion to know the cause of Alcidianaes long silence; Your Majesty (said she) hath good reason to esteeme Polexander happy, since all things happen to him so favourably. But whosoever considers well the demeanour of this Prince, will confesse that he himselfe is the Author of his good fortune, and that the blinde chance of armes, and that rash and inconsiderate divinity, to whom we give the glory all that happens extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, cannot be boasted of, with any justice, to governe the actions of Polexander, nor to place on his head the Lawrels wherewith he is crowned. Amintha ended this discourse just when the great Chamberlaine of Alcidiana sent her word that he was to advertise
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54727:67"/>
her of your Combat, and to present her a Letter from you. The Queene went thence into the Chamber where she was used to give audience, and followed by all those rare beauties wherewith her private Court was composed, seated her selfe in that Throne shining with gold and precious stones wherein she was plac'd the second time you had the honour to see her. The high-Chamberlayne was straight admitted, and kneeling at the foote of the Throne, related to the Queene the manner of your Combat, and then presented the Letter you had written to her. The Queene commanded Amintha to take it, and turning to her Chamberlayne: I will see (said she to him) what the stranger hath written, and he shall know my pleasure. In the meane while (said shee smiling) intimate to him that his good fortune makes me jealous, and that if he goe on, hee wil make me so farre indebted that all my fortune will not be sufficient to furnish me where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to acquit me. As for you Sarpedon, I doe not prescribe to you those things that are in your charge, I beleeve you too well know of what value Polexanders acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, to entertaine him as a common person. When she had said this, Alcidiana a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, and returning into her Cabinet with none but Amintha: Let's see (said shee to her) what Polexander hath writ to us. We shall infallibly know by this Letter, that hee is not much exempt from vanity as you would have me imagine. He was surely afraid that we should not heare of his Combat, or that the honour he got in it could not bee well related to us, if it were not done by himselfe. Amintha hath often told mee that she had an infinite desire to reply to the Queenes speech, but being confident that your Letter would make a better Answere, she unsealed it to give an end to the reproaches <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>f my faire Princesse, and gave it to her all broken open. The Queene tooke it, and presently giving it her againe commanded her to reade it. Imagine Polexander, if she were slowe to execute that commandement. She read your Letter, and stopping at all things that made it appeare how much Alcidiana was deceived, brought her to that point to beleeve that she extemporarily compos'd the submissions and humilities that were expressed therein.</p>
                  <p>She snatched it out of my hands, and would reade it her selfe, hoping to finde it in some what to convince you of vanitie, and Amintha of falshood. But seeing nothing there that was not to your advantage. Why (said she somewhat angred) should not this man be made as all others? I confesse Amintha my beleefe hath wronged his virtue. But who would have thought that this stranger, being young, fayre, valiant, victorious, should be uncapable of vaine-glory. For mine owne part, I hold it for a prodigie, and not being able to be wonne from my first opinion, I imagine yet that Polexanders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme humilities want not their pride, and that the utmost of his vanitie is, to strive not to have it discernd. Your Majesty, answered Amintha, is too just to oppose, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But why doe I strive to make that seen to your Majesty which incomparably you discerne better then my selfe? That which you feigne to beleeve, is but a turne of your good wit, and a signe that as often as you please, you can make humility taken for arrogance, valour for cowardize, and changing the face and constitution of things, bestow foulenesse and beauty, according as the force of your eloquence intends to obliege or damnity. I jest no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> (said Alcidiana) and if I had that absolute power which your ingenious flattery gives mee, I should not have so much injustice to imploy it to so ill purposes. I have beleev'd that Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was a man, and I thinke so still; and therefore cannot consider him but with those weakenesses where withall the condition of men is accompanied. Were Polexander (replyed Amintha) so happy as to defend his owne cause, hee would very hum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech your Majesty to be a little lesse cleare sighted then you are, and to imitate the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall justice, who never condemned a crime that was never committed. 'Tis possible Madam, that Polexander hath none of those faults which your Majesty supposeth; but if he have not beene so much favoured by Nature as other men, is it not a great deale of glory to him to have surmounted those vices that should have overcome him? or at least to keepe them so well concealed, that the eyes of envy it selfe are not penetrating e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to discover them? Your Majesty doubtlesly will beleeve that I am too obstinate in the defence of a man that is almost altogether unknowne to me, and the love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54727:68"/>
is not the sole motive, that makes me wave my respect and complying. I most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly yet beseech you, not to have that ill opinion of me, and to beleeve, that I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes forsake Polexanders part, provided that you suffer me not to abandon that of verity. Let it be the love of virtue or of the vertuous (replied Alcidiana smiling) that makes you so generous, I will never condemne the conceptions that so faire and high a passion gives you; and to witnesse how much they are in my esteem, I would have them advise me what I ought to doe for Polexander: If your Majesty, said Amintha, speak in good earnest, and would doe me the honour to beleeve your intentions which have your fame and content for their chiefe and last object: I engage my selfe to finde you a moderation by which you shall preserve that advantage which you have over the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Kings of the earth, and send home Polexander with an eternall obligation to fill the world with the renowne of your bounty and magnificence. You shall be beleev'd, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Queene, speake therefore, and speake what you thinke in your conscience you are bound to.</p>
                  <p>The honour (replied Amintha) which your Majesty hath done me, being considered, I should not be dutifull if I were silent: Nay, I should be disobedient. I will therefore speake, since it is your pleasure; and tell you, that the proofes of your liberality shewed to Polexander, should have filled him with admiration of your bounty. You have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me more to expediate but to let him know, that you are no lesse good then great. Sixe lines from your owne hand may make him beleeve this, and force him by a milde constraint, (even then when he shall be capable of envy or ingratitude) to praise eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally your excesse of bounty, and make you honoured by all Nations that have any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration for vertue. But what should we write to him (said Alcidiana?) 'Tis not for so poore a wit as mine (replied Amintha) to give advice in a matter of this importance. It is for your owne, Madam, to furnish your Majesty with thoughts and words worthy your selfe. It hath embellishments and heights not to be met withall in other wits, and will cause that by one same and miraculous effect, you shall imprint in Polexanders minde, an admiration and love of your vertue, and make him blesse the obliging testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of your bounty. Alcidiana won by these faire words, sent for a Cabinet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of she had the key, and taking thence what she needed, writ a letter which I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, because you never saw it. I knew it by the meanes of Amintha, who gave it me some few daies after (with the writing tables, whereof I will shortly tell you more. These were the words.</p>

                  <p>IF in your Combats you have sought for nothing but the glory to be esteemed of Alcidiana, be confident that there wants nought of your victory. Your valour is no lesse considered of her then it hath been advantagious to her. She confesseth she ows you her Crowne and that even her life was not secured if you had not taken on you the defence of it. But she stayes not there, she is compelled by the power of your vertue, to confesse yet something more. Tis, that she is not absolutely grieved that she hath been unfortunate since Fortune reserved Polexander to be her deliverer.</p>
                  <p>After she had ended this letter, she read it to her confident, and after became so red out of shame, that she was faine to hide her face with the letter it selfe. When this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion was over, the Queen seemed to be angry. And accusing Amintha, as if she had dictated that which the Queen had written to you: See (said she) what it is to beleeve a roole. We cannot chuse but fall into some extravagancy. Truly Amintha, I finde you very pretty and merry to wish me to flatter Polexander. I see well that if I continue to follow your counsell, at last I shall finde my selfe compelled to love him: and after she had said thus, she tore the letter in peeces, and commanded Amintha to burne it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

her. Amintha gathered the letter, and in lieu of throwing it in the fire, by her nimblenesse cast in another paper she had in her pocket. The while Alcidiana having drained her anger, and Amintha shewing by her silence, how much she was grieved at it; I am in the wrong (said the Queene to her) and will henceforward know well how to distinguish between those faults I doe my selfe, and those I commit by the advice of others: I am only guilty of the latter, and am resolved too to chastise that most severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But I will deferre it till I have given satisfaction to Polexander in what he expects of my acknowledgement. Shee with these words tooke the pen againe, and writ to you a letter which I never saw. Give mee leave Pallantus (said our Heroë after he had interrupted him) that I recite that deare &amp; pretious letter to you, &amp; let you know by the difference there is between it, &amp; the Declaration that ensued from that height of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the anger of your divine Queen precipitated me. This letter is not of the same stile with that you repeated to me; Nor is your other then a dreame, and this a reality. Hearken Pallantus, and admire what the most faire and perfect hand of the world hath vouchsafed to take the pains to write to me.</p>

But you are too generous to suffer Alcidiana to put her selfe into the state of a Petitioner; and she is not so void of reason to condemne a valour which hath made her triumph over her enemies. Enjoy in peace the glory you have gotten since you have neglected all other advantages; and doe not beleeve that Alcidiana shall be alwaies so unfortunate, but that she may as much oblige you as you have her now engaged.</p>
                  <p>Polexander had no sooner ended the repetition of this letter, but that his sighs pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on one another, almost tooke away his breathing; and if the particularities which Pallantus had learned him, had not given him some strength to support that violent fit of love and sorrow, he had infallibly been suffocated. At last, his sighs made themselves way, and issuing one after another gave him the liberty of speech. Presently he looked on Pallantus, and witnessing to him a joy mixt with sadnesse, and a troubled and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet satisfaction: is it possible said he, Pallantus, that he which hath received so great a testimony of Alcidiana's goodnesse, can live after the sentence of death which she hath pronounced against him? It must be possible to him, answered Pallantus, and reserving himselfe for some unknowne happinesse, that he judge of Alcidiana's intentions with the same reverence and feare that a religious soule should have for the will of heaven. But keep your ward you gave me Polexander, and suspend your contents and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till I have ended that which I know of the thoughts of my faire Princesse. Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander casting downe his eyes, and even not daring to speake a word, witnessed that he had a perfect resignation for those things that concerned the honour of Alcidiana. Pallantus admired this incomparable submission, and thus continued his discourse: The Queen had no sooner given Amintha the letter you repeated to me, but she thought she had done an act that was not equivalent with the others of her life. She sent me to runne after her confident with a command to come to her instantly. Amintha obeyed; but Alcidiana was not satisfied with it, for you had already received her letter, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by your answer, that it was a farre greater fortune to you then Sisiphus Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Alcidiana not daring to make shew but of one part of her displeasure, shee was so much a shamed of what she had done. I would (said she to Amintha) that I had added the halfe of my Crowne to the Principality of Sysiphus, so that Polexander had not the letter which you have made me write to him, I know sufficiently (replied Amintha) the obedience, that Prince is ready to yeeld to your Majesties commands, to assure you that if you thinke him not worthy to keep so pretious a thing, he will come and throw himselfe at your feet to beseech you to take it againe, and call backe those favours
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54727:69"/>
which you have too liberally communicated to him. The remedy (answered Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana) which you propose to me may well cure the wound I have given my selfe, but it can never take away the scarre. I would say that you might well get mee the Letter which Polexander hath received from me, but it is not in your power to make it so that he hath not had it. I feare not his vanity, but his memory, and whilest that hath a being yet should I not be freed of my feare, though I had that which you might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise me. Let him enjoy then that acknowledgment of the services he hath done mee, and hence forward let us have no more commerce with him, then with Spanyards and other strangers, which some tempest or chance hath sometimes throwne on our Coastes. You were then by this command, as it were, buried in the memories of those that loved you. But it was only in shew, for in effect you lived there in spight of all Inhibitions.</p>
                  <p>Alcidiana first violating her Lawes, entertayned her selfe with you alone; and thinking to remove out of her fancy and Idea that discontented her not but in that it seemed too pleasing to her; perceived not that her thoughts and the intention of her thought were directly contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This new victory brought new disquiets on the Queene, and made her knowe that it was in vaine for her to essay to acquit her selfe towards you. The very evening that the justs ended, she shut her up with Amintha, and beginning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new what a moneth of silence had interrupted. See us now (said she) in worse case then before. I thought Polexander had beene in my debt, and I finde my selfe behinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with him, more then I am able to pay him. Were I answerable for no more then for my kingdome and liberty, I have both to give him satisfaction: But since hee hath preserved to me the honour which rash Cephalus had hazarded, can I acknowledge that great service but by the thinge it selfe which he hath preserved? And if that must be, what will become of the wretched Alcidiana? Canst thou live deprived of that glory which thy predecessors left thee, and which thou maist say without boasting, was gotten thee by the practise of all the virtues? Amintha seeing the Princesse griefe to be so excessive that it drew teares from her eyes, was very much moved at it, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your interests for those of her good Mistresse. Your Majesty (said she) must not any longer suffer a sicknesse which insensibly gets on the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I finde it more troublesome then grievous, but you know it better then I, and I had rather trust my selfe to your experience then to mine owne feelings. Let us therefore be industrious Amintha in a businesse so urgent, and not putting off our cure to the succour that may come with time, let us try all those meanes that heaven hath put into our power.

bred, saw well that it was not necessary to urge your depart, nor to make your stay suspected. She therefore insensibly diverted Alcidianaes feares and resolutions, and repenting what her affection had made her say against you, assured the Princesse that you had not undertaken to combat with Cephalus, but with the same intention that he had done the justs: that was, you had a resolution to make your skill and gallantrie appeare, and not to engage the honour of the Princesse. And that you expected no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repute then that which is gotten by the like exercises. Cephalus (said shee) had published that you were the fairest Princesse in the World. Hee tooke armes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it against all those that professe to love what is fayre. Polexander would rayse the price upon him more then he. He therefore maintained against him, his armes in his hand, that you were yet somewhat more then the other imagined, and the successe of the justs hath made it seene that his proposition was true. What doe you thinke Madam, that you owe him for it? Nothing, but what the Sunne owes them that call him the Author of life, the Father of light, and the fayrest of all inannimate Creatures.</p>
                  <p>If Polexander had beene suddainly changed into some other, and become so vaine to looke for a reward after this last Combat; it should be then from the truth which he hath defended and not from you that he was to expect it. Set your minde then at rest, and driving farre from your fayre Soule those thoughts that disturbe it, hold it for an infallibility that your Majesty cannot be beholding to any one, since the honour to serve you is so great a recompence to those that doe it, that they are payd for all their services, even before they have begun them. The Queene whose extreme youth could not afford her those experiments that Amintha had gathered by the benefit of more yeeres, felt her selfe no lesse peacefull and at rest after the second discourse of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, then the first had put her out of order. She then rested her minde in its first seate, and retayning no other thoughts for you then she had for other Princes, was glad to giue you occasion to abide in her Court, and by your presence, obliege her people to stifle for ever all causes of revolting. After that resolution two or three moneths slid away, during which time you had often the honour to see the Queene, and obtayned by your submission and respects, the liberty to talke with her. This happinesse had la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted longer with you, if you had had the power to conceale yet your designe and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But this pleasant commerce broke off by the Petition you made her, to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the number of her slaves. I shall remember as long as I live the speech that the knowing Radiotez made to the Princesse to dispose her to bee gracious unto you. He seemed to love you well, since his cleere judgement that made him penetrate into things the most hidden, being as it were veyled by the excesse of his love; made him not perceive your intention, but did the utmost of his wit and esoquence to force Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana to put you amongst her flaves. There is no condition (said hee) in Polexander that should obliege your Majesty to deny him the chaynes he requesteth. He is young, fayre, valiant, and wise: and those were the foure qualities that the late King your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desired in those that should be chosen to enter into your Majesties particular ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. You will say he is a Prince, and a stranger: but after the examples of Orantus and Pallantus, who are French-men of Don Ferdinand a Spanyard, and of the Infant Cleonida Prince of Portugall, your Majesty cannot with justice refuse the humble sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Polexander, under pretext that he is a Prince and a stranger. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary these two titles, joyned with the considerations that you have to esteeme him, ought to be powerfull enough to make you dispence with the force of Lawes, if there were any that should forbid you to receive for your slaves Princes and Strangers. Thinke with your selfe, that all Rebells and Ambitious are not dead with Syzip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s. That there may occasions arise wherein your Majesty may have neede of personages extreamly faithfull, and as farre generous; and in whom will you finde more loyaltie and valour, then in him that offers himselfe to enter into your service, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not to be able ever to be absent from your person, nor bee separated from that which concernes you?</p>
                  <p>Alcidiana interrupting Radiotez: Father (said shee) I pretend not to overcome you eyther by virtue of my Eloquence or reasons. I know too well your abilities to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54727:70"/>
contest with you; but I may gaine by my obstinacy what I cannot by my perswasions, I beleeve with you, that all things concurre to give Polexander a place amongst my Slaves; but at the same time I know not what interiour motion forbids me to receive him. Let it suffice that I keepe him in my service by his owne worthinesse, It is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse that hee should bee engaged eyther by his particular vowes, or his publique fetters.</p>
                  <p>The good Radiotez, had nothing to reply to this answere, and was enforced to carry you the news of this misterious refusall. I know with what griefe you heard it, and the resolutions you tooke thereupon, but if you had beene lesse blinded by your passion, you might have seene through that apparant disgrace, how reall and great the favours were that she gave you cause to hope for. This is but to tell you of things without art or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling; Alcidiana had some particular good will towards you. I have already told you, that men should not pretend to the glory of her love. I repeate it not to anger you, but for an advertisement, not to promise your selfe any other recompence for your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice then the happinesse to have done it for the most deserving Princesse in the world. It may be you will aske me how I know that Alcidiana hath no <unclear>inclination</unclear> to you, and why I conjecture that her troubles, melancholy, and disquiets (which are infallible signes of Love in all other women) are not so in that Princesse, you may learne it from the writing tables where of I late spoke to you. Many moneths passed after you had lost the hope to be one of the Queenes sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ves; and the splendour and joy of your justs, your Masques and other matches had been passed over by the sadnesse of your thoughts, more black then the mourning you have taken: When Amintha discovered that Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana had not altogether blotted you out of her memory. You remember the strange accident that betided her in the Forrest of White-Hindes. Her hunting Chariot was violently drawne a way by the wildnesse of her horses, and happily overturned some twenty <unclear>paces</unclear> from a precipice, whither they were running to cast a way all. You found the Queene as dead, so violent was her fall, and so made her to be carried to the Pallace. Amintha had not so ill fortune; she <unclear>was hurt</unclear>, but it had not taken her sences from her. By chance, as she arose, she found a payre of writing tables covered with Diamonds, and having never seene them with the Queene, did not imagine that they were hers. She put them up and car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ied them to the Pallace with her Mistresse. After the Princesse was come to her selfe, and had assured all about her that she had no hurt: Amintha withdrew to her lodging, and <unclear>meditating</unclear> long time on your complaints, on your swounding, and the <unclear>desperatenesse</unclear> you shewed for the death of Alcidiana, she remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the table-booke which she had found, and desirous to see if there were nothing within that might tell her the name of the person that had lost it: Shee was informed by the first leafe, finding ther a peece of limming representing a Phoenix which is (as you know) Alcidianaes device. But I shall doe better to shew you the very tables, then to tell you the secrets contayned in it.</p>
                  <p>And in saying so, Pallantus drew them out of his pocket, and delivering them into the hands of our Heroë, tooke a picture of Alcidiana, which hee alwaies carried with him, and kept his eyes fixed on it whilest <unclear>Polexander</unclear> abode consulting with leaves more misterious then those of the antient Sybills. The first thing this Lover did after he had received that fatall booke, was, to kisse the rich covering, and to intimate by the respect he bore to the outside of the Temple, how great the veneration was where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he came neere to the divinity that was therein worshipped. Hee opened the Tables, and presently met with the lymming which Pallantus spoke of. Hee saw that unparrallelld Bird, that owes not his byrth <unclear>to</unclear> any but it selfe, to dispute beauty with the Sun himselfe, and oppose to the beames of that starre, the golden fethers where with it was crowned. The Word that was added to so fayre a body, had an exceeding grace in his owne language. See how ours hath wrongd it in the explication. My life shall exceede my byrth. After that Polexander had well considered this Device, and <unclear>searched</unclear> over all, whither there were not some Cypher or Character from whence he might draw any cause of consolation, he turned the leafe, and in the three following <unclear>read</unclear> the words that follow.</p>

                  <p>VVHat could cause the strange alteration I finde in my selfe? Can I bee sick or mad without knowing it? Within this little while I am ill wheresoever I am. If I walke I am presently weary. The places I delighted in, I cannot now endure. Hunting is odious to me, conversation troublesome, and those well beloved bookes wherein I have met my content and joy, can doe nothing towards the appeasing my disease. Of what crime can my Conscience accuse me that might drawe on me these too visible and too violent effects of the wrath of heaven? But suppose I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some one that deserved to be punished, must it be by a punishment so cruell and so unknowne? O avenging Angell, that indifferently executest the commands of thy Master! tell me at least, what is the torment thou makest me suffer. The greatest offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have in their tortures the comfort to know them, as they have the misery to feele them. Ixion is not ignorant of his wheele, nor Syziphus of his Stone. Titius sees the Vulture that teares out his Bowells, and Tantalus hath the content to gaze on the fruits and the water that flies from him. I alone suffer, without the knowledge of what I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. What helpe should I implore? What succour can I expect? if it bee impossible to tell my sicknesse, or to knowe whether it be the minde or the body that languisheth. But whilest I speake my <unclear>griefes</unclear> increase. They are enemies to discourse, and yet permit me not to be silent.</p>
                  <p>Polexander sighed often ere he ended reading, and asking of himselfe whether hee were cause of these troubles: 'Tis pride for me to be perswaded so (said he) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I must beleeve it a folly to punish my selfe for it. But whosoever he bee, barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and traytor, which respecteth not Alcidianaes peace, he shall finde that I am as cruell as invincible, when the businesse is to avenge that Princesse. After hee had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded these threats, which only Love could justifie, he continued his search, and passing over two or three blank leaves, he met with this that ensues.</p>

O Love! cryed Polexander, in finishing this Dreame, how fayre would thy victory be if it were true! Alcidiana gives way to thee when she is a sleepe, but she tryumphs over thee when she is awake.

                  <p>VVHat is become of that fierce &amp; pleasing dragon which all night tore my heart? but what sayd I? I am awake, and I speak as if I yet talked idlely. My ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is not yet well purg'd of those illusions that have done it so much hurt. She makes me carry my hand where I thought I had been wounded; I feele if my side be not opened, and whether my heart be in his right place. I finde no alteration in my selfe, and my feares are as false as my griefes. Children of darkenesse, little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by what unperceiveable wayes slippe yee into our fancyes? Get ye from my bed. Me thinks where ever you go you carry fire, and would fayne new-kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that which my dream blew in my brest. But you are vanish'd, inflamed Atomes, and the day dispelling your lights as it doth the other tapers of night, tells me that you are nothing but the effects of my Melancholly. Returne no more, and you dismall dreames, be yee alwaies the representers of what is passed, but become not the presa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of what is to come.</p>
                  <p>If the Teares and Prayers of Lovers (cryed Polexander) are as pleasing to you, ô yee Dreames! as the Poppy, Mandragoras and blood of beasts, that made you lately so favorable, doe not hearken to Alcidiana. Her conjurations are powerfull, but resist yee their charmes. They will else ruine the Empire of Love and overthrowe the Altars which are there consecrated to you. But I blaspheme, and offend a Divinity greater then you. No, no, let Alcidiana be obeyed, and let her be eternally insensible. 'Tis fit that all men should be miserable, rather then to suffer that Alcidiana should bee displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. After he had said thus, he went on to turne over the leaves, and saw in one page sometimes halfe blotted out, 'twas long before hee could gather any thing out of it, at last he read this fragment:</p>

How I hate thee fragment (said Polexander to himselfe) for not being imperfect enough. Thou hast two Letters too much, and the fayre Alcidiana hath not left them, but to intimate that my name is farre more blotted out of her memory, then out of this leafe. I must not doubt of it, but if I should so much flatter my selfe, as to imagine it to be some other name then mine which Alcidiana hath written; doe I not see by the conclusion of her Sentments—that I am the miserable stranger, for whom shee is so much indifferent. Yet let's on, and see to how many tortures her insensibilitie will condemne us. With that hee turned the other leafe, and sawe this beginning of a Letter:</p>

                  <p>HOw angry are the eyes of your Polexander? All the while I was in the Temple they were fixed on mine. The presence of those dreadfull Mysteries, that hold the hearts, or at least the eyes of the least devout—turn'd to the Altars, was not powerfull enough to drawe thither those impious bold ones. I complaine to you of it, because that Stranger consults more religiously with you then with the gods. Give him more respectfull regards—and forbid him that he—</p>
                  <p>You ought (divine Alcidiana) cried Polexander, you ought to forbid mee to live, rather then to impose on me impossible conditions, and command that my understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowing its happinesse, should become a Tyrant to it selfe, even to enjoyne my will not to desire it. But you have beene more just, and suppressing the bloody Lawes which your rigour had invented, you have dispenced with us for the necessity of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them. He continued his reading after hee had made this reflection, and met cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words by which Alcidiana had expressed her thoughts in looking in her glasse. They were these:</p>
                  <p>Doest thou know thy self well Alcidiana? These eyes afflicted and languishing; this complexion, so unlike what it hath alwaies beene; these pale lips; this leaden breast; in briefe, this dying person which thou seest in this glasse, hath it any thing of that thou lookst for?

Doe not accuse the glasse to be lesse true then twas wont. It is still the same it was, but thou art not what thou hast beene: Call againe dead Alcidiana, make the two last yeeres of thy life to returne againe; in a word, rayse thy selfe (if it be possible) out of the grave wherein thy errors have buried thee, and by what is passed thou maist judge of the present. But witlesse as thou art, it seemes thou art pleased in thine ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Thou inwardly comfortest thy selfe with thy losses. Thou findest allurements in thy alteration; and since thy glasse doth not flatter thee, thou endeavorest to flatter thy selfe. Breake this charme, unfortunate Princesse, and know thy sicknesse is at the height since thou art insensible of it.</p>

If Radiotez have not deceived me, tis impossible that my disease should come from that passion. How often hath he assured me that Love came from desire? and if it be so, I am not in Love, or else in Love with all persons in the World. For all fayre objects give me the same desires.

The more thou hast sought for occasions to appeare amiable, the more cause hast thou given me to make thee hated. I hate thee because I have run the hazard to love thee.

                  <p>Thou mightst well doubt (unhappy Polexander cryd our Heroë;) that the last calme, should be followed by a great tempest.

Ah Pallantus (answered the Prince) I know tis too much honour for me to be remembred in any way whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by Alcidiana. My Judgement avowes it, but my passion will not. I have such desires as perpetually struggle with my reason, and when I would force them not to go beyond the limitts she prescribes them, they boldly take armes against us both, and their insolencyes go so farre, that they even think to doe us a great favour when they use us but as slaves. Teach me (dear Pallantus) what my reason and I should do to get us the Mastery since thou wilt not have us give way to their tyranny. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sever in that feare and adoration which till now you have witnessed for Alcidiana (answered Pallantus.) Be not weary of suffering; and leave to your desires that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Empyre they have usurp'd over your reason. They will be of a different nature from ordinary desires, if time, opposition, and despaire do not weaken their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosity. Ah! Remedyes more cruell and insupportable then the ill it selfe (saide Polexander)! Am I brought to that extremity to make use of you? yes insensible friends, I receive and imbrace you, since you are so happy to have the resentments of Alcidiana for the Authors of your being. Pallantus, heere imposing him silence: Be pleas'd (sayd he) that I end the history of your disfavours, and that finally I banish you from the place wherein is inclos'd all your hopes and happinesses. Polexander replying nothing gave occasion to the faire slave to continue thus his discourse: Your sorrow, solitude, and your complaints having too long lasted for your quiet; Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha resolv'd to have pitty on you, and to redeeme you from you despaire by false hopes. You followed her advice, and suffring your selfe to be easily perswaded to what you so extreamly desired; you began againe your illustrious and magnificent way of living, whereby you had acquir'd the affections of the most part of Alcidiana's

                     </gap>rue cause of your change; she called for Amintha to discourse with her about it. I thought (said she) that having hitherto made a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of friendshipp with Polexander; you are not ignorant of those causes which he hath had heretofore to afflict himselfe, and those he hath now to rejoyce in. I honour Polexander (replied Amintha) but I have no part in his trust. Yet not so that I am ignorant of that which your Majesty desires to know. His griefe and joy are too publick to make a secret of them. Every one speakes of it, and if it be not known to your Majesty, you are without doubt the onely person in your Kingdome that is ignorant of it. But to give it you, it behooves (if you please) to think it fit that I pronounce to you a word which to you is very odious. Alcidiana, confident of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha's discretion told her, that she might speake; since your Majesty commanded me (replyed Amintha) I will tell you that Polexander is in love. The Queen was surprised with that word, and so surprised that she could not refrayne from blushing. But loath to rest mute on that occasion; is it possible (sayd she) to Amintha, that a spirit so strong as Polexander should be capable of so extreame a weaknesse? 'Tis possible Madam, answerd Amintha, and your Majesty would have the pleasure to know the cause aswell as the effects of this passion, you will be confirmd in that true opinion, that love is nothing but blindnesse and folly.

                     </gap>cidiana tooke no pleasure in this jesting, and you went neere to lose the good opinion she had of you, even by that which you had plotted with Amintha to get you into it. Polexander bindes me to returne to my first opinion (sayd she) to her Confident. Truely Nature and Radiotez have not deceiv'd me, when they assured me, that men were full of imperfections, and how those which had been estem'd freest from deserts and neerest approaching to a divine condition, had by diverse actions of their lives made it appeare they were truely men subject as the meanest to the most low and ridiculous extravagancies. Amintha saw well that twas nothing to the purpose to prosecute what she had begun, she therefore put it off to another time, and applying her selfe to the Queenes humour, did so well by her colloguing and wit, that in lesse then eight dayes wrought in Alcidiana an extreame desire to see the letters you had written to Stenelica. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently she shew'd her aboue fifty, and wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>d have given her a great many more, but that she was wearyed with your supposed extravagancyes. Stenelica punctually receyved two or three a daye and assoone as she had them, had order to bring them to the Queene. Five or six moneths slid away, yet the Queene discovered not the mystery of your Letters, nor of your maskes and turnaments. But by little and little her understanding comming on with her age, and her seventeenth yeere instructing her in that which the former sixteene were ignorant of; she made long and deepe reflections on all that you had done since you came into her Territories, and by those things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured that infallibly Stenelica was but the pretext and coverture of a more high affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This thought engaged her to reade all your Letters over againe. But scarce had she read the first, when she saw her selfe so lively pictured, that she called her blinde for being so long from discovering it. Streight an indignation for being deceived by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha, made her cast by all the eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ction she bore her, and made her resolve to punish you both for one crime, whereof she judg'd you were equally guilty. And not to defer her vengeance, she called for Stenelica, and shutting themselves in her owne Closet, and accommodating her selfe to the weakenesse of that poore Soule, hardly reasonable; told her, that she understanding how Polexander writ to her only to passe away his time; she would not have her to be any longer the object of his sport and jeasting. I command you therefore (said she) to receive no more of his Letters, nor any more to endure hiscompany. 'Tis a shame for one of your age and condition to lose your time
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54727:73"/>
in the fopperies of youth. Breake absolutely the commerce you have with this stranger; burne all his letters, send him back his Jewells, and suffer him not to talke to you any more; hearken to none that comes from him, and above all converse with Amintha as with your greatest enemy. The Queene was not thus contented to cut from that meanes of expressing your affection: But she would take from you all others, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish you and your complic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> for your temerity. She therefore remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

All the Court followed her in that Journey, and Amintha with the rest; though she tooke notice of a visible diminution in her favour.</p>
                  <p>My faire Princesse had not beene above foure or five dayes in that faire Pallace, when fortune willing to obliege her by your losse, stirred up that disorder which drew you from the Inaccessible Island.</p>
                  <p>Amintha (as you know) was stolne away one night by Pirates, which the winde had driven neere to the Queenes Pallace. As soone as she heard newes of this rape, she shewed a great deale of sorrow, though she had great cause to be glad of it. And I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily beleeve that (by her selfe) she gave the heavens and fortune thankes, that they had evenged her, and she had no hand in it; and that she was wonderfully well satisfied, to see the offenders punished without her being forced to any violence. She caused two ships to be made ready, and armed to pursue the Pirates that had stolne Amintha, and as she would have had them set sayle, it was told her, that in the very instant wherein the Lady was surprised, you had cast your selfe into a barke which by chance you found rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at the foote of the Castle, and that without doubt you had already overtaken the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. Alcidiana seeing herselfe so fully and quietly avenged, caused her two ships to put off, to give to all the Court an opinion contrary to her meanings, and in this manner, she put a period to all her cares and perturbations. Be pleased to let me imitate so great an example, and that finishing my discourse as I begun it, I may tell you, that your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire is unjust, and you are an ill esteemer of your good fortune, since you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lede not the greatnesse of it, not only to have obliged the prime Princesse of the world, to except you with that generall indifferency which she hath for all men, but to have made it appeare by publique testimonialls, that you have beene able to make her capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Flattering Pallantus (cryd Polexander in interrupting him) how thou canst abuse thy Eloquence, and disguise by thy smooth and winning tearms a rigour which is insupportable. Tell me not that I have made thy Queene capable of passion: Say she hates me, and not being able to endure my presence, hath banished me from a place whereto she knowes well it is altogether impossible for me to returne. But what do'st thou abominable and sacriligious Polexander? Darest thou murmure against that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that doth nothing but with justice, though it be not according to thy wishes? Respect, respect the arme that darts the thunder at thee; and receiving Alcidiana's stripes with a benediction, make all the world know that there are no felicities like those of suffering much for her. Polexander ended this speech with sighes, and being risen, began to walke with a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Their converse had not ended but with the day, if Zelmatida by chance had not met them in their way, and obliged them to returne to the Fort. They retired thither all three together, and gave the rest of the day to Bajazet and Iphidamantus. Pallantus, that would not stay any longer in that place, tooke his leave that same Evening, and promised Polexander that in his return from Africa, he would passe by the Canaryes. Polexander left him not tell he imbarked, and when he saw he must needes be gone, remember (deare Pallan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That is not it which you have promised me (replide Pallantus) neither expect that I will ever speake of you to my faire Mistris, if you doe not persever in the resolution to suffer for her. I will then (said our Heroë) since tis for her glory, and preserving my selfe even

in the height of my torments. I will hazard nothing but what I shall be inforced by the just desire of reseeing that incomparable Marvell. Polexander after he had spoake thus, imbraced Pallantus againe, and giving him the last farewell, returned to the three Princes that staied in the Isle. Much adoe he had to remaine the rest of the day with them. He spoake of nothing but of going away, and asking sometimes Iphidamantus, and otherwhiles Zelmatida, what they intended to doe, would willingly have left them both in the comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>y of <unclear>Bajazet</unclear>. But Zelmatida whose griefes made him as full of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish as <unclear>Polexander</unclear>, intreated him to be received as a companion of his fortune, and that he would obtaine his liberty from Bajazet; speake no more of liberty, (said the illustrious Corsary to him) twere to offend the friendship we have begun, to use tearms which are not practised but amongst enemies. Know then, you are free, if I be so, and though it be very distastfull to me to lose so deare company; yet preferring your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>fore mine owne, I yeeld to your separation. But (added he) addressing himselfe to Polexander as well as to Zelmatida, doe not leave me alone in my affliction, and since Iphidamantus hath no passion that presseth him, intreat for me that he will vouchsafe to abide here, that by his presence I may preserve to me a part of your selfe. Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, who among these so sensible and despairing Lovers, seemed content and unpassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: Stood not to be intreated, neither by his brother nor Zelmatida, to grant Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet what he requested: But (saide he) since there is (or ought to be) charity in those that are in health, to be industrious for the cure of such sick persons, that are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desperate: 'Tis just, that I forsake Polexander and Zelmatida to abide with Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet. This last hath great wounds, but they are not incurable, and by consequence, time and remedies are not lost in assisting him. But for you two (said he, turning himselfe to his brother and Zelmatida) there is no helpe at all for you, but in the speedy losing your selves. Go then, generous, afflicted men, goe search for shipwracks, precipices, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and death. This discourse ended: The foure Princes often imbraced one another, and gave so equall thankes, that it had beene very hard to know who were those that had obliged or those that received the obligation. After these compliments, succeeded the protestations of their eternall friendship, and reciprocall promises, to let one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know of their affaires as often as they had meanes. Polexander and Zelmatida un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to depart without paying their Hostes, sent two chaines of Diamonds, and two of Emeraulds to the Corsaries; and by that Present, left with them a more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion of their merits, then the miracles of their valour had beene able to make them conceive. Bajazet forgot not that he owed his life to Diceus, but gave him a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle of three Dimonds which the Portingalls valued at more then a hundred thousand crownes. These liberalities ended, the foure Princes at last tooke leave of each other. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidamantus aboade with Bajazet, Polexander and Zelmatida being shipped in one same vessell, began a voyage wherein they proposed to themselves none other end, but the continuation of their afflictions.</p>

Polexander, (vexed, with so fatall a gratification) made continuall prayers against the calme, and his life. And Zelmatida sending to Heaven a thousand pitifull supplications, besought it with teares, by a sudaine death to deliver him from the misfortune of not seeing Isatida. Whilst they thus vainly afflicted one another; their ship passed from the torrid Zone to the temperate, and leaving behinde them the fearefull plaines of the Ocean came neere the Coastes of Africa. The Marriners had already descryde the smoaking point of that Mountaine, (the highest in the world) which the Spaniards call Pico de Teyda; and Polexander was come out of his Cabin with the Indian Prince to shew him that wonder of the Isle of Teneriffe, and by consequence a part of his Dominions: When he saw shine among the waves, I know not what, that sometimes seemed to him glistering as gold, and otherwhile red as fire. This strange ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject interrupted his sad meditations, and holding him fixed by his eyes, gave him such impatiencies and curiosities where withall a minde so abated as his, in all likelihood was not capable. After he had beene sometime in this contemplation; he that was on the scuttle, cryde out that he saw a ship on fire. At that noise Polexander turned away his eyes from the object, which he scarce any longer saw through his long earnest loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on it, and by this diversion almost recovering his sight, tooke notice, that that which had so long amazed him, was the vessell which the Sentinell had discovered. Presently he commanded his Pilot to beare up to it; and when he was at a distance proportionable to his sight, he knew that the ship was not on fire, as the Sentinell ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, but that it bore sayles of the colour of fire, and glittered with gold in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This vessell said he to himselfe is too stately and rich for a ship of warre or merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize. The Princes of Morocco have none so brave. It cannot be Baj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>zets. O heaven! Shall I beleeve it (said he? Yes most assuredly tis the sacred ship of Alcidiana. He stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at that word, and musing a while on his imagination, doubt not (said he aloud) in striking Zelmatida on the arme, 'tis the very same. What? Said Zelmatida is that there? Our Heroë came to himselfe, and beseeching the Prince to pardon his transport: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all likelihood deceives me, or the vessell which you see is the same, which for the space of two yeeres, I have unprofitably sought after. Goe up to it then replide Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida. I intend it said Polexander. But wee must have a care that she doe not escape
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54727:75"/>
us as she hath done divers times. And in finishing these words, he was come so neere her that he noted the Devices that were painted on the sailes. You might see shine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that immortall Bird that seemed to have made her a Crowne with the very Beames of the Sun; and they read in some places some Arabian words which signified: I am sacred, for I am Alcidiana's. Wee need doubt no more, (cryde Polexander) to your armes my Companions; let every one prepare him to doe his best. But let none what ere he be, dare to shoote till I command him.</p>
               <p>Whilst he yet spoake the proud vessell presented her right side, and gave him foure vallies of Cannon one after another. He ran the hazard to be taken off by a bullet, which striking along the ship, from the prowe to the poope, pierced two of the sayles, and carried away a peece of one of the Masts. For all that Polexander would not have his Artillery discharge; but commanding his Marriners to clap on all their sayles, thought that Lynceus being prepared for fight, had no desire as at other times to save himselfe by flight. Whilst he was thus reasoning with himselfe, those that were in the rich vessell offended that a little ship should dare to carry her sayles aloft before her, would have satisf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ction, and to bring her to her duty discharged all her ordinance at her, which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her in three places, and killed Polexander fifteene or twenty of his men, and two of Zelmatida's. This act of hostility should have obliged Polexander to repell force by force. Yet he did not. But aboording the proud ship without shooting, he called for Lynceus divers times and crying aloud to make himselfe understood: Wee come not up to you (said he) as enemies; wee know that you belong to the most potent and fairest Queene of the world, and that knowledge obligeth us to respect you as sacred persons. Give over then to war with us, since wee are as well as you the slaves and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of Alcidiana; and if you doe not please to receive us into your ship, yet at least accept of us to serve you for direction or convoye: Scarce had Polexander finisht these words, but a man armed with armour of gold, who carried on his buckler the portraict of a Queene, presented himselfe on the side of the ship, and lifting up his sword; I would know (said he) adressing him to Polexander, who are those that dare take to them the glorious title of Alcidiana's slaves. The Prince insteed of answering stood as fastned on the buckler of the Knight with the golden armour, because he knew that 'twas Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana who was there pictured, and adoring that face which could not be seene without admiration: O thou Sun (cryde he) that only givest light to mine eyes, when shall I be permitted to burne my selfe in thy divine flames? He had not ended the last word, when the golden Knight stroake with his sword so weighty a blow on his head, that if it had not beene covered with a very good Casque, he had surely clove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it in sunder. This blowe awakened him from his extasie, and forced him to take his weapon in his hand. Thy rashnesse is great (said he presently) to him that strooke him, but if thou be either subject or slave to Alcidiana, I beare her respect enough to endure this injury. I am sent by Alcidiana (replide insolently the golden Knight) to correct those bold fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes like thy selfe, which dare to vaunt themselves to be the slaves of Alcidiana. To me alone appertaines so illustrious a quallity, and if thou doe not throw thy selfe at my feet to aske me pardon for being so audacious; Know, the day is come wherein thou must pay for it with thy life. In ending these threats he stroake Polexander the second time, and by his language made him well know that he was mistaken. Our Heroë pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to see himselfe so far from his hopes, and besides transported with a just jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, cast himselfe into his enemies ship, and made that proude one feele the weight of his arme so rudely, that with the first blowe he laid him for dead at his feete. Zelmatida that had beene a spectator of that action, could not sufficiently admire it; and standing in a posture ready to second his friend, in case he were assailed by the men of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished party, tooke off their resolution of undertaking it. Polexander the while his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall recovered not from his swound, commanded some of his followers to helpe him, and before he left him, desired to know what he was. A venerable Moore (for his age) therewith spake thus: Knight (said he) you may well judge by the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and pompous trayne, this man now stretched at your feet goes withall, that he should be of some eminent condition. Certainely, Africa, and I say more, Europe, have not any Soveraigne that can dispute with him for greatnesse. He is borne Prince of Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54727:75"/>
of Fez, and many other Kingdomes. 'Tis the hardy Abdelmelec Son of the puissant Hely. I will not tell you that the beauty of a Queene, which none can see but in pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, hath brought him in love. You may know it well enough by the words he gave you, by this fatall portraict (with that he tooke up from the Deck Abdelmelech's buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler) and by the Cyphers and Devices, which shine in every part of this ship. Father (said Polexander interrupting him) you may well make me understand many particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities whereof I am ignorant; but since it may be that they will not be very pleasing to me, I shall be glad to know nothing of them. I therefore leave you at quiet, to the end you may be the more industrious in the succouring of Abdelmelec; and for feare that this Portraict may run the hazard to be wronged by the sword of some one that respects it not so much as my selfe; I intreat you to give it me; and to tell your Prince when he hath recollected his spirits, that I should have thought to have done an act of injustice if I had left so faire a thing in the power of a man that knew no beter how to preserve it. And in saying thus, he tooke the buckler which the old man held, and returning into his owne ship commanded his Pilot, to steere againe his course for the Island of Alcidiana. Zelmatida received him as a Conqueror, and highly praised his action. But our Heroë, blushing for an honour that cost him so little: I have done nothing (said he to that Prince) but taught the poore Abdelmelec, that his strength is not proportioned to his courage, or rather I have made the unfortunate Polexander to know that as often as he will promise himselfe any contentment, he shall take the pleasure to deceive himselfe. No, no, he must no more hope, since he hopes so vainely, nor, that, for whatsoever may be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But whether I deceive my selfe, as you doe: or whether it be some unknowne power that workes me to this error; there is not a moment but I flatter my selfe with some new hope; and imagine spight of all reason and truth, that I shall one day see Izatida victorious over the grave, shine with the same allurements wherewithall mine eyes have been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so pleasingly dazeled. Whilst but to speake plainly these two-to-be-lamented Princes knew not whereon to resolve, their ship driven by an extreame fresh wind arrived at Polexanders Iland; where he was received by his Vice-roy and his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with such joy and acclamations as cannot be expressed; and caused Zelmatida to be entertayned with so much pompe, that he could not have been more magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently received if he had made his entry into the stately Citty of Cusco. He was lodged in the Pallace that Periander had caused to be built, and served with all the abundance and delicates that are seen in the extraordinary feastings of the prime Kings of Europe. But if Zelmattida were insensible of all the greate entertainment he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; Polexander was not lesse, of all the delights of his countrey and the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his people. They sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In a word they were both weary of every place they came in and principally of rest, and all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; for they had scarce tasted the delights of the fortunate Islands but they were cloyde with them. From the first dayes of their landing, they talked of putting to sea againe, and attempt againe either to make themselves happy or to be lost for ever. One evening as they were talking of it, one came and advertis'd Polexander that there was a ship come into the Port, and that a lady of quallity therein sent to know whether he were returned. Tell her (sayd Polexander presently to him that brought the newes) what you know, and if she have neede of my Service I will waite on her any where that she shall please to command me. Scarce had he ended this complyment., but he was told that the Lady was in the Pallace. He therefore intreated Zelmattida to give him leave, to performe the honour of his lodging, and leaving him with his people went to meet the Lady: which he did on the greate staires clad and attended like a person of great qualitie. He did her all kinde of civilities, and asked her pardon for the paines she had taken. The Lady
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54727:76"/>
having rendred him his Complyments, and signified her joy of meeting him, lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up a little the veyle that covered her, and feigning twas to set it higher, discoverd an eye more sparkling then that starre which carries the Name of the Mother of love, and a complexion so bright that even though it were not white, there leapt from it a certaine luster which on a suddaine dazel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I accept your offers (replyed that charming beauty) and receyve the testimonyes of your courtesye, with so much the more satisfaction since by them I am confirmed in the hatred which I have justly conceived against the most brutish and perfidious of Princes. I will relate you the history when your are pleased to heare it; for 'tis to the end to informe you that twice already I have saild from Africa, into this Iland.</p>
               <p>Polexander, told her that he was very unfortunate to be absent as such times as she took the paines to come thither. But Madam (saide he) you have need of rest. With your permission I will go and give order to your affaires and leave you at liberty. When you are pleased to see me you need but send the meanest of your servants, and I shall not faile presently to waite on you. The Lady much satisfied with these courtesies and having been a long while with her women to right the disorders of her dressing, she commanded one of her eunuches to go to Polexander and aske him the houre when he would please to give her Audience. The Prince who was returned to Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida made his most particular excuses that he was so often constraynd to faile of what he ought him, and leaving him with Alcippus and Garruca, returned into the chamber of his new guest. Assoone as she saw him, she came to meete him, and made him very pleasing excuses, for the liberty she tooke with so greate a Prince, and presenting him her hand, lead him to the innerside of her bed, and set her downe on it, that she might so have her back turn'd to the light, and that her face naturally sweet, might receive new graces by that art. Polexander setting himselfe right against her, marked all her sweetnesses and allurements, and sate surpris'd rather then charm'd with that addresse wherewithall she govern'd her quick and languishing eyes: she presently began to speake, and cuting off all kinde of preparation: I am sayd she the daughter of Muley Hassen King of Thunis. I have a sister elder then my selfe, which is call'd Bencerida Ennoramita. Her adventures are not much more happy then nine; and if I would cast my disgraces on any other then their veritable Author, I could say that she is justly punished for giving me ill councell. Yet I will speake no more of it, but shallbe well satisfied to discharge all my choler against that traitour who feigned not to love me but onely to make me undergo all that might be eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>cted by his cruelty. My Name is Perselida Amatonta Ennoramita, and that you might not believe I mistake my selfe in my discourse, you may please to know that the Name of Ennoramita is a Name that all the Princesses of my Race are obliged to carrie in remembrance of that famous Queen which delivered the kingdome of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns from the tyranie of the Arabians. The Territories of the King my father are bounded on the west by those of Fez and Morocco.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but you know that Hely who is King of those two Kingdoms hath two sonnes whereof the one is called Abdelmelec and the other Nephizus. But it may be you know not, that as the eldest is the most rash and proudest of men, so is the other the greatest traytour and the most abhominable Monster that hath ever dishonoured the quality of a Prince. At his returne from a voyage he made to Granada, he came to Tunis, and staying there for some designe he had upon Spayne (at least if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve an Impostor that never speakes truth) was neere two yeeres in feeding Muley Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He was but seldome seen, he changed often his place of abiding; and when he was obliged to any Journy, he never went but under a strange Name and habit. During his long aboade the disloy all Man cast his eyes on me, and taking pleasure in the quicknesse of my wit and dexterity of my actions, became, ere he was aware, in love with an Infant. At first his affection
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54727:76"/>
was but a diversion and a sport; because not being able to wish for any thing but what he continually enjoyed, (I would say) to see me and make me talke; he lived without desire or disquiet during the first two yeares of this extravagant affection, there happened strange revolutions in the kingdome of Granada. The kings of Castile set on them farre more power'fully then they had ever don, and after many seiges and battells, not onely wonne the capitall Citty but compelled the poore Boabdilez to abandon his Crowne and to crosse the sea to finde a miserable retreate. The exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Nephizus no sooner heard of this change, but he tooke leave of Muly and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Fez, under pretence of off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing the Countrey of Hely to the unfortunate King of Granada. It was above eighteen monthes ere my father heard any thing from him, and I think he expected nought any longer when this miscreant returnd to Thunis, not as he came at other times, I meane in the quality of a Prince, but under the Name of a certaine Spanish Lord called Don Hernandez de Toledo. He discovered himselfe to Muly, and having invented to him a thousand dangers, which doubtles he never came neere, and as many designes yet more imaginary he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he might be publiquely entertayned as Embassador from the king of Spain, and permit him to have a galley in the port, that both by day and night he might put to sea and quickly get to such places where he should be called by the necessity of his affaires, and the advise of his associates. The good Muly consented to all that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizus desired of him; and the love he bore to his children being indeed a blinde love, he was overjoyed to be able to contribute any thing to the greatnesse of a Prince on whom he already looked as on the husband of one of his daughters: during Nephizus second aboade, his passion made a great progresse.</p>
               <p>Hee had left mee a childe, and hee found mee so tall, so well made and so faire, as hee sayed that his love grew aswell as I; and gave over as I may say the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a child when he saw that I was no more so. He began to speake another language then he had used to me before. He intymated to me that I was the object and the end of all his desires; and by a thousand execrable oathes, would perswade me that to have the honour to be my slave, he intended to renounce the conquest of all Spayne. I was yong, and had a good opinion of my selfe. Imagine with your selfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were hard to gaine me by flattery. I must needs confesse to you, I beleeved the traitor, and though I had no great minde to his person, I yet loved that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of courage, and that extraordinary ambition that appeard in all his discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. He was above six monthes in intertayning me with his affection; and did what he could to engage me farre in his extravagancies. But treating him oftentimes as he deserved, he became more discreet, and besought me to let him returne to Morocco, to get the King his fathers permission to ask me in marriage. I consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without much intreaty to his departure, and indur'd the length of it without any greate disquiet. At Morocco he stayd well neere a yeare <unclear>on</unclear> at Fez; and I have learnt from divers persons, how that Monster instead of serving the king his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and defending him from his enemies, conspired against his life, and threw amongst his subjects the seeds of rebellion and parricide. These attempts not prospering, he was forc'd to absent himselfe from Morocco and to fly into Spayn; where questionlesse after he had contrived some newe treason, and made himselfe known what he was, he return'd to Fez, and obtaining his too milde fathers par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don was restord to his former authority. But some new plot begetting him a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemie he ran the hazard of his life, by an adventure which I could never come to know, neither from him nor any of his followers. O! how many innocents had been aveng'd, and how happily had the world been purg'd of so fearefull a Monster, if the too generous Knight that fought with Nephizus had been lesse pitifull and not so generous as he was. Surely he should not have been content to have pierc'd him or have made him beg his life; since he was bound for the generall good of the world to have shed even the last drop of blood of that traitour. About three moneths after, as if he had forgotten his shame, or perswaded himselfe that the report of his Combat had not passed the borders of Fez, he shewed himselfe at Tunis; no more under a strange habit and Name, but as the true sonne of Hely. His traine
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54727:77"/>
was answerable to his condition, and his bravery made such a shew that the eyes of Muley and of Benetrida Ennoramita were equally dazeled. My sister was even ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished to see the splendor of that Prince, and judging that he came not with so much pompe but for the dressing he had on me; even enrag'd with it, looked on me with an envious eye, and told me often that I was borne the happiest of all our race. For mine owne particular, I had other thoughts. I looked on Nephizus as on a man without honour and courage, and could not even indure his conversation. The first time he could speake to me in private he renewed to me the assurances of his Service, and perceiving that I harkned to him with a great deale of coldnesse and negligence. Ennoramita (sayd he to me) can I be so unfortunate as to finde an alteration in your humour? I replyed that I found so much in him that twas no wonder if he saw some in me. The Barbarian not conceiving what I would say: Let that Justice (sayd he) which never pardons the violaters of oathes, punish me with an eternall chastisement if I be not the same that I ever was for the faire Enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramita, and if it be not with as much love and faith as ever, I beseech that Justice presently to avenge it on my life. 'Tis not now in your power (sayd I) to dispose of your life. 'Tis no more your owne. Tis that knights of whom you so poorely begd it. Polexander seeming desirous to speake, Perselida Amatonta was silent, and our Heroë began thus: I confesse Madam (sayde he) that I am very indiscreet to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt you but the cause of my incivility is so just, that I could refrain no longer, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <unclear>truth</unclear> that testimony she exacts from me. The first time that you sayd Nephizus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his life from his enemy, I beleev'd you spoke of it with the same exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is usuall to injured persons, and that you tie not your selfe precisely to make a true narration. But seeing by the continuance of your discourse, that you are in an error too prejudicious to the honor of a Prince of Fez; I cannot but for his vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I know how all the matter passed and know it most particularly. In a word Madam twas a Lady that sav'd the life of the Prince of Fez, in spight of the obstination of another who would have had him lose it. But that history is long, and you must give me leave to deferre it to another time. I shalbe very glad to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a businesse I yet know, not replyed Perselida Amatonta, and to discover some new infidelity in my Affronter. But to continue those he did me, I say that my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches cast so much shame and confusion in his countenance, that though from that time he conceived the dressing to be avenged of me; and to make me feele the anger I had kindled in his soule; for all that he cast himselfe at my feete, and besought me with teares in his eyes to tell him the Author of that calumny. I will make him (sayd he) confesse his lye, nay dye in your presence; and if you have not quickly pitty of those ills that your rigour inflicts on me, I will soone let you see by the losse of my life, that I have never been so base as to beg it. You will have all Africa to fight withall, if you intend to purge your selfe of that Scandall. 'Twere better for to bury that unfortunate Combat in a voluntary forgetfullnesse, and that you did imploy your courage, to make those belye themselves that accuse you to have attempted against the life of your father. This Second Onset was no lesse piercing to Nephizus then the first. He was utterly ouerthrown and though he strove to make his offences passe as some extravagances and the anger of Hely for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of an old man; he could not for all that hide his disorder and perplexednesse from me, nor his anger for being so well knowen. He therefore lefte me assoone as he could, and without shew of choler or coldnesse continued to live with the King my father and me as if he had remembred nothing of what was pass'd. He would himselfe, the better to deceive those that had command to note his actions, make matches at Canes, and Just with the yong Knights of our Court. He intreated the leave of Muley Hassen, who much loving those kinde of youthfull sports, since from all times they have been used amongst the Moores, did not onely consent to it, but (being himselfe much delighted with them in his youth gave the Deseigne of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54727:77"/>
many Entrances and lent Nephizus the best horse of his great stable. This dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Prince came to the Justs under a Name farre from his intentions and mine. He called himselfe the Knight of Perselida Amatonta and obtained from Muley, that I should bestow on the Knight that had done best, the Prize that I should thinke worthy his adresse. The sports of the Canes, and the fight with the Bulls lasted three dayes. The fourth the Justs began, and Nephizus after he had overthrowne eight or ten of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest Knights of Tunis, grew so proud of his good fortune that he came oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my scaffold, to aske if I were not pleased with his dexterity.</p>
               <p>Muly had sent me one of his gentlemen to know what hindred me from giving the Prize of the Justs to the Prince of Fez; when a Knight armed with an armour sowed with Crownes entred the Lists, and asked leave to tell me his thought before he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in case to fight with those of Nephizus party. This favour was granted him by the King, on condition, that if his good fortune gave him the best of the Maintainer, he should not have the Prize appointed for the Vanquisher, till he had made himself known. The Knight yeelded to that condition, and comming out of the Lists to my scaffold, made his horse goe with so much artand evennesse, that wee both (my sister and my selfe) confessed together, that Africa had never seene any thing like it. As soone as he was neere enough to me to be understood, he lifted up his bever, and low inclining, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam said he to me, whoever is not of the Prince of Fez his opinion, shewes himselfe stupid, so far as to have no judgement, or so wicked as to dispute the most undoubtfull and best knowne of all truthes.</p>
               <p>'Tis most certaine that the defeate of those Knights which have this day come into the field proceeded from nothing else but the power of your beauty, and I beleeve that 'tis only for the interest of your renowne, that fortune hath so constantly held on Nephizus party. But she will not give to your merit all that justice which it deserves, if (after she had condemned the blindenesse and pride of those Knights who have dared to compare to the wonders of your beauty the common one of their Mistresses) she had not destined some one to correct the rashnesse of the Prince of Fez.</p>
               <p>'Tis she, Madam, that hath brought me hither to tell this audacious man, that 'tis not for him to ascribe to himselfe the title of your Knight, and that he became guilty of a crime not to be forgiven, when he tooke the boldnesse to hazard your renowne on the feeblenesse of his armes. Allowe then (if you please) of so just a resentment as is mine; and give way, that I shew this Assembly, that he only defends a just cause, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines that the bravest man of the world is unworthy to serve you. Thus said the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne Knight to me, and presently, either the power of flattery or mine inclination were so winning, that I felt my selfe in love without knowing who had kindled the flame.</p>
               <p>I strove to suppresse this first and indiscreete motion; but in spight of all my indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and all my reasonings my passion grew the stronger, and suffered me not to quell those troubles, and inward disorders which perplexed me. I put them off yet a little to answere the unknowne Knight, and to grant him leave to combate with Nephizus. After he had given me many thankes, he left me, and went to the place where he was to make it appeare that he was a man of his word.</p>
               <p>The Prince of Fez who was on horsebacke, no sooner saw him at one end of the field, but he went to the other. Presently the trumpets invited them both to shew their valour. They came on with such an extraordinary swiftnesse, and a force so equall, they broke each of them two lances without any advantage on one another. At the third, my Knight put Nephizus out of his saddle, and upon a dispute that the cunning Prince set on foote to save his honour, the King my Father, and the Judges of the field put off the decision of the difference to the next day. Nephizus who in his conscience well knew he had the worst, would not hazard his reputation at Justing. He therefore demanded that they might be permitted to regaine by the sword what either had lost by the lance. The unknowne Knight joyned with him in that request, and the Judges, to content both, granted them the combate. I instantly retired with the King and Enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramita, and as soone as possibly I could, I went and shut me into my closet. I was there about two houres musing on this strange adventure, and asking my selfe who this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54727:78"/>
Knight should be that had so sensibly obliged her. In this pleasing meditation was I when Nephizus came into my chamber; one of my slaves came and gave me notice of his comming, and I chid him for it so earnestly, that tooke from him for ever the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>inging me the like newes. Nephizus without doubt heard me, for (said he) when he was come into my closet, I would have taken the boldnesse to disturbe you, if the King had not expresly commanded me. Impute then (if you please) my importunity to my obedience, and continue not to shew your neglect, if you have not an intention to deliver me over altogether vanquished to the mercy of mine enemy. I answered: He is too valiant to have need of a second, and if you would beleeve me, you should imploy a part of this night to finde some invention that might utterly break off the match that you have deferred. Those words made him almost desperate.</p>
               <p>But the resolution he had taken to make me unfortunate, even to extremity, wrought him to dissemble is resentment. Our converse was not long, for the King sent for mee; I went to him with Nephizus, and all the supper time, I spoke almost of nothing but the civility and addresse of the unknowne Knight. I askt of every one his name, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none that could tell me any thing of him: I owe much (said I, aloud) to the Kings providence, for by the law which he hath imposed on the vanquisher, I shall have the content to know this stranger. Nephizus could have so much mastry o're himself to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his choler, nor to let go without an answer, a speech wherein he thought himself too much injured. He therefore spoke, and witnessed his anger by the tone of his voice. If the King (said he to me) had imposed on the vanquished the necessity which he hath on the va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>quisher, I doubt not but your curiosity had been satisfied. But the Conquerour alone being bound to make himselfe knowne, I much deceive my selfe, if the successe of to-morrows combate doe not much increase your longing. You are mistaken (said I eagerly to Nephizus) yet would say my admiration and not my longing. The King that saw well I had a minde to anger Nephizus, did something to hinder the continuing of our discourse. And I that knew what the goodnesse and indulgence of so affectionate a father required from my respect, presently changed countenance and voice; and said smilingly to Nephizus, that I had not that opinion of his enemy as I would have him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; and that I had not undertaken him, but to humble him a little on a day wherein the publick voice had raised his valour even to the skies. As crafty as that Prince was, yet he was caught by this soothing; and according to the humour of those in love, was so much moved with that favour, though it was no otherwise then all apparent, that he forgot almost all his anger. The houre to retire being come, he led me to my chamber, and by the way made me so many protestations of service, that if I had not knowne him well, without doubt I had been so silly as to have beleeved him. As soone as he left me, I got to bed, and spent almost all the night in thinking on the good aspect, the active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and valour of the unknowne Knight. Scarce was it day but that I awakened my women, and made such a coyle among my servants, that it witnessed well the disorder of my minde. I handled all my Jewells, and not knowing at last whereon to resolve, commanded a maid whom I very much trusted, to give me what would best beseem me. When I was about to coife me, not any one of my women was either handsome or quicke enough. All that they put on was naught. My dressing was sometime too great, sometimes too flat, and I made my selfe to be new dressed so often that I was not ready when one of the Kings Gentlemen came and told me that the Combatants humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought me to repaire to my Scaffold. I tooke not time to eat, but as one senselesse, ranne to the field, and was there exceedingly troubled till I saw the brave Knight. Nephizus inraged with anger, and may be with jealousie, came fiercely on his rivall, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him with an incredible vigour. At every course the Prince of Fez had some advantage; but at the last, he flew over his horses crupper, and lay so long time stretched on the sand, that they beleeved he would not make use of the permission that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested. Yet he arose by the helpe of his overthrower, and being remounted on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, insolently called his generous enemy to the combat: long time they fought and very suriously; and Nephizus questionlesse resolved rather to dye then to yeeld ground; and the other desirous to preserve the honour he had gotten, behaved him so cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously, that at last the wilfulnesse of the Prince of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As soone as the Judges had declared the Stranger to be the Victor, they brought him before me to receive the Prize which he had gotten. He besought me to give it him, with such a grace and submission that they made an end of losing me. Before I gave sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to so just a request (said I) you ought (if you please) on your part to fullfill the Law imposed on you. 'Tis to favourable (said he) not to obey it. But Madam, it needed not that such an ordinance should impose a necessity of discovering my selfe. The honour you doe me to command it, is to me a Law so sweete and powerfull, that for what disadvantage soever it may be to me in making my selfe knowne; yet I shall not faile to give you that small proofe of the extraordinary zeale I have to your service. In ending these civilities he tooke off his helmet, and thinking truely that I knew him not: See heere (said he to me) Muley Hassen, who hath no other honour nor merrit, then to be sprung from the Royall House of Thunis.</p>
               <p>I had heard my Father often speake of that yong Prince, and esteemed him as one of the most couragious and accomplished Knights of his time. But I being but an Infant when he left Africa to travell through Europe, I did not remember I had ever seene him. Though my love was gotten to such a height, beyonde which there are few others, yet I confesse to you, that it grew in such a manner in knowing whom I loved, that all the persecutions which I have suffered since, and all the time that hath passed since I saw my Lover have not beene able to lessen it.</p>
               <p>As soone as I was out of that astonishment which the sight of Muley Hassen had been the cause of, I presented him a very great Diamond, with three Pearles in fashion of a peare which I had destined for him, and desirous to answere his faire speech by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that might leave in him an opinion he was not unpleasing to me: Cousen (said I) 'tis not only as your kinsman that I rejoyce at your victory, but as a good Patryot; since Strangers that shall know how you have dealt with one of our most remarkeable neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, will respect our Frontires, and have no will to invade a Countrey that may vaunt it selfe to have an invincible Defender.</p>
               <p>Beleeve then that both in the one and the other title, I am extreamely glad of your honour, and keepe the Present I have made you, as an assurance, that hence forward I will interest my selfe in all things where you have any share. Muley out of his discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion durst not answere me, but went to waite on the King, who had sent for him by one of his Squires. You may imagine whether he were well received. Truely he was in such sort, that if my poore brother had been returned from that dismall enterprize which cost him his life, he could not have beene better welcommed. The King who had given him his owne name, held him a long time in his armes, called him his second Son, and the stay of his age; and causing him to mount on one of his horses, brought him to the Pallace attended as in triumphe. He forgot not Nephizus in his ill fortune, but shewed him by that little time he was with him, and by the little displeasure in his countenance, that his affection was an affection of state, and that which he shewed to the yong Muly, was of blood and nature, that is, how the first was feigned, and the other true. Nephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus had time to thinke on his revenge: For he kept his chamber neere a moneth. In this long solitude, having layd the plot of what he was to execute, he came after into the Court with so much jollity, as if he had borne away the Prize of the Justs, and came on to prattle with as much assiduity and passion, as if he had beene yet truely in love with me. But 'twas most vainely that he imployde all his craft, and forced countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for I was not now to be taught. I lived now only in Muley Hassen, and had no eares nor eyes but for him. I saw him every houre of the day, sometimes with the King, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles in my chamber, then in the gardens, afterwards in a hunting, and every where with so much satisfaction on one side and the other, as well of love as of respect, that I may say that five or six moneths that I passed thus, seemed to last nothing at all. But alas! Those things that please are not of longest continuance.</p>
               <p>Nephizus that had an intent to revenge himselfe extraordinarily of me, thought he could not doe it but in getting the yong Muley from Court, and becomming the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Master of my life. See how he went on: He dispatched to Morocco to oblige the King his Father to send his Embassadors to mine to treate of his marriage with me. In the meane while he negotiated so dextrously or rather so detestably with those that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54727:79"/>
the will and estate of good Muley, that they made him jealous of my Lover, and made them resolve to ruine him. The weakenesse of my poore Father exceedingly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the plots of that traitour: For scarce had his Ministers represented to him that for the safety of his estate, and the conservation of his Authority, 'twas fit that the yong Prince were dismissed the Court, but that he consented to it as easily as if he had never knowne nor loved him. For my selfe that had far lesse passion for the State then for my Lover, no sooner heard the newes, but I tore my haire, scratched my face, blasphemed against heaven, and violating all that I owed to the best Father in the world, accused his Councell and himselfe of treason and tyranny. But understanding from whence my affliction had his beginning, I turned all my rage on the perfidious Nephizus, I told him such things, and spoake to him in such a manner as might well have put him from the desire of possessing me, if he had not had that desire of obtaining me for no other cause but to make me prodigiously miserable. Muley Hassen had received commandment to retire himselfe to the Towne of Mezila which confines with the deserts of Numidia, and to depart without seeing the King nor my sister nor my selfe. Yet he obeyed not the last of these commands. For the same night that he was to be gone, deceiving his spies and guarde, he came into my closet, where I staied for him with my deare Atalida. As soone as he came in he cast himselfe rather as dead then alive at my feete, and when I went to raise him I fell a side, and so on my bed in a swound. Atalida had much ádoe to make us come to our selves: At last by vertue of some Essences I came from my fainting, and seeing Muley stretched as dead, I lay downe by him, and did whatsoever my griefe and love advised me.</p>
               <p>But what said I? No, no, I did nothing of what they ordained me to doe, since I dyed not with griefe for such a separation. When he had recoliected his spirits, he was ashamed to see himselfe as he was. He presently arose, and setling him on his knees, Madam said he, if those that banish me from the Court, had considered how far unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy I am of the honour I receive from your goodnesse, I should be the first that would approove their sentence, and receive with a benediction a thing which they had done with so much justice. But since neither the greatnesse of your merit, nor the defects in me, have not beene the motives of their condemnation, be pleased that I complaine of their vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lence, and that seperating the interest of my Lord the King from those of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, I say aloud, that to deale with me as I am dealt withall, is to abuse the regall power. O how those jealous and ambitious Officers had obliged me, if in putting me from the troubles of the State they had not banished me from you. Tis the losse of the sight of yourfaire eyes, and not my credit that I lament. I shall see you no more Enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramita, and in the dreadfull Deserts whereto I am exiled, the feare to be blotted out of your memory, as a fearefull Monster will continually war with me. Let that feare cease with your teares I replyde weeping, what ever becomes of Ennoramita she will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies yours. O how advantagious are my disgraces (said he presently) and how happy doe my misfortunes make me, since by their meanes I have obtained that which I hoped not to have gotten by the services of all my life. Yes Muley (said I) in interrupting him, Ennoramita is thine, and beleeve for certaine that she will never be any others. Wee parted, after reciprocall protestations of constancy and fidelity; and whilst my deare Muley got to the Deserts of Numidia, the Embassadours of Morocco hastened their Journey and arrived at Thunis. They had divers Audiences of the King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters &amp; after the Declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Heley &amp; Abdelmelec had sent by which Nephizus was put in possession of the Kingdome of Fez: I was sacrificed to the rage of that Monster, and to the establishment of the greatnesse of the elder Sister. I neglected nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the miseries prepared for me. I would have killed my self, but 'twas not ni my power. I tryed to have fled away, but I was hindred; I fell sick, even to the losse of my sences, but time tooke me from the one and the other malady.</p>
               <p>At last my Sister, that never forsooke me, representing me, that which duty, birth, virtu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet I assure you I lived with my husband as an honest woman should, and unwilling to doe any thing unworthy my spirit, I gave to Nephizus the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54727:79"/>
had gotten to be the absolute Master both of my life &amp; death. I obeyed him therefore punctually, and did that out of duty which I could not out of love. After I was at home with him he askd me most unworthily &amp; every day gave me so unreasonable commands that I beleeve he did it not but of purpose to make me disobey him &amp; so by consequence to have cause to abuse me. But I was so ready and obedient, that he was put to his wits to finde a pretext to make me feele his fury. I spoke not to any one of the Knights of his Court. I was invironed with a circle of black slaves that watched after my shortest treadings. I went not out of my chamber, and had no diversion but the remembrance of my deare Muley.</p>
               <p>Sometimes my hangman would come where I was with a sole designe to afflict me, and then he entertained with slave, infamous, prostitute, and seeing me melt into teares, I knew (would he say) that one day I should bring downe that pride which hath so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten abused me, and avenge my selfe at pleasure of thy impudence and scorne. Weepe wretch, weepe, not out of anger to see thy selfe subjected to my command, but rather out of griefe for rendring thy selfe unworthy of my love. One day when he had extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily abused me, what then (said I, enough resolutely) obliged thee to charge thy selfe with me? The longing I had to be avenged on thine insolence, replide he, I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to raigne absolutely over thee, that so by a long punishment I might chastice thy disdaines and scoffs. Never hope to regaine that which thou hast so brutishly disdained. The time is past wherein I was so weake as to suffer my self to be caught by thy so little beauty. I am thy deadly enemy; expect no other usage from me, but that which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and vengeance shall advise me to. Kill me then (said I) and to glut thy fury fully, exercise thy fire and sword, doe thy worst of cruelty on this miserable body. No, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the hangman, I will have thee live that thou maiest dye often, and that thou maiest doe a long pennance for thine offences. An excesse of choler transporting me at these last threatnings: O Muley Hassen where art thou now? Cride I. Why seest thou not that which she endures whom thou lovest so much? You must thinke, that on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the cruell Nephizus conceived not that I spoake of my Lover; for he answered me coldly, that Muley Hassen was too farre off to heare me, and that if I hoped for none other helpe but from him, I might well prepare my selfe for a long time of patience. This horrible converse being thus ended he left me, and was three dayes before I saw him againe.</p>
               <p>But he returned on the fourth, after infallibly he had mused on the name of Muley Hasten, and entring my chamber with his wonted brutality: Well, tost one, (said he) you cannot suppresse your ancient laciviousnesse. 'Twas your Gallant you called on the other day, and not thy Father, I know it, and know more (he lied falsly in saying so) that thou subornest my slaves to carry newes of thee to that infamous Exile, and that thy servants secretly intertaine the intelligences which thou had'st in thy Fathers Court. I will quickly breake this execrable commerce, and make an exemplary punishment on thy impudent Confidents. As soone as he had ended these reproaches he left me, and five or six dayes after sent me word by an old blackmoore woman which he had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for my Governesse, that I should prepare me to leave the City of Fez. I doubt not but you (as I heare) have travelled through Africa, know very well how pleasant the Territory of Fez is, as well for the Rivers of Buragrag, Juraven, and of Suba, which water it on three sides, as for a great number of Cities, Burgs, and Villages. Towards the South the Champio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stretcheth even to the foot of Mount Atlas &amp; the ancient Kigns of Fez have built for the pleasure of solitude and hunting many Pallaces at the entry of those high mountaines. 'Twas in one of those prisons that my Tyrant resolved to make me end my dayes. He brought me thither himselfe, and colouring this dismall Journey with a very serious pretext, that he went to drive back some Ara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

 to favour me. I understand what you would say replyde Nephizus: That fortune since she can take nothing from you, leaves you somewhat at quiet, and gives over wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, since she findes no more subject whereon to exercise her action. There is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing true (answered the Dervis) in your interpretation, but the favours I receive from fortune (if to accord with the ordinary manner of speech wee must call that fortune which is a pure <unclear>effect</unclear> of the providence which governes in heaven) are more sensible then you can imagine them. She doth only oblige me in ceasing to afflict me; but she obligeth me <unclear>effectively</unclear>, and gives me at least the sight of those felicities which I have <unclear>heeretofore</unclear> enjoyed. That is (said Nephizus) because you now not being distracted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these obscure and solitary places, your imagination so strongly represents you the happinesse which you enjoy no more, that it seemes you enjoy them yet. I have farre more then that (said the Dervis) for I recover in this Cave, and really enjoy the good which I lost in the world. Heereupon I began to speake, and desiring to engage the Hermit to relate his Story: You must (Father said I) if you please, take the paines to expresse your self more plainly, if you desire to give me the satisfaction of understanding you. I would say, that passing from these generall propositions to circumstances more particular; you would let me know, of what nature was the happinesse you have lost, and of what kinde that is which you have recovered in your solitude. I will obey you (Madam) said the Dervis, though by an expresse commandment from the spirit who conducted me into this Desart, if it be forbidden me to publish the secrets of my solitary retreat. Know then that I am the Son of a Shepheard, who in times past had great and numerous flocks, and many strong inclosed pastures in the large Plaines of Numidia. The care he had of his beloved sheepe was the cause of his death, for being too wilfull in the pursuite of some wilde beastes that would devoure them, he himselfe became a prey to those savage Monsters. I was left an Orphant by that dismall accident, and my tender yeares being not proportionable to the paines that it behooved me to take for the preservation of my flock; I left them to the mercy of their enemies, and went wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and desolate through places and Countryes to me altogether unknowne. This mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and wandring life having brought me to such an extremity, that I wished for death a hundred times in a day. Our great Prophet all shining with as many rayes as he had when he was carried up into heaven, appeared to me on the sea strand, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me up from where I was fallen, take heart (said he) and be not weary of living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The superiour power is mooved with thy disfavours, and see, his comforts come show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring downe to sweeten the bitternesse of thy life. When he had said thus, he vanished, and presently I saw glistring through a thicke cloud, an Angell more bright then the light it selfe.</p>
               <p>He deigned to be the companion and guide of my Journeys, and within a few dayes bounding them, by a gift he gave me of an infinite more value then all the goods I had lost, promised me too that I should enjoy it till my death.</p>
               <p>Alas! I dare say, and yet hope I blaspheme not, that truth, is no where but in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and that even an Angell is not alwaies to be beleeved, if he be not in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable abode. I held me most certainely assured of the eternity of my happinesse, when my Angell sad and heavy, came and pitifully told me, that a spirit sent from above, for the chasticement of my offences, was to constraine him to forsake me. Ah! My An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell cryde I, doe not leave me! And if I have deserved to be punished, let me yet in my torments have the consolation to behold thee! I have long resisted this black Angell (replyde mine Angell of light) but there is power given him to overcome me, and to torment thee.</p>
               <p>With this my Angell gave a great shrieke, and by force was compelled to leave me to the mercy of the most, to be feared by Demons, that the eternall justice makes use of, for the punishing of mankinde. I lost (with my good Angell) all the happinesse and delight that his company gave me, and have lived ever since so miserable and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that to free me from my persecutor I intended to have killed my selfe. A stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger arme then mine staied that blow, and the voice of my absent Angell, whispring me sometimes in my eare, said, come into the Desart, com into the Desart; 'tis there where thou shalt recover what thou hast lost. I beleeved his promises, and streight forsaking
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54727:81"/>
the world, retyrde me into these Mountaines. The Dervis here stopping, and I know not what new curiosity obliging me to speake: But (said I) since you have been in these Desarts, hath not your Angell performed that which he promised you? He hath not only (replied the Hermit) rendred me the greatest part of the goods I lost; but in an apparition, said thus himselfe: Hope, and live. The expiation of thy offences is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most accomplished. I shall shortly have the freedome to be with thee. I am now here but in feare, since for my too much loving thee, I have gone beyond that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me from above. That faire Angell flew away as soone as he had in this manner comforted me.</p>
               <p>But in that little time he was with me, he gave me that contentment, that to finish where I begun, I can assure you, that at this instant, I am reestablished in the true pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of that good which I lost in the world. Nephizus taking this Dervis for a foole, and that his melancholy and austerity made him take these visions for realities, would needes see how farre his extravagancies would extend; and therefore (said he) but if it be so, as you assure us, how is it possible that in one same time when you suffered so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny afflictions, that at every moment they brought you to the graves brincke, and yet in the meane while (as you say) you enjoyed such happinesse, that you even dare to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with those which our great Prophet prepares for us in Paradise? You might well have resolved the question your selfe, (said the Dervis) if you had looked on me, not by what I seeme, but by that which I am.</p>
               <p>You beleeve I differ not from other men, and 'tis that deceives you. But I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of two different Personages. I have one Nature which is proper to me, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is accidentall. Ther's a strange substance inseperably knit to mine. In a word, another my selfe lives in me, in the same manner as I live in my selfe, and as it happens sometimes, that nature thrusts into the world, bodies, which are so lincked the one to the other, that they cannot be seperated but by their common dissolution, and yet are agitated in one and the same time with divers passions: So you see in me a strange concourse, or to speake as I ought, a miraculous medley of a man, and an Angell; of a man extreamely afflicted, and of another happy. When I speake to you of the infinite pleasures that I enjoy in this solitary life, I talke to you in the person of that most happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rt of my selfe; and when I complaine of my suffrings, I speake to you in the name of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e person afflicted. In full, and not to hold you longer in this unpleasing discourse; I r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>joyce that I am perfectly happy in my selfe, and I am afflicted for being extreamely unfortunate in another.</p>
               <p>Nephizus, gathering nothing from this intricate discourse, but a confirmation of the Dervis his folly, left him, and told me that if I tooke pleasure in the extravagancyes of a mad man, I had found a meanes for my often diversion. Though I was not of the same opinion with the Dervis; yet in shew I forgot not to approve of Nephizus opinion, and to laugh (with him) at the brutishnesse of the Mahometans, that hold those for the beloved of God, from whom the ill disposition of their Organs, or the vapours arising from their spleene have taken away the use of reason. Wee came thence late home to the Pallace, and because I found my selfe much disquieted, I presently retyred into my chamber. There began I deepely to muse on the Dervis his discourse, and finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it extravagant, nor ought that seemed to me very mysterious, I resolved to see him often, and to goe thither so fewly accompanied, that he might have the freedome to discover to me those mysteries which he had yet concealed. Nephizus gave me the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion two dayes after; for he receiving letters from Abdelmelec, by a Mute who served him in those great imployments, he was (of necessity) to goe to Fez, and from Fez to Morocco.</p>
               <p>He left me in the custody of an old Ethiopian Eunuque, who was the most favoured of all his Confidents, and the depositary of all his secrets, commanding him at parting not to let me be out of his sight, nor to suffer me to go abroade, but very seldome. Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissus (so was the name of the Ethiopian) witnessed a great faithfulnesse to his Master; but he did it with so much judgement and respect, that he never gave me cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of him, and still concealed all newes that might increase my afflictions. Now, one day thinking on my Hermit and presently urged with a desire to see him, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54727:82"/>
the secret of his adventures: I intreated Narcissus to bring me to his Grot. He was so confident that I would never undertake any thing, against that which I ought to Nephizus, that he would not deny me a thing which was not precisely forbidden him. I went therefore to the Hermit with five or six of my women, and the Eunuques which garded me.</p>
               <p>As soone as the poore solitary man could speake to me a part: I expected (said he to me) nothing but death; and seeing my selfe deprived of that light which should dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the obscurity of this place, I wished even with passion to see my selfe inveloped with that darkenesse which shall never have end. But I know now that the visible An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, that hath so often given me his assistance is resolved to continue it to me. Surely (Madam) I promise my selfe new favours of his goodnesse, and confesse I have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in suspecting that divine Essence to be as mortall creatures, subject to change and forgetfulnesse. With this the Hermit held his peace, and I that had an extreame desire to know what was hidden under his mysterious speech, told him, that if I understood well the meaning of his discourse, that his fortune was not altered, since he complained then as he had done other times before. How (replied he) should the effects of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune cease, since the cause of it still endures. I complaine, and lament far lesse then I suffer. But since that beyond all hope, my tutelar Angell, restores to me that light that he hath so long hid from me, I make a vow never to be weary of expecting it, and how long soever his absence be, to hope still for the end. If my curiosity (said I) may be satisfied, without your discontent, I intreat you by that which is most deare to us, to let me know what Angell that is which you mention so often, and what that passion is which obligeth you to draw out so misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly your life among these Rocks, and places of fearefull solitude. At this intreaty the Hermit sighed oftentimes, and being a while silent; whereto am I brought (said he in Spanish) if my Angell knowes not what I suffer, and doth not know it selfe? He had scarce ended these words, when I gave so fearefull a shreeke, that all my servants came running to me, and asked what I ailed.</p>
               <p>O heaven (said I) how have I beene affrighted! Me thought I saw at the foote of the Hermit, a Lyon, who awaking at our discourse, was ready to leape at me. The old Narcissus began to laugh at my vision, and advised me to take the aire to divert me. I presently arose to put in action that which he proposed; but the Hermit holding me b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the skirt of my gowne, what (said he in Spanish) faire Princesse, doe you beleeve that by inhabiting these solitary Cavernes I am become one of the furious beasts of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse? Those words were so powerfull a charme to stay me, that I stood as unmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable.</p>
               <p>But the Hermit not perceiving it, can it be (said he in the same language) that you who have been moved with my afflictions when you knew me not, should leave to be piti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ull in the same instant when you knew me. Consider Ennoramita, ô be pleased to take notice that I am not permitted before so many suspected persons to beseech and solicit you further to have commiseration on my miseries. Our common enemies have their eyes over us, and I lose you if I continue to petition you. Stay yet but a moment, and say what shall become of me. I can but answere thee to be lamented Muley (said I in Spanish, for indeed 'twas he) I am too much interdicted to take or to give thee any good councell; yet expect in this place to heare from me. Farewell. With that word, the teares came into mine eyes, and I came out of the Caverne with so extraordinary a sadnesse, that Narcissus besought me to seeke no more so unpleasing a diversion.

               <p>This said, I returned thence speedily to my Prison, and being shut into my chamber with my faithfull Atalida: Ah my friend (said I) what have I heard! What have I seen this day? Why Madam (she replyde) are you yet in feare of your imaginary Lyon? Why do'st not thou know (said I) what I doe? My astonishment proceeds from a more just cause. If you should have found (said she) the unfortunate Muley under the habit of the Hermit, you had not beene more desolate then you are. Thou hast divined (cryde I) 'tis

he <hi>Atalida,</hi> tis <hi>Muley</hi> himselfe. I knew <hi>him</hi> when hee spake Spanish to me. But who hath brought him into these Deserts? What will he doe here? What will become of him? If you would calme your perturbation (answered <hi>Atalida)</hi> I will reply to your questions, and without the preventing your wit with any passionate counsell, will leave you the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to deliberate, your selfe, in a businesse so important. For al that <hi>Atalida</hi> could say to me, yet my transporting must have its course. Above an houre was I in admirations; and turning in my disordered minde a thousand thoughts farre more confused: At last I setled my selfe; and then, said <hi>Atalida,</hi> speaking very low for feare of being heard: Tis fit that I discover that which great considerations have forc'd me to conceale from you. I confesse, I knew <hi>Muley</hi> was in the <hi>Grott</hi> where you met him. For some six moneths since, desperate of ever hearing, any more, ought concerning you, he resolv'd to take on him the habite of a <hi>Dervis,</hi> and under that vaile to come himselfe and know whither you had need of his service, or had absolutely forgotten him. Presently he understood the inhumane usage you had from <hi>Nephizus,</hi> and instantly resolv'd to revenge you. But letting me know his generous design by his faith full <hi>Acmett</hi> (who every day is here, for wearing the same ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of an Hermit as his Master, and comming to aske almes, he hath the liberty to come in when he list) I forced him to undertake any thing without your permission, and assur'd him that I would worke things soe, that he should have the happinesse to see you. I durst not tell you of this, because [knowing your severity] I imagined that rather then to suffer <hi>Muley</hi> so neare to you, you would have consented to his death, nay even to your owne. All that I could doe, for the consolation of that miserable man, was to winne you insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to visit the Hermits of you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After <hi>Atalida</hi> had thus spoken, I began to be very angry with her, and threatned to write to <hi>Nephizus</hi> what dis-service she had done him. The generous Mayde, without leaving her former coolenesse, answered, and that very sharply, I should be angry for being angry; and that I was to remember, how in parting from <hi>Morocco,</hi> I had absolutely commanded her, not to abandon <hi>Muleys</hi> interest; but to serve him, notwithstanding all or any of my commands to the contrary. But tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (said shee yet) that you know he is here; advise and bethinke you what you will have him doe. If you will command him, he will breake open your prison, free you from your Tyrant, and bring you back to <hi>Tunis.</hi> In a word, he will kill the Tyrant in the midst of your guards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the very armes of his Father. Hold thee (cried I) execrable <hi>Atalida:</hi> Hast thou no otherwise profited by my precepts and Example? Dost thou not know that the only thought of those crimes thou proposest, is an offence that cannot be expiated but by death. I am ill used I confesse, but he that treats me so, hath right to doe it. My prison and fetters are sacred; If I doe but consent to have them broken, I am a miscreant and jmpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Tis true <hi>Nephizus</hi> is a Tyrant, but tis a Tyrant which the Lawes Authorize, and which the Heavens and my honour command me to respect. What would you have <hi>Muley</hi> doe, then replyed (rudely enough) <hi>Atalida!</hi> Let him returne to <hi>Mezila</hi> said I, and suffer forme, as I doe for him. You may well take the paynes [if you please) answered my deare <hi>Atalida-</hi>to give him that command your selfe, and you were best to resolve on't, for he will never obey it, if he receive it not from your owne mout<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I shall have power enough for that, (said I) and though I shall seem to wrong <hi>Nephizus,</hi> in seeing him, yet having never given him ought but my body, I doe not think that in speaking with <hi>Muley,</hi> I take from him any thing that is his. But this interview must be quickly, that I may be freed of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable man before the returne of <hi>Nephizus,</hi>

               <p>This resolution was executed the fifth day after it was taken. I made a match of hunting with <hi>Narcissus,</hi> and fortune was so favourable, that the Lion we had in chase, took the way to <hi>Muleys</hi> Cavern, and was long fought withall in the straight way that lead to the Cavern. I found my selfe almost alone at his death, and comming then from horsback with <hi>Atalida</hi> and two of my guard, I told them that I would goe see the Hermit til <hi>Narcissus</hi> came to us. I found him indeed rather dead then alive; The manner of my last parting from him, had been so sensible to him, that he avowed, but for the designe he had to free me from my bondage, he had freed himselfe of his life.

Let me rather entertaine you with the extreame fidelity and brave actions of <hi>Muley.</hi> He had not been three monethes from the solicitudes of <hi>Atlas,</hi> when I heard by a <hi>Courier</hi> which my too-unsensible father had sent to <hi>Nephizus,</hi> that he was set on by Land and Sea and invested on all sides, by the forces which the great Turke had sent into <hi>Africa.</hi> That his Estate was as a prey, if he were not quickly assisted: and expecting from day to day to be besieged in <hi>Tunis,</hi> he intreated his Allyes, and all his neighboures, to prepare a pui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssant succour, and thinke seriously how to deliver all <hi>Africk</hi> who would meet her train in that of <hi>Tunis.</hi> This Messenger came to <hi>Nephizus</hi> at <hi>Morocco:</hi> But he tooke little care to goe to Succour his father in Law that was obstinately busied about the ruin of his owne father. This <hi>courier</hi> was seconded by many others, who all instantly pressed for aide, but return'd all without obtaining any. And when <hi>I</hi> thought to have heard of the taking of <hi>Tunis, I</hi> understood that it had been miraculously reliev'd by the valour of a Man, who with a potent army of <hi>Arabians</hi> was come out of <hi>Numidia. I</hi> asked his name, and was answered that he would never make it knowne. But to enhance his actions, they told me that he had cut in peices the Turkish Army, burned a great many of his ships, pursued the Runawayes even to <hi>Argier,</hi> inhartned the inhabetants of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and made knowne to the King my Father, that he desired no other rewards for so generous an action, then the honour to have done it. I caused this Messenger very particularly to be demanded, whither they could know nothing concerning that man, from some one or other of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,</hi> or whether he had not caused his troopes to carry some Device or marke by which he might be knowne? The Messenger sent me word that the generous stranger had so exactly caused his Secret to be observed, that none of them all had discovered him, and that in all the <hi>Ensignes</hi> of his army there was only seene two <hi>Arabian</hi> words, which signified <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> Assoone as <hi>Atalida</hi> had tould me that paticularity, doubt no more of it said shee, 'tis <hi>Muley.</hi> He hath kept promise with me, and hath kept it so much the more generously, in that forgetting the indignities he receiv'd from my father, he would by his deliverance begin those brave actions I advised him to These great newes were not alone the cause that confirmed me in the opinion <hi>I</hi> had of my <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:</hi> Many more, as good, were brought me in less then four moneths, &amp; the King my father being never able to know from whence was come to him so powerfull a defender, nor who he was writ to me oftentimes; that he beleiv'd, it was an Angell which his prophet had sent him, to reproove the Princes of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> and his other Allyes, and throw an infamy on them for their perfidies and ingratiude.

A whole yeare <hi>I</hi> continued in this incertainty.</p>
               <p>But when I thought on it least, I found my selfe in full liberty; for my old <hi>Eunuch</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a command (which I believe was false) told me, that he was ingag'd to goe to the King my father in Law. I was much surpriz'd at this Iourney, yet imagining that he did it not without order, I thought it was from <hi>Nephizus,</hi> By little and little the most of my guard followed their Captaine, so that in lesse then eight or ten dayes, I saw my company reduced only to those servants I had brought with me from <hi>Tunis. Atalida</hi> was the first that told me of so incredible a novelty; but to make me beleeve it, they were forced (as I might say) to make me touch it with finger. When I was put out of all doubt, I stood so astonished at it, that (after I had been a long while in re-collecting my selfe) I cried out as if I had been in some great danger, and told <hi>Atalida</hi> that the liberty they gave me after so extraordinary a fashion, threatned me with some mischance far greater then that of my prison. <hi>Atalida</hi> did what she could to put off this imagination; But I knew too well the pernicious nature of <hi>Nephizus,</hi> either to beleive him capable of doing good, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent himsselfe of the misc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet [Madam since you wil have it so] let us imagin that all men, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their inclination of doing ill, doe already doubt of your virtue, and deny you those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, which your mis-fortune should receive from their charity. Have you not in your selfe a Comforter, that is a thousand times better then all those which you can expect from the world? The quiet minde, which the testimony of your conscience gives you, should make you heare without any feeling, nay with neglect, all that calumny it selfe can invent against you. These perswasions tooke not away all my feares, but (I confesse) they did the greatest part of them. Taking therefore a resolution that might serve for my justification, <hi>I</hi> left the Pallace, wherein <hi>I</hi> had been neere three yeares a prisoner, and went to <hi>Fez</hi> in an equipage answerable to my present condition. All the people shewed their love to me by their teares, and their feare by their Silence. Every where as <hi>I</hi> passed, <hi>I</hi> met with multitudes of men and women, which by their actions made me well understand that my misfortune could not be greater. When <hi>I</hi> came to the Pallace, <hi>I</hi> found there such an universall solitude and consternation, that <hi>I</hi> was faine to looke long time to meet with a man to whom I might speake. At last the <hi>House-keeper</hi> appeared, but to all the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I propos'd him, he gave mee no other answer then in shrugging up his shoulders, and shewing by his feare, that he was forbidden to talke, yet must I (said I then a loude) and will (happen what may) put an end to this silence, and know what <hi>Nephizus</hi> intends shall become of mee. What by prayers, urgings, and teares, at last I got one of <hi>Nephizus</hi> cheif Officers to tell me where his Master was, and the commands he had received from him; and so he answered me in sighing; that his Master was out of his country, and that befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I stood not to deliberate on what I had to doe, but the thought of Revenge presenting it selfe, advised me, to hold no more faith with him that had first violated that toward me, nor to take into my thought [as my Lord] that man who had used me as his Enemy; but (for the interest of my birth and Innocence) to pursue, even to the death, that miscreant who gloryed in the ruine of them both. This Councell <hi>I</hi> followed. Yet unwilling to make use of those meanes for that revenge, which might be condemned of good men, <hi>I</hi> thought it fit for me to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the protection of the King my Father, and to employ noe other assistance then his, for the obtaining a satisfaction from him that had so much wronged me. <hi>I</hi> therefore quickly got to <hi>Tunis</hi> and throwing my self at the Kings feet, besought him not so to have compassion of a daughter whom he had made miserable, as to resent the injuries he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Prince of <hi>Fez,</hi> in the persons of his children. That Prince, who before my marriage, <hi>I</hi> had found so jndulgent &amp; Debonayr, even to an excess, losing in such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, thatfeeling which nature &amp; honour should have given him, was inexorable to my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and insensible of the affronts <hi>I</hi> had received from <hi>Nephizus. I</hi> confesse to you that his impassibility was insupportable to me, and in the first stirrings of my greif, there escaped from me some words that were not so respectfull, as became the duty of a daughter, and my answeres put <hi>Muley-Hassen</hi> into such a fury, that before all his court he accused me to be the cause of the losse of my husband, the disorder of two Royall families, and many other offences. In conclusion, he not only refused me that assistance and protection which I intreated from him, but commanded me to depart from <hi>Tunis,</hi> and get back to finde out my Husband, &amp; regain his favour, if <hi>I</hi> desired that he should acknowledg me for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I see well (said I to him) that I must onely expect to have from heaven that succour which nature denyes me. Sir, I will obey your commands, &amp; since I find my self a stranger in mine owne country, and odious even to him that gave me life, I abandon, without sorrow, both my native soyle and my father, and betake me to the most dreadfull Deserts of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae,</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54727:84"/>
to doe penance for those faults which the guilty throw on my Innocence. The same day that I spake thus to <hi>Muley,</hi> I went secretly out of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and without making use of that retreat which my Sister in particular offered me, went as farre as Numidia, to hearken after my faithful <hi>Muley.</hi> There I understood that he was gone to assist the King of Egypt, &amp; that he had cut in peices two of the greatest armies that ever the Turks had sent against the <hi>Mummelucs.</hi> I sent divers Messengers to him to let him know the need I had of him: but not having the patience to attend their return, I crossed a great part of <hi>Numidia</hi> and without making my selfe known, imbarked at the first Port where I found shipping. I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence going up the <hi>Nyle</hi> the nearest I could to <hi>Cairo,</hi> some dayes after I came to the Court of <hi>Tomombay,</hi> and found all in a great rejoycing for the great advantages they had gotten over the <hi>Turke.</hi> The name of my Lover was there in such veneration, that he was called by the Prince himself, the deliverer of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This was truly to me a great comfort in mine adversities, to heare him so worthily spoken of whom I loved; but it was a redoubling of my greife, when they told me that he was gone from the Court, without taking his leave of the Prince, and not giving notice to his most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident friends of the necessity of his departing. Deare <hi>Muley,</hi> said I to my selfe, this suddain departing gives me a rare proofe of thy obedience. The love of mee hath made thee shut thine eyes to all other considerations, and thou hast beleeved, that thou shouldst gaine farre greater Empires then this, if thou could'st preserve me. Hoping therefore for no more in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> I returned to <hi>Tunis,</hi> and after I had staid there some dayes unknown, I re-imbarked me upon the assurance <hi>Atalida</hi> gave me, that I should not heare any newes of <hi>Muley</hi> but in <hi>Fez</hi> or <hi>Morocco.

But for al I could doe, my diligences and perquisitions were bootlesse. For <hi>Nephizus;</hi> they told me that being desperatly in love with the Princesse <hi>Ennoramita</hi> his wife, and not indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring she should be in the custody of the King her Father, he had besieg'd him in one of his Fortresses, to take her. But after the winning the place, and not finding her, he was neere dead for sorrow, and presently put to Sea to follow her.

                  </gap>hat <hi>Nephizus</hi> was gone to the <hi>Canaries</hi> with that pretended <hi>Ennoramita.</hi> I had Learn'd from <hi>Fame,</hi> that you were not only King of them, but the defendor of the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the Avenger of persecuted virtue, and the Exterminator of Monsters and Tyrants. And for that reason, I resolv'd to take you for the Judg of my cause, and to implore your valor for the exemplary chastising of <hi>Nephizus</hi> perfidies and impostures. The <hi>Princess</hi> of <hi>Tunis</hi> could goe no further; for <hi>Atalida,</hi> in clapping her hands and shewing an extreame asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, cryed out that the old Eunuch <hi>Narcissus</hi> was come into the court of the Pallace with a great company of Trumpets and Armed men. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> not able to beleeve the astonished Damsel, ran to one of her Chamber windowes, which look'd into the Court, and knowing <hi>Narcissus;</hi> Permit not [if you please, said shee to <hi>Polexander]</hi> that any wrong be done to me in a place where you are the Master. Feare nothing <hi>Madam,</hi> answered <hi>Heroe:</hi> whosoever dares to think of losing the respect that is due to you, shall not doe it unpunished. And not only here, but wheresoever else you shall please to make use of mine arme, I shall hinder, as much as in me lieth, your enemies from wronging your vertue.</p>
               <p>Scarce had he ended these words, but the Captaine of his guard came into <hi>Ennoramitas</hi> Chamber, and told him that a <hi>Herald,</hi> sent with a great trayne from <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> Prince of <hi>Morocco,</hi> to all the Courts of <hi>Vrope</hi> &amp; <hi>Africk,</hi> requested instantly that he might be permitted to acquit himselfe in the presence of his Majesty, of that Commission his Prince had given him.

whats that <hi>Madam,</hi> replied the Prince. Tis [said she] that I may have some time to speake with <hi>Narcissus,</hi> before his Masters command hath ingaged him to any extravigancy. You shall doe what you please, (answeared <hi>Polexander)</hi> but let his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to mee be what it will, he shall not want of receiving as good entertainement at my hands, as if he had brought me the confirmation of that which <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> sometime promised me. I know that your thoughts are not capable of any imbecillity, (said the Princess of <hi>Tunis;)</hi> but I am sure withall, that the minde of <hi>Narcissus</hi> is not incapable of feare. As long as he shall imagine that you know not the cause of his coming, he will be reasonable enough to tell us, what is become of <hi>Nephizus.</hi> But assoone as he hath declar'd his charge, and by consequence, shall beleeve he hath offended you; he will thinke of nothing after, but how to get out of your power, and in his apprehension, and feare of being chastis'd, will not even know where he is. <hi>Polexander</hi> Laughing at the good opinion <hi>Ennoramita</hi> would worke in him of <hi>Narcissus</hi> courage, commanded he should be brought to him, assoone as he should be in case to be seene. The Eunuch, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his nation a certaine proud severity, refus'd all that was offer'd him by <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> Officers, and could never be wonne to see him alone. <hi>Polexander</hi> hearing of these things in the presence of <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> shee intreated him to let <hi>Narcissus</hi> come to him with all his trayne; and told him [smiling,] that before that <hi>Ethiopian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Oration, shee would pesent her selfe to him in the quality of a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, and accusing the other of his ill treating her, would so force him to put by his gravity. Our <hi>Heroe</hi> approov'd of all that <hi>Amatontha</hi> desir'd, and going into the hall of the Princess lodgings, which was already fill'd with his Guard and other Officers, there receiv'd the venerable <hi>Narcissus.</hi> Scarce had the Eunuch made his reverences and first complements, but <hi>Ennoramita</hi> appear'd in the Hall, with a most desolate and afflicted countenance, and casting her selfe at <hi>Polexanders</hi> feet, besought him to give her his protection against many Enemies that did unjustly persecute her. I understood my Lord [said shee,] after the Prince had taken her up] that there was newly arrived in this place, one of the principall Agents of my Tyrants. I therefore beseech you, by the name you have gotten of the most Just Prince of the world, to harken to my complaints; and to beleeve, that I have gone a hundred and fifty leagues by sea in hope that you will grant me that, which my Country, my Parents, my Friends, and my <hi>Allyes</hi> have refus'd me. In saying so shee cast her eyes on <hi>Narcissus,</hi> who instantly knew her, and after shee had a while look'd on him, See [said shee to our <hi>Heroe]</hi> in taking the Eunuch by the hand, an inreproachable witnesse of those verities I am to tell you, and though he hath been of the number of those that have tormented me, yet I have nothing to say to him; for I know how farre the duty and faith of a servant bindes him to his Master. He belong'd to the Prince of <hi>Fez,</hi> and being answerable and obliged to him for a great Fortune, he could not lawfully consider any thing but his Interests. I acquit him also from all those miseries he hath made me suffer, but yet upon condition that he tell you before me, why he forsook me under a false pretext, whence 'tis for these two yeares and more, I have neither heard news of him nor of the King his Master, and for what cause <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizus</hi> hath unworthily repudiated me.</p>
               <p>The Old <hi>Narcissus</hi> hearing these last words of <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> lifted his hands to his eies to cope thence his teares; and having often sighed: My Lord (said he to <hi>Polexander)</hi> cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself at his feet) I should be unworthy that Name of a faithfull Servant, which this Princesse vouchsaf'd to give me, if even in that trouble and astonishment which her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence causeth in me, I did not preserve enough of Judgement, to give to her Innocence that testimony she expects from my mouth. True Sir, this Princesse deserves to be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, since she is unjustly prosecuted. But J am deceiv'd in saying so: She hath no more need of protection, for shee hath not any persecuter. <hi>Narcissus,</hi> in saying so renew'd his teares, and was a long time ere he could dry them. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> moved with the sorrow of that Man who had alwayes mildly treated her, besought <hi>Polexander</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into his Closset, that <hi>Narcissus</hi> might tell him in private those things that were not fit to be published. The Eunuch joyn'd his intreaties to those of the Princesse: and <hi>Polexander</hi> arising led her into his chamber; <hi>Narcissus</hi> follow'd them, and every one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

with a long current of tears, on this manner began the History of <hi>Nephizus</hi> Secrets.</p>
               <p>That eternall Justice which is not allwaies fear'd, because it is not allwayes busied in the punishing of wicked men, hath at last made the poor Prince of <hi>Fez</hi> to feele, that it chastiseth with a great severity, when it long time defers his punishments. That power made him fall into the pit, which himselfe had digged, and to make it selfe re-doubtableto those Princes that live, hath suffered one of the greatest Princes of <hi>Affrica</hi> to dye so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably, that even to this houre we can know no other thing of him, but that he is dead. What doe you tell me, cride <hi>Perselida?.</hi> What <hi>Narcissus,</hi> is the Prince of <hi>Fez</hi> dead! He is dead Madam (reply'd the Eunuch weeping) and all that <hi>I</hi> can say of his unhappy end is, that he hath served for food to the Monsters of the Ocean. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> made it well appeare, on this occasion, that a generous Soule is out of her Element, when she is constraind, either to resent her of the injuries, or to deny her compassion to those which are fallen (though justly) into any mis-fortune. No sooner was the Princesse assured of the death of her greatest enemy, but she lost the memory both of all the wrong she had received, and the protestations she had made to be avenged for them. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd a while recollected in her selfe, and casting downe her eyes, would have hid the teares that a true greife drew from her. At last, she declared her selfe [and after divers sighes] I confesse (said she, with a marvelous moderation) that I cannot chuse but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle the unfortunate death of that young Prince. J forgive him, with all my heart, the wrong he hath done me; and beseech the dreadfull Majesty, before whom he is to give an account of the actions of his life, not to deale with him according to the rigor of his Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice. <hi>Polexander</hi> admir'd this excesse of goodnesse, and praysing so fair a change, intreated <hi>Perselida</hi> to be pleas'd that he might be cleard of a thing he had heard in <hi>Bajazets</hi> Jsland. The Princesse replyde, that he might doe all that he thought fit. Thereupon, <hi>Polexander</hi> tooke the old Eunuch by the hand, and intreated him to tell, why <hi>Nephizus</hi> had forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his country and his wife; and whither it were on the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, or the maine <hi>Ocean</hi> that they thought he had suffered shipwrack. <hi>I</hi> can satisfy your curiosity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyde <hi>Narcissus,</hi> and in doing so, shall acquit my selfe of that whereto my Soveraigne Lady lately engaged me. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> having bestow'd farre more then she owed to the memory of her marriage, set her neer to <hi>Polexander,</hi> and <hi>Narcissus</hi> related to them what they desired to know, in these termes.

This Attempter had the successe he deserved, for <hi>Nephizus</hi> forces were discomfited and himselfe taken prisoner. But the too indulgent <hi>Hely,</hi> unwilling to consent either to the death or imprisonment of his rebellious Sonne; satisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with keeping him under guard some few dayes; after which never remembring what had passed, he shewed him more love and more confidence then before, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undoe him, the too facile and weak <hi>Hely,</hi> shewed him (I dare not say indiscreetly) a young wonder, of whom [as old as he was] he was become passionately amorons. I would tell you the story of that fatall beauty, because tis most strange; but it serving nothing to my purpose, I will content my selfe with the relating to you, that she ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the coasts of <hi>Morrocco</hi> in the midst of the flames of a burning ship, as presaging the fires and flames that she was to kindle in that country. <hi>Nephizus</hi> had noe sooner seen that stranger, but he not only trod under foot the respect he was bound to carry to the passion of his father, but he forgot that which he lawfully ought to love, and what he had other times affected. The desire to enjoy this stranger wholy possessing him and making him to lose all reason, he thought that by cunning and glosing, it might be easie for him to come to the End of his pretentions; and being young and faire should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much difficulty get this marvell out of the hands of the good old man his Father. But after he had imployed in it all his wits, and all his confidents, he found himselfe farre short of his reckoning. For having to doe with an old Man, jealous, suspectfull, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall,

and by consequence that was igno rant in nothing that was to be practisd to win a woman; his wyles were soone discovered, and he (to save his life) constrained to fly.</p>
               <p>At that time he writ to mee by one of his Mutes, that I should shut you up more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then before, (and in saying thus, he bow'd his head to <hi>Ennoramita's</hi> foot) that I should not suffer you to be seene by any body, and on the penalty of my life, I should not suffer any person whatsoever to come neere the Advenues of your prison. He writ me not the cause of that rigorous command, but I discovered it, since <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> took me into his service. I will tel it you, because it serves for the cleering of many things which may have come to your knowledg; and besides having oftentimes examin'd it, I found in it so much I know not what, of incredible, and so prodigious, that I call it doubt so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as I thinke on it, though? have had the confirmation from a thousand witnesses worthy of faith. See what twas, and Judge whether I have cause to speake as I doe. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizus</hi> inflam'd with love, with Despite, Anger, and Shame, arm'd more powerfully and openly then he dar'd doe till then, and having gotten the principall Townes, to give co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to his detestable rebellion, publish'd a Manifest against <hi>Hely,</hi> which I Cannot remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but my hayr riseth an end with the horror thereof. Among the great number of crimes whereof he accused that poore Prince, he reproach'd him with the stealing of you away to satisfy his execrable lust, and maintayned that she whom they cunningly call'd the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger <hi>Iphidamanta,</hi> was the true <hi>Perselida, Amatonta, Ennoramita</hi> Princess of <hi>Tunis.</hi> The people were not the sole, who, suffering themselves to be corrupted by that malignity which is but too naturall to them, gave credit to so prodigious a calumny, but many of the principal in the state either beleev'd it, or to have cause to take up armes, made shew to beleeve it. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> said in good Company, that for the manner of all his Fathers living, there was nothing in matter of love but might be credited of him. And the too-Amorous <hi>Hely,</hi> hearing this accusation, was in doubt of the truthes which the stranger <hi>Iphidamanta</hi> had assured to him. But being againe confirm'd by her selfe, in his former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, he caused an answer to be made to his Sons Manifest, to justify him from so black a supposition; and thinking to avenge himselfe, commanded all his followers not call the faire stranger by any other name then <hi>Ennoramita;</hi> and he observ'd the same he commanded others, and by this trick of youth made that name so famous, that the people of <hi>Morocco</hi> will not in a long time forget it.</p>
               <p>So (if it be lawfull for mee to speake with that boldnesse) by the folly of <hi>Hely,</hi> and the malice of <hi>Nephizus,</hi> your Name <hi>(Madam)</hi> and imagination, became as the fatall fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand, which the Enemy <hi>Demon</hi> of our peace put into the hands of the Father and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to make desolate the most flourishing Provinces of all <hi>Africa.</hi> In a word, after their writings, they came to blowes. The Sonnes gave the Father Battle, overcame him, thrice made him fly shamefully from <hi>Morocco,</hi> and compell'd him to seeke for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in <hi>Guargetssem,</hi> to escape from their fury. Yet could he not be secure, for a little time after he was be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Assoone as he was Master of the fortress, he would needes visit it all. He found his father in a Bed dangerously wounded, but seeing not <hi>Iphidamanta</hi> with him, he went to search for her, even to the bottom of the <hi>Casamatts.</hi> He was not like to meet her; for shee fled by sea with one <hi>Osmin,</hi> who within these few yeares, by meanes of his exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive favour, had been the pertext of all the revolts, and all the Warres of the two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The flight of that stranger had neere been the death of <hi>Hely,</hi> for <hi>Nephizus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at her losse, came with his Cymiterre in his hand, even to the Bed of that miserable King, and vomiting against him all that his sury fild him with, he threatned to passe his Weapon through his Body, if he would not restore to him his wife. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> staid that blow, and pulling his Brother thence by force, forsooke him not, til he saw him in a great repentance for the parricide he would have Committed. But the passion he was in for the faire stranger, and on the other side the remorse of Conscience not suffering him to stay longer at <hi>Morocco,</hi> he got some one to intreate his Father, to give him one of his great ships of warre, and assoone as he had gotten it, he imbarqued himselfe with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54727:86"/>
forty of fifty of his Complices. To tell you whether he intended, or what became of him, is not in my Power; for what enquiry soever I have made, I have not been able to know any thing of him, for a certaine. Some have told me that he was shipwrack'd neare the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and that there were found in the Isle of <hi>Fer</hi> certaine <hi>Arabick</hi> Characters engraven on the barke of a tree, which said, that the miserable <hi>Nephizus,</hi> after he had lost all, was come to seeke his death in that place; Others averred that he had been taken by Pyrats in the same Isle of <hi>Fer,</hi> and that after he had in diverse occasions made shew of his valour among them, they had thought him worthy to command them.</p>
               <p>However, tis but too true that <hi>Nephizus</hi> is dead. I thought to have been one of the first that had heard of it; and assoone as 'twas brought me, I deem'd it fitting to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertize, secretly, <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> of all; and not to give you any suspition of it, I made you beleive that <hi>Hely</hi> commanded me to come to him. Vnder this pretext I left you at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and by great Journeys came to <hi>Arsile</hi> where <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> kept his Court. He knew nothing of the death of his brother, when I told it him. He gave me great thankes for it, and for many reasons conjur'd me to keepe this newes secret. He in the meane while that would make his benefit of it, came to the King his father, and made shew to him of so great a greife for his passed offences, and such a desire to repaire them by his fidelity and obedience; that the mild <hi>Hely</hi> not only restored him to his favour, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most resign'd to him all his authority. Those two Princes might now have named them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves perfectly happy, if the one could have cured himselfe of that passion whereof he still languished, and kept for the pretended <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> and if the other had heen wise enough to free his mind from a fantasie, the most unreasonable that love is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. And now, since that love is the cause of my voyage, 'tis not from the purpose if I tell you what is permitted me to publish. Know then, that above four yeares since, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec</hi> is falne in love with a Princesse which he never saw but in Picture, and which he shall never see otherwise. This Princesse is called <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> and is Queene of an Island farre separated from these heere, and [incomparably] more fair then these are. This little peice of land is called, by some, the celestiall <hi>Island,</hi> by others the Inchanted <hi>Isle,</hi> but the most proper name is that of the <hi>Innaccessible Island,</hi> because all the Arte of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor the best steerage of the most experienced Pilots of the world can bring a vessell to any Port there, this impossibility doth <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> know, nor is he ignorant that, to love <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> is to love farre more vainly, then to fall in love either with the Sun or or some other Starre. Yet he perseveers in this unreasonable affection, and since he was thus bewitch'd, there hath not pass'd a yeare wherein he hath not undertaken one or two voyages with an endeavour to get to a place, which every day he himselfe calls <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible.</hi> Tis not long since, that [to content his sencelesse passion] he caused to be built the most rich and brave vessell that [may be] ever sayld on the main <hi>Ocean.</hi> But scarce was he imbarqued, when by an unexpected surprize he was beset by eight or ten sayl of Pyrats and enforc'd (spight of all his valour) to give way to their number; and after a bloody skirmish got from them, in spight of all their obstacles, by vertue of his armes: Yet esteeming farre lesse that which he had sav'd, then what he had lost, he even thought to have dyed with greif when he saw himselfe in safety, because he remembred that one of the Pyrates by craftinesse had stoln from him his buckler: and they were faine by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to keep him from returning to fight, for he would die or recover that Buckler, and would do it the more earnestly because he had caus'd to be painted on it the Portraict of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> Though <hi>Polexander</hi> thought that <hi>Narcissus</hi> spoke of him without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and noted the truth through the fable which the pride of the Prince of <hi>Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co</hi> had invented to disguise the fight wherein he lost his buckler; neverthelesse he would not make appeare to the old Ethiopian that he had any knowledge of it.

               <p>The King my Master (said the Eunuch) long time pursued the ravishers of his treasure, but being neither able to come up to them, nor to know whence they were, He returned to <hi>Morocco,</hi> with an intent rather to lose him selfe then leave the portraict of <hi>Alcidiana</hi> in the custody of a company of Barbarians. He had a mind to cause a part of his Navy to

be made ready, and to scoure along the seas, from these Isles to that of the Pyrats, to fight with all the vessels he should meete in his course, that by the taking of a great many Rovers, he might heare newes of those that had robd him. But the famous <hi>Abul Ismeron,</hi> who among all the Moores is held for a great Prophet, advised him not to undertake that voyage. I Know, said he, by the rules of mine art, and See it written in heaven as a thing infallible, that in this very place, thou shalt by the solemnity of a publique feast meete with him that hath robd thee of thy Buckler.

But since in that Turney, his principal intent, is not to defend the Beauty of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> for whome he hath oftentimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken armes; but to aveng him on the stealer of his Buckler; He Declares too, that no Knight shall be receiv'd to fight, till (in a Place that shall be appointed for speech) he have first made knowne, who he is, whence he came, who is his Mistris, and have purg'd himselfe by an oath, that he knowes nothing of them that stole the portraict of <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana.</hi>

                  <hi>Narcissus</hi> finishing thus his discourse, humbly besought <hi>Polexander</hi> to be pleas'd that he might publickly performe his charge; and that before all his court he might, at liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> declare the intention of the prince his Master. Our <hi>Heroe</hi> witnessing his being pleased with his civility, gave him leave to doe and say what he would; and for feare (said he) least some one of your traine may accuse you for not, punctually enough, observing what you have been commanded, I will be present at what you doe, and receive my selfe <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec's</hi> challenges. <hi>Narcissus</hi> gave him thanks for his Nobleness, and leaving <hi>Perselida Amatonta</hi> in an estate, that shew'd the agitation and mildenesse of her Spirit, return'd into the hall where his Trumpets and followers staid for him. <hi>Polexander</hi> came thither a little after, and his presence commanding silence to all, and there ranking them in their places, ask'd aloude of <hi>Narcissus</hi> what he had to say to him: Scarce had he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd those words, but the Trumpeters got the windowes of the Hall, and with the noise of their sounding deaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> Prince of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and of <hi>Fez,</hi> and <hi>Trevisan,</hi> Vanquisher of Nations, and Commander over the one and other Sea, knowing that honour is the sole price, for which great Princes, as himself, should be industrious, hath never taken armes, not left the quiet of his Court, but for the possession of a thing so generally desired. He hath attained to what he pretended, and his Paines, Valour, and good Fortune, have acquir'd him so great a name in the world, that he cannot with justice expect any thing more signall from the Knowledg of mankinde. And well truly might he repose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe deliciously under the shadow of his own palmes, if Love, jealous of so great a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, had not robd him of his heart, to the intent to make him lose the quality of invincible. Yet he had recover'd both the one and the other, if by a prodigious adventure, Love had not shut up that Beauty for whome our prince languisheth, in a place which no mortall can attaine unto. This impossibility stirrs up the great heart of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> but it wearies not his constancy. He first aspires to that which his reason tels him he can never arrive at. He Loves, he Desires, but he hopes not to enjoy: and as that Nation which adores the Sun, worship it, because they beleeve it to be the portraict of the Divinity which they cannot see So my Lord the Prince, not being able to hinder the admiration of Pictures, by authority of his example as much as by that of his Scepter, hath caused them even to be ador'd, by those to whome the great prophet <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath for bidden the worshiping of Images. Now it hath happened by a Treason, the most base that was ever committed, that one of those faire pictures, is fallen into the hands
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54727:87"/>
of a miserable Pyrate, who without question, is barbarous enough not to know his good fortune. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> therefore, not enduring that so sanctified a thing should be expos'd to the outrages of the prophane, hath resolv'd to purchase it againe with the price of his owne blood, and couragiously to hazard his life and estate in a warre which his love makes him call Holy. But for as much as he knowes not the aboad of those sacriligious persons who have put their execrable hands on the sacred portraict of her visible divinity he hath sent Spies into all parts to hearken after it; and intreates all Princes and Knights that love honour, to interest themselves in his quarrell, and come quickly to <hi>Morocco</hi> to consult with him of the meanes he should take to make those Pyrates feele a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may be somewhat answerable to the greatnesse of their crime. And in the mean time, if it had chanc'd that any Prince, Moor or Christian, were associated with these theeves, to have gotten by treachery what he thought he could not obtaine by a just combat; he gives him to understand, whatsoever he be, that he holds him for a coward, and a Traytor, if he declare not in the publick place of <hi>Morocco,</hi> that equally forc'd by the feare of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and the violence of his passion, he craftily made himself Master of <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> portraict; But acknowledging his low merit, he repents him of his theft, and restores the faire picture to his lawfull owner. And to the end that no man finde any pretext to fayle at this Assignation, My Lord the Prince sends, for the security of all (Christians and Moores) his Pass-ports and safe conducts in the best form that they can desire.</p>
               <p>In saying thus, he presented to <hi>Polexander</hi> the velume which he had unfolded at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his speech. Our <hi>Her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After he had thus spoken he arose, and giving leave to all the company to depart, retyr'd to the Princesse of <hi>Tunis.</hi> When he had been a while in discourse with her about the extravagancy of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and seeing her extreamely musing and melancholly: I have not much lesse cause then you (said he) to meditate deeply on those strange Adventures which the old <hi>Narcissus</hi> hath related to us. For if they be all true, I find I am involv'd in the follyes of <hi>Nephizus,</hi> and compeld, in respect of my blood, to declare my selfe his Eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But what? (said I) <hi>Nephizus</hi> is dead, and what outrage soever he hath endeavoured to have done me, I will by your Example sacrifice all my choler, and all my resentment on his Tombe. On the other side, I conceive a thing which astonisheth, and rejoyceth me together. For if my conjectures deceive me not, this stranger <hi>Iphidamanta,</hi> (that <hi>Nephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> would have to be taken for you, that he might so get her from his father) is my Sister the Princesse <hi>Cydaria,</hi> and twinne Sister of that Prince from whom she hath borrowed the Name of <hi>Iphidamant.</hi> This being soe, as I cannot almost any more doubt of it, <hi>Cyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> is not dead, as I beleev'd hitherto; and he was not well inform'd who reported to me that she perish'd in a ship all on fire, in sight of the Fortresse of <hi>Guarguetssem.</hi> That which most strongly perswades me, is, the particularity of the burning of <hi>Cydarias</hi> ship agrees well with that which <hi>Narcissus</hi> hath related to us touching the arrivall of the false <hi>Ennoramita</hi> on the coasts of <hi>Morocco.</hi> There is this difference that my servants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to me, how the <hi>Sea</hi> had swallowed up my Sisters vessell: and I finde by <hi>Narcissus</hi> reccitall, that that wherein she was, was cast on the coastes of <hi>Morocco.

But that headstrong and Wilfull Spirit, making use of this unbounded power we had given him, as we doe to all our Generalls, constraind us to follow him in that unhappy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I may well call it unhappy, since wee got nothing but the shame of fayling in our enterprise, and the sorrow for the losse of many of our Captaines. Indeed the cause of that journey deserv'd no better a successe. For it was nothing but a meere extravagancy of a young man, and a blinde desire to enjoy a Christian, call'd the faire <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> who, may be, was no fairer then five or six hundred others that were kept in the Island for the Generalls pleasure.

He accus'd us of Treason and cowardize, and commanded wee should follow, and perish with him, in the mid'st of his Enemies. But when he saw that those which were with him, in Lieu of obeying, brought him back by force into his ships: turne yet at last (said he) turne your weapons on mee, &amp; shew me on this occasion, that it is not falsely, that you have vanted to have an entire &amp; blinde obedience, for those to whom you have given the power to command you. Why doe you stay? No, No, doe not deliberate. Tis farre more just, that you should obey me now, then it was when I forc'd you to follow mee into this country.

Do not think that Ambition or avarice hath made me accept the command, of a company that made vaunt themselves to be Masters of the Ocean. No, my birth gave me titles and riches enough, to have no need of those which you so generously granted mee. Twas only Love, (I say that Love which made me finde such delights in that Miserable estate wherein you found me after my ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack) which hath made me wooe your protection, fight for you, and lastly made me receive with joy, the quality of your Generall. It likewise made me hope that by your assistance, I might one day recover the treasures my owne Father had rob'd me of; it promised me, if I perseverd in my passion, that even the faire and Divine <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> (in spight of all the forces of <hi>Benin)</hi> should be the reward of my constancy. In a word, I secur'd my selfe, that being seconded by your valour, I should finde no obstacle in my enterprizes. And yet you see in the meane time, that a multitude of naked and fearefull people, a Nation so Barbarous, that they know not the use of armes, shamefully pursues mee, drives me into my vessells, and by a prodigy, which carries no shew of truth, in making me lose the hope of my good fortune, hath deprived you of the fruition, of your Honour: But now I have consider'd that you and I have been equall losers; Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the request I made you (my companions) I aske you no more for Death. I only intreate you to have a care of your reputation, and returning altogether to the City of <hi>Benin,</hi> that wee avenge our selves alike of our common Enemies.</p>
               <p>This Spee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch had so great power with all us that were with him, that treading under foot all feare, and all other consideration, wee bid him leade us boldly on, and he should then confesse, that it was not without reason, that he hoped much of our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. Presently wee got into our Shallopps, and landed againe. <hi>Amurat,</hi> ravish'd with our resolution, put himselfe in the front of us, march'd right up to his Enemies, charg'd them, amazd' them, overthrew them, put them to flight and press'd on them

so, that he entred their Towne together with them. We thought we had no more to doe, then to gather the fruit of our Victory, when we saw our selves set on by men far more resolute then those wee had routed. The Prince of <hi>Benin</hi> made them fight and by his example made them so valiant, that 'twas then our turne to retire, and to contract all our pretentions within the only thought of defending our selves. My companions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring rather to dye in their conquest, then to survive to their losse, made a vow not to abandon their stations, and almost all of them made it good, for there died aboue two thirds of them on the place. <hi>Amurat</hi> perceiving that the more Blood the fury of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy shed, the more it increas'd, became instantly and wholely capable of a passion far more shameful and base then that of Love. He began to be affraide, and in his terror not only forgot his Mistris, but himselfe too; and so leaving the City of <hi>Benin,</hi> and drawing us after him, caus'd us to make as much hast to our shipps, as he had wonne us to goe from them. Wee set Sayle that very night, in such a disorder, that we never look'd after any one of our companions. To our Tempest by land, there succeeded another by Sea; wherein we ran no lesse hazzard. Assoone as it was overblown, our vessel was assayl'd by an other, which at the first wee tooke for a <hi>Portingall.</hi> But when wee were grappell'd, wee knew it belong'd to the King of <hi>Benin,</hi> and that the Prince his Sonne, had imbarqued himselfe in it to follow us. The Combat began againe with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Fury; and the Prince of <hi>Benin,</hi> giving oftentimes the name of Traytor and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visher to our Generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made him feele that supernatural valour, which caused us to looke on him as a God descended from heaven to converse with men. He gash'd <hi>Amurat</hi> with so many blowes, that after he had forc'd him to fall at his feete, he offer'd his Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miter to his throate, and told him he must either dye, or restore the Princess whom he had stolne. <hi>Amurat</hi> witnes'd an extream Scorne and Anger to see his Enemy so cruell as to make him his jeast, and subject of laughter, after he had vanquish'd him. This last outrage gave him his Mortall blow. Yet in that last instant of life, he had the comfort to be bewail'd, even of the person that killd him.</p>

               <p>Ah cruell and inconstant <hi>Nephizus</hi> (said she with her eyes full of teares) why dost thou compell me to be inhumane against mine owne resentments, and to rejoyce at thy unfortunate end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I am injurious to the eternall Justice, which hath restor'd to me that Libertie, whereof by thee I was wickedly deprived.

But above all, thinke seriously on the actions of my life, that thou mayst not goe on in accusing me unjustly with thy excesse and offences. In the meane time, I blot thee out of my memory as an Apparition that affrights me, and burying under the waves which (may) have swallowed thee, thy cruelties and thy Name; I re-give me entirely to him alone, to whom heaven and my will gave me, assone as I was of discretion.

But when you are got to <hi>Alcidianas</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, what good, what content hope you for it? In that equipage wherewith you will there appeare, you will never be taken for your selfe, but run a hazard to be punished as an Imposter that would faine make himselfe passe for what he is not. Either you should not desire your returne to the <hi>Innaccessible Island,</hi> or should desire it with all the Marks and advantages that belong to your condition to the end that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> who onely doubts of what you are, may by the bravery and state of your attendance, change her doubts into certainties. <hi>I</hi> would willingly follow thy councell, answer'd <hi>Polexander,</hi> but thou seest tis impossible. If <hi>I</hi> should make ready a fleet of two or three hundred Ships, If <hi>I</hi> should put into them all that treasure which the Queen my mother hath left me, If <hi>I</hi> should get al my Subjects to abandon their houses, wives, and children, to imbarque with me, all this great preparation would have so poore a successe, that even scarce the noyse of it would be heard in the <hi>Innaccessible</hi> Iland. No, no my freind, this Adventure must end as it began: Chance brought me with a small company to <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> and chance must bring me thither againe in the same equipage.

                  <hi>Polexander</hi> made her, to that purpose, all the offers fitting, and promis'd to send even to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to inquire what was become of that Prince.

But of late their madnesse hath alter'd, and so much for the better changed, that it is grown tame, and of cruell, is become humane and civill. Ambition, heretofore made them carry fire in one hand, and the Sword in the other. There was nothing so holy which was not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their impiety, nor so just that could escape their Injustice. The children stabd the ponyard into the bosome of their fathers, The fathers cut the throates of their Children. The bonds of blood and parentage stood in no other stead then to bring the unfortunate more surely to execution.</p>
               <p>In a word all was permitted to the desire which these new Princes had to govern. Now

that they are got in possession of their Masters Estates, &amp; that they command every where, who were there wont to obey; they have gone from the voluptuousnesse of a Lion to that of a Dog. They have no other object but infamous pleasures: and the Honour of Ladies runs lesse hazard amongst the Wild <hi>Arabians</hi> and other Robbers of <hi>Africa</hi> then in the Court of <hi>Hely.</hi> I Confesse I speake in heate, but I finde my selfe obliged to it, by so many considerations; that if I were not insensible of the outrages of the Princess of <hi>Morocco,</hi> I should be an enemy to virtue and Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> contentedly smiling at the last words of <hi>Polexander:</hi> tis not (said shee) your owne quarrell that you defend, but mine, and tis <hi>Perselida</hi> that makes knowne her just greivances, when <hi>Polexander</hi> speakes. This discourse went no farther, for the Kings Officers came to tell him his supper staid for him. He did with a good grace an action, which a man comes ill off on, when he does it with too much punctuality. He intreated the Princess of <hi>Tunis</hi> to goe take an ill repast; and without insisting on irksome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, had the fitnesse to entertaine her with <hi>Muley-Hassen,</hi> til she came into the Hall where they were to sup. To let you know the greatnesse of that Feast, tis enough to say, that it was made at the cost, and by the Order of the most Magnificent and polish'd Prince of his time. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> being set at table, with the thought of soone-seeing Prince <hi>Muley,</hi> was extreamely plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She told <hi>Polexander</hi> that he should remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his good freind <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and send for the old <hi>Narcissus.</hi> This discourse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd many Causes of Laughter, even so farre that some of the Courtiers tooke the Boldnesse to jeast at the Moorish Prince in his absence, and to exalt his Combats in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner far more dangerous then if they had openly mock'd at him. But <hi>Polexander</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd silence to those jeerers, but unwilling to have them thinke that he tooke the protection of impertinent Princes, without a reason: it is injustice, said he, to expect in Princes, those Qualities which are altogether Miraculous; they are men as other men, and are infinitely more worthy of praise then private ones, when they do nothing else but make themselves Masters over Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>OLEXANDER</hi> Had but laugh'd at the insolent Challenges which the old Eunuch had given him from <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> but when he had left <hi>Perselida,</hi> he reflected on the vanities and insolencies of the <hi>Moorish</hi> Prince, and thought that since <hi>Alcidiana</hi> was wrong'd, he was bound to be sensible of it, and therefore presently resolv'd to returne once more to <hi>Morocco,</hi> and by an exemplary chastisement, reduce his unworthy Rivall to the necessity of being wiser. With this intention he went to bed, and by meanes of his musing, entred into such impatiencies, that he slept as little all night, as if he had layne on thorns. Assoone as twas day he arose, and scarce allowing himselfe time to be dress'd, went with <hi>Alcippus</hi> to <hi>Zelmatida's</hi> Chamber. He found him in his bed, where according to his wonted custome, he gave himselfe a prey to melancholy, and complain'd of his surviving the <hi>Mexican</hi> Princess. After that <hi>Polexander</hi> had intreated him to attend that succour which infallibly time would give him, and entertain'd him with the adventures of <hi>Perselida Amatonta;</hi> I can (said he) relate, to you a novelty that will no lesse make you wonder, then the fortunes of this Princess. Tis like, that yet you may remember the enconter? wee had in coming hither, and the Combat wherein we were ingaged, by the pride of the Knight with the golden Armour, know, that the same Knight, who, as you saw, defended bad enough the portraict of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> hath now a great desire to recover it. But not knowing who twas that tooke it from him, and thinking he cannot have any newes of it by ordinary meanes, he hath publish'd a Turnament, whereto indifferently he invites all Knights; and promiseth full safety to <hi>Christians</hi> as well as <hi>Mahometans.</hi> He declares by his Cartells, that he will receive no man to <hi>just</hi> with him, til he have made known to the appointed Judges for the courses, who he is; who is his Mistris; and what pretension he hath to <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> He adds to it, that every one shall be bound to purg himself by oath, of the theft he supposeth hath bin done him, and to name who was the Author, if there be any that know him. And in conclusion, he calls to Combat the Pretender Robber, and protests to hold him for a coward and an infamous person, if he make not his apparence at the Turney, and that (after he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited the portraict of <hi>Alcidiana)</hi> if he strive not to get it by a just Combat. Tis boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse for mee to tell you, to whom this packet addres'd it selfe, for you know well, that I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54727:91"/>
am the Theife against whom <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> makes his protestations. I see it very well (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Zelmatida)</hi> and would you be rul'd by me, [the witnesse of your conscience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for you] I would not [were I in your place] trouble my selfe about any justification. If there were none in the world but <hi>Zelmatidas</hi> [said <hi>Polexander]</hi> I would doe as you advise me But when I consider, that the greatest number of men is composed of fooles and miscreants; and further, that our reputation is servilely knit to the opinion, of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; I think that we are ingaged to make it appeare what we are; and hold that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lives amongst people incapable of the soveraigne wisdome, tis more vitious to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst custome then against virtue.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine was not taught in our world (replyed <hi>Zelmatida)</hi> and I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad, therefore you may doe as you please. Well then (said <hi>Polexander)</hi> since it must needs be so, I will to <hi>Morocco;</hi> and [without making my selfe known) strive to gain, better then I have done, the Buckler of <hi>Abdelmelec.</hi> I see well what the matter is, (answer'd <hi>Zelmatida)</hi> you would have none but you that should keepe <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. This designe is worthy of you; but beware that <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> have not made this match to have you at his mercy, and avenge himselfe of the affront he hath received, without running the hazard of receiving another. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> is vaine (replyed <hi>Polexander)</hi> but yet generous. The good opinion he hath of himself leades him to ridiculous actions, but it will never make him to do any ill-ones. He thinkes himselfe farre more valiant then he is, and though in his combats he come off with the worst, he doth not therefore think himselfe overcome. He casts his mishap sometime on Fortune, sometime on the Sunne, and otherwhile on his Horse; and in breife, not to accuse himselfe at any time, he ever accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth some innocent. As for my selfe, I doubt not but he thinkes me the greatest Theife in the world, and Imagines I have gotten his Buckler by treachery, but that I keepe me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd for feare he should meet with me. This being so (sayd <hi>Zelmatida)</hi> you are obliged to go to <hi>Morocco,</hi> to put that Prince in his right witts. But (replyed <hi>Polexander)</hi> whilst I am in that Journey, who shall keepe you company? The shadow and remembrance of <hi>Izatida</hi> (said <hi>Zelmatida</hi> sighing) Those precious reliques of my happinesse are my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companions. They never forsake me, and entertaine me so sweetly, that (without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the incomparable Spirit of <hi>Polexander)</hi> I find nothing that pleaseth me better. But what need you trouble your selfe? Doe not you know that <hi>Zelmatida</hi> is a wretch, which should be no more accounted among the living? <hi>Polexander,</hi> (unwilling to continue this conversation) oftentimes embraced the melancholly <hi>Zelmatida,</hi> and so took leave of him, after he had given an assurance of his speedy returne. Assoone as he was in his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he sent for an old Knight that had been his Governour, and since by him made Vice-Roy of the <hi>Canaries.</hi> Him he commanded to observe <hi>Zelmatida</hi> as himself, and to do nothing without his ordering. His Vice-Roy answered that he would not faile in what he had prescrib'd him, and that he would endeavour to behave him in such an observance, that he should have no cause to be discontented.</p>
               <p>I intreat you Father, said the King, to perform it, and with that went to the Princess of <hi>Tunis,</hi> who had sent to looke for him whilst he was with <hi>Zelmatida.</hi> He wondred to see her ready so early, and wanting time to imploy those obliging termes which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacency hath made men invent to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>atter the Sloth of women, he set himselfe to finde fault with the incommodity of her Chamber, and the illness of the bed whereon she lay. I was never better (said <hi>Amatonta)</hi> and if the Newes I heard last evening had not hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my rest, I had been yet deepely in my first slumber. But not to keepe from you lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the resolution I have taken this night, I will tel you, that I should think my self guilty of an ingratitude the most base and Signall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>f I did not destinate all the time and Liberty which heaven hath vouchsafd to give meto the contentment of <hi>Muley Hassen,</hi> I therefore [though abruptly] take my leave of you, and converting into actions of thankes, those prayers and intreaties I intended to make you, I promise to preserve eternally the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your courtesies, and that, if I ever arrive at any happinesse, I will impute it to the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity of meeting with you; since in the same instant, I found the end of a part of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. You should ascribe it to the Iustice of heaven [answer'd <hi>Polexander;]</hi> for after it had tried your constancy by a great many of crosses and persecutions, it was obliged to give that virtue the Crown it had deserved. Do not doubt Madam: but that you shall find
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54727:91"/>
                  <hi>Muley-Hassen</hi> againe, overcome the insensibility of the King your Father, and moving him with the recital of your disgraces, you shal find even in <hi>Tunis,</hi> the desired haven, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your vertue shal rest safe and free from al Tempests. Set on-wards then assoone as you can, since that your happinesse attends you on the coasts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and if you thinke it fit to honour me, in waiting on you thither, I promise to my selfe, that I shall be a witness of your good fortune. Ah <hi>Polexander</hi> (answered <hi>Ennoramita)</hi> I doubt not but that, if my felicity depended on you, it should be very neere and certaine. But when I thinke on the difficulties that yet oppose it, it is almost impossible for mee to hope for it. Tis aboue 2 yeares since <hi>Muley</hi> hath heard from me, and by consequence knows not whether I be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live or dead. His affection hath certainely perswaded him that I am dead; and imagin to what dispaire that beliefe hath carried him. Alas, that poore Prince hath done violence to himselfe, not to survive me. Quite contrary (replied <hi>Polexander)</hi> he lives, and desires to reveng your death, hath certainely made him resolve to seeke after <hi>Nephizus,</hi> even to the end of the world, and not to attempt ought against himselfe till he hath found his Enemy. But (will you say) if by chance he heare of his death, he will give over to search &amp; by consequence to live. No such matter Madam; he wil without doubt have heard from some one, how you are gotten from your prison and (may be) not knowing now where you are, he wanders through the Kingdome of the King your Father, to Learne what is become of you.</p>
               <p>My first thoughts (said <hi>Ennoramita)</hi> would have me beleeve you, but when I advise with my reason, it tells me, that I doe but take pleasure in deceiving my selfe, to flatter me with these vaine hopes. Yet happen what may, I beleeve what I Desire, and promise to my selfe, that after I may, being so long time unfortunate, I shall be as long againe happy. Let us then (Madam) said <hi>Polexander,</hi> ship our selves with that good presage, and doubt no more of the successe of our enterprise. If you will do me the honour to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd by me, I would have you goe to <hi>Morocco.</hi> It is impossible that amongst the great number of <hi>Africans</hi> which are to meet at <hi>Abdelmelec's</hi> Turney, wee should not meet with some one that knowes <hi>Muley-Hassen.</hi> And who knowes whether that Prince, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with so many journeys, which he hath so unprofitably taken, should not come to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocco,</hi> to enquire after you from some of the Domesticks of the late Prince of <hi>Fez. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selida Amatonta,</hi> overcome by reasons so conformable to her wishes, consented to goe to <hi>Morocco;</hi> and understanding that the wind was fit for that crossing over, would not even give her selfe the time of a repast. And <hi>Polexander</hi> having given command that his great vessell of Warre should follow him, with those domesticall servants he could not misse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brought the Princesse of <hi>Tunis</hi> to the haven, and shipped himselfe with her. The first houres of their imbarquing were imployed in diverse imployments: <hi>Polexander</hi> much perplex'd for his taking a course so opposite to that which should conduct him to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended happinesse, complayn'd [as he was wont] of the Injustice of Fortune, and [not without reason] reproach'd her, that there was not a day wherein she raisd him not up new hindrances and new Enemies. <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> on the contrary, made vowes to that imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power, and to obtaine a happy successe to her designes, besought her to conduct <hi>Muley-Hassen</hi> to <hi>Morocco,</hi> or at least to preserve his life, and take out of his minde the distrust of her not being yet among the living. She her selfe granted her own request, and taking on her the place of fortune, assured her selfe that all her misfortunes were ended, that <hi>Muley-Hassen</hi> was alive, and that her Father, who had so long time forgotten her, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him of his obduracye, and sigh'd for her returne. This Princess having wearied her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination with too much troubling it, was inforc'd to make an end of her musings. she sent to know what our <hi>Heroe</hi> did; and that Message being an advertisement to the Prince to go see her, He came from his Cabinet, and to entertaine her with what was most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to her I know not (sayd he) whence the beliefe comes to me, but I cannot let it slip out of my fantasie that you shall meet with <hi>Muley</hi> at <hi>Morocco;</hi> and that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent shall begin in the very same place where your afflictions had their Originall. If that bliss betide me (replied <hi>Amatonta)</hi> I Will as much blesse <hi>Morocco,</hi> as I have heretofore curs'd it, and that to make it suffer some part of those miseries, which I have endured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly through the cruelty of her Prince, the fire of Heaven would consume it to ashes. But tis fittest that the memory of what is passed, should be blotted out, and to bury

with <hi>Nephizus</hi> all causes that have made me hate him. Your resolution is worthy of your vertue (answered <hi>Polexander,)</hi> and when I heare you speake so generously, methinks I heare the magnanimous <hi>Benzaida</hi> to accuse the ingratefull <hi>Nephizus,</hi> and mildly to reproach him for his inconstancy and violated oathes. What a pleasure have you done me (said <hi>Ennoramita)</hi> to bring into my Remembrance that poore abused creature. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to me (I beseech you) the story of her Lover, and why <hi>Nephizus</hi> made her come to <hi>Fez,</hi> Since he had forsaken her. It may be (said <hi>Polexander)</hi> that <hi>Nephizus</hi> never thought on her when he met her at <hi>Fez.</hi> That meeting was the last Exigent and misery which that incomparable Lady was brought to by her constancy. She could not live out of the sight of that disloyall Prince, and for many yeares of late, hath search'd him every where. But twas much to her mishap that she found him, for then hearing, from his owne mouth, how much he contemn'd her, she stabd her selfe, to be aveng'd on her own person for his disloyalty &amp; ingratitude. That history Madam is no lesse strange then Tragicall, and you cannot better employ the remainder of this day, then to heare, with compassion, the miseries whereof you are the cause, though most innocently. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> was astonish'd at those last words of <hi>Polexander.</hi> Yet beleeving he had not spoken them without a cause, she besought him to tel her whereof she was guilty. You have made one most miserable (answered our <hi>Heroe,)</hi> and yet are guiltlesse of it. After he had made this reply, he came neer to a little bed on which the Princess was seated, and seating himselfe right against her; in this manner began the to-be-lamented adventures of <hi>Benzaida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you did me the Honour to intrust me with the secrecies of your life, I noted from the beginning of your narration that you were ignorant of the principall part of <hi>Nephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> adventures. I was divers times tempted to interrupt you, and to discover that which oblig'd him to keepe himselfe conceal'd so long time; to change so often places, and not to appeare in publick, but under the name of a stranger. But not certainely knowing whether he were dead, I thought it was fit to leave you in your error, and not give you new cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to think worse of him. But now that I can put you out of trouble, and make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly know him without any wrong done; I will tell you his first legerities and make known those secrets which, with a great deale of reason, he hath alwaies hid from you. Even before your Infancy had triumphed over the heart of that Prince, he had subjected it to two personages farre different in humor and condition, yet both equally faire and alike abused. The first was called <hi>Izilia,</hi> the daughtur of an <hi>Arabian</hi> Knight, very rich and famous for the preserving (alone) the Province of <hi>Temesna,</hi> in the obedience of the King of <hi>Morocco.</hi> The other was the discreet and generous <hi>Benzaida,</hi> Princess of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> How! said <hi>Ennoramita</hi> (all amaz'd) <hi>Benzaida</hi> Daughter of the unfortunate King of <hi>Granada?</hi> The same (said <hi>Polexander,)</hi> yet I have oftentimes heard say (replied <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matonta)</hi> that shee was stolne away by a Spanish Captaine, before the taking of <hi>Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and since that time none knew what was become of her. The King her father (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our <hi>Heroe)</hi> without doubt was the cause of that brute, to hide from his Subjects the shame of his family, but tis most certaine that she dyed at <hi>Fez,</hi> and that the ingratitude of <hi>Nephizus</hi> was the cause of it. If you love me, said <hi>Ennoramita</hi> (interrupting him) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to me that strange adventure, and without refraining for feare of renewing my anger, let me know (I beseech you) all things as they have hapned. <hi>Nephizus</hi> is sufficiently pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd by his death, though he had not been to me as he was; yet were I obliged to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the wrong he hath done me, &amp; forget all my sufferings, out of that holy respect which the living should beare to the dead. If it be so, as I doubt not, Madam (said <hi>Polexander)</hi> you shall be absolutely satisfied.</p>
               <p>Some few yeares past <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> who is esteemed one of the Expertest Knights of all <hi>Africa,</hi> and the stoutest Juster amongst the Moores, published a Turney, to Maintaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Knights, both Christian and Mahometan, that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> is the fairest Princess of the world. I was at that Turnament, without any other designe, then to be a spectator of that galentry; for being without passion, I was likewise unprovided of a cause to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell with <hi>Abdelmelec.</hi> I wish'd he had not given me more by his last challenge then he did by his first, I would then leave him a free possessor of his imaginary prosperities, and not goe trouble those fine dreames which his vanity brings on him waking. I came to <hi>Morocco</hi> the second day of the Turney, and knew well by divers courses, that tis not without reason
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54727:93"/>
that the Moors vaunt to have taught the Christians the art of giving a blow with a lance with a good grace, and mannage and sit a horse for <hi>justs</hi> and running with canes, In see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those excellent Knights, there kindled a desire in me of trying them, and to put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise those lessons they had given me in <hi>France.</hi> This resolution was not so well taken, but that it might have bin very easie to have made me change it. But being by chance lodged with some <hi>Arabian</hi> Knights, I heard them speake such extraordinary things of the beauty and vertue of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> that I had a great minde to see the Picture, which I did, on the Buckler of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and in many other tables which that Prince had caus'd to be made, notwithstanding the Remonstrances of his <hi>Marabous,</hi> and the forbiddings of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> Assoone as I had seen it, I fell straight into that Error which accompanies young men, and thought <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was not so worthy, as my selfe, to serve so faire a Princess. The very next day I took armes against him, and maintain'd that twas to me only, for whom the Destinies had reserv'd the honour to serve <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> He accepted of me in the Combat, in the Quality of a Rival, and I, who demean'd my selfe in it with all the violence of a man of Sixteen, perpl exed him in such sort, that after divers courses, he was reduc'd to the necessity of giving me place. He was not only oblig'd to it by the lawes he had imposed on himselfe, but more, that he might renounce the title of <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> knight, he was compel'd to have recourse to the Ax &amp; to the Cymiter; but had no better fate then with the first; and his misfortune was such, that I inforc'd him to demand his life of me, and yeeld to me that brave title of <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> Knight. And so by a meere Caprichio of <unclear>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</unclear>, I became master of the feild, of the arms, of the pictures, &amp; the Prize appointed for the victor. I retir'd with al these advantages, &amp; ravish'd with the tables which I had so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously won, return'd to my ships, with an intent to get me speedily to the <hi>Canaries.</hi> But my voyage was interrupted by the arrival of that faire <hi>Arabian,</hi> which I nam'd to you, <hi>Azilia:</hi> she came one Evening into my ship, and when she was alone with me shee cast her selfe at my feet, &amp; her Eyes ful of teares besought me to commiserate abused innocence, &amp; avenge her of a Traytor, Who under promise of Marriage had robd her of her Honour. I took her up assone as I could, and promising to assist her in so just a quarrell; If any thing may hinder mee (said I) tis the opinion I have that your Enemy is in such a place; where twil be hard to bring him into Question. Questionlesse he will laugh at my defiance, as he hath been merry with his faith, and will do you (may be) some new injuries, in Lieu of asking your pardon for the former.</p>
               <p>I will hinder him well enough (answer'd the Lady) from using his former treasons: He shall feele what tis to be a faith-breaker. But noble Knight I beseech you to grant me two favors at once. The one is, that you will not deny me your sword and arme, and the other, that without informing your selfe by what way I intend to effect my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, you will promise not to leave me till I be fully satisfied. I granted her all, and taking but one Squire with me, followed her to a house that was at the Gates of <hi>Fez.</hi> All our way, she gave not over intreating me to observe exactly what I had promis'd, and when I had overcome her Enemy, not faile to cut off her head.</p>
               <p>Assoone as I was in my lodging, she renew'd her petitions, and receiving me with a great deale of civility, besought me to call my selfe <hi>Scander Stianack,</hi> and to take on me the <hi>Arabian</hi> habit. I agreed to her, and after I had been some dayes in that lodging, <hi>I</hi> knew it was the very same wherein <hi>Izilia's</hi> Lover was wont to meet her. Now one morning as I was walking in an Alley of the garden, I saw a man enter very richly clad. He came right to me, and drawing his Cymiter: tis at this time (said he) thou Man with heart and faith, that thou shall undergo the punishment thou hast long since de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. When I give thee thy life, did not I command thee never to set foot within these doores, nor within this Kingdom? Yet I see thee return'd to perfect the assassinate which thou began'st the last year, and continue thy cruelties on a person that is deare to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I have prevented thee. Thou must dye Traitor, thou must dye. This discourse was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to surprize me, yet, from the beginning, and judging that <hi>Izilia</hi> had kept her word with me, and deceiv'd her deceiver: I beleev'd it behov'd me to hold on the jeast and oblige this ill-advised Man, to give satisfaction to his beloved. I therefore drew my Cymiter, and answering him in the language he had us'd: I can no longer suffer (said I) the shame of mine house. <hi>Izilia</hi> through too much loving thee, hath wanted that love
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54727:94"/>
which she owes to her selfe, and kindred; and that blemish, wherewithall she hath fulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her own honor and that of her race, must be wash'd away either by thy blood of Allyance.</p>
               <p>The Man began to laugh at my threatnings, and using me as a Poltron, or infamous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, let fly at me a furious blow with his Cymiter. <hi>I</hi> put it by, and presently gave him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother so weighty, that, but for the greatnesse and softnesse of his Turbant, I had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt accomplish'd, whether I would or no, the will of <hi>Izilia.</hi> We were in a large Alley and girt on each fide with a palisado of Orange and Pomegranat trees. No body appeard in the Garden but the wife and daughter of the Gardiner. <hi>Izilia</hi> was there, but she was hidden and expected, behind a palisado of Iesemins, what should be the successe of her deceite. Her Enemy, the while, beleeving that I was <hi>Scandar Stianack,</hi> promis'd himselfe to bring me quickly to the case of asking him once more for my life. I, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired that his busines might be ended by kindnesse, solicited him to have regard to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fidelity of our house, to remember what he had promis'd to <hi>Izilia,</hi> and not exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a whole illustrious and couragious family. What (answer'd me fiercely the abus'd man) thou yet dar'st to open thy mouth? Ah miserable fellow thou must perish, and in saying so, let drive a blow at me with al his strength. I avoided it happily, &amp; entring upon a point with him sheath'd my Cymiter in his thigh: truly he witness'd that he had a good heart and skill, for he made extraordinary essayes to revenge the loss of his blood, and thinking it best to fight with more caution then he had done, preserv'd himselfe with so much Judgement that <hi>I</hi> was neere a quarter of an houre in bootelesly, beating the Ayre and the Iron. But the blood he lost by his wound taking from him, by little and little, his strength and agility, he did nothing but feebly ward. I might say to you without Vanity, that it had been very easie for me to have kild him in that case; but I would not make use of my advantage. On the contrary being desirous to oblige him to satisfie <hi>Izilia,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to satisfie her my selfe, Iintreated him to acknowledge the Injustice of his cause by the ill Successe of his armes, not to contest any more against that which was resolv'd in heaven, and to preserve his life by keeping his word. Thou shalt dye murderer (cried he, instead of answering me) and with those words cast himselfe in upon me with all the rest of his strength. I stood firme for him, and his choler taking away his Judgement, he fel head long into mine armes; The blow he received, by his own fault, was great and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. He lost his courage by it, and after he had let fall his Cymiter, he himself fell too along by the palisado. As I came neere to helpe him, She that called her selfe the Gard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners daughter; came running cross the palisado, and catching me fast by the arm cried out: Ah noble Knight take not away the life of the Prince of <hi>Fez.</hi> I started at that word, and turning to her, what? (said <hi>I)</hi> is this Knight a Prince? Tis <hi>Nephizus</hi> said she, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to speak further, her sobs and sighs made an end for her. I then perceived well how <hi>Izilia</hi> had deceived me as well as <hi>Nephizus.</hi> She presently appear'd in the Alley, &amp; run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with al her speed was presently with me. When she saw <hi>Nephizus</hi> stretch'd on the grasse &amp; al bloody: Make an end, make an end (said she) brave Knight! Tis not enough to have brought the perfidious <hi>Nephizus</hi> to the state he is, but you should give his head into my hands; you are engag'd to it and cannot deny it, if you are a man of your word. The fair Gardneresse, this while, held my arme, though there was no need, and turning on me her sweet and languishing Eyes; Beleeve not <hi>Izilia</hi> (said she) She will be very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry should you content her fury. <hi>Nephizus</hi> is very deare to her as disloyall as he is, and her satisfaction should be farre greater in seeing him penitent then beholding him dead, I have lesse interest then she, in the preservation of this Prince, since I have lesse hope of possessing him; yet I beg his life, and if my head be worthy to be the price of his, I offer it you with joy, &amp; beseech you, by that exchange, to satisfie <hi>Izilias</hi> anger. Yes too-avenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Izilia</hi> [continued she] turning her to that <hi>Arabian,</hi> do what thou wilt on me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute all thy sufferings on this Body, and make it a lamentable example of thy vengeance. Tear out my heart, steep thy hands in my blood, use me worse then thou wouldst handle <hi>Nephizus;</hi> I will endure all without complaining, so that <hi>Nephizus</hi> have his life I know he is disloyall: I know he takes not an oath but with intent to breake it. But he is still <hi>Nephizus.</hi> He is the Idol of my Soule, nay he is my very Soule. <hi>Izilia</hi> regarding that Heroicall Gardneresse with severity: and since when is it [said she]

bold <hi>Zaida</hi> that you have lost your respect? What, you love <hi>Nephizus?</hi> Truly [unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Slave] I shall well chastise your impudence. Leave (answered the faire <hi>Zaida)</hi> give over (if you please) these Injuries and threatnings. If I were as little Mistris of my passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as you, I would reproach you, justly, farre more then you revile me. You are the cause of my sufferings, you have the good I injoy'd. In a word, <hi>Nephizus</hi> was mine before he eversaw you. <hi>Izilia</hi> became mad at those words &amp;, had I not held her, she had without doubt, faln on <hi>Zaida.</hi> Whilst these two thus shew'd the contrariety of their humours <hi>Nephizus</hi> came to himselfe; and knowing <hi>Izilia,</hi> Well now mistrustful-one (said he) do'st, thou any more doubt of my love? Ah Traytor (repli'd <hi>Izilia)</hi> thy cunning is no more in season, thou must dye, and by thy death recover the Honour, which thy false oathes, and disloyall flatteries have rob'd me of: Thou art faln into the snare thou foresawest not. Dost thou not remember the promises thou mad'st me in going to <hi>Morocco?</hi> Am I that <hi>Amatonta</hi> for whom thou hast taken Armes against thy Brother? Thou might'st well thinke (disloyall) that Heaven would not alwaies be deafe to the cries of the Innocent; and to the end to chastise thee, it would permit, that after thou had'st deceived others, thou should'st deceive thine owne selfe. Know that he who thou see'st before thee, is not the miserable <hi>Scander-Stianack.</hi> Tis the victorious Knight, that carried away the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Turney at <hi>Morocco.</hi> Thus would shee pay me, for the service I had done her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polexander</hi> said thus with a low voice, and retaking his First tone, went on thus Scarce had <hi>Nephizus</hi> knowne who he was, but that lifting up his head a little, (whilst the faire and desolate Gardneresse held her hand on his wound) since (said he) I dye not by the hand of the Traytor <hi>Stianack,</hi> I dye without any great deale of sorrow. But tell mee I beseech you, by what chance came you hither? The intreaty (said I) of <hi>Izilia</hi> brought me hither, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me to Fight against you unknown. And this is enough of that for the present, tis fit now to look after the saving of your life, to the end that when you are in better case, then now you may know from <hi>Izilia,</hi> with what Dexterity she hath brought to pass this intricate businesse.</p>
               <p>The faire Gardneresse then began speake, having newly torne her Vaile to binde up <hi>Nephizus</hi> wound. Turne likewise your Eyes on me (said shee) and know <hi>Benzaida.</hi> She would call her selfe extreamely unhappy, if Fate had not at last brought her to a place, where she might yeeld thee some new proofes of her affection. It may be thou hast lost the remembrance of that name, &amp; thy new love suffers thee not to cal to minde thine old: or rather the disasters of our house, the calamities of <hi>Granada,</hi> and the deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her Princess makes thee contemn and abhor the Poore <hi>Benzaida.</hi> Open thine Eyes <hi>Nephizus;</hi> She that Speaks to thee in the habit of a slave, and a Gardneresse is that Princess not long since ador'd of so many people, and serv'd by so many Princes, who, for her too much Love to thee, forgot what shee ow'd to her Birth and her selfe.</p>
               <p>Imagin (Madam) said <hi>Polexander</hi> [applying himsefe to <hi>Ennoramita]</hi> whether <hi>Izi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> and my astonishment were not great, when in an instant we saw a Gardning maiden become a Princess; but withall [if you please] think in what a confusion <hi>Nephizus</hi> was when he found himselfe convinc'd of his faithlesnesse by two so irreprocahable witnesses. Yet instead of repenting him of his crimes, he preseverd; and not being able to justifie himselfe, beleev'd that in his great heart, he was bound to be obstinate in his offence, Vnworthily therefore thrusting away the deplorable <hi>Benzaida,</hi> and plucking aside her hand which was on his wound; Thou object [said he] more dismall to me, then the black Angels that wait for me at the entring into my grave, who hath made thee outlive thine Honour, and thy Fortune?

                  <hi>Izilia</hi> hereat, taking the word for <hi>Benzaida</hi> who dissolv'd in teares; O abhominable renegado <hi>Musulma</hi> [cried she] dar'st thou thus out rage that innocency which thou hast made miserable?

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming almost furious in seeing him, chid him for his impudence and rashnesse, and told him, that his impudence should have been long since corrected. But when he was gone, and I had permission to speak freely, what said I not against the providence of our great Prophet, against the starrs, against love, against fortune? in briefe, against all nature? And that; Traytor, to the end I might say nothing against thee. Yet I was quickly (in spight of me compeld to make thee a partner. The terrible object of thy treason, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it selfe before me, and I saw thee so horrible, that I could not look on thee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hatred, nor to hate, without reviling thee, as thou hadst deserved. It may augment thy rage to repeat them: But how excessive soever I make them by my words, they will never be equall to the miseries which thy ingratitude hath made me suffer. And now Traytor (cri'd I) thou hast left <hi>Africa,</hi> and cross'd the Sea, only to abuse an Innocent, and betray the facility of a maid, whose love and age made her capable of beleeving all. What do'st thou hope for, for thy treason? VVhat recompence is there reserv'd for so shamefull an action? Art thou so much degenerated from thy Ancestors? or is <hi>Africa,</hi> that was late the retreat of loyalty and truth, perverted, that thou canst not there keepe the place that thy birth gave thee, without making thy selfe famous by some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry treason? But is it not some old hatred that obligeth thee to treate me so unworthily? Canst not indure that the Race of the Great <hi>Mansor</hi> should reign in some corner of the world? Art thou not content that thy predecessors drove him out of <hi>Africa?</hi> Art thou leagu'd with the Enemies of our Religion, to exterminate the Beleevers, and ravish from the <hi>Alcoran</hi> that power which is left it in <hi>Spaine?</hi> Assure thy selfe that I never took part in the quarrells of our houses. Assoone as I saw thee I gave thee my heart, and made no distinction between the Race of <hi>Marin,</hi> and that of <hi>Mansor.</hi> But I invented reasons to justifie thy disloyalty, which can have no other, but that thou art a man and an <hi>African,</hi> that is, that thou art doubly disloyall.</p>
               <p>Would to Heaven that the ambition and avarice of our Fathers had been confined within the limits of their Provinces, and that their darings had not violated the sacred bounds, with which Nature had seperated their Regions. The Prince of <hi>Fez</hi> had not then ever heard speak of the Princesse of <hi>Granada,</hi> and the honor of that poore May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den should not be, as it is now, the sports of thy inconstancy, and subject of calumnies. But why stick I at these vaine considerations? Go Miscreant, triumph at thy pleasure over my heart, and reputation. Leave nothing undone to make the horrors of thy life without Example, and vaunt thee in the presence of thy <hi>Africans,</hi> who may be, are as simple as I, that 'twas for the love of them, thou falsifiedst thy faith to a <hi>Granadine</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and neglected that which <hi>Spaine</hi> had in most adoration. Without doubt thy vanity brought the like discourse within thee. But what's that to me, if it were so? Is it not enough, that I too truely know that thou hast betraid me? Neither the great <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,</hi> on whose <hi>Prophesies</hi> thou swor'st to be true to me, nor the feare which the black Angells should imprint in the Soules of the perfidious, nor my innocency, nor my love, nor in briefe, the resentment of my favours, have not been able to quell thy ill Nature, nor stay thy inconstancy.</p>

               <p>The subtleties that my Sex imploy to make themselves Masters of thine, have been hitherto unknown to me, or at least hatefull.

These good thoughts were not likely to possesse a Soul so wicked as thine. And if by chance, some good angel would with them have inspir'd thee, thy pernicious inclination would not have suffer'd to receiv them. Those that brought thee into the world, underwent the curse of Heaven, &amp; thy parents should call thee rather the punishment of their offences, then the blessing of their marriage. Nor art thou come out of thy Country, but to free it of a Monster, which was become the cause of terror, and hatred to all. Truly the success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of the great <hi>Mansor</hi> have good cause to rejoyce, since the usurper of their Estates hath left so abominable a Race. Comfort thy selfe; Comfort thy self in thy disgraces.</p>
               <p>The Tyrants who drove thy Ancestors out of <hi>Africa,</hi> have left such heires, that they wil soon have reason to envy thee. But what said I? No, No <hi>Nephizus,</hi> who shall be ever dear to me, I do not beleeve all this. The Love I bear my self, hinders me from mine own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and makes me throw on thy inconstancy, that change whereof I onely am guilty. The audacious <hi>Mescenarez</hi> having dared to pretend to that, which Love reserv'd for thee alone, made thee jealous; and the little care I took to cure thee of it, compell'd thee (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) to leave mee. It may be, thou yet wandrest through the Deserts of thy <hi>Numidia</hi> and askest from <hi>Love</hi> that he should give thee Iustice for the faith which I have violated. If it be so, O too credulous Prince, return where thou hast left me! Thou shalt know how I have suffer'd the wooings and rashnes of <hi>Mescenarez;</hi> and (since thy departure) whether he or his adherents have been able to get any advantage of the scorn and neglect thou hast made of me. Why sawest thou not me as I am now, discheveld, furious, an enemy to my self, or rather repentant, &amp; desolate? Thou shouldst have seen me with my knees on the earth &amp; tears in my Eyes imploring thy mercy, and confessing my self guilty, though I am nothing but a most miserable creature. But thou, most to be abhorred, neither carest what I do, not what I suffer. Thy lightnesse is satisfied in deceiving me, &amp; (may be) it now glories in my being abused. Go, go whether thou wilt (the Horror of thy Sex &amp; mine) I wil folow thee as a <hi>Fury,</hi> &amp; making thee suffer a part of those torments which I have endured, I wil not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thee to rejoyce (unpunish'd) of that death which thou hast given me. <hi>Benzaida</hi> stopping at that word, held her eyes some-while fix'd on the planching: at thelast she cast them on <hi>Nephizus,</hi> who, with <hi>Izilia</hi> and my selfe, hearkned to her without a word speaking; and changing her voice, tis enough ingratefull man (said she) tis enough to have reproved thee of thy misdeeds; I am in such an humor, that I am weary of complaining; I wil only tel how long I have sought thee, &amp; by what chance I heard news of thee, Know therefore that some few dayes after thy departure, I found my self so extreamly desirous of re-seeing thee, that I could not possibly stay longer in <hi>Granada. I</hi> then forsook my Fathers Palace without the knowledge of any but <hi>Zamaella</hi> and my Nurse, and commanding them to take, with them, all that was necessary for me, stole away one night, without fearing the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who ransack'd our country, or the dangers of a long Journey; and swore never to sojourne in any place of the world till <hi>I</hi> had met with thee. With this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution <hi>I</hi> took my way to the Sea-side, and as <hi>I</hi> was ready to imbarque my selfe in a vessell that was bound for <hi>Africa,</hi> the generous Prince (which thou shouldst never forget, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as thou art) <hi>Tindarache I</hi> say, being not to be put off neither by my cruelties nor by our common extravagances, presented himselfe to me, and casting him at my feet, besought me <hi>I</hi> would be pleas'd that he might accompany me. <hi>Benzaida</hi> (said he) <hi>I</hi> come not here to make you alter your resolution, nor to intreat you to acknowledge my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance. <hi>I</hi> come to you, because my fidelity commands it, and because <hi>I</hi> cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to dye till <hi>I</hi> see you happy. These offers much troubled me, yet knowing of a long

But for feare he should not observe all that he promis'd me, I receive you (said <hi>I)</hi> on condition that you take no heed neither to my actions nor my words, and look not on me but as on a person that knowes no more what she doth.</p>
               <p>That young Prince full of love and pitty, was so much mov'd at my speech, that the teares came into his eyes. He looked upon me, he gaz'd on heaven, and being able to endure his fortune without murmuring, What ever thou be (cried he) O Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! that watchest for the generall good of the world, what have I done to thee, that I should be the party belov'd of <hi>Benzaida.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After he had ended this exclamation, he turn'd himselfe towards me, and ask'd me whither I would go. Tis no matter where [I replied] provided it be there where I may find the Prince of <hi>Fez.</hi> Provided that it be where you may find the Prince of <hi>Fez?</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied <hi>Tindarache!</hi> O Too happy Prince if thou knew'st thy happinesse. Let s go, Let's go [Madam] after that ingratefull Man; Let us search for that enemy of his owne good; Let's compell him to accept the good Fortune he refuseth, and if there want but my life to make him true, I am content that you bestow it on your passion. The love and Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that Prince touch'd me so to the heart, that I was forc'd to impose him silence, for feare least his speech should make me too sensible. He was no lesse obedient to me in that, then in all other things; and I beleeve that wee cros'd the seas and a part of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> without any talke aboue five or six times. I found thee not in either of the Kingdomes, but I understood that the love thou barest to <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> Princess of <hi>Tunis,</hi> had made thee undertake a voyage on the Ocean. I therefore left <hi>Morocco,</hi> and went to imbarque my selfe at <hi>Azafi,</hi> to see if I could meet thee at Sea, or at least to passe the <hi>streights,</hi> and finde thee at <hi>Tunis:</hi> but being ingaged to stay at <hi>Azafi,</hi> to attend a <hi>Portugall</hi> ship, I was <hi>[I</hi> know not by what odnesse of Fortune] seen and desired by four <hi>Castilian</hi> Knights: who seem'd to be very Inquisitive of mee? And not contented to have entertain'd me in their Inne, shipped themselves with me, and did what they could, to win me not to forsake their conversation. I avoyded it yet as often as it was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and heaven, hearing my prayers, Stir'd up so furious a Tempest, that it gave the Spanyards farr other thoughts then those of pratling to me. After our ship had bin three dayes and three nights beaten with the Tempest, it came to shyde on to an Island, which is now famous by the stately Tombe of a Prince called <hi>Almansor.</hi> There wee went on shore to expect fairer weather, and give time to the Mariners to trym their ship; and I that would avoid the sight of the four troublesome Spanyards, I caus'd me to be conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Tindarache</hi> to a village which is not farre from the sea. But I could not keep me from the curiosity of those mad men. They followed mee, and stopping me between a wood and a many rocks, told me that they were come to serve me, and not to offer me any outrage. Wee are [said they] four Cozens, who are equally in love with you, and because our affection is too violent to endure any companions, we are resolved to fight in your presence, to give an end to the cause of our jealousy, and leave you the prize for the vanquisher. Though my minde was busied about nothing but the remembrance of thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, perjur'd <hi>Nephizus,</hi> yet the extravagancy of those men was capable to stay my musings. I gave Heaven thankes that it made me see a folly, which was not lesse extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary then mine; and told those Lovers, that I found their loves so unreasonable, and the person, who was the cause of it, so unworthy the fortune they would run for her, that <hi>I</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd them to continue freinds, and give over an enterprize that could be no other then, very unfortunate to them. That must not stay us, if you please (they replyed) since, of four that we be, there will be no mishap but for him that shall survive his companions; and in ending these words they threw off their doublets, and came to meet one another with their Swords drawn. The Combat was very short, though very bloody, and indeed it could not be otherwise, since 'twas done by the advice and guidance of so murderous and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a passion as that of love. Three presently fell down dead, and the fourth (his sword red with the blood of his Cozens) came and cast himselfe at my feet to aske me the prize for his victory. <hi>Tindarache,</hi> till then had shewed so little feeling, that not being able to doubt of his courage after the proofes that he had given me of it, I thought that by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thy false promises, I was not to give any more trust to his faire words.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54727:97"/>
But when he saw the Spanyard at my feet: Knight (said he to him) you make too much hast and having not yet done but the halfe of your businesse, you stick not to aske the salary for the whole. Doe you think that I am lesse Jealous, or not so cleare-sighted as you Spanyards? Truely (answered the other) you surprize me. Your leane and disfigur'd countenance, your reeling, and weak walking, and the feeblenesse of your armes, made me beleeve that you rather look'd for some Physitian to cure you, then for an Enemy to cut off some one or two of those dayes that were yet to live. Notwithstanding since you beseech me for it, in so good a manner, I am pleased not to have you to languish any longer, but to kill you a little more speedily then your melancholy would have done. <hi>Tindarache</hi> in lieu of replying to that arrogant answer, did but smile, and taking his Sword in his hand, told his enemy, that he besought him to make an end of his Cure. The other, whose new victory had made him more proud then he was by birth, went on very resolutely to <hi>Tindarache.</hi> The Prince met him as bravely, and at first gave him such a dangerous wound, that he forc'd him to put one knee to the ground. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard seeing his strength go away with his blood, furiously rose up to avenge himselfe of his vanquisher; but he, who knew how much his preservation imported me, recoyl'd still in warding, &amp; in that manner let him lose the rest of the strength &amp; blood that was left him. Atlast that unfortunate <hi>Castilian</hi> fel backwards &amp; not being able to speak by reason of the blood which came out of his mouth, he took a handkercher, which he steep'd in his wound, and after he had kissed it threw it towards me. <hi>Tindarache</hi> who was not wounded came to me, and seeing me affrighted: Away <hi>Madam</hi> said he, let's away from this dismall Island, wherein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Love hath been the cause of shedding so much blood, and let us go find out the happy Prince of <hi>Fez.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I took the advice of that generous Lover; and after I had given order to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that Bourg (whereinto I was retyr'd) for the buriall of the Spanyards; I re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd my selfe in the same Ship which had brought me thither. The violence of the tempest had put the <hi>Portugull</hi> Ship to that necessity, that they were forc'd to return to <hi>Azafie,</hi> and there <hi>I</hi> left them and came back to <hi>Morocco,</hi> where I understood that thou wert at <hi>Fez.</hi> Presently I put on, with my little and faithfull company; but passing through the solitudes of Mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> a Lyon rush'd on my poore Nurse, and carryed her away, <hi>Tindarache</hi> not being able to rescue her. The losse of one who had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deare to me, so transported me, that I would have expos'd my selfe even to the fury of the Lyon. But the faithfull <hi>Tindarache,</hi> who had alwayes his eyes on me, tooke notice of my action, and doubting of what I had resolved: Madam (said he) what mean you to do? Do you not remember now, that there is nought in the world capable to move you but the Prince of <hi>Fez?</hi> I must confesse it to thy glory, and my confusion, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd man) that thy Name took away my griefe, and <hi>I</hi> often accused my selfe for loving any other then thee. Some few dayes after <hi>I</hi> came out of those Deserts, and entred into thy Kingdome. Consider what kind of passion mine alwayes hath been, since, at the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name of <hi>Fez</hi> and the sole looking on thy Territories, <hi>I</hi> was so transported, that my body, too violently agitated by my mind, was compell'd to give way. <hi>I</hi> fell sick of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, which at first they thought deadly. Shall <hi>I</hi> relate to thee (insensible man) the care which <hi>Tindarache</hi> had of me, the paines he undertook, and the despaire whereunto the obstinacy of my ill, oftentimes threw him? No, <hi>I</hi> will tell thee nothing of it. That soule intirely loving, and wholely pure, which now enjoyes the eternall felicities, will not have me to prophane his mysteries. Thou shalt only know that <hi>I</hi> overcame my Fever by the desire <hi>I</hi> had to see thee. Assone as <hi>I</hi> could leave my Chamber, <hi>I</hi> went from the place where I had faln sick; and endeavour'd by little Journeys to make an end of my unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate voyage. And I had almost cross'd the large champians of <hi>Temesna,</hi> when I know not what strange affrightment seiz'd on me. I turn'd me towards <hi>Tindarache,</hi> and looking round about me, as if I had been pursued: <hi>Tindarache</hi> (said I without knowing why) we must shortly part. Madam (replied he) I do no lesse then you wish for that happy moment, that must render you to the dearest part of your selfe. But if my love could consent to it, I would wish to die, ere I were compeld to that cruell ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity to lose, with that content I receiv'd by your presence, the remaynder of an imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary hope which yet flatters my passion. Yet happen what the Destinies please, <hi>Tinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rache</hi>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:54727:97"/>
will without feare see fall that blow which must deprive him of his life. Those words made me beleeve that that faithfull Lover fear'd to meet with thee, not that he thought thee more valiant then himselfe, but because he knew by my extravagancies, that thou wert better belov'd then He. I would willingly at the same time, have free'd him of that feare, and stopping in the mid-way to speak more earnestly: <hi>Tindarache</hi> (said I) if you beleeve that I leade you where I am to find my greatest Enemy, to give you that discontent to see him possest of that which you think you have deserved, and to make him triumph on your disgraces: you neither know my intention nor what is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse of the infortunate <hi>Benzaida.</hi> I am not of those light mindes which may be twice deceived by apparances. I have committed one fault, but my Spirit and the assistance of our great Prophet, wil hinder me from acting a second. Let us go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (Prince as unfortunate as my selfe) let us go find the Traytor, At whose very name my Sense and Reason re-begin their old enmityes. But lets find him quickly, to the end that one same houre, and one same action may make us all Three equally contented.</p>
               <p>I had scarce ended the words, when <hi>Zamaella</hi> began to cry out, that I should take heed to my selfe. I turned my head, and saw ten or twelve men on horsbacke, who with their swords drawn, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ere ready to fall on <hi>Tindarache.</hi> Assoon as they had beset him, one of them came to me, and presenting me the point of his Sword: Is it so (said he) infamous and vagabond <hi>Izilia,</hi> that to satiate the Lubricities of a Tyrant, thou prostitutest thine honour, and reputation of thy race? I answer'd nothing to those revilings, because I thought they were not addressed to me. In the meane time he that had spoken, commanded two Negroes, that were of his company, to bind my hands, &amp; guard me well on payne of their lives, &amp; presently hasten'd to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices that were cowardly murdering of <hi>Tindarache.</hi> I did all I could to withhold him and to make him know that he was mistaken; but his choler having blinded him, he perceived not the fault he had done, till after, when it was irreparable.

                  </gap>mpanions) how blockishly are we mistaken. He came then presently to me, and looking long on me, Unfortunate <hi>Scander Stianack</hi> (said he striking his brest) what hast thou done, and how wilt thou justifie thy mistake, and ending those words, he took me by the hand, and taking off my bonds, what service can I do you (said he) that may be sufficent to expiate the wrong which I have Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly done you? Exact from me what satisfaction you please <hi>(Madam;)</hi> you will see by the content I shall have in it, that my intent was not to offend you. I would have answerd him when I heard thevoyce of <hi>Tindarache</hi> sounding in mine ears, which made me run to the place where he lay. I found him all weltring in blood, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly wounded in divers places. Assoone as he saw me he strove to arise, but not being able, he turn'd his dying Eyes on me, and kissing the hand which I had given him <hi>Madam</hi> said he to me, <hi>I</hi> cannot perform what I promis'd you; but you see tis not my fault. Give me an assurance that you are satisfied, and I shall go contentedly out of the world. Those words were so peircing to me, that forcing my weaknesse, and forgetting that I was look'd on by men who might conceive an ill opinion of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments, I rais'd up the head of that to-be-lamented Prince, and knowing not what I said, so much was I troubled, besought him not to forsake me and leave me all alone in an Enemies Country, Tis that which makes me go to my grave with sorrow (replied he with a low voice,) but the vowes and prayers I make for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarding of my death, are vaine and to no purpose; spight of me I must leave you; and I perceive that I have no longer time to live, then sufficeth to bid you farewell.

               <p>I went to the Pallace to find out mine Enemy, and accosting one of the Kings Guard, I learn't that all the Court was in an uproare, because the night before <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phizus</hi> had stolne away a faire Stranger, and was gone with her accompanied only with two or three slaves.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54727:98"/>
words, as to take breath, saw that <hi>Nephizus</hi> lay insensible to all this narration. Yet she went on: and addressing her to that cruell Prince: doe but reflect (said she) on all that I have related to thee, and thou shalt see that thy perjury is the cause of all those ills which have betided me; not only in mine owne person but in that of my freinds. Yet I reproach thee not for them, for after thy last injuries, those deserved not to be thought on. Hearken only to the remainder of my sufferings, and afterward I will leave thee in peace. When <hi>Scander Stianack</hi> had made me a recitall of thy new disloyalties, and that I had a long time bewaild the loss of <hi>Tindarache,</hi> I resolv'd to accept the offers he had made me: and, not to erre any more, told him; that since he had depriv'd me of him that was to me instead of a Father, Brother, &amp; a Husband, I was wel pleas'd to have recourse to none other then to him that had made me so unfortunate; and that he would conduct me to some place, where I might live unknown, and have my Honour in safety, He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd me to take care of me as of his Sister; and assoone as he had caus'd <hi>Tindarache</hi> to be interr'd, brought me towards this lodging. Assoon as I came hither, I entreated him to let me live at mine own wll; and obtaining that favour, I tooke on me the habit you now see me in, <hi>Zamaella</hi> clad her so too, and for these ten or twelve dayes, we have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed among the domestiques here for two Christian slaves, which the Father of <hi>Izilia</hi> had bought. The next day after our arrivall, <hi>Scander Stianack</hi> came to see mee; and seeing by his action that he was very much troubled: Faire creature (said he) I am enforc'd to leave you. The ancient Enemies of our family have besieg'd my father in a House which he hath in the Province of <hi>Temesna,</hi> and I must needs goe to assist him: I cannot be back againe in lesse then two moneths, for I must have some time to get all My freinds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that they may be in case to dis-engage my Father. After he had sayd thus much, he call'd for his Gardner and his Wife, and commanded them, that in publique, they should use me as the other slaves, but in private to serve me as <hi>Izilia</hi> her self. Hereupon he tooke leave of me, and since that time I never heard of him. This true recitall of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes (without doubt) will not be sufficient to take from thee the opinion which thy owne crimes have laid on mine innocence. But if this confession serve me for nothing with thee, yet I am well assur'd 'twill stand, for mine avayle, with all persons of Honour and virtue. Yet beleive not, miserable <hi>Nephizus,</hi> that the seeing of thee convicted of so many falshoods and perjuries, I have, as thou hast done, chang'd my affection and desire: No, No, I am still the same <hi>Benzaida;</hi> Such as thou as known me at <hi>Granada,</hi> such am I at <hi>Fez.</hi> I love thee, because I have been capable to love thee. But since my love is a fault which hath made thee commit many others, I will beare the punishment of all those of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; and in revenging my selfe on my selfe, avenge all the Innocents which thou hast abused after me. In finishing these words, <hi>Benzaida</hi> turned on t'other side, and calling <hi>Zamaella</hi> who had follow'd her, made a signe that she should come neer her, &amp; when she was come: Have a care (said she) that when I can no more think on my selfe, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide nothing that be mis-becoming the pudicity of <hi>Benzaida.</hi> She had no sooner ended these words, but she drew out a Ponyard which she had under her robe, and with it strook her selfe a blow to the heart. She stagger'd presently, and leaning on <hi>Zamaella,</hi> had care, even in dying, to preserve that honesty of which the excess of love could never make her neglectfull. <hi>Izilia</hi> first of all saw the Ponyard, and ran to stop <hi>Benzaida,</hi> but neither she nor I were quick enough. All that I could doe was to clap a handkercheif on the wound of that Generous Princesse. She gently thrust away my hand; and her beauty being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly increased in this last moment of her life, she appear'd to me so farre unworthy of the usage she had received from <hi>Nephizus,</hi> that to revenge her I was at the point to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what I had promis'd to <hi>Izilia.</hi> But that <hi>African</hi> Lady, almost plucking <hi>Nephizus</hi> out of his bed by force of tormenting him, See Tyrant (cryed she in his Eares) see what thou hast done!

bloody one. For the House, wherein we were, was broken open by strangers, and for all the resistance I could make, they tooke away <hi>Izilia</hi> and <hi>Nephizus,</hi> and left me for dead in the Court of that fatall Lodging. Tis needlesse to tell you by what chance <hi>I</hi> was brought thence, for those particularities will serve nothing to the clearing of your doubts. <hi>Polexander</hi> having thus related the History of <hi>Nephizus</hi> perjuries; <hi>Ennoramita</hi> after she had shewed her astonishment by divers actions spake thus: I confesse (said she) that I have much adoe to imagine that one man hath, been capable of so many wickednesses. Heaven is Heaven (added she after the manner of the <hi>Mahometans)</hi> and its Justice that never sleepeth, breakes out fearfully when its patience is exhausted. At so holy and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a thought, <hi>Polexander</hi> bad the Princesse goodnight, and commanding his Pilot to make use of all favour of the Wind, his Vessell made so good way in two dayes and two nights, that he came neere to the coasts of <hi>Morocco.</hi> The wind fail'd them under the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tress of <hi>Guargetssem,</hi> &amp; compel'd <hi>Polexander</hi> &amp; his Company to make the rest of their Journey by Land. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> being very much disguised and her Women too, tooke Camels, and by little Journeys, came with their conductor to that famous City which the follies of the Old <hi>Hely,</hi> and the Tyrannies of his ridiculous Sons, had made more deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late then an Army of Christians would have done.</p>
               <p>Ten dayes had the <hi>Justs</hi> been open when this Troope arrived, and a great number of Knights had appeared with severall Successes, and all had been constrained by the Lawes of the Turney, to declare publikely who they were, &amp; who were their Mistresses. <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who came expressely to chastise the indiscretion of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and avenge <hi>Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana</hi> of that Princes impudence, had a great minde to put himselfe into the lifts, the next day after his arrivall. But <hi>Ennoramita</hi> intreating him to give her one intire day, as well to see the Combat as to be informed of the Combatants, he put it off to the second day; and went, with her, to take up their Lodging in one of the great Innes, wherein strangers had all kind of freedome. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> was no sooner lodged, but she sent one of her Slaves to enquire, through all the Innes, if there were not any Knights of <hi>Tunis.</hi> But for all the Slaves diligence in that perquisition, he returned to his Mistris without learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that might content her. She passed all the night in much unrest, and assoone as 'twas day, clad her selfe in the habit of the Lady of <hi>Morocco,</hi> that she might be the lesse noted. A little before noone she went to the place of the <hi>Justs,</hi> and taking her seat in the place appointed for Spectators of quality and cheifly for Ladies, she heard the sound of many Trumpets. The desire to find <hi>Muley-Hassen,</hi> turning her all into eyes, there was not a man entred, were he on Horseback or otherwise, that she surveyed not from head to foote. The trumpets which she lately heard, came into the field. They were clad like so many <hi>Fames</hi> and served as <hi>Vant-Courtiers</hi> to a Knight clad according to the ancient <hi>Greekes.</hi> He came to the place prepar'd for the recitalls, and all being silent, he spake thus.</p>
               <p>Tis superfluous that I tell my Name, since so many <hi>Fames</hi> publish who I am; yet not to interrupt that Order which many valiant men observed, you shall understand that my Name is <hi>Sidy-Bu-Median,</hi> famous by the reputation of the great Saint from whom I am descended. And more famous yet by the affection which the Princesse of <hi>Telensin</hi> hath always born me in spight of the cruelties of that Tyrant who possesseth her estate. Those who have come in here before me, have appear'd to give a proof of their love and valour and I am come to publish the virtue and beauty of a great Queen, and to oblige all those in this Assembly, who are men of courage, to have pity of my mis-fortune and to employ their valour for the deliverance of my Princesse. Every one being moved with this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, gave double attention, and promising to himselfe to heare something that should be strange, made known to <hi>Median</hi> that they had a great minde to heare him. He thereupon (after he had discovered the Picture of the Princesse of <hi>Telinfin</hi> that was painted on his Buckler) went on thus. There is none in this Assembly who knowes not the greatnesse of the Kingdome of <hi>Telensin,</hi> and who, in some way, hath not heard that the Kings of it have made themselves redoubtable to their Enemies. He which now raigns What said I? He which raigns, No he raignes not, for the fury of his Subjects excited by the Sorceries and predictions of a false Prophet come out of <hi>Tefesca</hi> hath loaden him with Irons, and dispoyld him of his Government. The poore <hi>Habdulac-Numen</hi> (so
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54727:99"/>
is that Prince called) hath one only daughter; of whom <hi>I</hi> dare say nothing for feare <hi>I</hi> should not speake as <hi>I</hi> ought, This Angell of Light is called <hi>Arzila,</hi> and should not have been put amongst the List of mortall things, if the affection which she beares to the least of men had not cut off somewhat from the opinion they had conceived of her Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <hi>I</hi> was that Happy man, though an unworthy object for <hi>Arzila's</hi> affection. <hi>I</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that favour with the respect that <hi>I</hi> ought, and not being able to deserve her by any service, I never vaunted of any thing but that I could not merit her. I was even on the point to be elevated unto heaven, when a Divell gotten loose from hell <hi>(I</hi> meane the false Prophet of whom <hi>I</hi> have spoken) ruined all my hopes, and buryed my felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties under the ruines of the Royall Progeny. <hi>Habat Elmely</hi> (so was that cruell Tyrants Name) covering his ambition and Pride with a falle and pernicious piety, entred into <hi>Telensin</hi> with a great company of his Sectaries; and after he had there preach'd his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, gain'd the Brutish and inconstant people, and made them rise in armes against heir Soveraign. <hi>I</hi> Joyn'd my selfe with those that were loyall, and did my best endeavour. tBut after divers defeates, and being left for dead in the feild of the last Battle, <hi>Abdulac V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> was taken prisoner, loaden with Irons, and thrown into a horrible Dungeon. The false Prophet presently took on him the Royall Authority, and since that he had acused to be published at the beginning of the War, that he was come from Heaven and the great Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to teach the truth to the <hi>Telensiens,</hi> and, by the marriage of himselfe with <hi>Arzila,</hi> beget them Kings that should chase all the Christians out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica;</hi> he commanded that in what place soever that Princesse should be retyr'd, they should bring her to him, and declar'd, that not only he, which conceal'd her should be impal'd alive, but also, that if she came not in within foure dayes, <hi>Abdulac Vmen</hi> should be flead alive in the great place of <hi>Telensin.</hi> At this last newes <hi>Arzila,</hi> (who passionately lov'd her Father) left the place where she was in safety, thought it good (in appearance) not to dis-allow of the false prophets designe; came to him to his Palace, only with two Women, and casting her at his feet: Behold (said she) the Maiden (for whom thou hast testified hitherto so much respect and affection) reduc'd to submssions and prayers! If the desire to raigne, which hath made thee forget the Loyalty thou owest my Father, hath not made thee lose the Love thou didst beare the Daughter, repent thy selfe for having displeased him, and setting a period to his mis-fortune, give him cause to acknowledg so great a service. I present not my selfe before thee to make use of that absolute power which my birth and thy affection gives me over thy will; but I beseech thee as a Subject, and submit to all thou shalt ordeine me; Provided thou restore to me the King my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Ought not the false <hi>Emely</hi> to have beene moved by the prayers and tears of that faire Princesse? He was not a jot, though he feigned to be so. His infamous brutality see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self at the point to be satiated, made him dissemble his hatred. and advis'd him to promise <hi>Arzila</hi> all that she requested to the end, that she might the more willingly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice her self for the safety of her Father. He then led her into a place where she could be heard by no body; and taking her by the hand said, I keep not <hi>Abdulac</hi> prisoner, not have I taken on me the title of a King, but to oblige you not to be cruell to me. Have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one that is unfortunate. succour a man desperate, pay with some small favour so many yeares services which I have given you (though my discretion hath hindered me from making it appeare to you) and dispose, as you please, of the Crown of Telensin: I restore it you with your Father, and renounce for ever all other glory but that of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. He added many other immodest and lascivious words to those, and seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe sweetly refused, began to be moved, and told the Chast <hi>Arzila</hi> that she should not hope to see againe her Father on the throne, if she did not grant him what he had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares search'd for. The Princesse, hiding her just displeasure, threw her selfe again at the feet of that abhominable wretch, in Lieu of answering him; and melting into teares My Lord (said she) consider what tis you require of me; thinke who I am, and do notmake me beleeve that thou hast ever lov'd me. The Tyrant laugh'd at the Princesse virtue, and raising her from the ground, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

came red as fire, and stepping a pace or two backwards; My honour then (said she) is the only ransome thou desirest for thy Princes liberty? I ever beleev'd that thou wert an in famous fellow and a Traytor: But expect not that the feare of death, nor the hope of reseeing <hi>Abdulac</hi> in the throne, shall ever bring me to lose that which I love more then the Crown or my life. The King my Father would disavow me for his Daughter; and would be his owne executioner, should he know I had reestablish'd him by so sordid, so shamefull, and execrable a treaty. The false Prophet, enraged to see himselfe so farre from his purpose, caus'd <hi>Arzila</hi> to be taken away by some of his guard, brought her into the Dungeon where her father lay; and to affright her more, and by other wayes, then by threatnings, commanded her Fathers Nose to be cut off: At which horrible spectacle, <hi>Arzila</hi> tore her haire, cast her selfe into her Fathers Armes, be-bloodied her face against his; and after some lamentations, able to make the heart of a common Executioner to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, besought the King to give her over for the price of his liberty. My body (said she) is yours; give it then to that Monster, and make use of that power which Nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you; and, with that, she againe imbrac'd her Father, and besmear'd her face all over with his blood. When she thought that she was frightfull enough by that soyling, shee turn'd her to the Tyrant, and extending her Armes and hands to him: Thou most infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and lustfull Goate (cried she) why dost thou not exact presently from this Prince, whilst he suffers under thy afflicting torments, that which thy lust hath so long wished for?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abdulac</hi> made his Daughter to be silent, by the most pitifull remonstrances, that so tragicall an occasion could put into the mouth of a Father. But why should I stand so much on the misfortunes of that incomparable payr? The good King would never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the dishonour of his Daughter; and seeing so great constancy in so weak a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, indur'd, with a great deale of patience, his ignominious and cruell usage. The inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Elmely,</hi> grown desperate by the virtue of those two truly-royall minds, caus'd <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zila</hi> to be put into a Dungeon apart from her Father, and so went away, after he had as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd them that there should not passe a day, wherein they should not feel how far his choler would extend. It is (brave Knights) five moneths now, since these honor'd perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages have suffer'd an infinite sort of indignities in these Dungeons, wherein they are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive. Ever since I have been able to carry Armes, I have try'd divers wayes to free the Father and Daughter, but none hath succeeded; and if by your assistance, I see me not quickly in case to pluck the Tyrant from that Throne, who is no way redoubtable but in words, I here make a vow, never to review my desolate Country. <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> (who was present at this relation) perceiving that <hi>Sidy-Bu-Median</hi> had no more to say, fixing his Eyes a while on the portraict of <hi>Arzila,</hi> began to speak thus: I see well (said he to the unfortunate Knight) that you are come hither to make friends, and not to engage your selfe in new enmities. As for my selfe, who alone should have some cause to refuse the succour you come for, since you are come with an intent to fight with me: yet I make known to you, that I give my full resentment to the consideration of <hi>Arzila,</hi> and will imploy, for her deliverance and the King her Father, all the power that I have in the Kingdomes of <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Above five hundred Knights, Christians and Mahometans, presently after, offered themselves to <hi>Sidy,</hi> and their offers were prosecuted with so many actions of valour, that the very yeare of the <hi>Turney</hi> the false Prophet was burn'd alive in <hi>Telensin, Abdulac Vmen</hi> reestablished in his Throne, and the vertuous <hi>Arzila</hi> married to the constant <hi>Sidy-Bu-Median.</hi> Assoone as he had given <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> thanks for the assistance he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he besought him to dispence with his <hi>Iusting</hi> against him; for (said he) I cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extravagancy contest for valour, with that man whose succour I am come to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore. After he had made this just excuse to the Prince of <hi>Morocco,</hi> he retyr'd; and left the field free to a Portugall Knight, the Son of the Governour of <hi>Larache,</hi> who on the faith of <hi>Abdelmelec's Chartells,</hi> fear'd not to forsake the Banks of <hi>Zila,</hi> and to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the hands of his Enemies. He came to the place appointed for Speech, and said boldly that he was a Christian in Religion, a Portingall by birth, a sworne Enemy to the Moores by duty and inclination; and Son of him that had taken from them the towne of <hi>Larache.</hi> But if all these things (said he) give you cause to look on me with an Eye of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54727:100"/>
of hatred, that which I have yet to tell you will oblige you to behold me with that of commiseration and pity. Amongst the Slaves which the Law of Armes gave us, we met with a Moorish Lady, so faire and so accomplish'd, that assoon as I saw her, I became her Vassal. Neither the Antipathy of our Nations, nor the contrariety of our Beleifes, no not the very contempt which that deare Enemy made of my service, have been able to cure me of my passion. I daily besought her to be favourable unto me, and as daily she rejected my prayers. She will not almost either see me or heare me; and threatens, that if <hi>I</hi> restore her not quickly to her father, she will free her selfe by death from the servitude where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she is. <hi>I</hi> feare to lose her, either one way or other; so that I know not how to demean my selfe towards her: <hi>I</hi> would willingly give her her liberty, but <hi>I</hi> feare that she will forsake me assoone as she is free. On the other side, I doubt, least in keeping her, she carry her selfe to some desperate action; and that apprehension presseth me to send her to her Parents. At the same of this Turney <hi>I</hi> have taken Armes to oblige her; and having promis'd to maintaine that she is fairer then all the Ladyes in <hi>Africa, I</hi> am now come to perform my word to her.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Portugall</hi> had made this recitall, he was led about the Lists, and being left with a very good Lance, expected when the Trumpets should give him a Signall of the time and order of the Combat. Presently after came <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> out of his Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and being warned to put on, came fiercely on the <hi>Portingall,</hi> who made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that he was an excellent Horseman, and broke his Lance on the Princes <hi>Caske.</hi> At the second Course he made the Challenger forsake his Saddle; but by his owne strength as much as by that of his Enemy, he was carried over his Horses Crupper. The Officers of the field came and presently took him up, and giving him his horse againe, took his Buckler and hung it up among many others under the Portraict of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> The valiant Moore <hi>Elgazair</hi> tooke the <hi>Portugals</hi> place: That Knight was the belov'd of Ladies and Warriours, and though he was very inconstant in his Love and Freindship, yet he had the good luck to acquire many Mistresses, and many Freinds. At the first Turney of <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> he did Wonders for the proud Moore <hi>Abra;</hi> at that of <hi>Nephizus</hi> at <hi>Fez,</hi> he maintained that <hi>Arais</hi> Princesse of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> of the Mountain <hi>Farobe</hi> was the most charming beauty of either the one or the other <hi>Mauritania;</hi> and now he would make <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> confesse that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> was not so faire as the young <hi>Elserifa.</hi> He came to make his Declaration at the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med place; and made all his Auditors laugh, at the grace wherewithall he publish'd the perfections of his new and easie Mistris. He desired not though, to be esteem'd more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant then he was, and for that cause he carried both armes, &amp; a Device that intimated suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently the ficklenesse of his mind. His Arms were wavy, and wrought with such art, that when the Sun darted his beames on them, the Colours losing themselves one in another, &amp; producing a fair effect, resembled the rainbow, or rather those various shadowings which you see on the necks of pigeons. His Buckler was bordered with Opalls &amp; in the midst was seen a Fountaine like to that marvelous one in <hi>Daulphine,</hi> which from time to time casts out flames. This Knight was so renowned for his valour and courtesie, and so known for the many fair actions he had done, that all the Spectators promis'd to themselves an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame pleasure in the Combat. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> lov'd him with all his heart and if he could have suffer'd himself to be overcome, so that the glory of <hi>Alcidiana</hi> had not receiv'd a diminution by it, <hi>I</hi> doubt not but he would himselfe have contributed to his owne dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat. But Love being alwayes stronger then freindship, suspended the Princes affection, and oblig'd him to satisfie his owne passion. And that of the whole Assembly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking his place, and <hi>Algazair</hi> his, they parted both at once, and met in the midst of their Cariere with such an extreame force that they lifted up one another, and sent the splinters of their Lances all about the fields. The two next courses were not lesse faire nor unequall to the first, and so ravish'd the Spectators that they clapped their hands, and signified by their acclamations, that they had not yet seen any like it. But the fourth decided the businesse, and caused the Picture of the young <hi>Elserifa</hi> to be placed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly under that of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi>

               <p>This faire Encounter was follow'd by another, which gave no lesse admiration to all there present. 'Twas undertaken by a French Prince, that was expressely come from

                  <hi>Naples</hi> to be at this Turney. He was the worthy inheritor of his Predecessors eminent virtues, and from his Infancy had equally made profession of love and the warres. If they were astonished at the richnesse of his Armour, and the pomp of his equipage, they admir'd not lesse the novelty which appeard in the picture of his Lady. Shee was clad in such a fashion, that they might easily know the greatnesse of her condition: But two little <hi>Loves</hi> which were painted over her head held a Veyle before her face, and kept her from being known. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> drew neer to complain of that sleight, and thought he had the more cause, because looking on the hands of that Lady, and taking them for Nose-gayes of Lillies and Roses, he told the Prince, that hee wrong'd so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a beauty in not shewing her in so famous an Assembly.</p>
               <p>The Prince answer'd him, that he was of the same opinion, and that his Lady deserv'd to be seen by the Eyes of all the World, but that he fear'd the chance of Armes, and dar'd not expose the fairest creature of the Vniverse, to the extravagancies of fortune. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec</hi> approv'd of the brave French-mans just apprehension, and would not that the veyle of his Lady should retard the contentment of the Company. They ran at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in their first courses brake their lances without any advantage; at the fourth, our generous French-man strook and was not touched; at the fifth he made <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> quit one of his stirrops, and at the sixth they fell, both men and Horses together. Presently they got up againe, and put their hands to their Swords to decide the difference, but the Judges of the Field came instantly in to them, and separating them according to the Lawes of the Turney, proclaym'd them both Victorious. <hi>Abdelmelee</hi> return'd to his Tent, and the French Prince to his lodging with his veyld Picture. This <hi>Iust</hi> so ended, there entred two Knights clad as the <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> which are of the Guard to the great Turke. They were two <hi>Flemish</hi> Renegados, who were in great esteem among the Warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of <hi>Argier,</hi> and were no lesse famous for their valour then for their fantasticalnesse. Of extraordinary Enemies, which they had been, they were become friends, and their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity had produc'd a love, which hath for a longtime been the talk of all <hi>Barbary.</hi> The one was calld <hi>Abdear,</hi> and the other <hi>Raman. Abdear</hi> had married a Moore, who passed among the Ladyes of her Nation for a beauty perfectly accomplish'd, and yet her extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant humour and eight or ten dayes enjoying, had made her so displeasing to him, that he had much adoe with himselfe to refraine from repudiating her. Her black haire, her complexion that shew'd the Eye a mixture of pure incarnadine, with a brown that had nothing of the Olive, her stature tall and slender, the quicknesse of her Eyes and of her wit, were not sufficient charmes to allure him. But on the contrary, the yellow Locks of <hi>Ramans</hi> wife, who was a Brittaine and by him made to deny her faith, the whitenesse which she borrowed as well from art as Nature, and her green Eyes, which made some beleeve that she saw not a glimpse, were to <hi>Abdear</hi> such miracles and perfections as were not found in all the Sex of Woman besides. <hi>Raman</hi> was, (as he said himselfe in the publick place) of his friends humour, and yet they had different palats. He noted every day some new defects in white-flaxen hair'd Woemen, to the end he might find cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne his owne. He cal'd that red, which was but halfe flaxen, and never cal'd the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame white complexions, but relicks of Sicknesse, and Images of Playster. For the haires and black eye-browes, he spake of them as of the Master-peeces of Nature; and said they were made to compose of them those powerfull bowes, by which <hi>Love</hi> hath got to himselfe the Empire of the world. The black and sparkling Eyes in a cleare and well-colour'd face, seem'd to him more faire then the brightest Stars in a calme Evening.</p>
               <p>In a word <hi>Raman</hi> was in love with the Wife of <hi>Abdear,</hi> and <hi>Abdear</hi> with the Wife of <hi>Raman;</hi> and their passion was come to such a point, that after they had made themselves confident of one another, they were come together to maintaine publickly the beautie of their Mistrisses. <hi>Raman</hi> came first into the Lists, and first felt that <hi>Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec</hi> had more strength then needed to orethrow him: and if the Grecian and African beauties had left their defence to him, they had lost that fame which they had gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Nations of the world. <hi>Abdear</hi> thought that the flaxen should be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him then the brown had been to his companion; But he kept his Horse no better then his friend, but blemishing (as much as he could by his fall) the great lustre that
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54727:101"/>
subjects us to the power of the flaxen-hayrd beauty, made all the Assembly say, that Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are good or bad, according as they find good or bad Defenders. Assoone as the noyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that follow'd the defeat of these two Extravagants. was over, there were seen appeare at the Barres, a Troup very proudly, but very sadly accroutred. The Trumpetters were clad as those of Europe paint the Phantasms and shadowes of the dead. Their Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets were made as t were of bones, and had a sound so dolefull, that many imagin'd, they were to see some Funerall in Iesu of <hi>Iusting.</hi> But they soone changed their opinion: for presently after, they saw come in divers foot-boyes, and many horses, which among the black that cover'd them, made some shew of flames. The Captaine of this Brigade, was mounted upon a Roane horse with Caparisons of black Velvet, imbroider'd with Gold and Silk of the colour of fire. The Armes he bare, by the industry of the Workman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented a furnace, wherein the fire was nourished by a little mizling raine that fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. His shield was black in many places, and the rest bloodied with the long tresse of a Comet. This Devise had for motto to it, these three Latin words: <hi>Vt perdat lucet. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemander</hi> (so was the Knight call'd so deadly inflamed; came to the place prescrib'd, and easily obtaining the Audience, he desired, said: that he was come out of the Mountaines which separate <hi>Spaine</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> to give to the faire <hi>Infeliciana</hi> the last testimony of his love. Truely his constancy deserves from us extraordinary prayses. For though the object of his passion was, during her life, full of grace and merit, yet we must confesse that there was a miracle in so long a perseverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Infeliciana</hi> enjoyed in the highest degree, all that which the fairest Ladies, either Greek or Spanish, had of allurement or fire; yet whoever, di-sinteress'd should, Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will acknowledge the beauty of that Lady to be nothing in comparison of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of her wit, and the sweetnesse of her conversation. This magnanimous Knight, charm'd with so many divine qualities, had neither soul nor life, but what he receiv'd from the Eyes or discourse of <hi>Infeliciana.</hi> When he was absent from her, he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but languish: His melancholy and heavinesse made both the Court and the light odious to him, and made the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> (of whom he was passionatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd) to take notice of it. That Prince, by all manner of offers and favours, would faine have won him to discover the cause of his disquiet, but all in vaine. After he had long time mused on it, he doubted that the sadnesse of his favorite came from love; and himselfe being then extreamely in love with a young Lady call'd <hi>Ismenia,</hi> who wanted no allurements, he imagin'd that <hi>Polemander</hi> kept not his love pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, for any other thing, but because it had originall from her beauty. Presently the King grew jealous, and so extreamely jealous, that, to free him of all his suspitions, he made use of all the wit and subtlety wherewith his love could furnish him. But it was all in vaine that he made use of his great promises, his feined compassion, and his other artifices. The discretion and silence of <hi>Polemander</hi> triumph'd over all those enemies, and confirmd the King in that opinion he had too lightly conceiv'd. He secretly look'd on <hi>Polemander</hi> as his Rivall. He forgot what he was to him, He threatens him, and suffering himselfe to be transported by his former motions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated already on the execution of him, which but lately he lov'd as his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. On the other side, his fury made him think strange things of <hi>Ismenia.</hi> He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused her for being crafty, to desire more then one Lover, and but to feine as often as she promised him her affection; some dayes passed, during which the Prince was able to containe him, but the excessive torments which his silence added to those his jealousie made him undergoe, compel'd, him at last, to make known his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and discover to all <hi>Navarre</hi> the cause of his vexation. He brake out (in the end) even against <hi>Polemander,</hi> and not content to revile him for those things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he never thought, told him, that if he gave not over his love, he would make him feele all that which could be expected from the just indignation of an offended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. This perfect lover seeing himselfe thrust at, &amp; tott'ring on all sides, would not give place to violence, but abiding in his first resolution, intended to perish rather then to faile of that secrecy he had promised to <hi>Infeliciana.</hi> Whilst all the Court was troubled at the Melancholy and Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Infeliciana</hi> admir'd the generousnesse of her Lover. She confesseth that he only is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be beloved, and laugh'd at the blindnesse of those cowardly and perfidious minds that have no other light but what they have from Envy and detraction. <hi>Polemander,</hi> who well saw how much his discretion made him miserable, protested to <hi>Infeliciana</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to forsake her; and rather to lose the Kings favour then to violate his faith, or those commands which she had justly impos'd on him. He kept his word so truly, that the most crafty and curious Courtiers of them all, were as well caught as the rest, and made no difficulty to beleive that <hi>Ismenia</hi> was the true cause of <hi>Polemander's</hi> passion. But if their preoccupation had not made them see things far otherwise thenthey were, it had been very easie for them to have been dis-beguild, when <hi>Infeliciana</hi> was taken from the Court to be given to a <hi>German</hi> Prince to whom she had been promis'd by her parents. Truly, death is not so horrible as the departure of <hi>Infeliciana</hi> was to <hi>Polemander.</hi> He fail'd but little of being lost to himselfe, and had infallibly done injury to his owne person, if that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie's forbiddings, and the hope of re-seeing her had not staid his Tragicall resolution. In spight of himselfe he therefore gave himselfe life, but unwilling to keep it but as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which he would persecute, he did him those ills, and went on to such extremities, that none would ever beleive it, but such as have lov'd so truly as he. The day that <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciana</hi> parted, he went out alone from the City, and taking on him the habit of a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, put himselfe in the way she was to pass. As farre off as He saw her Chariot, he tore his hair, gave most fearfull shriekes, and beating his head against the trees and stones, lay as dead in the midst of the high-way. Those that rid before <hi>Infeliciana</hi> pittied him, and taking him; for a man afflicted with some strange sicknesse, commanded their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to remove him, those that were chosen to doe that worke of charity, were so base, that they had almost kild him, in Lieu of assisting that poor Lover. They did him a many mischiefes in drawing of him, and with the extremity of their dragging made him recover his senses. Presently he rose up as a man enraged: and getting out of the hands of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitifull men, ran even to <hi>Infeliciana's</hi> Chariot. In her presence he renewed his cries and fury, and spake such things that the most barbarous mindes could not hear without rele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. On an instant he cast himself under the Chariot, which the Charioteer had stop'd; and as he lay there besought them to crush his head in peices under the Wheeles, to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, by so glorious a death, a life that was odious unto him; in this speech he intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled the Name of <hi>Infeliciana,</hi> and repeated it so often, that she tooke notice of it, and knowing him, was so strucken with greife that she fell into a swoon. Assoone as her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had brought her againe from her fainting, She commanded her Squire to take that miserable creature from under the Charriot: divers alighted to obey her, and taking <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemander</hi> by the armes and head, made him by force to let go his hold on one of the wheeles. But assoon as they had pulled him off, he threw himselfe on againe, and those that would have hindred him, could not doe it so wel, nor the Charioteer so fitly take his time to put on; but that one of the wheels ran over his right leg, which pain he indured so patiently that no body perceived it; and though he could scarce keepe himselfe up, yet followed her more then a league on foot, still caling on the Name of <hi>Infeliciana,</hi> &amp; wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a happy Iourney. He remain'd still in these violent passions, and begg'd from Heaven eithera speedy death or the return of that beauty. When he was told that she had forgotten her promises and given her selfe to one of the house of the <hi>Palatine;</hi> Tis very hard to expresse the excesse of Sorrow; which that infidelity brought on <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</hi> But when he was in the height of his griefe, he heard that <hi>Infeliciana</hi> was dead with sorrow for having left him for another.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polemander,</hi> after he had related all this, stood a while speechlesse; at last surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his passions, and wiping off his teares, he addressed him to the Prince of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and discovering the Picture of <hi>Infeliciana;</hi> I come, said he, to maintain that there is not a beauty in the world which should not give place to this. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> would have made an answer to that speech, conformable to his peevish humour, but the Judges of the field intreated him to give them leave to doe their charge; and addressing them to <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander:</hi> Your intent (said they) is praise-worthy, but it is contrary to the Lawes of this Turney, the Prince <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> hath undertaken it, to make all Knights confesse that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> is the rarest beauty in the World. She, who is pictured on your Buckler; is

dead, and by consequence how faire soe ever She hath been, she can, be no more compar'd with <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> That beauty which is no more, is as a beauty that hath never been. Judge, after this, If you may be received to the combat, and whither <hi>Abdelmel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Judges, who knew how farre the gallantry of a Lover mightextend, hearkned very favourably to <hi>Folemander;</hi> but answering him in few words, that a dead beauty could not be set in comparison with a living one, they, intreated him to retire; &amp; til he had gotten a new Mistris, give place to those that were yet to run. <hi>Polemander,</hi> loath to be noted by an unreasonable wilfulnesse, the very same day got towards his shipping, and after his setting sayle, within few dayes (happily) arrived at <hi>Beyone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The while, <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> seeing the Sun ready to set, promis'd to himselfe to goe victorious out of the Turney, and bragged already amongst his <hi>Courtiers,</hi> that the Theife, who had stolne from him the Picture of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> durst not forsake his vess<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell nor appeare in so famous an Assembly. But the pretended Thiefe was come; and, had it not been for <hi>Ennoramita's</hi> intreaty, had long before made him (with his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) lose also the boldnesse of continuing his boastings. Whilst that Princesse sate desperate of seeing him come in, whom her heart and Eyes so servently long'd for: She saw enter a Knight clad after the same manner as are the Knights of <hi>Senega</hi> and <hi>Thombut;</hi> he was followed by six black Slaves, and mounted on a Black Barbary, caparison'd with Olive-colour Velvet cut into the fashion of <hi>Oake<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Knight took off a taffata of the colour of dead leavs that was upon it &amp; shew'd him a prodigions shape, instead of a Lady's picture; 'Twas a living death: He had caused to be painted a body, which in all parts was half bare to the bone, and half cover'd with flesh. One side of her face seem'd very faire, and the other shew'd nothing but bones <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> was affrighted at the sight of it; and asked of the Knight; whither: he had caus'd that Monster to be pictur'd in contempt of <hi>ALCIDIANA.</hi>

               <p>Such as she is [said he) she is more fair then your Queen; and could you see he Originall, as you now see but the Copy, you will avow, to the shame of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> that this body so faire in those places by which she seemes to be living, is the sole ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whereto all Princes owe their affections and services. But that I may let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing stick in your minde to hinder you from being of my opinion; Know, that pict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure you see is that of a Princesse, who lately was adored through all <hi>Africa</hi> She is faire in the highest degree, but she is more unfortunate: her body, which by a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priviledg preserves all her beauties in her mseries, is accompanied with a minde that incessantly dies, and which is equally devour'd by love and hatred, by duty and aversion. If Christians, who have the liberty of re-presenting all things by their colours, had the Art of painting mindes: you should see the fairest body of the world joyn'd to a minde even like death it selfe. But what my Painter could not doe one way, he hath done in another, and not being able to make the mind seen with the body he hath divided the body it selfe and painted the one part alive and the other dead. The Starre, under whose aspect I took possession of earth gave me not life, but to consecrate it to this faire Princesse. I loved her, before I was of fit age to know her, and I adored her assoone as I was capable of reason. I left <hi>Africa</hi> to try by the knowledge of strange virtues and manners to acquire such qualities as were worthy of her, after 3 years: carying her to an excesse which I had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to hope, drew me out of the dirt, to raise me even to the Skies: My <hi>Rivalls</hi> were amazed at my good fortune, and their pride not permitting them to suffer it, they e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

me from that place of pleasure. I was stricken by the same hand whence I expected my protection and my miserable soule exposed to eternall tortures was condemn'd towander incessantly through the solitary Deserts of <hi>Numidia. Ennoramita</hi> could not longer be in quiet (after the hearing of those last words) without testifying by her cries that she was that Dead-living-Lady, or rather that dead-one reviv'd who was painted on the buckler of the desolate Knight: she doubted not, but he that had spoken was <hi>Muley Hassen;</hi> and throwing her on the Neck of her confident, who was seated neere her; <hi>Atalida</hi> [said she] marke that Knight, tis <hi>Muley,</hi> tis <hi>Muley,</hi> without doubt: But let's heare the continuation of his History and mine. <hi>Muley,</hi> who had not been interrupted by <hi>Ennoramita's</hi> agitation, thus continued on his Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some short time after I was confined to the deserts of <hi>Numidia,</hi> my Princess [as if shee had been guilty for not loving her Enemy] was deliver'd over to his fury, and condemned to a punishment, that was to last as long as she had either faith or life. Tis even he [said againe <hi>Ennoramita;]</hi> Good Heaven! How discreet is he to hide what should not be known? She implor'd not the mercy of her Judges [said the Knight,] to make them lenify the sentence of er Condemnation, but seeing that it could not be revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>k'd, she went willingly to her torture, and in the height of her torments, exceedingly blessed the Executioners, for giving her so illustrious means to make her virtues the more renowned. In the meane time I led on a miserable life, among the precipices and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines &amp; having no more to hope for in the world, I went out of it by a voluntary retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and sequester'd my selfe into the Caverns of our Mountaine <hi>Atlas.</hi> O how wife was he in the art of love, who said, that Love is a just Master; and if so be wee would suffer and have patience, wee shall infallibly receive the wages we have deserved! I had not there abandon'd the World six moneths, with the hopes that had so pleasin gly stayd me there, when the very voice of my faire Princess call'd mee thence: (O heaven cried out <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> he Speakes of that time, when he was a <hi>Hermit,</hi> and that I visited him with <hi>Nephizus.)</hi> That visible Angell [continued <hi>Muley]</hi> took the payn to descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my solitary vault, and by a light derived from her selfe, to expell the obscurity of my cavern. I saw that miracle; I spake to her; <hi>I</hi> told her my afflictions. I Petitioned that I might aveng her; and offered to lose my selfe for her safety. But unwilling to have any other will then hers, I intreated, that I might be once, for all, commanded what I should doe. I would have thee live, said shee, but not live contented, since I am unfortunate. Give over then this manner of obscure and dismall life, and get thee far hence, making the renowne of thy actions to sound so farre, that the noyse of them may come into my eares. My Honour and faith forbid me, to have any particular communication with thee: but they forbid mee not, to rejoyce in thy Fame. O poore Prince [said <hi>Amaton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> softly] how well hath he concea'ld that which I spake, in banishing him from my presence. I obeyed, without resistance (continued the Knight) a command, that was so glorious for mee, and so worthy the vertue of my Princess. I put my selfe into the Armies of mine own Enemies; and, during two yeares, serv'd them so well, that it was my fault alone, if I brought no other fruits thence then that of Honour. Hee lies not [said <hi>Ennoramita]</hi> but alas! what hath he done since? Whence comes he now? I was on the point [said the Knight] to put in execution one of the fairest enterprizes, that a faithfull <hi>Musulman</hi> could conceive against the <hi>Christians,</hi> when they who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Secrecies of my affection, gave me intelligence that my Princess had been taken away from that place wherein her Ty ant had long time kept her prisoner, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into some other that was not known but to her Tormentors. Presently I forsook my Armes, and infallible designes, and under the habit you now see mee in, have tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled from the one end of <hi>Africa</hi> to the other.

Assone as <hi>Muley-Hassen</hi> (for 'twas he) had finished his history, there grew a humming or muttering noyse from the midst of the Auditors, and presently after some shouts and talke, which intimated that he had given satisfaction to all the Company. But if the rumour had not taken from the faire and constant <hi>Amatonta Ennoramita,</hi> the liberty of being heard; O how had the publique joy been augmented <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>and the shoutes and clapping of the hands been redoubled! In the meane time, the Heraulds imposing silence: <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> began to speake, and told <hi>Muley,</hi> that though in the causing him to lose his Buckler, there would be nothing got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to <hi>Alcidiana</hi> or himselfe, yet he was glad that he should make an end of the day by his defeat. <hi>Muley</hi> answered nothing to that boasting, but went to take one of the strongest lances that was in the field, and brought his Horse gently to the end of the Tilt.</p>
               <p>The Trumpetters, that were weary with calling so many Knights, sounded for the last time, and seeing the Sun set, invited by a hasty sounding, our two Princes to a speedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of their difference. At the parting of <hi>Muley, Ennoramita</hi> grew pale, and, if she had not lean'd on one of her Women, She had infallibly discovered that she was Interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Iust.</hi> 'Tis a strange malady, or rather a pleasant folly this Love. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> knowes how strong her Lover is, how expert, and how many more redoubtfull Knights then <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> he hath overthrown, yet she feares least some disgrace betide him, and that the same <hi>Demon</hi> which had so many yeares persecuted her, should enter into the body of <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> or at least-guide his arme and lance, so that <hi>Muley</hi> might receive an affront from him. But whil'st she was in these feares, the hardy <hi>Hassen</hi> astonish'd his adversary and all the Spectators with his vigor and dexterity. He had already broken three lances, and, at all the three courses, carried away the Honor from <hi>Abdelmelec.</hi> At the fourth; he made him lose his Stirrops; and if the <hi>Moor</hi> had not clasped his Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the neck of his horse, without doubt he had gon to the ground. <hi>Ennoramita</hi> saw that brave course, and from thence conceived such a hope, that her blood, which was all got to her heart, left the place that had no more need of defence, and spread it selfe through all those parts which it had forsaken. The Judges of the field hindred any further running, and fearing least the successe might not be fortunate to their Prince, for that by reason of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have (said she) sent my faithfull Slave, with a Charge to follow him, and that assoone as he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As he ended his discourse, <hi>Ennora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mita's</hi> Slave entred the Chamber, and at his entrance addressing him to his Mistresse, See Madam (said he) the Knight you sent me to seeke <hi>Amatonta</hi> startled at that newes, and was so surpriz'd that she could not arise from the place where she was seated: <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> undertook the entertainment. He went to meet <hi>Muley</hi> at the Gate, and after he had prais'd his Valour, told him, that a Lady of great quality was so ravished <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that cry, gave her Lover more then the halfe of her trouble. He stood presently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, and abode befor <hi>Amatonta,</hi> as if he had been strucken by a thunderclap. She arose to recall him from that transport, and told him aboue a hundred times, with an action full of Sadnesse and Love, that she was the unfortunate <hi>Perselida-Amaton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta-Ennoramita.</hi> Is it you <hi>Madam,</hi> cried <hi>Muley-Hassen?</hi> and are you free and alive? Yes <hi>Muley</hi> (answered the Princess) I live, and should say that I do but now begin to live, since but of late I have recovered that life, which <hi>Nephizus</hi> had deprived me of, in taking from me the liberty of seeing thee. Thereupon, she related to him the death of the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> the long time she had been kept a captive, and the resolution she had at last taken to get out of her Prison, and to search for some one which might deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her from the servitude of him who had forsaken her for the love of another. After this she made known to him, that being not able to obtaine any protection from the King her Father, she had sayled to the <hi>Canaryes,</hi> tobeseech the King of those Islands to put an end to her mis-fortunes.</p>
               <p>In the ending this Speech, she made known to <hi>Muley</hi> who <hi>Polexander</hi> was, and thereby obliging him and our <hi>Heroe</hi> too to new complements, for the conclusion of this first interview, made them promise to be mutuall freinds al their lives. <hi>Muley-Hassen</hi> was not free for his already Narration of his adventures; but was forced, after supper, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the particulars to <hi>Ennoramita.</hi> That relation being ended, the Princess intreated him to thinke no more of the Combat he had undertaken against <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and to give himselfe the pleasure to see it ended by the valour of <hi>Polexander. Muley,</hi> who tasted too much of true content to tye himselfe to the prosecution of so vaine a victory as that which he might obtaine on the Prince of <hi>Morocco,</hi> very easily consented to <hi>Ennorami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's</hi> intreaty, and told <hi>Polexander,</hi> that he yeilded to him his place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Polexander,</hi> that was out of all patience til he had left <hi>Africa,</hi> accepted his offer with a great deale of content, and beleeving 'twas farre in night, conducted <hi>Perselida</hi> into her Chamber, and gave his owne to <hi>Muley.</hi> Assoone as he was retyr'd into that of <hi>Alcippus,</hi> he commanded both him and <hi>Diceus,</hi> that all his Equipage should be ready the next day betimes, and that his Ship should be in case to weigh Anchor the night following. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he went to bed and assoone as 'twas day sleep, which he had taken but by Intervalls, left him. He quickly clad himselfe, and after he had addressed his first thoughts to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good Events, went to <hi>Muleys</hi> chamber. He commanded to be brought him very rich Clothes, and very neere the fashion of the Knights of <hi>Morocco,</hi> and the while that <hi>Ennoramita</hi> was dressing, told him a part of his Adventures.</p>
               <p>The Princesse was no sooner in case to be seen by a Lover so passionately desired, but she sent to intreate him to her Chamber. He came thither with <hi>Polexander,</hi> and found her so dressed and clad, that he had cause to have a good opinion of his fortune. These two Lovers renewed the assurances of their affection, and stood a long time parlying with their Eyes and hands; not daring (may be) in the presence of <hi>Polexander,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse that which the height of their love fill'd their mindes withall.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Heroe</hi> tooke notice of it, and knowing that the mysteries of Love desire no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, fitly tooke leave of them, and went to prepare him for the <hi>Justs.</hi> At the houre prescribed by the Laws of the Turney, he rid out of his lodging accompanyed only with <hi>Alcippus;</hi> and, as an ordinary <hi>Moorish</hi> Knight, came to the Gates of the Field. Those who were appointed to give entrance to the Assailants, looked on him with a great deal of Scorne; and seeing him so ill followed, Judged (according to the impertinent custom of bruitish bred men) that he was a man of no great value, At last (with much adoe) he had leave to enter, and comming to the place where the Prince of <hi>Morocco</hi> used to receive and hear his Rivals, <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> (said he) tis needlesse that I should tell thee who I am. This Picture shall speake for me: and in thus speaking he discovered that Buckler he had taken from the Prince. <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> presently knew it, and had not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enough at his first perturbations, to see, without trouble, the man which he expected with so much impatiency, He trembled, and, favourably to interpret that trembling. <hi>I</hi> will say 'twas out of Joy and feare, at least he made it seeme so. For being recollected from his first agitation; I never hoped to see thee more (said he audaciously to <hi>Polexander')</hi> and beleeved, that the Cowardize, wherewith all ill actions are accompanied, would not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54727:104"/>
suffer thee to shew thy selfe in this place of Honour. But since thou hast no lesse impudence to maintaine thy Thefts, then thou hadst boldnesse to do them, I find that Fortune is not all together unjust in making thy rashnesse happy. Yet see here a place wherein she hath but little Authority; And therefore thou shouldst feare least she forsake thee at thy need, and leave thee to suffer that punishment which thou hast deserved. Thou art (replied <hi>Polexander)</hi> either poorely in Love, or very senceles, to suffer (for so long a time) the Portraict of <hi>Alcidiana</hi> in the hands of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and of such another as hath so shamefully made thee quit it. On, <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> Run on to thy revenge, &amp; do not Evaporate thy Choler in idle Narrations. When our <hi>Heroe</hi> had ended his speech, he turned his back to <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and rid to attend him at the end of the Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t. The Prince of <hi>Morocco,</hi> re-collecting all his force and all the opinion of his Courage, came thundring on <hi>Polexander,</hi> and broke his Lance with a great deale of strength. Our <hi>Hero:</hi> struck his on the Princes <hi>Casque,</hi> and turning him over on the Crupper of his Horse, astonished him so, that he was carried to the end of the Cariere, sencelesse. yet he recovered, and tooke a second Lance; <hi>Polexander,</hi> met him with his first, and so impetuously lifted him above his Horse, that almost in the very instant of the shock, they saw him extended on the Gravell. Presently he got up, and on all sides hearing the noyse of the people, and the hand-clappings of all the principall Spectators; he thought himselfe lost in his reputation, if he did not hazard his Life to regaine what he had so lately lost. He call'd for [and 'twas brought him) a fresh Horse, and sent two Pole-axes and two Cimyters to <hi>Polexander,</hi> that he might take his choyce of two. <hi>Polexander</hi> tooke the first he met withall under his hand; and sending the two other to his <hi>Rivall,</hi> bad them tell him, that he was not his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy though his Challenges had extreamely offended him, even to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his life: that he should look to himselfe, and undertake nothing beyond his power. Those words made <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> lose all the little reason was left him: He ran on <hi>Polexander</hi> with the sury, but not with the courage of a Lion. <hi>Polexander</hi> presently stopp'd him, and unwilling to make use of his armes, because they were dangerous, made it appeare to all the Assembly, that he came to the Turney, rather to reprove <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> for his daring, then to punish him for it. The inequality, noted between them, took away all the pleasure the Spectators promised themselves in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Combat. Even <hi>Polexander,</hi> (being ashamed of so much advantage) retired often, and besought <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> to have a care of his life. But that weak and wilfull Prince, neither being able to vanquish nor to yeeld, gave <hi>Polexander</hi> a great deale more trouble, then if he had farre better defended himselfe. Whilst our <hi>Heroe</hi> sought a meanes to be rid of him without killing him, He heard a great noyse of Trumpets at the principall Gate of the field; and took that occasion to oblige <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> at that time, not to be killed. Let us at least see (said he) before we end our Combate, who comes so boldly to violate the Lawes of the Turney. <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> gave a deafe Ear to these words, but seeing a great many Trumpetters enter the field, he tooke off his <hi>Casque,</hi> and went from <hi>Polexander</hi> to chastise those that had contemn'd his countermands.</p>
               <p>A man clad in a long robe, after the Persian maner, covered with Plates of silver cut and imbroydered in scales, streight appear'd mounted on a brave horse. He was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by twelve black Slaves, who had all Collars of silver and long chaines of the same mettle! The Knight himselfe seemed a Slave, for he had chaines on his legs, which (though of Gold) were yet the tokens of his servitude: <hi>Polexander</hi> (at first, knew not what to thinke of that novelty, but casting his eyes on the Banners which were tyed to the trumpets of that Slave-Knight and noting on them a <hi>Phoenix</hi> which arose out of its Cradle, (or if you will it's Tombe] he imagined that 'twas one of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana's</hi> Slaves. His astonishment was no lesse then his joy: He grew pale, he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and passing, in an instant, from one extremity to another, became all on fire. His first perturbances were followed by other more temperate, and re-collecting his Spirits, and making use (as he ought) of his reason, perswaded himself that <hi>Alcidiana</hi> had not, without some important cause, sent that illustrious Slave, to the Court of <hi>Morocco.</hi> Being more nerely approached to see him distinctly, he knew 'twas the same
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54727:105"/>
                  <hi>Pallantus</hi> who had pronounc'd the sentence of his condemnation in <hi>Bajazets</hi> Island. He was oftentimes tempted to go and embrace him; but the considerations of the <hi>Iust,</hi> not permitting his discovery, he expected with a great deale of impatiency what <hi>Pallantus</hi> had to say. The trumpets imposing silence, and the famous Slave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conducted to the place for the Orations, spake thus: <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> Queen of the most happy Island, hath understood, that divers bold men, have taken to themselves such Licence as hath been disadvantagious to her honor, and have dar'd not only to take her for the object of their diversions, but to stile themselves the Knights and defenders of her beauty.</p>
               <p>These Insolencies have troubled the peace of her mind, and have made her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of choler. After she had long complain'd of the pride of men she hath pleas'd to divulge her just indignation, and given me command to be at this Assembly, to the end that by a publick disavowing, I should make known to all the world, that she holds all those for her enemies, who have the impudence to name themselves her <hi>Lovers.</hi> She therefore forbids the continuation of these <hi>Iusts,</hi> and her will is, that the Prince himselfe of <hi>Morocco</hi> be compriz'd within the rigour of her Law. And for asmuch as she heares how a certaine Barbarian call'd <hi>Phelismond,</hi> dares in the Deserts of <hi>Denmark</hi> to vaunt himselfe only worthy of her service; She invites to the ruine of that Monster, all those who think them interested in her honor. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus,</hi> after he had thus ended his strict and proud <hi>Declaration,</hi> retyr'd: and left all those who had not heard of <hi>Alcidiana</hi> in an extreame astonishment at his high cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and language, and in a great desire of knowing him. In the meane time, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec</hi> farr more offended at <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> contempt, then with the disgrace of his combat, I will obey, said he, that which this proud Queen commands; and I will scorne her, since she makes her selfe unworthy of my service. And with that he went and pluck'd downe her Picture which he had hung under a paviiion of Cloth of Gold, and throwing it on the ground, trampled it under his horses feet. <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> beholding that bruitshnesse, ran to <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> and offering his Cymiter at his throat, what Monster (cryd he) more Monster then he of the North, give over the not rendring the respect thou owest to <hi>Alcidiana;</hi> and if thou wilt avenge thy selfe of thy shame, do it on thy selfe, since thou alone art the cause of it. <hi>Polexander,</hi> in thus speaking, alighted to take us <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> picture; When <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> who had lost all knowledge and sence of honor, glad to make use of that advantage, let drive so weighty a blow with his Axe; on our Heroe's helmet, that he had almost laid him on the ground. <hi>Polexander</hi> feeling this basenesse, got present on Horseback; and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge <hi>Alcidiana</hi> rather then himselfe, had quickly brought <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> in case to implore that excessive courtesie which he had so basely offended. <hi>Polexander</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously gave him his life, and went out of the field with the Victory and two <hi>Pictures</hi> of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The Author tells us not how Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec came by Alcidiana's Picture, twice, for <hi>Polexander</hi> took one from him in the ship, and how got he a second for the <hi>Iusts?</hi>
                  </note> In comming from the place of the <hi>Iusts; Muley</hi> joyn'd to him, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating to him the opinion he had of his valour, made him new protestations of his love. They went streight to their lodging, and found there <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> who out of the impatiency of seeing her Lover, could not stay out the end of the <hi>Turney.</hi> She besought him presently to take her out of her Enemies Dominions, and bring her to some place where she might, with facility, heare from the King her Father, to treat with him of her returne and mariage. <hi>Muley</hi> related to her, that, during the time he lay at <hi>Mezila</hi> and in some other Townes of <hi>Numidia,</hi> he had there gotten so many friends and so much credit, that he was little lesse absolute there then the King himselfe: Lett's go thither then, said <hi>Ennoramita,</hi> and assure our selves that, in spight of the power of our common Enemies, we shall quickly see our selves in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley Hassen's</hi> favour. This resolution was not long from being put into execution: For that very houre <hi>Perselida Amatonta Ennoramita</hi> gave to <hi>Polexander</hi> those thanks which she beleev'd was due to him from her, and beseeching him to preserve to her and her deare <hi>Muley,</hi> the friendship he had promised them, rid out of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> to the place where she had left her ship. <hi>Polexander,</hi> on his side had no lesse impatiency. Assoon as he was alone, he sent <hi>Diceus</hi> to learn where <hi>Pallantus</hi> was lodg'd; and after he had been a while with <hi>Alcippus,</hi> silent; we must to <hi>Denmark</hi> (said
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54727:105"/>
he) and avenge <hi>Alcidiana</hi> of a Barbarians boldnesse. <hi>Alcippus</hi> would have made known to him the difficulties that were to be met with in that voyage; but <hi>Polexander</hi> with one word shut his mouth; and to tell him that his intent could not be alter'd, we must (said he) the second time go to <hi>Denmark,</hi> and part, for it, hence this very day. In that very instant, <hi>Diceus</hi> return'd, and told the King his Master, that <hi>Pallantus</hi> was return'd to his ship, and had presently set saile. Let him go (said he) and let us, on our part, do what is commanded us: In saying so, he got to Horseback a little before night, and rid to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barke him at the mouth of the River of <hi>Tensif,</hi> where his Mariners had order to come and expect him. When his Ship was under sayle, he cast his Eyes towards his deare Islands, and sighing at the remembrance of those things he went from, 'tis not (said he softly) by the course which I take, that I shall discover the <hi>Inaccessible</hi> Island. But I have this comfort, I do that which I ought; and if I have not the happinesse to see <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> yet I have the glory of obeying her. After these words, he began to think on the meanes of fighting with <hi>Phelismond,</hi> and mus'd, a long time, on those he should take hold of to know, who <hi>Phelismond</hi> was, and in what Province of the Kingdome of <hi>Denmark</hi> he might meet him. But he resolv'd to free himselfe of those cares on the dexterity of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus,</hi> and not to make himselfe knowne in that Northern Court. After these thoughts, he remembred <hi>Zelmatida;</hi> and calling to him <hi>Alcippus,</hi> what will <hi>Zelmatida</hi> think (said he) of our stay? I feare least he will imagine some treason wrought against us by <hi>Abdelmelec;</hi> and if once he have that opinion, assuredly nothing can hinder his comming to <hi>Morrocco,</hi> to know the certainty himselfe: I have a mind to send some one of my servants to him. <hi>Alcippus</hi> approv'd of the King's apprehension, but the difficulty was to find the means. The next day they had it, for a <hi>Patache</hi> of a <hi>Madera</hi> Merchant, pass'd very neer by <hi>Polexanders</hi> Ship, and she gave her the rights she ought, and being known, they made her come neer. Our <hi>Heroe,</hi> after he had spoken with the <hi>Master,</hi> commanded him to carry one of his followers to the Isle of <hi>Lancerotta;</hi> and presently went to write to <hi>Zelmatida;</hi> and by his letter excusing himselfe in a good manner, that he was compel'd to break his word with him, was now in no other care but to chuse amongst his company a man that he might send to <hi>Zelmatida,</hi> of capacity, to tell him by word of mouth what he could not write to him. <hi>Alcippus</hi> and <hi>Diceus</hi> came first into his mind; but being not able to misse two such imployable &amp; faithful servants, he was compeld to think of others. He had bred up a <hi>Canaryan,</hi> a Prince by birth and great grand-child to the King <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vartemus;</hi> and in all his travells had found him so capable of his service, that he thought he could not find a man more fit. He therefore cald for him, gave him his letters in charge, and instructing him in what he had to say to <hi>Zelmatida,</hi> caus'd him to be imbarqu'd in the Pinnace of <hi>Madera;</hi> and commanded that he should attend on the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince till he returnd. In an instart, the 2.

                  <p>
                     <hi>IF I make you not an excuse for failing in my promise, 'twas because I was engaged by the Command of</hi> Alcidiana. <hi>I know this reason would not be available with many: But I know withall that</hi> Zelmatida, <hi>who very highly enjoys the quality of a brave man and a Lover, will no sooner have looked on it, but will instantly be satisfied. I came happily off my Iourney to Morocco; and then thought onely of returning to you, to re-begin our usuall recreations, when one of</hi> Alcidiana's Esquires, <hi>expressely sent to make all her Adorers run desperate, commanded me to a Iourney for the exterminating a man, who in the midst of the Septentrionall darknesse hath erected Temples to that new</hi> Sun: <hi>Thus I go where the light of that faire Starre conducts me. I would say nothing of the hopes I have in the Successe of my voyage, if I were not assured that it cannot but be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate being guided by</hi> Alcidiana.</p>
                  <p>THe Vice-Roy, who looked on <hi>Polexander,</hi> as the worke of his care, of his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and instructions; and who (according to the weaknesse of old folks, believed himselfe, in some manner, to be the Author of all the Princes fairest actions,) could not read the Letter without the shew of an extraordinary content. He gave it back to <hi>Zelmatida,</hi> and putting on a very serious countenance, <hi>I</hi> must confesse (said he) that there is something (of I know not what in our Prince) that is seldome seen in other men. O! how much are those poore Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> (who without heart and honour shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully languish in the idienesse of their Courts) beholding to that passion, which for these three yeares hath made <hi>Polexander</hi> to wander all the quarters of the Ocean. Certainly, without this obstacle, the King my Master had taught them how to obey, since they are
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54727:106"/>
unworthy to command and had of a thousand little States which tare and vex'd one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, compos'd a Monarchy equall to the Three Ancient. <hi>Zelmatida</hi> answered not to the extollings, and amplification of the good old Man, but only with a little shrug of his Shoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unwilling he should continue such censures as might extend even to himselfe, Father (said he) let's know (I pray) what the King your Master hath done at <hi>Morocco.</hi> Therewith he addressed himselfe to the <hi>Canaryan</hi> Prince, and with a great deale of civility besought him to intimate how <hi>Polexander</hi> came off from the Turney of <hi>Abdelmelec.</hi> The <hi>Canaryan,</hi> who savoured no more of his Ancestors barbarousnesse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with a great deale of Ingenuity, all that had passed at <hi>Morocco;</hi> and to shew that he could do it well, intermingled so neatly the Adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That Old Man, permitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be carried away with the ill custome of those of his age, began to speake, assoone as the <hi>Canaryan</hi> had ended; and making a rigorous and unprofitable inquiry of all which had hapned at <hi>Morocco,</hi> drew-in headlong from thence this pernicious consequence, that Love is the greatest of all follyes whereto Nature can possibly bring men in Subjection. <hi>Zelmatida</hi> Shrugg'd his shoulders again, in hearing himselfe so il dealt with in the person of another; &amp; to silence the Vice-Roy, put himself on the praysing the Valour and good fortune of <hi>Polexander.</hi> That which you know of him, (replyed the Vice-Roy presently) is not to be thought on in comparison of so many other acts of Iudgement and Valour which he hath done since he came into the World. I say, since he came into the world, without wronging those termes which are used in the Ordinary fashion of speaking: For, from the first years of his Infancy, he hath made it appeare that he was not borne but for the astonishment and felicity of his age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zelmatida</hi> taking occasion at that hint which fortune gave him, to hear the Vice-Roy at full without much intreating, besought him often by the Name of Father, to relate all the story of <hi>Polexanders</hi> life. The good old Man, (taken in his weaknesse) had no mind to deny, but presently consented to <hi>Zelmatida's</hi> Petition, and would instantly have begun the History of the King his Master, if the <hi>Indian</hi> Prince had not stopped him at the first word, and said, that so brave a relation was excellent matter for a walke, and the Vice-Roy approv'd of it. <hi>Zelmatida</hi> hereupon came out of his Chamber, after many kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses done to the <hi>Canaryan,</hi> and wishing him to repose himself awhile, came down with the good old man into the great Garden. The Sun already began to decline to the West, and the heat of the day, temper'd by a little wind, seemed by it's freshness to extinguish that heat which the Sun, had spread through all the Horizon. Besides, the <hi>Pines, Palms, Cedars,</hi> and <hi>Orange-trees</hi> composed Allyes, as delightsom to the smell as to the sight. <hi>Zelmatida</hi> went into one of them, so long and close, that, but for the sweet trouble of an infinite number of Songsters which gave not over chanting on the trees, he could not have found out a place more fit for his walke, for to hear the Adventures of <hi>Polexander.</hi> The Vice-Roy, unwilling that such litle Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers should be of capacity to make him hold his peace, at the first signe from <hi>Zelmatida,</hi> began his Narration; and the more to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deare his Auditor, did it with this Preface.</p>

                  <p>IF your Majestie had not all qualities deserving the Author of your race, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sirname of Child of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and the incomparable title of a Deity, I should fearel east that, in relating to you the actions of a Prince which infallibly is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then Man, you might accuse me of falsehood and flattery. But when I consider that I am to speak to a Prince, who by his own wonderful acts is bound to beleeve those of His life; I feare not to relate to you a Life as miraculous as any of those <hi>Heroes,</hi> of whom your Forefathers, and ours have made them their first Gods. Some have bin of opinion that Kings receiv'd from Heaven some advantages which were not granted to other men. I have known divers Kings who have made me doubt of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that beliefe. But having the honor to know you, &amp; withal <hi>Polexander,</hi> as I do, I am forc'd to confesse that, as there are Kings who are alwayes children, there are others too, who are men in their Infancy. Without giving then ought to my affection, &amp; without soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I dare say that my King is of those last, and that he came into the world with those excellent qualities, which age, Study, and experience sell to ordinary men at so deare rates. His Soule, in her descent from Heaven, preserv'd &amp; retayn'd al it had receiv'd in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But it was very fit, and I dare say absolutely necessary, that <hi>Polexander</hi> should be borne with those qualities which are seen but in very few Princes: for it would have bin a peice of prodigie, if there had come ought, that was any way vulgar, from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riander</hi> the wonder of his age, and <hi>Axiamira</hi> the Admiration and glory of her times. The Prince, which (for good cause) I alwayes call incomparable, was borne in this Island, and, with his life, receiv'd the Crown of almost all the <hi>Canaryes:</hi> Not that he had his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction from those barbarous Kings which heretofore raign'd here: His derivation is more glorious; being descended from two of the greatest houses that ever flourished in <hi>Europ.</hi> The one is that of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the other of the Emperors of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> It is but little lesse then three hundred yeares, since the French had, for their King, a Prince, who for the sanctity of his life, hath been thought worthy to be ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But Fortune, who soon repented her of the injustice done to so great a Prince, brought him into these Seas; and in lieu of the most rich Crown of the World which she had taken from him, gave him the fairest and most delightfull. I meane, that after she had long time made him wander on the Ocean, she brought him to cast Anchor and land on this Isle, the very day whereon the Inhabitants were assembled to chuse them a King. He was called to this Little Monarchy by the consent of all, and in lesse then three or four yeares made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so much valued amongst those of the neighbor Islands, that in emulation of one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, they would needs have him for their Commander. After the death of that Prince, his Son <hi>Periander</hi> not only succeeded him, but to extend the bounds of this little Empire, drove the Portugalls out of the Isles they had guarded, and without doubt might have gotten the Crown of <hi>Spaine</hi> it selfe, if the desire of recovering his ancient inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance had not engag'd him in a War with the Turk. In his first voyage into the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> he marryed with a Grecian Princesse call'd <hi>Axiamira,</hi> who by her spirit and virtue made it well appeare, that she came from that Heroick blood which had so often tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd over the Monarches of <hi>Asia.</hi> He returned hither with that Princesse, and within the four or five first yeares of his marriage, had on her <hi>Polexander, Iphidamantus</hi> and <hi>Cydaria.</hi> Assoone as he saw himselfe made happy by so fair a posterity, he thought on the meanes to make their condition equall to that of his Predecessors, and to that end renewing the Treaties wherein the Knights of <hi>Rhodes</hi> and many other Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome would have before time engaged him, he undertook a busines, which as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible as it seem'd, he had infallibly effected, had it not been for the treason or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize of his Allyes. He got him secretly to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and not finding matters there as he had been by some made to hope, would therefore be himselfe his owne Agent. He travell'd alone through all <hi>Greece;</hi> visited all the Princes of the Imperiall house who were banished into the Islands of the Mediterranean, passed thence into <hi>Syria,</hi> to cause the Heyres of the house of <hi>Antioch</hi> to take armes; and lastly, disguiz'd like a Turke, came to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he abode neer six moneths, and dealt with so many Christians, during that time, by the mediation of the Patriark, that he thought himselfe powerfull inough to drive thence the Turke. Thence he returned to <hi>Rhodes</hi> with that good hope, and having wrought his enterprize to it's perfection (at least he thought so) he departed from that Island with an army which should have been invincible. Assoon as he arriv'd, he made himselfe Master of those Castles which shut up the mouth of the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> and by that surprise threw so great a terror into <hi>Constantinople</hi> that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet</hi> was on the point to forsake it. <hi>Periander</hi> entred into the <hi>Propontis</hi> and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Cast down your eyes great King (said she) on these three Innocents and their unfortunate Mother. They are come, on the day of thy triumph, to lay open to thee their calamities, and to implore thy pity. They have heard that, by an acknowledgment worthy thy Piety, thou hast promis'd to heaven thou wilt deny nothing to the first unfortunate and miserable wretch that shall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to thy clemency. See, O King; behold a Subject, on whom thou may'st fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise that Queen of Virtues. These three little Infants do beg of thee to give them their Father; and I the miserable and wretched Mother, beseech thy Majesty to restore to me my Husband. Before I tell you the successe of her Petition, 'twill be fitting that I relate an action, by which <hi>Polexander,</hi> who was then but seaven yeares old, astonished all the <hi>Ottoman Court;</hi> and made the first shew of those wonders which have made him the prime Prince of Christendome. Assoon as the Queen his mother had made him kneel he rose againe, and looking on <hi>Bajazet,</hi> with a boldnesse more then his age promised, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to the highest steps of the Throne, and took hold of the Kingly Scepter. The great Turk took pleasure in his action, and, stroaking <hi>Polexander,</hi> asked him in <hi>Greek</hi> whither he likewise came to intreate any thing of him? The young Prince (that understood the language, because 'twas almost naturall to him) answer'd <hi>Bajazet,</hi> yes; and still kept hold of the Scepter: <hi>I</hi> aske from thee what the Queen my Mother desires; and do not refuse me, for I shall not be ever a Child. <hi>Bajazet</hi> began to laugh at that threatning; and yet thinking on it, as if it came from some other then a Child, he turned him towards the <hi>Mufti</hi> that was on his right hand, and causing him to take notice of <hi>Polexanders</hi> speech to him; This Child (said he) makes me call the <hi>Traytor Scanderbeg</hi> to my remembrance. The glorious <hi>Mahomet,</hi> my Lord and Father, whose Soule raignes now with our Prophet, sometime told me that the Prince of <hi>Albania,</hi> being but a child, spake to him in snch a manner, as he pre-judg'd he would in time be a man of extraordinary ranck and value, and Tis to be feared least This prove a second <hi>Scanderbeg.</hi> But let's know what his Mother demandeth, and in so saying he commanded <hi>Capi-Aga,</hi> who was his Favourite, to take <hi>Polexander,</hi> and set him againe by <hi>Axiamira.</hi> The little Prince would not descend but by force, and shaking his head, set his hands on the <hi>Aga's</hi> Cimyter. The <hi>Aga</hi> only laughed at it, and, taking him from neer the Turk commanded the Queen his Mother to keep him with her. In the meane time <hi>Bajazet</hi> looked on <hi>Axiamira</hi> with a kind of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and at last, addressing him to the Princesse; Thy Petition is just (said he to her) and our word is inviolable.

Assoone as this sentence was pronounced, <hi>Axiamira</hi> was taken with her Children, by some of the <hi>Sultan's</hi> Guard conducted back to her ship, and a little while after, foure <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Those Hang-men questionlesse had order to take away <hi>Polexander,</hi> but (mistaking) instead of him they seized on <hi>Iphidamantus,</hi> for all the cryes and Teares of his Mother, and gave command, in the name of the great Tutk; to those whom the <hi>Basha</hi> of the Sea had put into <hi>Axiamiras</hi> ship, not to leave her till she were sayld far into the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean.</hi> They dis-embarqu'd her on the Island <hi>Tenedos,</hi> with <hi>Polexander</hi> and <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daria;</hi> and after they had treated her with all unworthy usage, return'd toward <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. Axiamira,</hi> that had no other object, then the Coffin wherein she her selfe had enclos'd the body of <hi>Periander,</hi> nor other thought then that of his death, and the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of <hi>Iphidamantus,</hi> spent the dayes and nights in continuall teares and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Polexander,</hi> made shew of griefe enough, but it was a generous sorrow, and a griefe accompanied with threatnings. Comfort your selfe said he to his Mother; If <hi>I</hi> live, the Kings death shall be reveng'd, and the Tyrants offending you shall not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished. Notwithstanding, the desolate <hi>Axiamira</hi> return'd hither, and having promised to my selfe, but a mournfull successe of her Journey; I was not surpriz'd to fee her come on shore with the body of my dead Master. She swoonded assoone as she saw me, and in that case was caried to the Palace. Assoon as she came to her selfe, she ask'd where they had done the body of the King her Husband, and could not be in quiet till they had brought it into her Chamber. When she was a little recovered and setled; I earnestly besought her to be as well a good Mother as a good Wife, to divide her love between her Children and her Husbaud; and not to forsake those that stood in need of her to follow one who was no more in case to desire the proofes of her affections. Speak not to me (said she) of any thing in the world, but of perpetually bewayling the irreparable losses which I have undergone. I know what I owe to <hi>Polexander</hi> and <hi>Cydaria:</hi> For the last, I will have all the care which the weaknesse of her age, and the memory of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> can exact from me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And for <hi>Polexander,</hi> I put him into your hands. The King his Father had chosen you to make him worthy that high fortune to which he is destinated. Let it appeare by your care and instructions, that the love you bare to so good a Master is not dead with bim. Above all, I give you in charge that <hi>Polexander</hi> never heare any thing of the Empire of his Ancestors, and that you never make known to him those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate designes which have shortned the dayes of <hi>Periander.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> had many things to answer to <hi>Axiamira's</hi> Propositions, but she stopt me, and said, that unlesse <hi>I</hi> meant to make her run desperate, <hi>I</hi> should speak to her of nothing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever but of the Kings death. When <hi>I</hi> knew her resolution <hi>I</hi> left her; and dedicating my selfe to the good of the charge of <hi>Polexander, I</hi> apply'd my dayes and nights to so honourable an imployment. When his Court was ordered, <hi>I</hi> causd an Assembly to be made, wherein the Deputies of all the Islands acknowledg'd him for their Prince, And between his hands swore to him their oath of fidelity. After that, <hi>I</hi> distributed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Isles among the ancient Servants of <hi>Periander,</hi> and intreating them to continue to the Son the affection they bare to the Father, dismis'd them with all that was necessary to hinder all revolts and surprizes. In the meane time <hi>I</hi> confin'd my selfe to the Palace with my young Master; and after <hi>I</hi> had gotten from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> men of most eminency for the instruction of a Prince, began carefully and diligently to improve so rare a plant.</p>
                  <p>But I must confess that Prince (as <hi>I</hi> have already said) had almost neither need of teaching or Study. And I beleeve that Nature reveald to him all that the most able of men acquir'd not, but in growing old on their books, and in imployments. If his wit were admirable, his body was not much lesse. At the age of ten yeares he was so strong and active, that were it at the race, were it at wrastling, or any other exercises he was not out-gone by any of his owne age, or of others of some more yeares. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of his twelfth yeare the Kings of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but especially that of <hi>Portugall,</hi> made many attempts to drive him from the <hi>Canaries.</hi> By the intelligence of some

Merchants of <hi>Madera,</hi> his men surpriz'd the Isle of <hi>Palmes,</hi> and fortified themselves there so strongly, that it was impossible for the Governour to make them quit it; After I heard of these proceedings, and withall, seeing that it was of too dangerous a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to suffer those Spaniards so neer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The beginning of the Warre succeeded marvellous well with us; for in two moneths, we burnt five and twenty of the Enemies ships, took nine, won two Forts, and put eight hundred Portugalls in chaines.

Come, come, let's fight, it behoves us, &amp; keep, here either by a faire death or a faire victory. In this [said]] may it please your Majesty, you are not to be hearkned to, for I am answerable, for your life, to the Queen your Mother, and to all your Subjects, and if any ilaccident should betide, 'twould be imputed either to my treachery or insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency.

And what say you, if bodies were not maintained in their being by the operation of their Soules, would they not become meere lumps of Earth and dirt? Do you think tis otherwise with our Subjects? truly no. They must, without doubt, perish when their Kings, like soules sick of a Lethargy, unworthily lye sleeping in their palaces, and suffer those mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to perish through their idlenesse, whom they should preserve by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. Lets on then, lets on my deare governour, where our dutie calls us. Sir (said I) your Majesty is neither of age to doe what you would, nor your people reduced to the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of axecting it from you. Kings ought to be alwaies of yeares to defend their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (replied the Prince) and their condition is such, that neither age nor danger ought to hinder them from preserving their Estates. You have so often taught me these truthes, that I wonder you will read to me now a new Doctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>i I have never told your Majesty any thing (I answered) which in my conscience, I believed not only to be true, but also worthy of your royall Soul: and this being so, <hi>I</hi> intended not to ruin, by a false dictrine, that which I had established by a true one. All that I desire now is, that your Majesty would turne your thoughts on your selfe, and thence carry them through all the histories you have read, to the end you your selfe may be Judg of the difference which is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us.</p>
                  <p>The Prince presently apprehending, by the quicknesse of his wit, what I would say to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54727:109"/>
him; answered me, that he would not have our controversie to be decided by the examples of former ages. Other Princes have done what they pleas'd, and I pretend to have the same priviledg, and by consequence will goe on, without any consideration, right to the place where our Enemies are. What after this, will you oppose me? Ah Sir, (cried I throwing my selfe at his feet, and moystning his hands with my teares,) weigh what your great heart would make you undertake; and thinke with your selfe what a disaster it will be, if some dismall blow should take you hence, in the extremity of your youth.</p>
                  <p>My deare Governour (replied the Prince coldly,) this consideration proceedes not from a true affection, but it comes from an ill custome, which those, that are neare to Kings have gotten, to flatter them in all things. 'Tis true that I may dye by this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dying lose a great many yeares, which by all likelyhood I have to live: but I know from your selfe, that none ever dyed before the time Heaven had prescribed him; besides <hi>I</hi> am perswaded, that a King never dies too soon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, when he dies for the safety of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>Whilst the King my Master, and I, thus contested, the <hi>Portingal</hi> and our men made on, and meeting some two leagues from our Quarters, fought with a great losse on both sides. The <hi>Canaryans</hi> made the <hi>Portingalls</hi> give back, and drave them before them into a vally, where, for want of mistrust, they fel into an Ambascado. There were they ill handled, and after they had lost more then their halfe on the place, saw 'twas then their turn to fly. The <hi>Portingalls</hi> being all reunited came furiously on the <hi>Canaryans;</hi> and their Cavalry making a horrible massacre of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>nawaies, drave the rest even to our intrenchments. <hi>Polexander</hi> saw the flight of his Souldiers, and was very likely to have thrown himselfe down, from the top of a bastion, to go stay them. Ah my Governor (cried he) I beseech you do not indure I should lose my Honour, and see, my men slaine unsuccored. I renewed my remonstrances, but to no purpose: Of necessity we must (and did) bring him his Armes, and consent that he should fall on the Enemy. In the meane time I caus d all the remainder of our Souldiers that were in the Towne, to sally forth, who in spight of the Enemies, forced them to retire. Our young King, with fifty of his Knights, fell on the reere of the <hi>Portingalls,</hi> and thrust himselfe so farre in amongst them, that I was a long time without knowing what was become of him. His presence and actions gave so much heart even to those that had lost it, that the <hi>Portingalls</hi> were hack'd in peices, and from the Town even to the Sea Side, the high waies were covered with them.</p>
                  <p>The King should have returned from this conflict with an extream satisfaction, for he had done admirably well; and besides, he heard on all hands, applauding? some of joy, and some of praise. Neverthelesse a secret sadnesse made him droope the head, and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to heare the acclamations of the people. As I was about to aske him the cause: My Governour (said he) let me once make triall of what you have often told me; and whereof Sir (said I?) That the multitude is never govern'd by reason. Wee have done nothing but run after a company of people, that had as great a desire to fly from us, as wee had to overtake them, and yet to heare the shouts of the Uulgar sort, one would thinke we had gotten some important battle against all the force of Spaine. I smil'd at the Princes consideration: When presently, putting on a more serious countenance, besides (said he) I shal never be sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that King is a very merry man, and very Gamesome, who, whilst himselfe lies as it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were buried in all pleasures and delights, troubles the repose and peace of his neighbours, by such of his subjects as ('tis not unlikely) he would faine be rid of. If I live, I will teach him to live quietly, or to come and fight himselfe. But til that happinesse betide me I am resolv'd to drive the <hi>Portingalls</hi> from these Islands; and to accompl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>sh it with the more facility, I will over into the Isle of <hi>Palmes</hi> with the rest of my Troops.</p>
                  <p>When he had told me his intentions I was more puzled a great deale then I was before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I knew well that my Authority and power were not able to hould in that yong Lion; I had therefore recourse to stronger. I writ to the Queen his mother, who persisted in her teares and solitude, and most humbly besought her, If she loved the life of the King her sonne, she would call him back to her. <hi>I</hi> intimated all the reasons which obliged me to write so, and made them so considerable and weighty to her, that for a quarter of an
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54727:110"/>
houre, She violated the vow she had made of thinking no more on worldly businesse. She thereupon, writ to the King her son; that she desired to see him for some urging occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and conjur'd him by her letter, that leaving, for some time, the businesse of Warre, he should make a turne to the place of her retirement: she writ the same to me, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to bring back to her the King her sonne.</p>
                  <p>The Prince, who was endu'd with all virtues in the highest degree, put it not in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration whether he should obey the Queen, but told me that wee were to retire to his Mother: the Honour wee acquire by Armes is worthyly to be desired, but <hi>I</hi> beleeve that to be no lesse which is gotten by doing what we ought. 'Tis true, (said <hi>I)</hi> and therefore you ought (if you please) to give [without delay] the Queen your Mother the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment she expects by your presence. Come (said he) let's give it her, but before we goe hence, try if we can see our Enemies. He needed not goe farre to be satisfied: for the day before our imbarquing, the <hi>Portingalls</hi> return'd on us, and fail'd little of surp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There was a furious conflict, wherein, (without adding any thing to the truth) <hi>Polexander</hi> secur'd the Honour of his Armes, and dis-ingaged, both his men &amp; shipping. The Enemies Fleet retir'd to the Isle of <hi>Palmes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> I thought it had been out of feare, but the next morning I knew 'Twas out of cunning. The Kings departure was not so secretly kept, but that the news of it came to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, whereupon they resolved to fight with him at Sea, and by taking of the King to make an end of those warres wherewithall he threatned al <hi>Spaine.</hi> For mine one part, [who dayly took care for the conducting the Prince] I left al our vessels in the roade of <hi>Tenerif</hi> which was opposite to that of the <hi>Palmes;</hi> and one night crossing one of the Islands, caus'd the King to imbarpue himselfe at a port over, against that of <hi>Gomera.</hi> At daie breake wee set saile, and in a little time our vessel had gone by all the <hi>Canaries,</hi> but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into a sleeve or narrow passage, which seperated this Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ve saile, which surely expected us. They made up; and the feare I was in, for the King my Master, redoubling my foresight, I commanded Presently our ship should take another course, and to regaine on the South, the <hi>Fortunate</hi> Island. These five shipps chas'd us all the rest of the day, and my Pilot was constrained to goe Roome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Sea, that they might not know the course he steer'd. Two vessels of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which followed ours, were commanded to bestow some shot to amaze the Enemy. <hi>Polexander</hi> was almost enraged that I would not fight with them. He besought me to feare nothing, and casting himselfe at my feet, my deare Governour (said he) if you love my life, give not the advantage to our Enemies to publish, they have made us fly from them. What will they say of thee, unfortunate <hi>Polexander</hi> (he added in sighing) when it shall be known that five poore ships have enforc'd thee to fly as a theefe, and forsake a Part of thine owne Company to save thy selfe by their destruction! Ah! let me rather dye a thousand deaths! And in so saying, like one desperate, he ran through the ship to oblige the Pilot and Mariners to tack about. But the Command I had given, could not be chang'd but by me, and the Prince prevail'd not in giving any new. He took notice of it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently drawing one of his Guards Swords, and turning it on himselfe, however, (said he) yet will I not have the dishonour to live after the flight, and diobedience of mine one Subjects. I stop'd him ere he could wrong himselfe, and casting by all obsequiousnesse, told him that If he would not be govern'd, I should be constrain'd to make use of that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the Queen his Mother had given me. Doe so my good Governour (said he) do what you will with me, <hi>I</hi> will indure all, provided that I run not away. This while Night drew on, and with the Night a winde so contrary, that I repented me for not lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the <hi>Fortunate</hi> Island. We were forc'd to strike all our Sayles, for feare of being put back to the place from whence we came. Which when the young Prince perceived, he shew'd an extreame joy for it, and told me that Heaven, more exorable then I, had heard his prayers, and would not permit that I should cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We knew thempresently to be Enemies by their flaggs. They made up, shot, and press'd on us, so that in spight of us we must fight. I wish I were able to represent to you the cheerfullnesse, wherewith the young Prince prepar'd him to the combat, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54727:110"/>
wherewithall he ordered others. My companions, said he to the Souldiers, see how the Justice of Heaven favours us, in exposing to your revenge those which have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd your families to all that their tyranny had, the most barbarous. Do not beleeve that these cruell Pyrates give us the chase; They would be glad to be further from you; But, the windes and the waves, which they would have so often made confederates in their robberies, bring them to you, whether they wil or no, to the end they might purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by such a delivery, of those crimes whereof you might accuse them. Consider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that you are not, as these theeves, two or three hundred leagues apart from him for whom in particular you are to fight. You have your King not only for a witnesse of your actions, but also for a companion in your fortune.

Neverthelesse, we were forc'd to forsake our sides, and (to resist a little longer) fortifie our selves on the poope. One amongst us (in the meane time) resolving a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious and determinate act, charged a Culverin on his shoulders, and placing himselfe on the highest part of the poope, caus'd fire to be given to it. The blow was strange; It kill'd above twenty Portugalls, and the bullet striking through one of their ships, without notice taken of it, either by Souldier or Mariner, they were amaz'd in the height of the fight, to see that ship sink right down with all that was in her. The Portugalls were so infinitely terrified and astonish'd by that accident, that they utterly lost that eagernesse with which they strove to make themselves Masters of our Vessell. In this Intervall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain'd what we had lost, &amp; knock'd our Enemies in again to the ship that was left them. <hi>Polexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> no way appear'd daunted in so great a danger, but alwayes avoyding me, was alwayes amongst his men, and still promis'd them the victory. Notwithstanding, their number was so diminished, that we had left us, both of Mariners and Souldiers, but fifty. The Portugalls, awakned from their amazement, took notice of our weaknesse, and about a hundred or sixscore of them flew into our Vessell. All the Mariners, as well as Souldiers, thought now on nothing but how to defend themselves.</p>
                  <p>The fight began afresh, and not a man of ours was slaine which had not before kill'd, (at least) one of his Enemies. Though <hi>Polexander</hi> was [as you may imagine) extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wearied with so long a toyle, yet resisted he couragiously that fatigation; and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the greatnesse of his heart, ran to assist his people. As I followed him, and had my Eyes only on him, he saw me fall at his feet by two thrusts of pikes which I received at once. Ah, my Governor is dead (cri'd he!) and in the same instant, preventing a Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, who without doubt came on to dispatch me, thrust his sword through the others bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. He fell dead fast by me, but in falling, with a Mallet at Armes, gave such a blow on the Princes head, that he fell with him. Though I was sore wounded, yet I arose, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King my Master in so ill case, I carried him, all in a trance, into his Cabin, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armd his head, to see whether he had yet any life in him. Presently he came to himselfe, and streight ask'd me what was become of his Enemies. Alas (said I) what ere is become of them, they have their wish, and gotten enough by cutting off a Life that was to be so fatall to them. I spake it wholly transported with griefe, seeing all the Princes haire knotted with blood, so that I beleeved he had received so dangerous a blow, that it was impossible to save him, and so gave him for dead. I laid him along on me, and carefully search'd his head: wherewith, he clapt his hand on it, and seeing at the drawing it back 'twas all bloody; I perceive now (my good Governor) you feare I am much hurt, but let it not trouble you, for I feele no paine. After <hi>I</hi> had well search'd, <hi>I</hi> saw that he had no wound on his head, but that the Axe, wherewith he was struck down, sliding along his Helmet, entred into his shoulder, and from the wound it made there, came that blood, which, after he was fall'n, ran into his hayre. I streight disarm'd him, and finding the place where he was wounded, I thought the hurt not mortall, and so went about to stench the blood, which being done, I told that <hi>Heroe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> it was fit he should rest a while

as he was, whilst I went to see in what estate our businesse stood, and would send some of his Servants to attend him. The generous Prince would have risen, but fainting with Weaknesse, he grew pale: and striving, for feare I should perceive how ill he was, since (said he) you think it fitting; I will stay here. <hi>I</hi> went presently out of the Cabin, and wondring to heare no more noyse, got quickly up to know the cause of their silence, Truly 'twas terribly fearefull, and tis possible you never yet heard speak of the like ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. Our Vessell seem'd to me a bloody Scaffold, on which had been executed a great number of unfortunate and miserable wretches. Of above a hundred and fifty <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naryans</hi> and <hi>Portugalls,</hi> which I had left fighting, I found not one standing. Some were dead, others, wounded with mortall blowes, with sighes and groanes were giving a period to their lamentable Destiny. The <hi>Portugall</hi> Ship too, which was grapled with ours at the beginning of the fight, had either been forced off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After <hi>I</hi> had been a while, as it were, out of my self by so dismall a spectacle, <hi>I</hi> re-collected my wits, and perceiving, by this generall defeate, that the King my Master was in some safety, I gave thankes to heaven, and besought it with all my heart, that it would perfect what was begun, for the good of <hi>Polexander.</hi>

His Name was <hi>Diceus,</hi> and (for his age) he was an excellent Chirurgion. The need I had of him obliged me to see in what plight he was, and whither his wounds were deadly: I drew him from under many bodies that were faln on him, and laying him in a place commodius enough caled him so often &amp; so much tows'd him that he opened his Eyes a little. I imagined there might be found some Essences about him, and therefore, rigging in his pockets and finding what I search'd for, made him take the half of a little glasse bottle. Presently he retook heart, and his affection rendring him the memory of his Master, he asked (without knowing me) what was become of the Prince. He lives (said I) thankes be to heaven; but <hi>Diceus</hi> (said <hi>I)</hi> he is in such a case, that he needs thy assistance. See what a true affection can do! Scarce had <hi>Diceus</hi> heard <hi>Polexander</hi> was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and yet wounded, but he arose; and knowing me, my Lord (said he) bring me spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to the King. Prithee, (replied I) do thou take the paynes to help me to him, for I cannot keep my selfe on foot; and feeling a faintnesse, <hi>Diceus</hi> (said I) the King is in his Cabin, Go quickly and help him: So that thou savest his life, tis no great matter what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the rest. With that I fell, and lost all perceivance and understanding. <hi>Diceus,</hi> fore-seeing that my swoonding would be long, left me, after he had commodiously seen me laid, and went to the King; whom he found in a heavy slumber, whereof he had no good opinion, and therefore awakened him, and telling who he was; Sir (said he) all your Enemies are dead. It is fit your Majesty should now relish the sweets of so brave a Victory. Whilst he spake thus, he perceived his wound, and having gently searched it was assured, that not a Ueyne was cut, nor Nerve wronged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by divers actions intimated his exceeding gladnesse for it, and besought the King not to feare any ill successe of his hurt. I have none, [replied the King] all that troubles me is, that I finde a certaine weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that duls me. Hereupon <hi>Diceus</hi> got him to take five or six drops of a Cordiall Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which so strengthned him, that after he had closed and bound up his wound, he arose as cherefulll as if he had not been hurt. But as he was about to aske for me, he tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that <hi>Diceus</hi> was all bloody: Alas! poore <hi>Diceus</hi> [cried he] thou art sore hurt.

The Third day a tall man of Warre assail'd us, and by consequence took us. <unclear>Those</unclear> that were abord her, were more astonished at their prize, then we were, of their setting on us. They knew not what to thinke of so horrible a Massaker, but they wondered more when they saw appear, a youth of about thirteen years who with a marvelous confidence demanded who they were, and whither they came, as Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies or friends. The Captaine of the straingers could not reply to the Kings question for he understood him not. Addressing himselfe therefore unto me (who was crept after <hi>Polexander,</hi> rather then I would forsak him) Father (said he) if by chance you understand my language I intreat you to tell me by what mischance you are falen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the estate I finde you. By his speech I knew him to be a Frenchman, and concealing from him the Name and birth of the King my Master, related the accident which had lately betided us, and withall presented to him the King as for my Son; and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both our wounds, besought him to conduct us to the <hi>Canaries.</hi> the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> (who as <hi>I</hi> understood that same daye) was a Gentleman of <hi>Britany,</hi> hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving what I had spoken touching the valour of my supposed sonne, took him into his Armes, a thousand times kis'd him, and highly praised that wonder of valour and spake of it as of a most certaine presage, that he should be one day a great war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior. <hi>I</hi> besought him againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to bring us to our Islands; and though as it seemed he had another designe, yet for the love of <hi>Polexander</hi> he promis'd me to make that voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, but fortune had otherwaies dispos'd of him.

That Princesse who was not much elder then He, and who, for her age, was the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and accomplish'd personage I ever saw, gave her selfe not respit to hear or consider me.

But som filly braines began to prattle 'that I was a <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> and how, by my inchantments I made things appeare that were not; or to make them reall, <hi>I</hi> used the Power of the Devill. During these <hi>Iusts, Diceus</hi> (whom we had secretly sent to the <hi>Canaries)</hi> return'd, with the best newes we could Wish. He told us, that the Queen was alive, and how, by the succour she had procured from <hi>Spimantus</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the incomparable Valour of one <hi>Alcippus</hi> a <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryan</hi> Knight, the <hi>Portugalls</hi> had been beaten at Sea and in the Ilands, and constrain'd to abandon the Forts of <hi>Palmes, Gomera,</hi> and <hi>Teneriffe.</hi> That all men passionately wished for the Kings returne, and to make it the more safe and glorious, <hi>Alcippus</hi> was comming with a Fleet of above a hundred sayles of ships. Within a few dayes after Posts came to the French King, advertising him that a powerfull naval Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was seen on the coastes of <hi>Britany.</hi> Those Messengers were seconded by others which confirmed it for truth, and by their newes put the Court into such an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, that they were ready to part from <hi>Lyons,</hi> and run hastily to the succour of <hi>Britanny.</hi> But the Arrivall of <hi>Alcippus</hi> taking away all cause of feare, made the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it to cease to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

give limits to his Joy, made it break<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forth before all his Courtiers, He oftentimes em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd <hi>Polexander,</hi> and made him many excuses for not entertaining him as a Prince of his condition: And thereupon re-embracing him, and calling him his deare Cosen and his deare Brother, brought him to the Queen. <hi>Alcippus</hi> was yet in the Privy-Chamber when both the Kings came in: Instantly he knew his owne: and un-accustomed to the respects and circumspections which are to be observed before the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> went and cast himselfe at <hi>Polexander's</hi> feet. In the first interveiw he gave him so many proofes of his Zeale and fidelity, that the Prince, by virtue of his inclination as well as by his sensibility of the great Services he had received from him, lov'd him at first sight, and ever since hath so particularly honor'd him with his favour, that he hath conceal'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from him. That very day he put off the Personage which he had acted for three yeares; and although he was obliged to take on him with the Name of a Soveraigne, all that stately preparation and decking, by which Kings imprint a reverence and terrour in the hearts of their people, yet did he carry himselfe amongst those which were not of his condition, as courteously &amp; familiarly as he had done, when he went for a private man. I pressed him continually to take his leave of the French King and, Queene: but He, who had other thoughts, put off his departure from day to day, and seeing himselfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by my solicitations, My dear Governor (said he) I know my duty to the Queen my Mother, and I understand whereto the quality of a King obligeth me. I will give full satisfaction to these two duties: but I will first repay the obligations I owe to <hi>France.</hi> I see the King my Brother on the point of a great Enterprize: He intends shortly to fall on <hi>Italy</hi> and force from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which they have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp'd from my Predecessors: Judge you whither I should leave him in such an occasion. No, I will passe the <hi>Alpes</hi> with him, and will, at least, have the comfort of seeing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers of those great Kings from whom <hi>I</hi> have my being. The very same day, He, (who had no other designe then to give contentment to his generous humour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the favours he had received from <hi>France)</hi> offred himselfe to King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> and intreated him to make use of his Navall Army. Those who ruled the King; after long consideration on <hi>Polexanders</hi> offers, imagined they were but artificiall and cunning, and that, infallibly, he was advised to go to the conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi> to make his owne use of that occasion. If this Young Prince (said an Officer) see that things go fair for him, he will set the pretensions of his house on Foot, and, in declaring himselfe the next heyre to <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou,</hi> may possibly turn to his side the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> affections, That indeed his age, virtue, and want of strength might take away these suspitions; but the reasons of State advise to live alwayes in distrust, and the ill was rather to be beleeved then the good. This ground laid: they thought it surest to give most civill thankes to the young Prince, and to send him home to his owne <hi>Islands</hi> the most honourably they could. The advice was followed, and the French King imployed all the fairest words were dictated to him to re-mercy <hi>Polexander:</hi> and being the Sonne of a Father, who had never taught him any other thing then this: that, <hi>He knew not how to raigne, that knew not how to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,</hi> he so well practised his Fathers Doctrine, that <hi>Polexander</hi> no way doubted of his cunning and dissimulation. When he saw himselfe absolutely dis-engaged, he told me, that being acquitted from what he thought due from him to the French King, he was resolved to follow my advice, and to render to the Queen his Mother, and to his Subjects, that which they expected from him. But (said he) we must handsomely bid farewell to <hi>France,</hi> and since it hath given us so many Examples of Gallantry, tis fitting we should let them see that we are able to imitate them. He resolved therefore to entertain all the Court the Eve of his departure, and to joyne to his great feast, a Ball after the <hi>French</hi> manner, and a Maske after the fashion of his owne country. I should be too troublesome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should I tell you the particulars of that magnificence, for it would take a whole day to make you a description of the Halls where the Ball was kept, the feast made, and the Maske danced. Never were more Engines and inventions seen in one place: <hi>Art</hi> there surmounted <hi>Nature,</hi> and the day was imitated by the infinite Number of Lights which were not seen. But the most admired, was a Maske of twelve naturall <hi>Canaryans,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Polexander</hi> was the Leader, all clad and dancing after the manner of their own Country. When these sports were ended <hi>Polexander</hi> accompanied the King and Queen
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54727:113"/>
to their lodging, and took this leave of them both with so much spirit and grace, that he appear'd no lesse in that <hi>Adieu,</hi> then in his great entertainment. The Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who had particularly consider'd him as one of the greatest lights of his house, staid to lye with him, to have the more time to give him the Farewell. The other Princes visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, with great demonstration of Esteeme, and amity. Even the Princesses and Ladyes suspended their custome, to give him the departing complements. But among all those beauties, who had not, or at least made no shew to have any other then a simple well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wishing to so brave a Prince, there was one either more sensible or lesse discreet then the rest. She was both of great birth and beauty, and of little more age then <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> During the Prince's aboad at <hi>Lions,</hi> she had divers times written to him without making her selfe knowne: but receiving no answer, she thought she must hazard some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then a few letters without subscription and signature. She therefore advis'd to employ a confident in this Amorous negotiation; and to make her selfe known by that mediation. <hi>Polexander</hi> hearkned to that Embassadresse, and understanding all that she had in charge, so generously treated her that she return'd much contented, though he had not ingag'd himselfe. She first deceiv'd her selfe, that she might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deceive her who set her on work; and so firmely beleev'd the King would yeeld to her prosecution, that she made no difficulty to assure her Mistrisse, she should have an entire satisfaction: But that assurance was found false by the suddaine departure of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</hi> Assoone as he had rendred all the complements he had receiv'd, he took Post, and came to lye at a Town where usually they embarque that descend by the River of <hi>Loire.</hi> He found his lodging as richly furnish'd as that at <hi>Lions;</hi> and was there serv'd by the French Kings Officers, with a profusion that well witnessed the wealth of that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. The next day, as he was ready to put him on the River, he was staid by the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and many other young Lords, who were come poste, to give him that last te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of their affection. He receiv'd them with such courtesies as wholy won them, and so quaintly made use of that grace which he principally had in giving, that even the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> could not refuse a box of Rubies which he intreated him to accept as a token of his friendship. As soon as this brave Troop was seperated, <hi>Polexander</hi> thank'd, even to the meanest, all King <hi>Charles</hi> his Officers; and bestowing on them gifts proportionable to his quality and not to theirs, put himselfe into a great Boat, of purpose provided for him to descend into <hi>Britany.</hi> The Boat was fairely painted and guilt; there was in it a Hall, a Chamber, and a Cabinet, whose hangings, and other furniture was of <hi>China Sattin</hi> with great braydes of Gold and Silver. Most of the Boat-men were clad in the same Sattin, inrich'd with Silver lace, and rowed with Oares painted with the colours of their Liveries. At the first stroak, they began a Song, which they had accorded among themselves, and though 'twas none of the most charming, yet it pleas'd my Master the King, since it was a testimony of the affection which the French bare him; They row'd till towards two or three houres of night, with all the pleasure so pleasant a way of travelling could be accompanyed; and if <hi>Polexander</hi> could have had his will he had made no stop. But order being given, all along from <hi>Lions,</hi> for his <hi>Geasts,</hi> two Stewards of the French Kings, who attended him, got him be pleas'd to land where his lodging was provided. It was on the side of the River; and though 'twas but an Inne, they had so orderly disposed it, that it might have pass'd for a very faire Castle. The King presently after his arrivall, set him at Table, and ravish'd with the sweetnesse of the ayre and calmenesse of the night, shew'd he had a great desire to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eimbarque after Supper. He had but begun to eat, when a most curious, cleere, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame sweet voyce, comming from the river, strook his Eares, and so pleasingly touch'd them, that he arose from Table and ran to the Chamber window to lose nothing of so excellent a Musick. The person that sung was set on the banck of <hi>Loire,</hi> and intimated to be jealous of the Nymphes of the River, accusing them for ravishing a treasure which the Singers incomparable love was only worthy to possesse. <hi>Polexander</hi> stood as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted with so delicate a voyce, and when she had made an end of her ravishing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; he turn'd towards them that were behind him, and ask'd, if there were no meanes to heare it againe: your Majesty needs but shew that you desire it, said one of the French-men. He; whom you please to honour with your commands, will not faile
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54727:114"/>
to bring that Musitian to you. Tis not fit (replyed <hi>Polexander)</hi> for me to abuse the French courtesie; this Musitian would be alone, and we must leave him at his liberty; and not oblige him to a troublesome complying; Yet presently, a Frenchman by a slight, usual to that Nation, went to the Musitian, and telling, into what admiration the Song had brought the King and his desire to see him, besought, that he would not deny that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to so great a Prince. The Musitian, receiving very civilly the French man's proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; My voyce (said he) payes me with too much use for the little care. I have taken in improving it. I expected from it no other recompence, but its assisting me in bewayling my misfortunes, and behold it hath acquir'd me the favour of a King, which I may terme the prime in all the world, if I were not borne French. I will go wheresoever you please to lead me; But if the Prince, who sent for me, so much love Musick, try to bring him hither. There is an <hi>Eccho</hi> in the Island which lyes before us, which is more worth then a whol consort. The French man getting the Musitian to promise that he would stay still there, return'd to <hi>Polexander,</hi> and relating what he had done, assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, the Musitian expected only his command to come to him. 'Tis better to go to him and follow his conncell, replyed the King. Presently he arose from table, and went with <hi>Alcippus</hi> the French-man and my selfe, where he was to find that excellent voyce. The night being very cleere by reason of the Moon, being almost at full, the Musitian perceiv'd him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a farr off; and comming to meet him, did (as all Musitians do, whether good or bad) excuse himselfe for his ill singing, through fault of a rheume, which he could not be rid of. The Prince gave him many faire words, for feare he should beleeve he came expresly to make him sing, and asked him whence he was, and whither he was going. My fortunes (said he) are not worthy to be known by your Majesty. Yet you will do me a favour to tel them me reply'd the King; and if I do not deceive my selfe, it will not be a small contentment to me. You are too generous (answer'd the Musitian) to take any pleasure in a thing that is so worthy of compassion. Be pleas'd Sir, rather to put by that curiosity, for it can bring you nought but trouble, and but serve to add to my afflictions. I am not come (reply'd <hi>Polexander,</hi> to molest you, yet (at least) you may tell me what your designe is. 'Tis in that (said the Musitian) I shall be most pestred. I confesse I have one, but to tell you what a one 'tis, is a thing to me impossible, for I change my resolution every moment; and without adding any thing to the truth, I sweare to your Majesty, that even now since I had the honour to be neere you: <hi>I</hi> think I have had above twenty, and all different. These riddles (reply'd <hi>Polexand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>r)</hi> need an explication: but since you would not speak so obscurely, but that 'tis your desire; not to be understood, I will not oblige you to an unfolding. Only tell me what way you meane to take. The very worst I can [answerd the Musitian] at least, the feare that beares me company wisheth me to it. But to testifie to your Majestie, how farr my intention is to please you, I will reveale what I never spake to any: I am going to see whether I shall be happier in <hi>Britany,</hi> then I was at <hi>Lions;</hi> and in uttering these last words, the Musitian sigh'd, and sigh'd so amourously, that it touch'd the King my Master even to the heart, yet withall, it overjoy'd, him to have the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of not leaving the young man. He therefore promis'd to bring him into <hi>Britany,</hi> and to imploy all his credit, to give him the contentment he went to look for in those partes. I have often heard (said the Musitian) that 'tis for the greatnesse of Kings to promise all, &amp; for their wisdoms to performe only what is most advantageous to them and I extreamely feare, least in that nature you assure me of your protection. But what said I? pardon me (great Prince) an impudence deserving punishment, did it proceed from a sound braine. Truly, of late I have not been Master of mine owne witts, and my reason is so darkned with an extraordinary passion, that I see but at halfes.</p>
                  <p>The King had too quick an apprehension not to comprehend the mysteryes of those words. He imagined the Musitian to be some man of indifferent condition, faln in love with a Person of very high quality; and by consequence beleev'd, his designe would have good successe. This imagination made him promise the Musitian againe, to assist him with all his credit; and by his offers won him to imbarque with them. The Musitian, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to pay the Kings affection with some ayre that might please him, lead him to the place where he had sung, and repeated a Song, whose notes were so fitted to the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54727:114"/>
words, that they distinctly mark'd in it both joy and sadnesse, hope and feare. That done, <hi>Polexander</hi> return'd to his lodging and took the Musitian with him. He look'd on <unclear>him</unclear> by torchlight, and seeing <unclear>him</unclear> so young, so faire and well made; I confess [said he to the Frenchman that followed him] <hi>France</hi> produceth things extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily rare. The musitian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to see how earnestly <hi>Polexander</hi> ey'd him, drew back to a corner of the Chamber where there was not so much light; and taking a Lute from a Page that was by him, (plaid on it all the Evening, rather to hide himselfe some way from the curiosity of those who had <unclear>their</unclear> Eyes fix'd on him, then to have the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his hand or cleanlinesse of his touch to be admired. A part of the night being thus plesantly overpast, the rest they gave to their repose.</p>
                  <p>The Musitian retyr'd with his Servants, and the next day came to the arising of the King my Master. He behaved himselfe so respectfully towards the Prince, and shewed such a feare as often as he was engaged to answer him, that the King knew not which to praise in him most; whither his extream beauty, or infinite discretion. After divers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he intreated him along, and so took boat, Assoone as he was in, he called for the Musitian, and bringing him into his Cabin; if you love me, said he, you wil tell me who you are, and what 'tis that troubles you. And to witnesse I have not this curiosity but to assist you, I renew the promises I made you Yesterday at Even: and if it be in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make you happy, <hi>I</hi> engage my Honour, that I will lose all I have in the world, rather then faile of my word.</p>
                  <p>The young Musitian (whom I will call <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> since he told <hi>Polexander</hi> that his name was so) cast himselfe at the King's feet, and embracing his leggs, Sir (said he) <hi>I</hi> am much greiv'd, that I cannot make appear by some more humble and respectfull action, the sensibility I have of those assurances your Majesty vouchsafes to give me. I dare not doubt any longer of my good fortune, since your generousnesse hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of it: and were it not for some remainder of feare which holds my happynesse sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, <hi>I</hi> confesse, that I can wish for nothing more. But to the end, your Majesty may know what the cause is of my sufferings, &amp; by that knowledg apply a remedy which may free me from them, I will tel you, all my miseries came from my loving too much: He blush'd in making that Declaration, and his bashfullnesse hindered him from going<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on in his discourse. <hi>Polexander,</hi> to give him time to recollect himselfe, told him, that considering the age, beauty &amp; other graces he was endow'd with, he could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extraordinary diffidence to avoid the trap whereinto he was fal'n. For (said he) I have learn'd from those who have taught me, that youth and beauty, be it of the body or the mind, are dangerous company; and usally betraying those they love most, deliver them over into the hands of the most cruell of all the Tyrants, wherewithall our humane condition is persecuted.</p>
                  <p>Hearing you speak thus of love (replied <hi>Hyppolitus)</hi> 'tis easy to be imagined that you know it well. I know not (answer'd <hi>Polexander)</hi> what it is, and speak only by heare say. How! (said <hi>Hyppolitus)</hi> speak you of love but on the beliefe you have of your Tutors? no truly (replyed the King,) and even thinking oftentimes on that which they have taught me of it, I imagine with my selfe, that tis with love as with so many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fables invented for delight and instruction, and that indeed there was nothing which in spight of us, could make it selfe Master of our liberties, and force us to love what we ought to hate.</p>
                  <p>Ah Sir! what say you? cried <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> with a sight You are in an opinion exploded by all ages and Nations: Repent you quickly for being faln into this Error; and hold your selfe for a lost-man, if you persever in it. <hi>Polexander</hi> began to laugh at the feare <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> would have put him in, and told him, he spake according to his understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and truly (said he) I finde nothing in me that teacheth I should give place to love. What (repli'd <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> presently) doe you then love nothing? Yes marry do I, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Polexander:</hi> I love all that is lovely, but my love is an untroubled, a calme love, an obedient love, a love that passeth not the bounds I prescribe it.

my joyes, and their griefes, mine owne: in briefe, I will live more for them then for my selfe. Tis more then I expected (quoth <hi>Hyppolitus)</hi> from a minde which faines to be ignorant of love. Doe not beleeve I dissemble (continued <hi>Polexander)</hi> I know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love, then a judicious and just desire to do good actions; to render to every one what is his due; to acquire a Noble reputation by legitimate waies, and, by a wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a life of few yeares continuance, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This may be (added <hi>Hyppolitus)</hi> because you feare the troubles and disquiets which accompany it. But you would not be sorry to see some young beauty passionately in love with you, and to give to another that passion you would not entertaine your selfe. I have as little intention (answered <hi>Polexander)</hi> to give as to receive any love; and since it falls fitly now to be spoken of, I will tel you tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if, by any fantasticalnesse of Fortune, it should betide me to be beloved, as you would have me understand it, there is nothing I would not doe, either to dis-beguile her that had made so ill a choice, or to hinder me from seeing her. And I [said <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> sighing alowd] would leave nothing undone to be never seperated from such a person as you, who knowes not so much as the name of love, and would fly from me as if I were his Mortall Enemy. I pitty you [repli'd the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] and advise you to what a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous man should doe. If you cannot cure your selfe by any remedy, may please you, try those which seem to you the most dis-agreeable, and yet, which by their hidden virtue may be extreamely profitable unto you. I meane, if you cannot be holpen by the enjoying, cure your selfe by contempt, absence, or oblivion. Ah! Cruell and bunexperienc'd Councellor, cri'd <hi>Hyppolitus]</hi> O remedies more painefull then the disease it selfe! I am in the wrong [repli'd <hi>Polexander]</hi> 'tis true I should have stai'd the prescribing you those last remedies, till you had lost all hope. Forget them till there be need [deare <hi>Hippolitus]</hi> an in the meane time go on to relate to me your fortune. I have told it you all [repli'd <hi>Hyppolitus.]</hi> What have you told me [repli'd <hi>Polexander?]</hi> That I loved [added <hi>Hyppolitus]</hi> and lov'd a personage as insensible and as great an Enemy to love as your Majesty. <hi>I</hi> am very glad [continued <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der]</hi> for having that conformity with your Mistris: since without it, I know well you would leave me as some <hi>Barbarian,</hi> that could not polish or civilize himselfe in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode of politenesse and civility it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended the first converse of <hi>Polexander</hi> and <hi>Hyppolitus;</hi> and all the time of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the meane time, <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> visibly lost that lustre and freshnesse which made him admired at the first meeting. He did seldome sleep or eate; He never sung but when <hi>Polexander</hi> pres'd him to it, and towards the end he sung so weakly, that we judg'd him entring into some dangerous disease. <hi>Polexander</hi> strove to comfort and cheere him; and to draw him from this depth of sadnesse, made him hope his Mistris would not be so insensible as he imagined.</p>
                  <p>To make me hope with reason [answered <hi>Hyppolitus]</hi> it behoves your Majesty to make tryall on your selfe, and acknowledg whither you may be capable of being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. No, no, Sir, do not make a proofe so difficult. 'Tis done already, and in saying so he held his peace, and after he had some while mused: Dye, dye [said he] unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Hyppolitus]</hi> and by death finde that which thou couldst not get, ether by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, absence, or oblivion.</p>
                  <p>At last we came to <hi>Nantes,</hi> where <hi>Polexander</hi> was receiv'd yet with a greate Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence then he had been in any of the other Townes on the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Loire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hyppoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was the one cause of his disquiet: But he was too generous to abandon him in the State he was. He besought him to think on his cure, and call his courage and Fortune to

second his love. <hi>I</hi> would faine make use of your councell; said the languishing <hi>Hyppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus,</hi> but my owne weaknesse opposeth it; and the more <hi>I</hi> endeavour to bring my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to obedience, the more rebellious <hi>I</hi> find it. 'Tis your virtue Sir, tis that alone which <hi>I</hi> call to the reliefe of my infirmity: Have pitty on a wretch who implores your assistance. Lend your hand to one, from whom you have taken the strength of uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him selfe! Be sensible by commiseration, if you cannot be so by love! and if you will not heale a heart which you have cover'd with wounds, yet give a testimoniall at least, that you have a feeling, and participate of his misery.</p>
                  <p>I speak to your Majesty in this manner, because I see so great a resembiance betwixt you and the Saint I adore, that I continually perswade my selfe, if <hi>I</hi> could but see you once touch'd with my afflictions, my Mistris would at last become exorable. <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> who was exceedingly astonish'd at the beginning of this speech, came out of it by the artificiall conclusion. And to content <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> he protested to him, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely sensible of his miss-fortunes, and wish'd he knew the meanes to overcome them. These promises brought back a little courage to <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> and in a moment He regain'd new strength and, beseeching <hi>Polexander</hi> to stay for him at <hi>Nantes</hi> two dayes, he parted thence with two Squires and a Page, and was a day and a halfe in his Journey. He return'd not more merry, but more resolute then when he parted, and then assur'd <hi>Polexander,</hi> he had an intention to follow his first advice, and to overcome by absence and forgetfullnesse, what he could not otherwayes subdue. He told him more, that having vainly attempted divers meanes to mollifie his Mistris obdurate heart, he intenended to forsake <hi>France,</hi> and in His company to seek the recovery from his malady. <hi>Polexander</hi> was so good, that without thinking on what he was, He often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times imbrac'd <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> promisd to make him happy, and to confirme him in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, <hi>I</hi> will (said he) propose to you an exchange, of which 'tis possible you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove: Leave an ingratefull Mistris for an acknowledging friend. Let friendship take the place of Love; and to give your mind an object worthy it, make it amorous of honor and immortality. Take the Exercise of Armes for a counterpoyson to that melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly which devours you, and in lieu of shedding teares, poure forth the blood of your Enemies. Surely 'tis farre more honourable to command men then to serve a Child; and to acquire a name through perilous adventures, then to ruinate your virtue by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish imployments, or rather effeminate idlenesse. Let's leave <hi>Hyppolitus,</hi> let's leave to women what is proper to women; and since we are beleev'd to be men, let's try to do such actions as may not belye the opinion is had of us. The painting which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us best, is the dust, sweat, and blood wherewith we are cover'd in fight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the wounds we receive then, are the beauties and charmes which should winn all generous hearts. <hi>I</hi> perceive well that you condemne this my opinion: but <hi>I</hi> know not how to help it, thus farre <hi>I</hi> am rude. Though there be a great difference (repli'd <hi>Hyppolitus)</hi> betwixt your Majesties humour and mine, yet shall there be no contrariety in our wills: I submit absolutely all my reason to yours. <hi>I</hi> condemne all you approve not, and how sweet soever Love exerciseth his Empire o're my heart, since you professe your selfe his Enemy, <hi>I</hi> will no more brag in being one of his slaves. <hi>Polexander</hi> replying not, but with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It would be trouble some to tell you all the <hi>Canaryans</hi> did to testifie to their King, the joy they had in reviewing him. He went into all the Vessells, prais'd the love and fidelity of the Captaines and Souldiers, told them he had not forsaken them, but to make himselfe more worthy their affection, and imbracing the most eminent, assured them he was ready to be their follower to the end of the world. By such an obliging and humane fashion of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his mind, <hi>Polexander</hi> made his Subjects know he would faine have already been at the <hi>Canaryes.</hi> The Vessell prepar'd to carry him, cannot be compar'd but to the statelynesse of that, in which you cross'd the Ocean. Assoon as <hi>Hyppolitus, Alcippus, Diceus</hi> and my selfe were come aboord him, all the fleet was warn'd, by a Canon shot, to set sayle. Every one perform'd his charge in a marvelous good order, and with a very favourable wind we left the Coasts of <hi>France.</hi> When we were in sight of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>

shores, <hi>Polexander</hi> would needs make it appeare to his Enemies, that he was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently powerfull and couragious to set on them in their owne Houses. He therefore sent six of his <unclear>lightest</unclear> men of Warre, and himselfe entring into one of the Ports of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia,</hi> burnt many ships, landed, forc'd a Town extreamly rich, took foure or five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred prisoners, and so set sayle again after he had left in <hi>Spaine</hi> so glorious tokens of his sensibility.

Their King received that affront, without the meanes of repelling it, because he was surpris'd, and the King my Master before he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, sent and told him by a Herald, that he would hold him for a heartlesse Prince, if he himself did not presently take armes, and be sensible of the injury had been done him, and so we presently set Saile and steerd on our course. He thought no more on <hi>Portugal</hi> or <hi>Spaniard,</hi> when his Sentinells discovered many Sailes at the entry of the <hi>Streights</hi> This Fleet, compos'd of many great Gallyons, and other vessells of Warre; put roome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ward to Sea, assoone as they had descried us, and getting the wind of us, made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear they had command to fight with us. <hi>Polexander,</hi> unwilling to lose so faire an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, put his Army in <hi>Batalia,</hi> and animating his Soldiers by a short and powerfull Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, went the first himselfe to assault the Enemy. The fight was indeed very long and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and though the Spanyards shew'd spirit enough, yet had they all been lost there, but that the night favoured their flying. The King seeing himselfe victorious, sent a squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of his ships after the run-awayes, which gave them a sprightfull chase, and himselfe the while having taken a view of his gayn and losse, retir'd to take a little rest after so long a toyle, But he was much hindred by a lamentable spectacle which presented it selfe to his Eyes, at his entrance into his Cabin. He saw there the faire <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> all in blood, and wounded in divers dangerous places. Imagine with your selfe (if you please) how great his affright was, and how much his Sorrow, to see in so sad a plight, a person that was so deare to him. He cried out as loud as he could, and being scarce able to stand, fail'd little of falling quite backwards. <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> who gaz'd on him with dying Eyes, (Imagined he would recover) and in that opinion, putting forth his right hand to him with such an action as was capable to peirce to a feeling even insensibly it selfe?

But deare <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> (he added stooping to see his wounds) do not despayre of life. your wounds, may be, are not so dangerous. At that speech <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> smyl'd, and taking the King by the hand, No, no Sir (said he) they are not dangerous, Nevertheles, since tis not in your power to undertake for what is to come, command (if you please) your people to retire, that I may discover to you a secret which ought not to be known by any but your selfe. Hereupon, <hi>Polexander,</hi> bid all withdraw except the two Squires and <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> Page. He rais'd himselfe a little by their help, and casting his eyes downwards as ashamed: Look on me well [said he to <hi>Polexander]</hi> and take notice of the unfortunate Princesse <hi>de Foix,</hi> who, to overcome your contempt and cruelty, hath been compel'd by her too violent passion, to take the habit of a man, and the name of <hi>Hypolitus.</hi> But I ought not to complaine of my change, since I am obliged to it, for the pity <unclear>yow</unclear> have had of me. Yea <hi>Polexander</hi> [said she in another tone,] tis to this habit onely that I ow thy compassion, for thou wouldst never have had any, if my disguize had not hindered thee from knowing me. I am now dying [ingrateful man] but <hi>I</hi> dye contented, since my life was not pleasing to you. But I deceive my selfe, or you are not to be beleeved. Now I please you, for I am covered with blood and wounds. Looke on me well therefore, and preserve that cruelty which I have so long contented withall. I now love it, when it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> advantagious to me. <hi>Polexander</hi> was so surprized to heare all this, and so lively touched with <hi>Hypolitus</hi> amorous and pitifull words, that he could not retaine his sighes nor teares.

He, on the other side, after his being three or four dayes in-exorable to the Petitions of his servants, suffered himselfe to be perswaded to the finishing his voyage.</p>
                  <p>All his Shipps then being returned with a great many prisoners, he stood for the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> But the King's griefe ceas'd not by the absence of the object which had caus'd it. He lamented the faire <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> as she had been his own Sister, or to say better; as if effectively he had guilty been of her death. His griefe spread into his followers, and made them lose all sence of joy for their victory. Those who considered <hi>Polexander,</hi> farre more then they did the King, went a great deale farther: for they found fault with their own good Fortune, and detested such happy successe as had been bought by the teares of their Master, and the blood of so rare a Princesse. But time, which to this day ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found malady which it could not cure, by little and little, gave remedy to our Master; and presented him so many new imployments, that he was forc'd [spight of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe] to forget those which sorrow had made so deare to him. When he was near the coasts of <hi>Morocco,</hi> he learnt of certaine Merchants that were sayling into <hi>Scotland,</hi> how the Prince <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> eldest Sonne to the King of <hi>Morocco,</hi> had proclaim'd the most glorious Turney, that had ever been seen in <hi>Europe,</hi> or <hi>Africa.</hi> Our young Prince seem'd he would be glad to see this Moorish bravery, and breake a lance in memory of the Princesse <hi>De foix.</hi> To dash the businesse I exhibited to him the great necessity of his presence with his Subjects, and how much a delaying might be advantagious to his Enemies.

'Tis so little a time, that the least calme, or weakest Tempest, may make us lose more. After thus much spoken, he cal'd for all the Officers of his Army; and making a faire Oration, by which he immortaliz'd their valour and fidelity, intreated them to intimate to the Queen his Mother and his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the newes of his returning; and when [said he] you arrive at the <hi>Canaries,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide

                  <p>His Commanders threw themselves at his feet, to beseech him to lead them whither he was going; but when he had made known, that his absence would be only but for three or four dayes, and desired not to be known in <hi>Morocco,</hi> they took their leave, &amp; with al their vessells got to the happy end of their navigation. In the meane time, the King my Master, causing al the badges, and other things of markabout his ship, to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and his Servants to be clad in the French Fashion, entred with two little ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells that followed him into the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Tansif.</hi> He landed assoone as he could, and commanding me to wait for him in his Ship, took no other followers with him, then <hi>Alcippus, Diceus</hi> and ten or twelve Slaves. At his taking Horse, he commanded them expresly, to name him for a Frenchman; and began a journey, which instead of eight dayes lasted neer six Moneths. I confesse yet, that as long as I live, I shall repent me for not following him; for as I understood by <hi>Alcippus</hi> and <hi>Diceus,</hi> there will never beseen any thing equal to the wonders of readiness, valour, &amp; courtesie, which <hi>Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> shew'd in <hi>Abdelmelec's</hi> Turney.

I acknowledg now, that I abused his goodnesse much in the speech I had with him about that Journey: But his Heroick Soule, incapable to receive any alteration, endur'd my liberty without shew of being mov'd; and never oppos'd but his own naturall sweetnesse, to the sharpnesse of al my reprehensions. I must confesse, my deare Master, (said he) I have done amisse, and have not taken enough into my consideration, the Queen my Mother nor you. But you have so often taught me, that there is no voice which ought so sweetly to touch the eares of a virtuous Man, as that of a miserable creature which reclaimes his assistnce, and I made so certaine an experience of that truth, when the unfortunat <hi>Izilia</hi> related to me her afflictions, that I could not resist the violence wherewithal her complaints drew me to the place where she had need of my courage.

'Twas told him at his arrivall, the Queen his Mother was more afflicted then ever, since some ten or twelve dayes before, the Princesse <hi>Cydaria</hi> had been by a great number of strangers carried away. <hi>Polexander,</hi> afflicted as much as possibly the best natur'd man in the world could be, came to his Mother, witness'd, by his unfained griefe, an extream sorrow for her affliction, besought her to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve her selfe for his and the Subjects good; and promis'd he would never be at rest till he had restor'd to her the Princesse her Daughter. You may well beleeve that Good Queen had receiv'd an extreame content in reviewing so worthy an Heyre of the great <hi>Periander,</hi> if the death of that Prince, and the rape of her Daughter had not made her incapable of all kind of pleasure. On the contrary, it was to her a redoubling of her vexation, in the estate wherein she was. For the presence of so accomplish'd a Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd the losse of a Father that was no lesse so; renew'd likewise her ancient sorrowes, and reduced her to the incapacity of giving any thing to the returne of the Prince, but teares. Yet dar'd she not discover to him the true cause of them, but, by a wisdome worthy her selfe, had rather <hi>Polexander</hi> should suspect it to be for her too much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her Daughter, then that he should know, her extraordinary affliction was from the want of power to avenge the murder of the great <hi>Periander.</hi> The King my Master made the same construction of her teares as She desired; and thinking that the losse of <hi>Cydaria</hi> was the sole cause, He, by consequence, beleev'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he might give her an ample testimony of his love, in forgetting his own interests for the safety of his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. He understood the Prince of <hi>Scotland</hi> was gone after the Ravishers; and that news made him the more impatient, till he was shipped. The very same day he set sayle, and steering again his course towards <hi>Africa,</hi> met with many of his ships, which after a long vaine chase, were returning to the <hi>Canaryes.</hi> Some of them He sent back to the Quee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the next day after that resolution, his Vice-Admirall came to him, and said; that the Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> after he had given chase to those that stole away <hi>Cydaria,</hi> at last fetcht them up in sight of the fortresse of <hi>Guargetssem;</hi> and after a furious combat, the Ravishers, finding themselves the weakest, had put fire to their powder, and involved, in one same flame, the vanquish'd and the vanquishers. Vnfortunate that I am, cri'd <hi>Polexander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> must my return be remembred by the losse of the Daughter, and desolation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Deplorable <hi>Polexander!</hi> hast thou the heart to carry these sad newes to a person whose griefs should be more sensible to thee, then thine own? No, no, be not the sad bringer of so Tragicall an accident: Present not thy selfe before <hi>Axiamira,</hi> since thou canst not do it without increasing her afflictions. Whilst he was thus lamenting, I came into his Cabin, and seeing <hi>Alcippus</hi> durst not speak a word to qualifie his passion, I made use of the authority which my age and condition gave me. Hearkning therefore to him a little while: If (said I at last) I should condemn your complaints, I should find fault with the most just sensiblenesse that is in nature. When we lose those whom blood or affection makes deare unto us, we lose a part of our selves, and by cosequence, should seeme to be our owne Enemies, if we, for their losse, should make of shew of lamentation. But Sir, this sorrow must have its rules &amp; bounds, and must not imitate the griefe of Children, who fal'n into the durt content themselves with crying, and never strive to get out. Besides these reasons, and others, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your condition, you ought to take into consideration the Queen your Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you ought to give her the Example of comforting her selfe; and by your constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, facilitate the meanes of supporting her mis-fortunes: All things sort well with you, to go render her this necessary proofe of your good disposition. She now bewayls your absence, as well as your Sisters. Go and ease her of one part of her feares and disquiet; and since 'tis impossible for you to give her all she desires, give her yet (at least) all which she desires with reason. I know tis vexatious and irksome to you, to signifie to her the death of your Sister: But it is not of necessity, that you should, your selfe, bring her that unwelcome and heavy newes. Besides, <hi>Axiamira's</hi> virtue is no common
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54727:118"/>
virtue; She is of proofe against the greatest Accidents; and Fortune, who hath often violently justled her, hath not been able to stirr her. At that word, <hi>Polexander</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me, Governour (said he) I yeeld to so many reasons, and will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Presently the Pilot had command to returne to the <hi>Canaryes:</hi> and, as if the wind had been govern'd by that Prince, it shifted in a moment from East to West, and so fresh a gale, that the second day we discry'd the prodigious Mountaine of the Isle of <hi>Teneriffe.</hi> There we met with an obstacle, which was as the presage of those hind'rances, where withall Fortune went about to oppose the prosperities of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</hi> Four-Pyrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

My generous Master, finding in this occasion wherewithall to exercise his great courage, made it appeare to the Rovers they had been very ill advised. He so affrighted them by the terror of his blowes, but particularly by the death of their Captaine, that they gave over the fight, and contented themselves with the losses they had sustained. <hi>Polexander</hi> was more hard to be pleas'd, and would not overcome by halfes: He hotly pursued the Run-awayes, sunck two of their ships, and, but for the ill weather which seem'd to envy his victory, it had not been unperfected. But of this I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to accuse Fortune, if by a pernicious sequell, that Jealous-one had not made it appeare, she had a designe, not to save the Prince's Enemies, but to ruine the Prince himselfe. To bring it to passe, she arm'd the Sea and the Winds, and commanded them to wage Warr with him: and after she had held him many dayes and nights without hope of safety, cast him into a Port wherein he made a more dangerous shipwrack, then if his Vessell had been split upon some Rock. His ship then open and leaking in many places, and unfurnished in her principall parts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hazardously entred the mouth of a little River, which our Pilots knew not, and not finding water enough, insensibly ran in on the owze. The generous <hi>Polexander</hi> presently came to assist <hi>Alcippus, Diceus,</hi> and my selfe, that could no more; and assuring us, we were out of all danger, said, that if we had yet but a little courage, we might instantly enjoy our good fortune. Get out my friends, let's get out of this sad abode; and let's see whether the Land will be more kind to us then the water; and whilst our Mariners resume their Spirits, let us take the benefit of that rest which an extream pleasant shore presents us. <hi>Alcippus</hi> overcame his sicknesse to follow <hi>Polexander,</hi> went a land with him; <hi>Diceus</hi> follow'd presently after; and <hi>I,</hi> who had rather dye then be from my Prince, caus'd my selfe to be carryed on shore by foure of our slaves. The ayre of the Land streightwayes dissipating a part of our sicknesse, we found our selves comforted and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But seeing neither men nor houses, and the night too approaching, they return'd where they had left me, and told me, we must set up Tents on the shore, to passe the comming night better then we had done the eight or ten precedent. <hi>Diceus</hi> receiving this order from me, went back into the ship, and commanded the Officers of the Kings Cabin, to go set up the Kings pavillion in the most commodious place they could find. All which was don with so much diligence, that, in lesse then an houre, we found our selves very well lodg'd. When every one had eaten, we set Sentinells on the parts that lead to us, for feare of being surpris'd, and gave them expresse order not to disperse themselves for what cause soever. This done, we went to Bed; Scarce had the Sun begun to whiten the top of the Rock, at whose feet we had pitch'd our Tent, when <hi>Polexander</hi> call'd <hi>Alcippus</hi> and my selfe, and told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We streight clad us, and that while the Prince went to relieve the Sentinells, and put some little Court of Guard about his Tents, to make some little resistance, in case we were set on; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad us on paine of death, to observe him as a King before any person whatsoever that should hap to come neer him. This being thus ordered, he commanded his horses to be landed, but they had been so Sea-beaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could hardly uphold themselves. Yet there was a Barbary, white as Snow, which <hi>Polexander</hi> had bought to combate with <hi>Abdelmelec,</hi> that took heart assoone as he was landed, and refreshing himselfe on the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54727:118"/>
Grasse, seem'd by his neighing to assure the King his Master, that he might make use of him. The Prince, after he had taken a little repast amongst all his followers, took horse and <hi>Alcippus</hi> and <hi>Diceus</hi> following him a foot, travers'd a plaine which stretch'd it selfe along by the River, and grew broader in other Lands, as farr off as the eye could extend. After he had ridden three or four miles, he descended by a pleasant slope hanging of a hill, into so delight some valleys were it for the little Brookes which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, for the Fountaines which slid from the top of the little hills, for the meadow, coverd with a thousand severall kindes of flowers, or for the little woods which invirond them so that oftentimes considering them, I have said to my selfe, that the ancient <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> had good cause to chuse the abode of their <hi>Heroes</hi> Soules in the Islands of the <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantick</hi> Sea. If <hi>Polexander</hi> were ravished at so faire a Scite. he was farre more, in meeting with those that inhabited it. They were Shepheards so handsome, and Shepheardesses so fayre and neatly clad, that in seeing them <hi>Polexander</hi> thought on the Knights and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the French Court, &amp; beleeved he saw them represent &amp; act some Pastoral in their rurall habits. The first he met withall not a jot wondred to see him so richly clad and so proudly mounted. On the contrary they came to him with the grace and civility of Courtiers, and questionlesse said many neat and witty things to him, but the Prince could not understand them, and by consequence, make no answer.</p>
                  <p>He made them speake oftentimes, to comprehend somewhat of their Language, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some of their words: thought it had somewhat of the <hi>Arabick.</hi> He therefore spake to them in that Language, but they understood him not, so that, to expresse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he was constraind to make use of Signes, instead of Words. The Shepheards supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the quicknesse of their wit, the obscurity of the Language by which <hi>Polexander</hi> strove to make himselfe understood, apprehended, that he ask'd the Name of their Island and the place where Strangers used to be received. They forthwith offered themselves to accompany him thither, and told him the Name of their Isle, But he could not divine what they said, two Young Shepheards leaving their flocks in the custody of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, put themselves before <hi>Polexander,</hi> and making a signe he should follow them, lead him from those Vallyes, by the most pleasant way that can be imagined. <hi>Al cippus</hi> and <hi>Diceus</hi> were ravished with their Adventure, and following merrily their Master and his guides, quickly got to the top of those Hills which kept them from the Mid-daies Sun. There they saw Plaines. but covered with Flowers, and cut crosse by many wayes, which outwent the fairest Garden-alleyes and parks of <hi>Europ,</hi> As they came neere to a Wood of <hi>Palmes</hi> and <hi>Cedars,</hi> they saw leap out of it, a <hi>Hind</hi> more white then snow. She was wounded above her right shoulder: The Arrow which had given the wound yet stuck in, it, &amp; paind her so much that she fell on her legs at every ten paces, &amp; ran her nose to the ground. The Shepheards staid to see the fal of the dear, &amp; well deeming by whom she was hunted, made signs to <hi>Polexander,</hi> that would have said somthing of great importance. He soon knew it, for as he had his eyes fixed on the <hi>Hind</hi> he heard a horn, and turning his head towards the Wood, saw come out of it, amongst many Lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>es on horsback, a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, drawn by fonre horses as white as his own. The Chariot was uncovered, and for shape almost like a throne. A very faire Maiden, clad like a Nymph, was the Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resse, and to guide the Horses, was set at the feet of another Nymph so richly clad, that 'twill be hard for me to describe it to you. She held a Bow in one hand, an Arrow in the other, and wore a Quiver crosse her shoulders. As soone as the Shepherds saw her, they gave a great shout in flying, and forgot (to our mishap) to make signe to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> that he should follow them: He stood firme, and desired to have the whole content. But as he was intentively beholding the Troop of Ladies, and noting her that was mounted on the Chariot, the <hi>Hind</hi> came and fell almost between his Horses legges, and by that unlook'd-for fall, so affrighted him, that flying from under <hi>Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> he had almost given him a most sensible affront. But the Prince, who was the best and bravest Hors-man of his age, corrected him with so much art, and knew so readily to tame his fury, that the faire huntresses, and especially She that sate highest in the Chariot, making a stand, stood still awhile to behold the strangers readinesse. After he had made himselfe admired on Hors-back, he alighted, and delivering his horse to <hi>Alcippus,</hi> drew neer to the Chariot of the faire, and fatall huntresse. She cast her
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54727:119"/>
eyes on him, and judging him a stranger by his habit, spake to two Ladies that were neer her, and withall commanded the driver of the Chariot to put on. The Horses, stirred by the whip, fell to their gallop, and the faire Troop riding with full speed, got out of sight, as if it had been a dreame or an inchantment. <hi>Polexander,</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, stood fix'd, as if he had been trans form'd into a stone, and grew pale on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, as if he had been ready to have swoonded; <hi>Alcippus</hi> perceiv'd it, and ran to him. Ah my friend (said <hi>Polexander,</hi> what have I seen? The two Shepherds, who had left him, return'd as soone as the Ladies were gone, and seeing <hi>Polexander</hi> so wan, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd his horse had hurt him; and in that opinion intreated him, by their signes, to rest himselfe in one of their Cottages. <hi>Polexander,</hi> understanding by their gestures the curteous offers they made him, and besides desirous wholly to gaine them, yeelded to returne with them. He would not get againe on horse-back, but leaning on <hi>Alcippus,</hi> began to walk gently, and in going, asked him whither he had not noted (among so many faire huntresses) her, which stood up-right in the Chariot, and whither he did not remember whom she was like. <hi>Alcippus</hi> answering him, that he had not so much time; tis most certaine (said he) that either all we have seen is a meer illusion, or that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable huntresse must be <hi>Alcidiana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Shepheards turn'd their heads at that Name, and many times repeated it, by which the King my Master was assured of what he imagined, and by that lost himselfe. <hi>Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida,</hi> Smiling at the pleasant conclusion of the Viceroy; 'twas then truly <hi>Alcidiana</hi> (said he?) The very same, answered the good old man; and mark how <hi>Polexander</hi> had it manifested.. When the Shepheards had brought him to their Cottages, and entertain'd him there, not with all the magnifience, but with all the Gentilenesse of a Palace; One of them thought on somewhat which might contribute very much to the Princes contentment, and letting him know he went to fetch it, assured him that he would be back againe within two dayes at the latest. <hi>Polexander</hi> signified to him an extreame sensibility of his courtesie, and to omit nothing of that which might acquire him the favour of his hostes, pass'd over a part of the day in doing what they proposed to him. At evening, he retyr'd with <hi>Alcippus</hi> and <hi>Diceus,</hi> and giving the Later instructions of all he would have me know, sent him to me all night; and he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me where I was left, made me know the Kings pleasure, and to have it executed staid all the next day with me. We unloaded our Ship, and transported to the next Town all that was in her: Which done, <hi>Diceus</hi> return'd to receive new commands, but at his arrivall meeting the King in an estate farre differing from that he had left him in, forgot all he had to say to him from me, and thought of nothing but the means to help his sick Master. <hi>Polexander</hi> might well be term'd so, for since the fatall meeting with that divine huntresse, he was faln into such a deep melancholy, that even <hi>Alcippus</hi> had much adoe to draw a word from him. He sigh'd thrice and foure times in utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a word; and rather answering his own thoughts then <hi>Alcippus</hi> questions. Tis true (said he) <hi>Abdelmelec</hi> is as generous as he is rash; and since he had a mind to lose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he could not doe it in a more high enterprize. But how I pitty him for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seen but through a very obscure veyle, this so shining and lively a light, which makes him contemn all others. Certainly those pictures of <hi>Alcidiana</hi> which he hath are the works of ignorance or envie; and I may say, after what I have seen, that Prince adores a Divinity to him unknown. <hi>Alcippus,</hi> desirous to qualifie the disquiet of this new Lover, Me thinks (said he) that instead of lamenting <hi>Abdelmelecs</hi> fortune, you ought to extoll your own, and give thanks to Love, that since he hath inspir'd you with a desire to serve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

But <hi>Sir</hi> (said he) if the Viceroy presse me upon your staying, what shall I say to him? Thou shalt tell him (replyd the Prince all that thou thinkest fittest to keep him where he is. <hi>Diceus</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently took one of his hosts Horses, and in full speed came to the Towne where I was retyred. I was wonderfully astonish'd at so quick a returne, and askd him the cause. Tis nothing (said he) nor no other then the curiosity of a great Lord of this Isle: He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to see <hi>Abdelmelecs</hi> bucklers, and I have ridden all last night that he might not long expect his desir'd contentment. After he had told me this tale, he took the two buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and returnd with as much speed as he came. <hi>Polexander,</hi> seeing him come back, commended his love and diligence, and with an excesse of joy, forgetting what he was embrac'd him a long time in his armes. Then he set <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> Pictures in their best light, and considering them well: I am confirm'd (said he to <hi>Alcippus)</hi> in my first opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; These Pictures are nothing like <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> I saw the Princesse so little (replyd <hi>Alcippus)</hi> that my memory represents her not to me, but very confusedly. Yet, if that <hi>Idea</hi> of her which I retain hathany conformity with the Original, I find not these Coppies any way do resemble her. Assuredly (said <hi>Polexander</hi> with a litle passion) they are nothing at all like her. Where find you that sweet and majesticall livelinesse, which sparkles in her eyes? or that fresh and cleere whitnesse of her complexion and brest? No, no, there is nought here of <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> Only a man may see by some strokes, that tis the portraict of some excellently faire creature. In this discussion was the Prince, when the Shepheard who two dayes before had left him, entred his Chamber, and presenting to him another Shepherd, of a very good aspect for an old man, made him understand by signes, that, that was it which he had promised him. The old Shepheard presently beginning to speake, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>Polexender</hi> in <hi>Arabian,</hi> and by that language, made him sufficiently conceive the good office done him by the young Shepheard. The Prince went and imbrac'd him to signifie how sensible he was of that obligation. After that satisfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he streight did the like to the old man, and told him in <hi>Arabicke,</hi> that he was too happy in meeting with one to whom he might make himselfe understood. This venerable old man answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, his joy was not lesse; and should he reap no other fruit of his travells, then the tafting the sweetnesse of his conversation, he would (all the rest of his life) blesse that curiosity which at first made him to undertake them.

But why doe I number our riches to you. Your curiosity is too generous to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted among the excrements of the Land and Sea. I shall doe better in entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you with the manner of our government, with our Lawes and Mannors. This Iland hath been governed from all times by Kings or Queens, for, both the one and the other Sex may indifferently raigne there. For our Lawes they have been estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, rather to put us in mind of those vertues which are naturall to us, then to refraine us from Vices. But I passe by particular Lawes to speake of those of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first commands us to believe but one God in Heaven, and by consequence to adore but one on Earth. The second forbid our Kings, to take any Stranger Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses to their Wives; and declares, that if any one undertake to travell against the fundamentall Law of the State; and happens to marry with a stranger, the Children proceeding from that marriage, cannot succeed their Father in any inheritance, if they be not borne in this Iland. This old Law hath been exactly kept even to this day, or to say better, no occasion hath call'd on a necessity of putting it in practice. Yet the last deceass'd King, my good Master gave birth to one; but the Eternall wisdome, which works all for the best, strangled it almost as soone as it was borne. That great Prince (by name <hi>Alcidus)</hi> leaving the Isle to have the knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther people and Countries then his own, saves himselfe reduc'd to the extremity, of either violating this fundamentall Law, or to leave among the number of the vulgar and private persons, a pretious gage which he had receiv'd from the love of one of the fayrest Princesses of the world. I will sincerely relate to you the History, since thereby I shall make answer to all your questions. To take it then from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; you may please to know there is in this Kingdome, a third fundamentall Law, which ordaines, that every yeare the King chuse one of his Sonnes, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther person of eminent vertue to the end, that as Soveraigne Priest, he make a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to an Iland not farre from this, to pay the tribute of Love, and celebrate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of alliance, whereto our Predecessors, have engaged us towards the true God which is ador'd in this Island, under the forme of the Sunne. The King <hi>Cleonidas,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the late King my Master, commanded that his son with an extraordinary stately preparation and equipage, should g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For transported with a desire to see the world, he cross'd the Ocean, and arriv'd in <hi>England,</hi> where he became desperately in love with a Princesse the Sister of King <hi>Edward.</hi> She was call'd <hi>Phelismonda,</hi> and tis to be confess'd, her charmes were so powerfull, her wit so admirable, and her vertues so extraordinary, that when the King my Master disclos'd to me his love to her; I was compell'd to tell him he could not have a more just affection. In that passion he made me his Confident, and <hi>Phelismonda</hi> chose for her's, an English Lady cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But as I have told you, the Eternall wisdome who fore-sees even the least of our actions, had resolv'd the infortunate <hi>Phelismonda</hi> should give no Kings to this Island; for after the Princesse had undergone many terrible throwes, she dy'd (undelivered) in the armes of the King her Husband. As soone as <hi>Alcidus</hi> saw her expire, he did what he could to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her, and seeing himselfe hindred by all us that were neer him, he made shew of being comforted, the more freely to put in execution his tragicall designe.

The High-Priest receiv'd the King our Master, with tears of joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gaz'd on him as on a Prince, who after he had been long dead, was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously rays'd again. <hi>Alcidus</hi> related his adventures to him, and thinking he had not sufficiently acquitted himselfe of the Commission the King his Father had given him in charge, began the sacrifices anew, and after he had satisfied the Obligations of his estate, he would likewise perfect his owne particular.

I should be to tedious to relate the contentment <hi>Alcidus</hi> return gave to the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the ravishing joy the King his Father received. The Feast for it lasted many monethes, and to make it more accomplish'd, <hi>Cleonidas</hi> married the Prince, to a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his blood, called <hi>Diana,</hi> (with more Iustice then she among the Greeks.) The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond year after this happy marriage, but of small continuance, <hi>Alcidus</hi> mounted the Throne by the death of his Father, and the next yeare he had by his Queen a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who without flattery, ought to be placed among things celestiall. Tis not to say what She is, to say that she is faire, that she is witty, that she is virtuous. I shall not have saied enough of her; when I have told you that she is beauty it selfe, that she is the highest of the created <hi>Intelligences,</hi> and in short, should be taken for that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary virtue to which the ancient Philosophers gave the Sirname <hi>Heroicall.</hi>

Some few dayes after this Princesse birth, the Riner Arzilea overflowed his banckes, and rising hie, even to some old buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings which were called the Tombes of the Prophets, cast downe a peece of a wall which inclosed the Vaults where the bodyes of the Prophets had been buried. When the River was retir'd into his Channell, some body mark'd that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ruine, and his curiosity lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him into those Caves, He saw a great Tombe covered with plates of Gold. Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he published this wonder through the City, and the King being advertiz'd of it, sent thither a guard, A little after, (thrust on no doubt by some divine inspiration) he went himselfe to those Sepulchers, made the plates of them to be cleans'd, and thereon found very ancient characters, by which he understood, 'twas neere three hundred yeares since the death of those Prophets. He had patience to read all that was there written, and hapned (on a plate separated from the rest) to meet with certaine predictions which gave him matter enough to meditate and ponder on. There was one, whereon it was manifestly spoken of his raigne, and of his House. I cannot relate to you the proper termes, but I will tell you the Substance. The Prophesiy spoke of <hi>Alcidus</hi> Voyage, of the short continuance of those two marriages, of a Sonne which he was to have by the first, which should be one day one of the most valiant Princes of the World, and King of a very great Kingdome, if he could be taken alive out of the Wombe of his dead Mother. It added further how of a second marriage, <hi>Alcidus</hi> should have a Daughter, of so much perfection and rarity, thar she should be esteem'd the miracle of her age, and be passionately desired by many Strange Princes. But that it behoved them to have a wonderfull care for the gard of that Princesse, because she was threatned by many Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: and among others to be stolne away and forc'd in her owne Pallace, and to be one day the Wife of a Slave, sprung from the most barbarous of all the Nations of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> To this prophesie there was joyn'd another, in which the Prophet seem'd to see that <hi>African</hi> Slave arrive in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Kingdome. He solicites him for his undertaking the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof against the enterprizes of many Strangers that would have lain it deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and promiseth the Queen (in the name of the Deity) that if she could resolve to take that to her Husband, the felicities of her Raigne should be farre more great then those of the precedent Governments. Hitherto we have seen nothing of all that which the Prophesie presageth us, except the death of our two Queenes, that of the King (who was taken from us at his age of five and forty, and (if the speech be true) the designe which a Prince of this country called <hi>Siziphus</hi> had on <hi>Alcidiana.</hi> But the late King who naturally was devout euen to superstition, gave such credit to these prophesies, that he caused the Princesse his daughter to be nursed in a Palace whereto no person could ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and when she was past the brest, he chose many young Gentlemen of his Court to be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This Company hath almost still subsisted, and during the life of the King my Master some French and other Strangers, driven by tempests on our coastes, by their brave acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons obtaind to be put in the number of <hi>Alcidianas</hi> Slaves. Some time, and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Alcidus,</hi> the Princesse sequestred her selfe wholly from the conversation of men; and besides her publique Court which is composed of the Grandys of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the Officers of the Crowne, She constituted a particular one, whereinto on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Maides and Women are admitted. The Queen is never seen of men but when she is obliged to do some publique action, be it as a Princesse or a Prelatesse. Sometimes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create her, She betakes her to the country, and there enjoyes the pleasure of Hunting. The rest of her time She remaines shut up in her palace amongst her Women. Thus the Old Shepheard instructed <hi>Polexander</hi> in all the State secrets he knew, and so fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all his curiositie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Seeing himselfe then so well informed, he tooke hold of, and went over againe with the Shepheards discourse, and to content his passion, he began to exaggerate the Majesty of <hi>Alcidiana,</hi> and the happinesse of her subjects, and ended his speech with new thankes and new Offers to the Old man, and to oblige him to stay yet, drew from his little finger a very great Diamond, and with a good grace presented it to him. The good Old man very civily refused it, and told him, that when he tooke on the Habit of a Shepheard, hee had put off not only the Hope, but the desire of riches, That he wanted nothing, because he could content himselfe with a little, and that if he found any one that would disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then him of a part of the meanes his Ancestors had left him, he should walke on to his Gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Contrarily, he thought it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse done in putting it to that tryall, and imployed all the best words he had, to crown it as worthily as it deserved.</p>
                  <p>The old Shepherd was a little tempted by the Eares, as had he been by his Eyes. The Prince his praises put him into a confusion, and made him resolve to put somewhat in action that might oblige the Prince not to continue them. He therefore arose and making avery low reverence to the Prince, humbly besought him he might know whither he could be any further usefull to him, you will bee extreamely so alwaies replied the Prince, but for the present I intreat you one favour, and 'tis, if your affaires can permit it, you will do me the Honor to let me enjoy your company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till you have given me some knowledg in this Countries Languages The Shepheard (who had the generousnesse of a King) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered that his businesse should never be taken into his consideration, when his good Fortune would present him, the occasion of doing him Service. That he should abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dispose of him, and ever finde a readinesse to give proofe of his obedience. After <hi>Polexander</hi> had received those civilities according to his wonted courtesies, he gave a period to their first conversation, and lead the Shepheard to walke. The old man made shew of enjoying the strength of one of farre younger yeares; for though he was come that very day from a village neere twelve miles distant from that where <hi>Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> lay, yet stuck he not to walke till it was farre in the night, and made the Prince confesse his legs were the worst of the two.

But he, who had confined all his felicitie in the sight of <hi>Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana,</hi> converted into bitternesse, the sweets of his aboade, and nourish'd his melancholy, even with such things as should make an end of it.

As soone as <hi>Polexander</hi> heard of her comming, he gave thanks to the Author of his passion, and not to lose the happinesse which he presented him, resolv'd not to put off the enjoying it till another season.</p>
                  <p>He therefore caus'd a Shepheards habit to be made for him, that under such a digguise he might come neer <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> Pallace, and see her as often as she went to, or came from hunting.

                     </gap>s not hard for you to imagine the brave meditations he had in this attending and expectation. Sometime he made a comparison betwixt himselfe and the wounded Deare. Sometimes he accused the Stagge of more than a brutish stupidity, to flye the glory of being pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by one of <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> shafts, and oftentimes wished him in his place. With how much joy (said he) would <hi>I</hi> receive the death thou flyest from, and how happy would I esteeme my Fate, if, being wounded as <hi>I</hi> am by <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> darts, I durst promise my selfe to dye, as thou must, at the feet of that Princesse. Surely if in that desireable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I were seen to shed any teares, they should be teares of joy, and my sobs should be so many thanksgivings to that faire hand, which should take me from among the living. After some two houres almost of his thus intertaining himselfe, he heard a noise, and turning his head the way whence it came, saw a great Stag in a rutt way, that went quite crosse the Forrest from one end to the other.

But who are you (said she) for it seemes you are not of my followers? <hi>Polexander</hi> twice or thrice, had a desire to tell her, she knew not all that were hers. But his discretion not suffring him to take that boldnesse, he answered, that he was a stranger, and not long since by a happy ship-wrack throwne a shoare on her Island. At those words, <hi>Alcidiana</hi> considering him better then she had done: I think (said she much surpriz'd) I have already seen you, but under another habit, then that you were now. <hi>Polexander</hi> was much troubled at it, because he durst not avow that truth, and yet fear'd to wrong himselfe, if he did not confesse it. But many of <hi>Alcidiana's</hi> Ladyes, and some Huntsemen, (at that instant) comming in, redeem'd him from that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Hereupon the Queen arose, and all the rest alighting: thank this Shepheard (said she to her Ladies) but for his courage, you had found <hi>Alcidiana</hi> as ill handled as her Paifray. With that, the Nymphes environ'd <hi>Polexander,</hi> and after they had given him thankes proportionable to the merit of his action, began to praise him; this his good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, another his advantageous stature, this, his beauty, that his youth; and all were of opinion, he had nothing of the Shepheard but the Clothes, and apparent simplicity.</p>
                  <p>The Vice Roy had no intent to breake off his discourse here, and <hi>Zelmatida</hi> ravished with this beginning expected the sequell with a great deale of impatiency. But suddenly there fell such a violent raine, that to obtaine a satisfaction; He was obliged to returne to the Pallace with the Vice Roy.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">Z</seg>Elmatida staid not till he came to his lodgings, that the Vice-roy might the sooner goe on with his discourse which the storme had interrupted. And meeting Garruca as he entred his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; my friend (said he) thou maist well repent thee for not walking with us. Thou hast lost the bravest relation in the world; for Pimantus hath recounted to me a part of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Polexanders life. Truely, imagination how inventive soever, can finde out nothing beyond the prodigies of valour and judgement, which have accompanied the tendrest years of that Prince. I will relate them to thee at leasure, and to make thee more desire it, I would have thee heare the sequell of the bravest adventure in the world. After he had thus spoke he entred into his privy chamber with Pimantus and Garruca, and seating them neere him, Father (said he) turning to the Vice-roy, let me know I beseech you, with what recompence did Alcidiana acknowledge the great service Polexander did her. It was incomparable (said the Vice-roy) at least if the King my Master may be believed. Alcidiana calling him to her, asked m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He answered the Princesse, he was borne in one of the fortunate Islands, that the condition of his Predecessors was not without eminency, and had alwaies made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of armes. For himselfe, he had beene naturally enclined to follow their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and though he found in the mediocrity of his fortune sufficient not to envy the greatest: Yet an ardent desire to attaine to honour by difficult wayes, had made him leave his Countrey, and to search among the perrills of warre, and the sea, somewhat that might satisfie his ambitious humour. That at first he had not found things as he i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, and by an impetuosi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But being miraculously conducted by her to that honour he had alwaies desired, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned his guilty impatiences, and by a just repentance turned into acts of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at his distrusts and repinings. For to what greater honour (said he) could that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power which governes our adventures raise me, then that I receive this day, to heare my selfe praised by the sweetest tongue of the world? At those words Alcidiana smiled, and turning to one of her Ladies called Amintha: Confesse (said she) that all the politnesse and civility is not confind to our Island: Since I have beene convicted both by mine eyes and eares; I must needes give over the being too Idolatrous of mine owne Countrey, and stripping my selfe of part of that love I beare it, confesse that this stranger is able to impose a great deale of envy on the bravest men of your Kingdome. Alcidiana breaking that discourse, began againe what she had left, and addressing her to Polexander. Let us know your resolution (said she) and whether wee can oblige
<pb facs="tcp:54727:124"/>
you to make any stay in this Isle? Madam (replide the King my Master) I have learnt being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ges, soveraignely to determine of the fortune of private men, and for those of a meane degree, not to propose to themselves any thing but the glory of obeying them. This being granted, (Madam) it belongs to your Majesty to pronounce (if you please) what you have resolved of my fortune, and to me, to receive the commands you shall please to impose on me, as Lawes written in heaven it selfe. If I were your lawfull Princesse (replied Alcidiana) you have reason to speake as you doe; but having no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power over you then what you give me your selfe, I cannot with justice exercise any Soveraigne Authority over you.</p>
               <p>Polexander with a great reverence, making appeare to the Princesse he knew all that obsequiousnesse and respect obliged him to: I humbly beseech your Majesty (said he) to be pleased that I contradict your opinion, and remember you how particular men cannot lessen, nor suspend the right of Kings, and by consequence that they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies invested with that absolute power which the Lawes both divine and humane have inseperably fastned to their condition: And in what liberty soever nature gives us birth, wee lose that priviledge of birthright, as soone as wee are out of that limits of our native soyle, and dare enter on that which is subject to the sweet authority of Kings.</p>
               <p>'Tis to no purpose (replied Alcidiana) to take armes against your selfe; and denounce so cruell a warre against your freedome; for I accept not the evidence you produce to your owne prejudice, and cannot doe lesse then preserve that liberty which hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected my life. Yes, you are free, and a liberty so priviledged, that it is at your choice to abide heere, or returne to your owne Countrey. But if you have an intent to live in this Kingdome, you may promise to your selfe from our just sensibility, all that the greatnesse of your service hath cause to hope for. Our Pallace shall be open to you, no audience shall be denyed you, and by a very particular exemption, it shall be even per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to be sometimes of our association, and to our sports. The Princesse Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot comming, as she ended her speech, she went into it, and losing the memory of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard she had run, returned to the Pallace, I know not with what joy, more quicke and lively then that she was accustomed to shew.</p>
               <p>That Lady amongst the rest which I named Amintha, made a particular compliment to our shepheard, and told him that if he had neede of her, he should know she could be and was a good friend. Polexander gave her many humble thankes, and very proud of his good fortune, returned to finde Alcippus. He related to him what had betided, but it was done so disturbedly, and out of order: so many interrogations nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and so much distraction, that Alcippus perceived the Prince not to be at all where he was.</p>
               <p>My friend (said he to him) sighing from the bottome of his heart; why wert not thou spectator of my glory? O Heaven! How faire is Alcidiana! What a grace, what a Majesty, what a height of courage! If thou hadst seene her in the danger I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her, thou wouldest confesse she hath nothing of her sex, but what it hath of rare and beautifull. Certainely she is incomparable, and whosoever can resist her charmes may brag (but to his shame) that instead of a heart, he carries within him a cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible stone. I see well now (answered Alcippus) that 'tis not lesse difficult to get out of this Island then to come into it: 'Tis farre worse, replide Polexander, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially for me, for I sweare to thee, nothing but death shall be able to make me get from it. But (said Alcippus) what shall become of your followers? What shall the Queene you Mother doe? A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

My good mother hath preserved my estate during my first absence, and I hope she will doe it as well during my second. And if to assist her she have neede of a new Alcippus, I hope she may yet finde some one in my Kingdome. I hope no lesse then your Majesty (said Alcippus) and besides promise to my selfe, that if you will make good use of your

fortune, you will not repent you for loving the fairest creature of the world. How ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily (replyed the Prince) doest thou passe from one extremity to another. But lately thou madest me feare even to the least accidents of life; for so I call the disorders that may happen in my fortune, and now thou wouldest have me promise my selfe such greatnesse and heights, that it would trouble the most disordered and unbridled ambition to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. But without flattring my selfe with any hope, without proposing any end to what I undertake: Know Alcippus, that I will right on, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Their Host, from whom familiarity had no way taken any thing of his first courtesie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> came to meet them with a countenance that openly witnessed the content he received in their aboade, and asked whether they had well acquitted themselves in their pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ship of being shepheards? Polexander, unwilling to have his passion knowne, answered the old man, that Alcippus was sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough to please himselfe in the case of a pastorall life. But for himselfe, his blood was too hot, and he too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uch affected noise and action, to put on a resolution of slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or meditating all day long. The old shepheard laughed heartily at that answere, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mbracing Polexander. You are in the right said he, 'tis for gray haires, and chill bloods to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

The old shepheard replied, he had not heard of that accident, and intreated the slave to relate to him something of it. The slave presently satisfied him, &amp; the shepheard streight thought Polexander had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from him the best adventure of his journey.

You might see on it that in the midst a Phenix on her funerall pile, and the workeman had so wittily made use of the faire lustre of that Diamond, that it seemed, the bird was not only in midst of the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> should be more miraculous then her birth. The slave thinking Polexander sought for somewhat else there: A Lady (said he) of the Queenes, called Amintha, gave me this boxe, and in delivering it, charged me to tell you there wanted the principall ornament, which was the Princesse picture; but it was a gratification you ought not to demand, since the Queene for some reason or scruple, only knowne to her selfe, would never suffer her picture to be taken. After this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the King my Master, having nought else to doe but his humble thanksgiving put in use all that he knew of the Countrey language, and taking from his finger the great Diamond he would have given his Hoste, with a great many excuses put it on one of the slaves.</p>
               <p>The man never thought Polexander had beene of a condition able to give Presents of importance. He therefore tooke his Diamond as a thing of small value, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a resolution to make Alcidiana merry at sight of the shepheards liberality. But when he was returned to the Pallace, and had at leasure considered his Diamond, he could not believe what he saw, but imagined there was either some illusion or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in Polexanders liberality. He came and gave an accompt to Amintha of his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to make her laughe, told her in shewing the Ring, that he had beene payd for
<pb facs="tcp:54727:125"/>
his paines in shepheards coyne. The Lady tooke the Ring, and the luster of it streight striking her sight; what (said she all amaz'd) hath the stranger given you this Diamond? Yes Madam, said the slave smiling. Doe not laughe replide Amintha, for assure your selfe, you have the fairest Diamond in the Kingdome. This Stranger must needes be more then he seemes. Tis the present of a King, and no ordinary person; and I tell you plainely betwix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> us two, the Queenes boxe is not worth much more then this Ring. She went presently to the Princesse, and related to her at large all the civilities and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions whereby Polexander received her Present. Besides, (said she) I am to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint your Majesty with one thing, which may no lesse astonish you, then the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers valour.</p>
               <p>What is it said Alcidiana? See (replide Amintha) and withall shewed her the slaves Diamond, and told her 'twas Polexanders gift. The Queene stood amazed, and after some silence; I see (said she) wee have not to doe with a man that contents himselfe with a little: I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> wee consider what he hath bestowed on Pallantus, 'twill be a shame for us to offer him lesse then a Crowne. Whilst the Princesse talked thus of Polexander; he by his extraordinary joy made knowne he was not so hard to be contented as she i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined. As he had beene tide by the eyes, he stood gazing on the present, and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an amarous illusion, found shut up in a little boxe, all the greatnesse and treasure of the Universe.</p>
               <p>He invited his Hoste to take part in his glory. He called Alcippus, sent for Diceus, and thinking himselfe unable to expresse alone, what he felt, commanded them never to give over publishing his most happy fortune. Their fullnesse of joy was not silent in so faire an occasion of speech. They extold the Princes happinesse beyond it selfe, and spoake wonders of Alcidiana's beauty and magnificence. But when they would have gone from her prayses to Polexanders, and make it appeare that if his fortune were good, his merit was no lesse; he called them flatterers, imposed them silence, and said, that the most extraordinary desert could not without impudence have any value, or to be thought on neere Alcidiana. He so much forgot himselfe in this discourse, that his Host, who had beene one of the finest Courtiers of his time, imagined the Prince was not mooved to speake as he did by the sole motive of Alcidiana's liberality. And Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander as soone caught himselfe in his fault, but 'twas too late: For when he would faine have shifted it from his Hoste, and made him believe Alcidiana's presence had beene cause of all these praises: I believe (replied the wise old man) that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e Queenes liberality doth not displease you; but I am much deceived, if her beauty doth not more neerely touch you. It happened to Polexander that which usually betides all Lovers, which are discovered in their subtleties. He blushed, and but for the darkenesse of the place where he was, he had confirmed his Host in the opinion he had of him. In this manner ended a day that had beene so favourable to Polexander. The very next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he cast off his shepheards habit, and as he was ready to goe to the Queenes Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, he understood she had suddainly left the Countrey, on the receipt of most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant newes, and was returned to the City of Arzilea, which is the Capitall of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that her presence might strangle a revolte that was ready to breake forth. Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders first motions were such as you may fancy in a yong Prince, amorous and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly valiant. But they were moderated by the second, and all that reason permitted him to wish; was that there might chance some great occasion wherein he might make shew how much he affected the Queene. This prayer or wish was just, and it was heard. For a small time after, one of the greatest Lords of the Kingdome, called Siziphus, who had before beene convicted of an attempt against the Queenes owne person, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the field with a mighty Army, and colouring his rebellion under a pretext that the State was not governed according to the ancient manner, made all good men see he openly aspired to a Tyranny.</p>
               <p>Alcidiana looking on his rebellion as on a Monster never before seene in her State, accused her indulgency and mercy as the causes of it, and by consequence, judged, that to cut it from any further life, she was to make use of her utmost justice. She called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Officers of her Crowne, and in their presence, gave command to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of her armes, to goe meete the Rebells, and hinder her people from suffring any
<pb facs="tcp:54727:125"/>
violence. These orders were executed with so much speede and trust, that before Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziphus was come out of his Province, he saw him stopped by an Army halfe as strong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine as his. He shewed in that occasion, he knew how to make warre, for instead of precipitating himselfe inconsiderately to a fight, he intrenched his Army in a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious place, and secured his back with the Towne, whose name he carried, and because he could draw thence all he needed for the sustenance of his Troopes, those of Alcidiana's party, saw themselves inforced to stay a long time encamped before the Enemy.</p>
               <p>Polexander was no sooner assured of this warre, but he sent for me from the place where I had so long attended him, and putting himselfe into an equipage farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a private man rode towards the Army. He had learnt of many the affection Sizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sall, the ill successe of that enterprice; and lastly the pardon Alcidiana gave him, after his being condemned to dye, as guilty of high treason. All this made him thinke on Syziphus, not only as a Traytour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull; But as a Rivall. He therefore thought, that if he could by the way of honor make an end of that, he should all at once, get the good liking of Alcidiana's Subjects, save the Princesse a second time, and gloriously give satisfaction both to his love and jealousie. As soone as he came into the Army, he went to the Generall, and making himselfe knowne by the badges Alcidiana had given him, ingaged the Grandies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine him as a personage of extraordinary and high estimation. Some dayes after, he communicated his designe to the Generall, and getting his approbation, obtained permission to challenge Syziphus. The King at Armes was commanded to goe to the Campe of the Rebell and his Companions, and not to neglect any thing that might adde to the reputation of Polexanders defiance. I yet remember the challenge he sent by the Herauld. Twas thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Stranger <hi>Polexander,</hi> to <hi>Syziphus</hi> thrice a Rebell.</head>
                  <p>AMbition is alwaies guilty, but not ever modest. All Lawes condemne Tyrants; yet there have beene many of them seene who by their dangerous magnanimity have exempted themselves from that condemnation. This Syziphus tells thee, that when any hath violated the Law, and troden Justice under foote, it behooves him by a famous death, or some great event to deliver himselfe both from the power of Law and justice: In the meane time, poore ambitious man, in lieu of following those proude tyrannicall Maximes, thou hast imitated the proceedings of common Theeves. Thou hast lost thy courage with thy hopes; thou hast shamefully begged pardon for a crime thou wert not able to perpetrate, and thy infamy is come to that height, thou hast been seene to implore with teares, her pity whose justice thou hadst (newly) most brutish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked. After this unmanlinesse, I doe not believe there is left thee any sence of honour. Yet I will adventure this challenge, to see whether I am deceived, and if thou hast not lost all thy courage with thy integrity, thou wilt come with thy armes to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thy selfe of those crimes this State accuseth thee by my Pen.</p>
                  <p>Syziphus received the challenge with a fury unworthy a man of courage, and yet to testifie he had enough, he accepted it, and told the Herauld that the next morning he would be in the Meadow betweene the two Armies, to make knowne by the death of one of his enemies, what he had prepared for the rest. The ensuing morne at breake of the day, there was proclaimed a truce on both sides for six houres only, and yet both sides for feare of being surprised stood on their gards.</p>
                  <p>At the houre of combate, the two Rivalls came out of their quarters, and presented themselves in the field with such armes as Cavaliers were wont to make use of in the
<pb facs="tcp:54727:126"/>
like duels. Polexander after his invocation of Alcidiana and love, came amaine on Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziphus, and incountered him with such a force, that it seemed the power of those Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities he had called on, had with their power effectively assisted him. Syziphus retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from his amazement, tooke him to his sword, and came up to Polexander with all the resolution of a man of courage. The victory was a while doubtfull, but at last it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the just side. Syziphus covered with wounds growne desperate at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>is ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and tortured by the remorse of conscience, let himselfe fall at the feete of his Conquerour, to oblige him to give him his life; and confessed (with weakenesse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) the crimes whereof he had long since beene convicted. Polexander bounded his revenge within the confession of that timerous ambitious man; but he strove in vaine to preserve his life, for he dyed on the place, and by a ficklenesse too ordinary in Armies, that of Syziphus no sooner saw him dye, but renouncing any other party then Alcidiana's, sent Deputies to treate with the Generall. The accord was not hard to be made, since they demanded nothing, but that all might be forgotten which was past, and every man might returne to his owne home, without feare of being inquired after. As soone as the Treaty was signed, the intrenchments which seperated the two Armies were slighted, and before 'twas night, it had beene a hard matter to meet with any of those that were of Syziphus party.</p>
                  <p>This important newes was sent to Alcidiana, and with so much diligence, that the next morning as she went to the Temple, the Post presented the Generalls letter to her; she looked earnestly on the Messenger before she opened them, and reading in his countenance the good newes he brought. What, Syziphus is beaten, said she to the Gentleman? Yes Madam (he replied) but an extraordinary way. The Queene her self broke open the packet, and according to her manner, would reade the letters without referring her selfe to the fidelity of her Secretaries of State. She heard of the Kings challenge, the combate he had with Syziphus, and in briefe, all that I have related. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had ended her delightsome reading: All powerfull and all good Diety (cried she) into whose hands I have committed the fortune both of my State and my selfe, well may I call the day wherein the stranger Polexander landed in this Kingdome, the day of thy love and blessing! What act of thankes, Invisible Sun, what offrings can acquit me from that miracle which thy goodnesse hath pleased to shew f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This ejaculation of her heart ended, she turned to those which followed her, and without discovering any excessive joy, come (said she) let us goe and give thankes to heaven for the victory wee have obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is the more admirable, since it hath cost no mans life, but that of the publique enemy. At those words there was a kinde of a humming noise, declaring the joy every one b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>d of so happy an event, and the desire to know the particularities, which were published, as soone as Alcidiana had done her devotion, and were intertained with so generall a contentment, that all shops were shut up, and all the Temples open as on some solemne festivall day.</p>
                  <p>Polexander, who had not beene knowne but by some persons of quallity for his first service done to the Queene, by this second made himselfe to be taken notice of the meanest of the people. His name was in the mouth of every one. They called him the tutelare Angell of their Queene and State, and some even proclaimed that he was the powerfull Protector, which the prophesies promised the Kingdome under the name of a slave. Whilst these rumours ran among the people, Alcidiana, (retired with Amintha) was assaulted by many different thoughts. You judged well (said she to her Confident) when you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ought this stranger was more then he seemed. For mine owne part, when I call to minde the Majesty which shines in his face, the discretion and courtesie that have made him so well esteemed by us, and those two actions he hath undertaken by an absolute effect of his generosity; I certainely believe him to be some great Prince, who to gaine renowne to his valour, and fill the world with the report of his wonders, thus travells through strange Countries. What thinke you of it Amintha? Your Majesty knowes well enough (replied the Lady) that it was my first opinion. That which he hath done against Syziphus addes nothing to the conceipt I had of him. I believed him at first sight as couragious as he is, and if your Majesty permit me to extend my selfe a
<pb facs="tcp:54727:126"/>
little beyond what is fitting, I will take the boldnesse to tell you, that heaven in retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of your good deedes, hath sent you this man, who possibly is the sole man on earth that is worthy to serve you. See, (said Alcidiana blushing) one of the pleasants fantasies that Amintha shall have in her life time. You are a foole, believe me, and thanke Syziphus for my pardoning your idle digression. I know how far you were his enemy, and by consequence should understand that the newes of his death is able to make you lose a part of your discretion. But let's talke of somewhat else. In your judgement, how should I behave my selfe towards our Liberator, and what fortune can I offer him, which may acquit my debt? One word from your Majesty (answered Amintha) may with usury pay all that the stranger hath done for you and your State. You are (may be) more in the right then you are aware of, replied the Queene; for I see not how any can pay otherwise then by words and actions of thankes, a man who makes a profusion of riches, and contemnes what others adore. After many the like words used by Alcidiana, she went to dispatch the Post which came from the Army, and by her answere to the Lievtenant Generall, not only commanded him to treate Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander as her owne person, but also to bring him to her as soone as businesse would permit it.</p>
                  <p>The Courtier returned with as much speede as he came, and by his returne obliged Polexander to prepare himselfe for the receiving the reward of his victory from Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana's owne hands. The Lievtenant Generall after the performance of all his charge, thought wholely of giving the King my Master all the honour prescribed him by the Queenes letters. They marched off with part of the Army, and I may truely tell you, that at that journey was a continuall triumphe. The Countrey people came to meet us, that they might have the content of seeing their Redeemer. The Inhabitants of Townes far distant from their high-way, came thither with presents, and he thought himselfe unfortunate, that had not the happynesse to be looked on by Polexander. In divers places wee meet with erected Altars, and sacrifices prepared to doe our Prince the more honour, and some more free, and daring then the rest, said aloud, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the disastrous allyance where withall Alcidiana was threatned by the prophesies, she ought to resolve to marry with Polexander. After eight or ten dayes in this manner, wee came to Arzilea. Never did the King my Master shew himselfe as he did that day. His presence, his beauty, accompanied with the richnesse of his habit, made him admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all, and (as wee knew a long while after) Alcidiana could not refraine from say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Amintha, that the stranger would never have what he deserved, if he had not one day on his head one of the fairest Crownes in the world. In that (replide Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha) you may either perfect what fortune hath begun, or doe Polexander that justice which she enviously denies him.</p>
                  <p>At those words, Alcidiana could not refraine from blushing, and intimating she tooke no pleasure in Amintha's freedome, she forbad her to talke to her any more of Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander but when she gave her leave. This rigourous Law being thus established, Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana went out of the chamber where she had seene Polexander passe, and retired to be fitly dressed to receive him. At the houre appointed by her for that Ceremony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, her great Chamberlaine, and the Captaine of her slaves, attended by all that were under their command, came to the place where our King alighted, and the complements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing passed, told him they came from the Queene to accompany him to his audience. This was done with a great deale of order and ceremony. But when Polexander was come to the foote of Alcidiana's Throne, and that he saw her fairer, and of more luster then all the jewells that even covered her, all his boldnesse, courage, and reason for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke him. He blushed, he grew pale, and as if his victory had been a matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and shame, he was seased on by a confusion, and moved with such a trembling as all the Court marked it; so did the Queene as well as others; but faining not to take notice of it, she witnessed by a well studied speech, the obligation all her people had to Polexanders courage, and at last addressing her to himselfe, told him that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not how to reward an action that was beyond all ballancing, she intreated him to give her the meanes not to live ingratefull. Amintha, that by chance was hard by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, without doubt was afraid lest his disturbance should last; and therefore spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb facs="tcp:54727:127"/>
for most commonly 'twas by her that Alcidiana made knowne her pleasure, she thanked the King my Master for the death of Syziphus, and suppressing the insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so far extended her selfe in his praise, that she threw him againe into his former confusion. Yet he spake, and though he said very little, and that fearefully, he came (notwithstanding) off that action to the good liking of those who wished to see him pestered.</p>
                  <p>That publick audience was seconded by a private one, wherein Polexander had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an incomparable content, had he beene powerfull enough to have mastered his passion. But such a temper was not to be expected from a minde that suffred under the extreamest intemperancy. The cause of it increased by the addition of Alcidiana's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; and 'tis no wonder if the effects redouble. Neverthelesse they hindred not this passionate Lover from holding his part well in his conversation with Alcidiana and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha. He made the third, and so readily disintricated himselfe from that Laborinth, where all things combinde to lose him, that Alcidiana had no cause to lessen the good opinion she had conceived of him. The next day she sent him by the same slave who brought him the Diamond boxe, the expeditions of the Principality which Syziphus formerly possessed. But he refused them with such excuses and modesty as might have satisfied the Queene: But yet she was not, and absolutely would have Polexander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her present, that she might not alwaies remaine obliged to him. Amintha was imployde to get him to accept it, and she made so good use of her eloquence, that the King my Master consented, and tooke the gratification. But he never made use of it, for as long as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But when he saw his brother dead, he changed his resolution, and desperately casting away his vizard of dissimulution, concluded he would be talked of. To this end he thought no better pretext was to be chosen, then the avenging his brothers death. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry privately he sent a Gentleman of his to Polexander, and giving him to understand to what sensibility the death of his brother obliged him, laid before him his own generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that should not refuse any content to those whom had offended. Polexander no sooner received the challenge, but he prepared to give it a satisfaction. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus, and giving him order for what was necessary for the com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>at, went forth secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the Gentle man,</p>
                  <p>Alcippus came to them at the place Polexander appointed, and without distrusting one another came all three where Tantalus expected them. At first sight he made shew of a great courage and much hope, and spoake so loftily, and altogether with so much falcity of his brothers death, that Polexander forgetting his usuall patience, told him in heate, that he wondred how he had so long time lingered, and not sooner beene sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this pretended murther, and with that drew his sword, and ingaged Tantalus to give over his revilings. As soone as Alcippus, saw them ready, he told the Gentleman who brought the challenge, that 'twas not honorable for them to be idle, whilst their Masters were so busied. The words stirred the generousnesse of the Gentleman, which by a dangerous consequence cost him his life. Polexander and Tantalus were the while hard at it, and because they fought on horseback, they had not so soone done as their seconds. Yet had Tantalus received three woundes, and Polexander thinking himselfe too much satisfied, intreated him to thinke on his safety, and to believe there was no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>oule play in the death of his brother. But Tantalus had done too much to stop till he had ended. He passed furiously on Polexander, and in passing gave him a wound which he thought would have ended the combat. Indeede the wound was great, for it went quite through the Kings arme, but 'twas neither mortall nor dangerous. The generous Prince finding himselfe wounded, renewed his strength and courage, and sheathing
<pb facs="tcp:54727:127"/>
his sword in Tantalus side, let out from his heart at once both his pride and life. The unfortunate man was not falne from his horse, when Alcidiana's Lievtenant Generall, her great Chamberlaine, and many other Lords came to their place of combat. They blamed Tantalus unjust resentment, and bewailed his misfortune. But those two things not much troubled them, they rejoyced with Polexander for his last victory. As he gave them thankes for their affection, they saw his arme all bloody, and thinking him sore hurt, made shew of all the forwardnesse, and double diligence that Courtiers use when there is any service to be done to a man in the Princes favour. Polexander assured them 'twas nothing, and though he would gladly have returned to the City without so much company, yet for feare of offending any, he was forced to undergoe that punishment. Before he came to a great causeway which crosseth the Lake in which Arzilea is built, there were assembled so many people to see him passe, that he could scarce get into the Towne. Every one called him the invincible, the Exterminator of Rebells; and mothers with their fingers shewing him to their children, told them, that for all their happinesse they were obliged to that Prince his valour. At last he got to his lodging, and all a voyding, to leave him at liberty: Diceus unclad him, looked on his wound, and having stopped the blood, applied the first dressing. With much a doe he got him to his bed; but as soone as he was laid, pondering on his action, and fearing lest Alcidiana might thinke he sought occasions to be talked of, would needes excuse it to her by a letter.</p>
                  <p>Presently he writ, and giving it to Alcippus, commanded him to deliver it to Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha, and be seech her in his name to do those good offices for him to the Queene, which he expexted from her noblenesse. Alcippus performed his Commission, and earnestly pressing the Lady to tell him what his Master might hope: All (replied she) provided he mistrust his good fortune. Alcippus was wary enough of relating her speech to his Master, for feare his explaining it to his owne disadvantage, might give him more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous woundes then that which made him keepe his chamber. In the meane time A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha did her best endeavour for the Princes contentment. The very next day she gave him a proofe of it, which raised him to the height of happinesse and glory, if the follies of Lovers deserve to unfold them, the use of tearmes so noble and serious. For that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy came to him from Alcidiana. In the name of the Princesse, she made proffers to him a thousand times more considerable then the Principality she had given, and intreating him to hasten his cure, that he might himselfe be Judge of the recompence his virtue deserved, delivered into his hands Alcidiana's answere to his letter. You may imagine whether so speciall a remedy did not extraordinarily operate on our Patient. Had every word been as powerfull as the Magicians most mysterious spells, and all the Characters equalized the virtue of those which force dead bodies from their graves, and call soules out of hell, they could not have wrought greater prodigies, nor produced more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull alterations, by the hidden virtue of five or six lines, Polexander had lost all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of himselfe. He not only thought he was invulnerable, but immortall, and in that extasie, promised no lesse to absent Alcidiana, then the laying of all the Crownes of the earth at her feete.</p>
                  <p>Amintha; leaving him in this amourous heate, went questionlesse to tell the Queene, what miracles she had done by her answere. The Princesse continued them by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall sending to visit her Defender; and Diceus noted it in the supernaturall healing his Masters wounde. One day he told him, that indeede his hand dressed the wounde, but certainely (said he) 'tis cured by the secret virtue of Alcidiana's. Polexander was pleased with Diceus fancy, and confessed to his Chyrurgion that the honour he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Queene did sensibly forward his health. As soone as he left his chamber, he went to the Pallace, and being permitted the entrance to Alcidiana's Sanctuary (if I may speake as foolishly as amorous people use to doe) ne found her in that fashion, which (by his only relation to me) I thought capable to touch even insensibility. She had layd by her habit and dresse of Ceremony, and in putting it off, disrobed her selfe of that stately and awefull Majesty which made all to cast downe their lookes that gazed on her. Love, sweetnesse, delicacy, and the graces had taken her place, and seemed to be expresly met together to sport themselves about the Princesse. Her habit lesse jealous
<pb facs="tcp:54727:128"/>
of her beauties then that was wont, laid open to Polexander those treasures which till then he could not see, but by the helpe of imagination. Her neck was bare, and if for forme it passed all the study and examination of the most famous Statuaries, for white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it obscured the very pearles, and cast raies of light, and such shining flashes, that Polexander confessed he stood dazeled with it. He cast downe his sight to recover it, but love maliciously stopped it, now on an arme, and then on her hand, which by their beauties and allurements seemed to dispute with the other parts of that wonder the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of blinding all beholders. At last confessing himselfe absolutely overcome, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his armes at the Princesse feete, she gave him his life, and to make it appeare that she tooke care of his preservation, asked him whether he were cured of his wounde. The King answered, that though it had beene mortall, the experiments of her excessive goodnesse had beene of power to have healed him. I should be very ingratefull (said she) if my service drawing you so often to the hazarding your life, I should not be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for its preservation. Yes, I am, and would have the world know, that I have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular vigilancy over it, and that my obligations to you are so great, that I thinke not my selfe of ability enough to acquit my selfe worthily of them. The more I consider what you have done for my people, and my selfe; the more am I in doubt whether my debt be greater to you as Queene, or as Alcidiana. Madam, you, both as Queene, and as Alcidiana so confound and disorder me (replied Polexander) that I can hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a little judgement to cleere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I believe you have seene that fatall portraict which cost the valiant Almanzor his life, and many other Knights. The King my Master possessing that piece, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing else to desire but the possession of Alcidiana her selfe; so far forgot him in his good fortune, that he was often tempted to present him to the Queene, and to make knowne his aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>To alter his determination, she proposed to him the petitioning her permission to be one of her slaves. He had long time before a desire to it, and was even ravished that he could please her: Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

whereinto his impatiency, and the excesse of his good fortune had plunged him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appeare againe in company, and to the Court. The Queene at that time had made a progresse to the most distant Provice of her Kingdome, and at her returne came to one of her houses, built in a Forrest, which they call the Forrest of white Hyndes. Whilst she abode there, Polexander had once more the happinesse to save her life; for the Princesse being gone a hunting, and Amintha desirous to drive her Chariot, the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses either affrighted, or ill guided, tooke their bits in their teeths, hurryed the Chariot cleane crosse the fields, and if Polexander had not happily arrived, and turned them by his voice and clamour, they were even running headlong downe a precipice, where all must needes have beene torne in pieces. The Chariot was overturned very neere the downefall, and what with the bruise and the feare, Alcidiana and Amintha lay as dead in the field. The King ran presently to them, and being not able to succour but one at once, tooke Alcidiana, and carried her all in a swounde to her Pallace. For Amintha she quickly came to her selfe, and returned without neede of any assistance. When the Queenes Physitians had by their gentle remedies, recalled those spirits which her fall and feare had dispersed, she seemed not to remember any more the accident that was betided her, and desirous to know all the particulars of that, ingaged Amintha to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them.</p>
                  <p>Since (said she) I had my part in the mischance and affright, I can only tell your Majesty, your horses were stronger then I, and not being used to my voice and guidance, they would obey neither; but fling away with me in spight of my resistance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Polexanders helpe they were hurrying your Majesty downe the precipice of the Cedars.</p>
                  <p>O stranger! (cried the Queene) fatall for my preservation, will fortune never leave furnishing thee with occasions to oblige me? She commanded they would leave her to her rest, and retaining none but Amintha with her, she kept her bed two or three dayes, and would see none but her women. When she thought her selfe as perfectly well as before her fall, she sent for Polexander, and with a becomming grace accusing him of all the accidents had betided her; I cannot doubt any longer (said she) after so many strange events, but that you hold intelligence with fortune, and that from time to time you command her to throw me into new dangers, to the end you may have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of freeing me. Polexander answered very respectively to so pleasant and nice a speech, and after was with the Princesse as he had lived before his retreate and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
                  <p>Alcidiana being returned to Arzilea, our Prince was strucken with such a dulnesse of spirit, or bewitched by the philters and magicall practises of an old woman called Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelica, that he forgot his affection to Alcidiana, and seemed to desire no other happines then the enjoying that Sorceresse. He gloried in that prodigious change, he spoke of nothing but Stenelica, he talked dayly and hourely of that old womans virtues, writ to her twice or thrice a day, satiated her with presents, and sometimes making use of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus, and then of me to continue that commerce, imposed on us a rigourous silence, whensoever wee offred to speake to him according to our wonted liberty. This extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy (or if you will have it so) this false and mysticall shew beguiled us five or six moneths, and wee thought wee had Stenelica sure, and reduced her to satisfie Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, she broake with him, sent backe his jewells, and some of his letters, forbad him her house, and threatned to avenge her selfe of his mockery. At that time Alcidiana went from Arzilea, to a stately Castle built on a point of Land, opposite to the fortunate Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. At the foote of it is an unwalled Towne, and because there inhabit a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fishers, and other seafaring men, I had caused our ship to be brought about thither, to trim and fit her well againe for a voyage. When wee came thither, I went downe to the haven to see what was done to her, and found her very well rigged and repaired. Our Marriners that had kept still with her, were overjoyed to see me, and though they wanted nothing whatsoever; yet they made a shew to me of a great desire they had that Polexander would bring them back againe to their Islands. To put them in some hope, I said, the King would surely part ere long, and charged them to keepe their ship in readinesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54727:129"/>
Certainely wee must believe wee have domesticall spirits which continually watch about us, who drawing from the very fountaine that truth which is hidden from us, make it glide into us by some unperceivable channell. For if it were not so, how came it into my minde to give our Marriners such unlikely assurances, and against my owne beliefe, talke to them of Polexander's going away as of a thing resolved on? In the meane time there hapned a strange adventure, for two dayes after Amintha was stolen away by a Portugall Pirate, driven by a furious tempest on the inaccessible Island, and so cunningly taken away, that her rape was not heard on till she was far at sea. Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander no sooner heard of the accident, but he ran to the sea, and finding an armed barke at the Castles foote, got into it with Alcippus. His affection and generousnesse were very fatall to him; for they tooke from him the thought of the place he went from, and hindred him from considering that in losing sight of the inaccessible Island, he instantly lost the meanes of returning thither againe.</p>
                  <p>Diceus and I, thought the Prince might have neede of his men and ships, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee got aboard her, and commanded to set saile. The winde was extreame favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to us, and quickly brought us up to Polexanders barke. Alcippus knowing us as farre as he could kenne, and causing us to come neere, advised his Master to leave the barke, which he did, and comming aboard his owne vessell, spent all the rest of the day in chasing the Pirate, whom he had infallibly taken, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> the night had come on two hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res later. But the darkenesse taking him from our sight, he so absolutely stole away from our finding, that the nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> morning wee found our selves in full sea without sight of land or vessell. Polexander meditated long on what he should doe, at last the secret Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant of Alcidiana's charmes drawing him to the inaccessible Island, he commanded his Pilot to returne thither. 'Twas easier for him to command it, then for the Pilot to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey it.</p>
                  <p>He tooke his Elevation, curiously consulted with his Card and Needle, he would have returned by the same course he came forth, and thought surely that for this time Alcidiana's Isle should neither be inchanted or inaccessible. Yet for all this, after he had sailed all day, and kept him fast to his way all the following night, and so on till next noone, he found his art and paines unserviceable against the inchantments of Alcidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's Island. It failed but little when Polexander knew his misfortune that he had not throwne himselfe over board; but seeing himselfe withheld by our reasons; Well (said he) since you will have it so, I will live; but it shall not be for my selfe, for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to see Alcidiana againe; it shall be only for Amintha. Wee were three or foure dayes in doing nothing but whirling round that tempestuous sea, and attempting new waies to get sight of our inaccessible Island. The very winde was moved with the teares, and despaire of Polexander, and willing to moderate his griefe by some diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that might wholely take him up, cast him into such places where he met where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to exercise both his cholor and his valour. Some six dayes saile from Alcidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's Isle, if my supputation be right, there is in the way to those Isles which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents called Hesperides, another sufficiently great and fertile, out inhabited by people so barbarous, or rather so unreasonable, that of all Nations I have seene there is none so differing as they from the nature of man. The winde having driven us on the Coast of that savage Countrey; Polexander landed with fifteene or twenty of his men, but he was no sooner on shoare, when he saw a great company of those furious brutes. They never inquired his intention, they would not give him leave to speake, nor would they suffer him to retire peaceable backe againe; but on the contrary, making the aire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound with their dreadfull shreeks and shouts, they camefuriously on our small company, and after they had given a volley of flints and arrowes, made Polexander suspend his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall humanity, and repell force by force. He came up to them, his sword drawne, and with it layd foure or five on the earth. When he saw wee imitated his example without winning ought on those savages: retire (said he to us) and doe not imbrew your swords in the blood of these wretches. He had no sooner given that command, but he saw a yong Maiden, who running and stretching out her hands, besought him to take her into his protection, and save her from the fury of those mad men. His noblenesse made him streight alter his command. He made againe on those beasts in a humane shape,
<pb facs="tcp:54727:129"/>
and in spight of all their resistance, tooke from them the Maiden, whom they had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and staied in the midst of her course. He put her in my custody, and commanding me to see her a shipboard, staied with Alcippus, Diceus, and ten or twelve others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the enemy. By little and little he got to the sea, and gave command to his Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers to shoot among those savages. He was no sooner obeyed, but the Cannon scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred halfe of them in peeces about the strand, and the rest, to fly the more nimbly threw away their stones and arrowes, and hid themselves in great woods that came downe to the very shoare: As soone as the Prince was shipped againe, and had well laughed at our pleasant adventure, he desired to see the person he had given me in guard. I told him not who she was, but bringing her, he at first sight knew her, though she was disfigured with Sunburning, travell, hunger, and the outrages she received from those Barbarians. He shewed how joyfull he was for her deliverance; alas poore Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da (said he) by what accident fell'st thou into the hands of these Monsters? Is not thy Mistris there? Tell me (I prithee) where I may finde her, and what I may doe for her service.</p>
                  <p>'Twas Amintha's Maide, and had been forced away with her. As soone as she saw Polexander, she was like to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>lne to the ground, and being not able to speake, but after a long time: Ah my Lord (said she) how doth my good fortune amaze me! and how unable am I to tell you what you desire to know? Amintha did ever verily believe you would lose your selfe in striving to relieve her, and when her Ravisher gave her leave to be alone with me; the sole thing (would she say) of which I am most sensible, and chiefest to be thought lamented in my misfortune, is, that Polexander out of his generousnesse will not faile to engage himselfe in my disaster. He will leave our Isle to follow me, and never considering, that there is no returning when once he hath lost sight of it, will bootelesly adde his owne losse to mine. If thou lovest me (replied Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander) kill me not by these new proofes of Amintha's generous affection. Tell me who was her Ravisher, and whether he hath carryed her? My Lord (answered Elida) my Mistris is in the hands of a Portugall Pirate, who is no lesse mad then those you now came from.</p>
                  <p>Ambition and love have deprived him of more then halfe his reason, and yet hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough left to keepe him from being carried to the utmost violence against Amintha. A tempest throwing him upon the Isle of these inraged brutes, and necessity compelling him to land there, he went on shoare, and was received in the same manner as you. He lost many of his men, and was forced to put to sea againe in the height of the tempest. The aversion or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>islike I had to him, and the shewes I made him every moment of it, put him on to rid me away. He therefore by force plucking me out of my Mistris armes, barbarously exposed me to the fury of these incensed savages. I must needes relate to you the strange accidents which have bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ded me among these fooles. Thou shalt doe that another time, replied the King; but tell me now what is become of Amintha? That which I have told you (said she) may make you imagine I can certifie you nothing of my Mistris. Canst thou not at least (added Polexander) shew me as neere as can be, the way the Rover tooke? Even this same (replied she) and if I forget not, he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meete with other Pirates which have their place of refuge and retreate in an Isle of this sea. I know where '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>is (said the Prince) and presently commanded his Pilot to stand for the Islands of Cape Vert.</p>
                  <p>He was obeyed, and so happily that within few dayes after wee discovered the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of Africa, to which he was forced against his will by the winde and the currents, and staied there longer then he desired; for they were so much becalmed right against the flourishing shoares of the Kingdome of Senega, that for three dayes together his ship was as setled as it had beene turned into a rock. The remembrance of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse he had lost, and the vexations that continually followed him, fed then extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily on him. He disclosed those anxieties, impatiences and distasts, to which he had never beene knowne to be subject. He found fault with all, the calme was more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to him then the tempest, he would not even see Elida; and scarce could Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus and I draw him for a few moments out of this melancholy humour. There was but one thing that set him at rights, and 'twas the picture of Alcidiana. They talke of me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb facs="tcp:54727:130"/>
who (being possest by some ill spirits, and others distract of their reason) by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of musick have beene freed from those ill Demons, and cured of their madnesse; and I believe it to be true, since I saw Polexander above a hundred times get out of that fury which visibly possest him at the only aspect of Alcidiana's picture, and to take on his former wisdome, and usuall temper. But to the common misfortune of us all, that powerfull charme, that admirable counterpoyson, that Talismon more virtuous then all that are sold at Tunis and Morrocco: in a word, that picture (which is hard to believe) was taken out of Polexander's hands. During the calme whereof I have told you, he being much disquieted, and growing weary of his ship, made himselfe be ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed ashoare, and not desiring any company, no not Alcippus, there intertained his thoughts neere a Fountaine in the contemplation of the Queenes picture. 'Twas the last day of the calme, he came on shoare, and the sight of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>aire portraict, and his reading of some Arabian verses composed by him for the Princesse, brought him into a sleepe, and whilst he lay so at rest, a yong Prince called Almanzor (as long after wee learnt) by a fatall fortune was unluckily led to the place where the King my Master lay sleeping.</p>
                  <p>From a farre off he perceived his guilt armour, and knowing not what it might be, his curiosity drew him to approach as softly as he could. The King slept still, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceiving that famous boxe which Alcidiana had given him, staied to looke on the picture within it. He admired, was strucken, and became in love with it. Then ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up the paper wherein the Arabian verses were writ, and retiring without awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the King, got on his horse, and fled away as fast as he could spurre. Polexander (informed by his Guardian Angell) awakened in the very instant that Almanzor was on horseback, and heard the noise he made in flying, but his understanding and memory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not yet well cleered of those vapours which cause sleepe, had not the liberty, the one of reasoning on the present, and the other of what was passed. Yet remained he not long in this kinde of darkenesse. His soule opened her eyes as soone as those of his body were unshut. He remembred his boxe and his verses, and put his hand where he thought to finde them. But deceived in what he attempted, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e arose all startled, he sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon and about him, he turned whence he came, his eyes are fixed on the sands, he tosseth and turneth all the leaves and flints, and scratcheth and removeth the least leafe of grasse.</p>
                  <p>Then he be thought him of the noise he had heard, and said to himselfe, that what he had taken for the flight of a Lyon or some other beast, was that of the Theefe, which had carried away all the remainder of his treasure. He would faine have followed, but knew not what way to take. Yet he ran to the Mountaine, and being got very hye, whether goe I? (said he to himselfe) what doe I looke after? Will these deserts and forrests tell me newes of it? Presently he returned to the sea side, got into his shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loppe, and commanded the Marriners to carry him aboard his ship. As soone as he was there, he entred his Cabin without speaking to any of us, and casting him on his bed: Thou couldest doe me no other outrage; (said he) But cruell Fate, thou ruinest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>akest from me all that feare which hath so often made me have recourse to thy protection. Alcippus imagining by these words, that his Master had received some new displeasure, came neere and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him to make knowne the cause of his affliction. O friend (said Polexander) some one hath stolen from me Alcidiana's picture! Doe but reflect on that disaster, and oblige me no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> to unfold it to thee.</p>
                  <p>Alcippus, at first thought his Master talked idely; but hearing him a midst his sighes to cast forth the word of Theefe, of portraict, of Alcidiana, he thought (doubtlesly) the Prince had lost his boxe, and that the robbery of which he newely spoke was true indeede. He told it me, and I relating it to Diceus, it went quickly through the ship. One of our Marriners (at the same instant) saw a ship comming out of the River of Senega, and ignorant whether he spoke true or false, or whether he should speake it or no; cried out the theefe was running away, and 'twas fit they should make after him. The ship was thereupon made ready for the winde began to rise, and the sea men who
<pb facs="tcp:54727:130"/>
looke after nothing but confusion and prey agreeing with their companion, cried out with him that 'twas not fit to suffer the theefe to escape. Alcippus hearing these cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, came out of his Masters Cabin, and being told the cause of the noise, presently ran into Polexander to advertise him of it, and by that newes, false or true, drew him from his deadly melancholy.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon he left his Cabin, came on the deck, and understanding from whence the other ship came. Be confident (said he) that's the Theefe, follow him, and (if you love me) endeavour he may not escape us. Wee gave the ship chase three dayes and three nights, and comming up to her the fourth, engaged her to strike saile, and yeeld <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o our discretion. Polexander first boorded her, and offring his sword at the Commanders throat, told him there was no other way to save his life, but by restoring what he had stolne. I am ready to obey you said the prisoner; but remember (if you please) that I have but lent my hands, and an absolute power hath commanded me to undertake the theft.</p>
                  <p>Well, well (replied Polexander) restore it, 'tis no matter by whom it was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or acted, so I have restitution, and with that urged his prisoner to performe quickly what was required of him. The poore man, all pale and trembling, drew out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some a ring and a letter, and presenting the first to Polexander; see (said he) my Kings high prized Seale, and then giving him the letter: This is that (he added) which hath cost the death of the writer, and had we not beene met withall, and interrupted by you, was going to be the instrument o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> a more execrable Massacre. Polexander amazed at these things, and full of choller to see himselfe so far from his hopes; keepe thy letter and thy ring, said he to his prisoner, and give me the boxe thou stolest from me. The boxe which I have stolen, replied the prisoner? Ah, noble Sir, if it be your pleasure that I shall perish, doe not search for that pretext. I am guilty enough already, without the imputation of a crime whereof I am innocent. What (said Polexander exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly angry) didst thou not steale it whilst I sleept on the banckes of Senega? I perceive now, said the prisoner, that you take me for another, and truely 'tis an admirable act of the eternall Providence, which continually watcheth for the preservation of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents.</p>
                  <p>Doe then, (my Lord) doe what that commands you! Punish a traytour and assassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who to satisfie his ambition, hath exiled from his breast all sence of honour and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Polexander thought then he was certainly mistaken, and was at the point of setting the man at liberty; but considering that such a freedome might be the cause of some great wickednesse, he tooke the ring and letter which till then he had left in the hand of his prisoner, and made him come with him into his owne shippe, where not knowing what to doe further, bid his Pilot steere whither he pleased, for all courses were alike to him. Whilst Alcippus, the Pilot, and my selfe were consulting of the speediest way for our quick returne to the Canaries: Polexande passed the time with his prisoner, and required from him an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

from the blinde fury of the Father, and the sharpe sighted rage of his step-mother, who for a long time knew not what was become of the Childe; but her spies were so indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious that at last they discovered he was bred up in King Benin's Court. As soone as she heard it, she resolved his death, and chusing me for the executioner, or at least the prosecutor, she put in practice all that she knew might conduce to the perfecting of her damnable designe. She forced Zabaim to write to Benin for the delivering his Sonne into my hands, and in case he should refuse it, forced to denounce war against him.</p>
                  <p>You may easily see all this wickednesse proved when you please to read the letter I gave you. But in as much as the African Kings never make denuntiation of wars; but they send the Ring which is the principall note of their dignity, I found a way to steale it from Zabaim. Now, to tell you, after so many villanies, that which hath beene the cause of my being now your prisoner; know, I parted from Senega expressely on a message to King Benin, and if that Prince had delivered into my hands the lawfull heire of Senega, for certaine (blinded as I was with ambition) I had executed Zelopa's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and sheathed the sword I weare in the breast of that Innocent. Polexander af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at so horrible a relation, told his prisoner he gave thankes to heaven for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mistaken, and that in his misfortunes he found a great deale of consolation; since the divine goodnesse had vouchsafed to make use of his errour for the hindring the death of the Prince of Senega. It belongs to me, answered the prisoner, (throwing himself at our Princes feete) to give thankes to the fountaine of all mercy, for the enlightning my soule with the raies of his love in spight of my obduratnesse. I therefore make a vow not to abuse it any more, nor ever to returne into my Countrey till it be freed from Zelopa's tyranny. You shall doe very well, replied Polexander, and to quit you from the sorrowing for the losse of your fortunes by this resolution, I engage my selfe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to you.</p>
                  <p>The Prince infallibly had beene better then his word to him, but heaven seeing the holy and rigorous penitence of that sinner, was willing to recompence him more liberally then Polexander: For it tooke him out of this world, the very same day that wee arrived at the Canaries. I will not relate to you the sundry fights Polexander had with the Pirates, whilst wee strove to bring him back into his Kingdome. I will only tell you he was there no more happy then he was at sea. At his arrivall he heard of the death of the incomparable Axiamira. He bewailed her losse as much as it deserved, and after some moneths of mourning, from one part of piety <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ell to another. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed all his time in hearing the complaints of his Subjects, to reconcile their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and to free them from all feare of the Spanish forces. After all this, he deigned to cast his eyes on me, declared me his Vice-roy in all his Isles, and establishing me in that authority before his departure, commanded that in his absence, I should be obeyed as himselfe. Scarce tooke he any time of repose after so many travells and disquiets. Amintha's Confident, whom he had brought from the Islands of mad men, seeing him still to grieve for the losse of the picture, strive said she one day to get the thing it selfe, rather then the shadow. That thought (answered the Prince) comes on me a hundred times in a day, but I give no eare to it, because it proposeth to me a thing impossible. Tis so indeed (replied Elida) by ordinary meanes, but you must have recourse to such as are not so.</p>
                  <p>Alas! and what are those asked the Prince? I imagine to my selfe one (added E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lida) that seemes to me infallible. I prithee tell that me, said the King. It behooves you then (added Elida) either under pretext of religion or otherwise, to get entrance into the Isle of the Sun, and when you are permitted to abide there, stay for the comming of Lynceus or some other of Alcidiana's Pilots. I intend so much (sadly answered Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander) but when I have attempted it, what will be the issue for my consolation. I make it no difficulty to get into the Isle of the Sun, since it is never denied to such as come thither to sacrifice. And I may too stay there, nay and meete with those that come from Alcidiana's Island; but all this is nothing, for I am certaine, the Queenes Pilots will never receive me into their vessell. What ground have you for that feare, said Elida to him? From some what you have spoaken to me unawarres, replied Polexander. I thinke
<pb facs="tcp:54727:131"/>
I know what you would say, answered Elida. Yet faile not to doe all that lies in your power, and leave the rest to fortune. If you gat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>er thence no other satisfaction, yet you shall at least have thus much, that you have not neglected any meanes of making your selfe happy. Well I'le believe you, deare Elida, said the Prince, and indeed fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her advice so absolutely, that the very next day he put to Sea, and tooke with him that Maiden, Alcippus, and Diceus, and though his Pilot knew not the scituation of the Island of the Sun, yet he promised to finde it, provided it were not inchanted as that of Alcidiana. But the season being extreamely ill, and the difficulty which the Pilot thought to orecome, greater then he imagined, he was above two moneths contesting with his ignorance, and the frequent stormes. At last he drew neere to that Island, and Polexander being where he might discover a far off, perceived a vessell which came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Isle. He made up to her, he carefully marked her, and finding by assured tokens that she belonged to Alcidiana, followed her, but in such a manner as he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved he made them not jealous of him.</p>
                  <p>Yet Lynceus (for twas he) perceived the Kings designe, and winding up and downe all the rest of the day, thrust himselfe into the Haven of the Sun, as soone as the obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the night had made him lose sight of the Princes vessell. The next morning he sought for her, he pursued her, he got with all the sailes he could make away from the place where he might have found her; in short, by often turning and traversing that sea, Polexander returned to the place from whence he set saile. Heere he spent a part of the winter, for all his impatiences. At last his strength being by little and little ore come by the weakenesse of his minde, he fell sick of a languishing disease. Oftentimes we thought him dead, but his good temper having wrestled neere six moneths with his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet thoughts and melancholy he recovered, I may say from the grave. Yet was he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove six moneths more wherein he could not put himselfe to the least effect, but he fell againe into his former malady. After so many relapses, he at last got strength whether he would or no, and recovering by the returne of the Sun a health more vigourous and setled then that which he had lost, he would sacrifice it as the other, to his passion, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, and new voyages.</p>
                  <p>And now seeing the season approach, wherein Alcidiana's ships used to set saile for the Island of the Sunne, he did what he had so often done before, without any other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe then to end his life in quest of that happinesse he had lost. Whether it were that Alcidiana's ships were already gone, or that she had altered the time of sacrifices; so it happened, that Polexander found nought of what he searched on the coast of the Isle of the Sun. Whilst he was in this perplexity, one of Bajazets Rovers fell into his hands. He used him with a great deale of courtesie, and wonne him to stay sometime with him. During which, talking of divers things, he understood how valiant Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet was, how generous and magnificent, and of his being passionately in love with a great Princes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, whose picture he carried in a boxe of Diamonds. At the newes of this imagine you see Polexander troubled, all in disquiet, and transported with the desire of revenge.</p>
                  <p>He certainely believes it to be the boxe that was stolen from him: And to be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, describes to the Pirate the forme of the boxe, makes to him a picture of Alcidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's picture, and forgets not the least stroake in it. The Pirate, who may be only spoke by hearesay, or but confusedly, remembred what he had seene, answered Polexander to his owne desire, and could so well perswade him that Bajazets boxe was the same he described, that he presently put on to assault him in his Island in the very midst of all his forces. But his good fortune was he found him not there. He was gone a roving with his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eete; and the Governour of the Isle understanding Polexanders designe by the Pirate he had let goe, would have staied him, not only as an enemy of his Governour, but as a man for whose redemption there might be payd a great ransome. Polexander, was therefore set on in his vessell, by all those the Pirates reserved for the guard of the Isle: Imagine now the Princes resolution when he saw himselfe in the midst of fifteen or twenty Pinnaces and Gallies. He made a fight that can never be worthily enough related, no not by the most eloquent pen in the world. He fought two dayes and two nights without intermission, and as a generous Lyon not only teares in pieces the toiles
<pb facs="tcp:54727:132"/>
that invirone him, but the hunters also that oppose his passage; so did this Heroë, either sincke force from fight part of the enemies vessells, and making a great slaughter of the Pirates, gloriously returned by the same way he came thither. The third day after this victorious retreate he discovered a ship, and thinking it belonged to the Rovers that had so traytrously dealt with him, he commanded them in it to strike saile. The Master not obeying, there began a fight with the Cannon, and was continued by handy blowes. Polexander in that incounter met with a hardy enemy, and 'twas that valiant Prince, the Sonne of Zabaim and Zelop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, who as I have told you tooke away Polexanders box. The fight was equally maintained by the valour of those two Princes for the space of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ven or eight houres.</p>
                  <p>Now was Polexander in Almanzor's vessell, and anon after was Almanzor in Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's. They were imitated by their Souldiers, who came on or retreated, as they had more or lesse good fortune. That was the cause, when the tempest had seperated them, some of Almanzor's Souldiers were in Polexanders ship, and the Prince wanted of his, and amongst others that famous Italian Painter, who had drawne for him Alcidiana's picture. The storme taking him after the combate, he was very violently beaten by it for five or six dayes, but at last his Pilot knew, that the ill weather had beene very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to him, since in a small time with an extreame swiftnesse it had made him crosse a long space of the sea. The fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>st day of the calme he discried the top of the prodigious hye Pike of Teneriffe, and advising Polexander of it, he was commanded to get in and cast anchor there. At his landing, all the Inhabitants of the Isle shewed so much joy for his returne, and so great a desire to enjoy him longer, that he resolved to give them that satisfaction. In the meane time he sent Diceus into the other Islands to make choice of the best ships in the Havens, and to cause ten or twelve to be made ready at all points for him.</p>
                  <p>His providence may be tearmed propheticall, for Diceus was no sooner returned with the ships, but the Portugalls appeared about the Isles. Their confederates they had yet among the Canarians, had without doubt given them advice of the losse of Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, of the Queen his Mothers death, and the desire which many witnessed of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the Portugall subjection. They therefore believing they needed but to shew themselves, and so enter in possession of the Isles, drew neere without doing any act of hostility, and sent newes of their comming to those who had called them thither. The answer they received was not such as they expected. Word being sent how Polexander was safely returned. Neverthelesse they were advised to land in the very Isle of Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

This counsell was followed, and 'twas so, but for the King my Masters greater honour. I dare say, that the forepassed times whatever they talke to us of their H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Greece vauntes she had a Prince so magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, that he alone cast himselfe into an enemies City, and alone sustained all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s of a Nation who wished his death. But Polexander did that by the greatnesse of his courage, which the other did by necessity. Instead of standing as simply defensive, he went on alone to incounter a great number of the worlds most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Souldiers; and what passeth all beliefe, in opposing his only sword and courage, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>iffe, and gave time to his ships to come and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in so wonderfull a victory.</p>
                  <p>The Portugalls perceiving well there was nothing but blowes to be gotten, fled after a short fight, and seeing themselves chased by our vessels, retired into the ports they have on the coast of Africa. Polexander had begu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take breath after all these turmoiles, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a new enemy as much to be feared as all the Portugals together, ingaged him to exercise once more his valor. Twas the generous Almanzor Prince of Senega. I have told you he found Polexander sleeping neer the sea shoar, and how he took away his box, &amp; Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana's picture. 'Twas a fatal theft to him. He saw himself take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as soone as he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for Alcidiana's admirable beauty communicating to her picturs some beame of her light, &amp; a part of her power stroke those with love that had never seen her, &amp; flash'd forth flames
<pb facs="tcp:54727:132"/>
from a cold piece of copper, and a few dead colours. As soone as Almanzor had made tryall of that prodigious adventure, he coveted nothing, no not life, but for Alcidiana, and turned all his youthfull valour, against a Rivall whom he thought to be more gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced then himselfe. Nor was he tormented with that sole Demon, for those of honour and renowne did not lesse afflict him. His generous disposition upbraided him with his these, and represented to him his poorenesse of spirit which could not sufficiently be condemned, for stealing and robbing a man that was a sleepe. These two motives with his jealousie and repentance, made him leave his owne Territories the very day of his Coronation, and forced him to crosse an unknowne sea in quest of Alcidiana and Polexander.</p>
                  <p>The last he met withall, as I told you, and fought with him unknowne. But after they were seperated by the tempest, he knew it from out Italian Painter which was left in his ship, and then he thought of nothing else but of finding him againe. As soone as he was in the roade of Teneiffe, he sent back the Italian to Polexander, and by him a letter so full of excuses for his fault committed, and so many testimonies of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that by the accusation and humiliation, the King my Master knew the magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of that Prince. At the end of his letter he spoake to him of the greatnesse of his love, and said, his passion had reduced him to that point, that he could not without death restore a thing which he himselfe confessed could not be detained without the losse of his honour.</p>
                  <p>Polexander, sent Alcippus to him with the Italian, to assure him of the estimation he held of his courage and intention, to intreate from him the honour, to enter his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and assure him he would contribute to his contentment all that did not oppose the service he owed to Alcidiana. Almanzor grew almost desperate to heare all these generosities, and made shew of an extreame sensibility of what his Rivall had offered him, called himselfe a most unfortunate man to have to contest with so high a virtue, and at last told Alcippus, he most humbly besought Polexander to give him the happinesse to make an end on Land, of that fight which they began at Sea. Alcippus set all his wits on worke to alter that Princes resolution; but seeing 'twas all in vaine: I will (said he) goe, and make knowne to my Master the King the true cause of my voyage. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you doe so (replied Almanzor) and after his imbracie would have loaden him with jewells. But Alcippus very civilly refusing them, got himselfe to be landed, and so went to give an account to his Master of what he had done with Almanzor. That brave and great King sent him back with new complements to his enemy, and till the day of fight treated him as if he had beene Zelmatida or Iphidamantus. The Indian Prince smiled at the old Pimantus addresse, and intreated him to relate the combate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene those two illustrious Rivalls. The particulars (answered the Vice-roy) deserve your curiosity.</p>
                  <p>Those two Princes met at one instant on the place of combate, armed at all points, and mounted on two of the best horses in all Africa.

Almanzor, covered with blood and woundes fell downe under his horse legs: Polexander was as quickly alighted, and to him with his sword in his hand; you desired (said he) to be overcome, confesse now, that you are so. That Prince seeing himselfe neere the losse of his life, contemning the threats of his enemy, cast his thoughts on Alcidiana, and addressing himselfe to her, made to that Queene a resignation of his life in such tearmes as drew teares from the eyes of his Conquerour. What said I, his Conquerour? No, the King my Master, in
<pb facs="tcp:54727:133"/>
hearing them, confessed himselfe vanquished, presented his sword to Almanzor, begged him his life, and avowing that he was only worthy to serve Alcidiana: he added; yes certainely you deserve that honour, and you are too sole vanquisher; for our combate having for object nothing but Alcidiana's service, he alone may justly be termed victor, who hath given the best testimony of his love and constancy. Polexander yet went further, for seeing Almanzor desperate of life, he left him his sword, and going away, as if afraid, strove to make it believed he had had no advantage ore Almanzor. That poore Prince would faine have died where he fell, but his Servants carried him back into his ship, and finding his woundes not mortall, omitting nothing to hinder de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire from doing more then the sword of Polexander. But all their labour was in vaine, for Almanzor would absolutely dye, and after a languishing of many moneths percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving he began to amend, he caused himselfe to be carryed into that stately Tombe which is to be seene in one of our Isles, and unmercifully turned on himselfe a weapon more cruell then that of his Rivall.</p>
                  <p>The King my Master heard not of his death till a long time after, by meanes of his forsaking his Realme, as soone as his woundes were healed, and rebeginning his errant life, to lose the sorrow for his victory, as also to tempt fortune againe, and meet some Angell, or some star that might reconduct him to the Inaccessible Island. But neither on the waters, nor in the skies found he ought, but what had conspired his ruine. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse he returned to the Isle of the Sun, and had long conference with some Priests whom he had wone by his gifts.</p>
                  <p>From them he got all that might advance his intention, and yet ran two moneths more up and downe the sea to try his fortune. He put in execution all that love advised, he observed all that the Priests of the Sun had prescribed him, and notwithstanding did nothing but increase his afflictions, and ruinate the remainder of his hopes. In this vaine travell having spent almost all the yeere, which was the fourth since he came out of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana's Island, he came to winter in this Island, and in the beginning of the spring put to sea with seaven good ships of consort. In this last voyage he perceived that perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance might overcome the malignity of fortune and the starres; for being a dayes saile from the Island of the Sun, he discovered three great vessells, and for feare of terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying them commanded his Pilot to steere a contrary course to theirs till the beginning of the night, which was executed with so much art, that the three ships sailed without any suspition.</p>
                  <p>At sun set, Polexander hoysed up all his sailes, and was so fortunate, that at day breake he was come up so close to them, as he knew them to be of the Inaccessible Island. He saw Alcidiana's new arising Phoenix painted on the sailes of the tallest, and judging thereby it was the sacred vessell: Companions (said he) at last wee have found that wee have sought for these foure yeeres; but that we may not perish in the Haven, we must joyne wisdome to valour, and ability to affection. Let every one of you therefore contribute to my contentment, and make it appeare in this occasion the same obedience they have testified in all those that have preceded. I particularly desire from you this obedience (said he) because by it I will suspence with your valour, hold your hands, and take from you that wonted fervency wherewithall you were accustomed to assaile mine enemies.</p>
                  <p>You know these are none, and 'tis only the reverence they beare to their Lawes of their Countrey, and their Queenes command, which makes them turne their armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. After he had thus spoaken, he caused five of his ships to make up, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Pilots to get the winde. Himselfe with two other made right to those of Alcidiana. They instantly severed, one tooke towards the South, another towards the East, and the last Northerly. This stratagem angred Polexander, and made him afraid of losing them, either in following them severally, or if he should give chase but to one. He deliberated a while what to doe, and thought it best to get his ships together, and follow all that which tooke her course to the North. It was the greatest, and therefore he thought her to be that wherein Lynceus was. Well after her he made; but the first and second day he could not come up within reach of the Canon. The third day he got to her, but that the night made him lose sight of her, and was the cause why all the next
<pb facs="tcp:54727:133"/>
day she could not be seene of them. The fift, he discovered his Canaries, and a Marriner which was in the scuttle of the Mast, cried out, he discried Alcidiana's ship. This newes infused new life into Polexander and his followers. They hasted all after the cunning Lynceus, and having singled and found him out among so many turnings the sea makes by reason of the Islands, laid him aboard in sight of that of Iron. He could no more have escaped us, but must be taken. Polexander was now (as he thought) the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of fortune, when a great vessell which lay in the roade of the foresaid Isle, came out, met with him, and staied him, and withall gave testimony that the inequallity of their forces should not binder him from fighting. Polexander cryed out to his men, that they should not amuse themselves about that new enemy, but closely follow Lynce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. But the Turkes in the great vessell forced them to fight for their passage. The King inraged at this obstacle, layd the Turkes aboard, and being unable to compell them to a retreat, came to handy stroakes with their Captaine. I will relate to you an admirable adventure: In the heate of the fight, some of our people crying out, that Polexander had the victory; scarce had the Captaine of the Turks heard that name, but he came and threw himselfe at the feete of the King my Master, presented him his armes, petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to be chastised for his insolency, and in a word, made himselfe knowne to be the same Iphidamantus whom the Sultan Bajazet forced away the same day he caused Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander to be strangled.</p>
                  <p>Polexander astonished at the adventure, witnessed how much he rejoyced in seeing him againe, but remembring he lost Lynceus, intreated him to goe and expect his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne at the Canaries, and suffer him to follow the ship wherein his fortunes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed. Iphidamantus after he had craved pardon for his errour, would repaire it in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting him to take Lynceus. They did all they could to fetch him up again, but in vaine, and in lieu of it found themselves pestred betweene two Navall Armies, which were ready to give battle. The one was Spanish, and the other made up of part Turkes, and part Moores.</p>
                  <p>The Vice-roy of Argier commanded in chiefe, who having passed the streights at the request of Abdelmelec and other Africans to make an enterprize on the Portugall, saw himselfe compelled after a bloody fight, to returne into the Mediterranean, and dispute no more for the Empire of the Ocean with a Nation, who by their late discoveries, and mighty fleete were gotten Masters of it. 'Tis fit before I proceed further, that I relate to you Iphidamantus life, as he himselfe told it his brother Polexander whilst they were together. Do not put your self to that trouble, Father, replied Zelmatida; I know it all. He himself made it known to me in the Pirats Iland. I know how he was bred by the Basha Achomat under the name of Soliman, that Melicerta and Histeria daughters of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha fell in love with him, and am not ignorant how the insensibility of Achomat caused the death of the one, and the banishment of the other. In briefe I know all that hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ided him to the very day he was taken by our deare Bajazet. Since 'tis so, replied the Vice-roy, I have no more to tell you, but that Polexander (after the battle betwixt the Turkes and Spanyards) finding againe the pretended ship of Lyncens, did what he could to winne her by faire meanes. But that being bootelesse, he followed her to the Pirats Island, fought with her, and at last understood he had taken all that paines only for an apparition and Chymera. For in effect 'twas not Lynceus, but a Rover called Cid Hamet, which scoured through the seas in a ship which a little before he had taken from one of Alcidiana's Pilots.</p>
                  <p>Judge now, great Prince if love be not a dangerous thing, or rather a malediction which heaven in its anger powres downe to chastice the sinnes of the earth. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tis the greatest scourg it can inflict upon us. O Sorceror which empoysonest by thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries? O Basiliske which murdrest whomsoever thou beholdest! Accursed love, which whilst I live shalt be the object of my hatred and imprecations. By thee, the most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and generous of all Kings hath lost the use of reason, the fairest time of his life, the desire of honour, and the hope of a thousand conquests. Through thee he goes like a mad man to assaile all alone a whole Nation, and expose himselfe to the fury and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a hundred thousand Barbarians. Through thee he hath altred the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the necessity of his condition, and of a great Prince as he was borne, he is become
<pb facs="tcp:54727:134"/>
a new Monster of the Ocean, the playing toy of the windes and waves, the outcast of the rocks, and the prey of Pirates. It may be at this houre I speake he is tossed by some surious tempest, sees all the elements animated aginst his temerity, and findes himselfe at the point of paying by a sad shipwrack the contempt he hath had of that absolute power, which with an equall justice disposeth both of the calmes and tempest. The Vice-roy's feare was not only provident, but propheticall, for at the very time he spoke, Polexander expected, (but constantly) the shipwrack which threatned him. Yet he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped it, and after the surmounting many perrills, landed in a little Bourg, which is but two dayes journey from Copenhagen. He came on shoare in that place to thinke advisedly on what he was to doe for his cloathing himselfe after the Danish fashion, to avoide the exposing his person in strange habits to the fight of the vulgar people of Copenhagen.</p>
                  <p>He had not much Danish, but he had enough for not being a stranger among that rude Nation. When he had put all things in order, he got on horseback with Alcippus and Diceus, and tooke the next way to the chiefe City. He lodged (first night) in a great Towne a little dayes journey from it, and rising about breake of day, which was then about ten of the cloack, he rid a great way before he baited, and having not past five houres of way more to ride, he entred into a great wood of firre trees, and had scarce gone two hundred paces, but he was ingaged to stay and read in a copper table fixed to a tree the way he was to take. Whilst he made that inquisition, he heard a great noice, and making a stand, lent his eare, and judged there were some theeves robbing of passengers, his innate goodnesse soliciting for their succour, he rid towards them, and leaving his way, tooke another far narrower, which seemed to lead to an old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle which he saw on the knap of a mountaine. When he was come to some ruines which he saw in a little open bottome, he perceived a man with his sword drawne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending himselfe against five who would either have taken or murdred him: Wounded he was in many places; yet did not his woundes deprive him of strength or courage. The King made in to second him, and instantly mingled amongst the murtherers, made them feele the weight of his blowes, and gave them not time to perpetrate that crime they had begun.</p>
                  <p>The Dane perceiving the assistance which was as 'twere miraculously betided him, tooke breath, joyning with his defender, fell'd on the earth the last of his enemies. He thought the combate done, when Alcippus and Diceus cried out, and he looking about, saw ten new cut throats came to charge him, who questionlesse had surprised him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their advertisement. With that Polexander alighted, so did Alcippus, Diceus who was a Souldier followed them, and the Dane shewing himselfe more resolute, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyled then before, went foremost to meet those traitours, and no lesse terrified them by his threats then his blowes. Alcippus valiant even to rashnesse, flew on one of the theeves, but whilst he laid him in the dust, was charged behind, and so pressed that he could not turne head. He received so unfortunate a blow, that he lost the motion of his right arme, and by consequence the meanes of using his sword. He was even compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to sit downe, and leave to others the taking of revenge which he was desperate of being able to performe himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Polexander no sooner saw him unfit for further combate, but he ran to him, and so manfully sustained the stroake of the enemy, that he deprived them of their obstinacy of fighting. The Dane had a great part in this defeate, and Diceus was not without acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ing a greate deale of honour there. The combate being ended, Polexander went againe to see in what case Alcippus was, and thought him dead, when he saw him bleed so exceedingly.</p>
                  <p>But Diceus assured him, he had no other hurt then a veine cut, and that 'twas nothing. They quickly saw he spoake truth, for he stopped the blood by the first swathband. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the Dane came to Polexander, and seeming almost nothing weakened by his woundes: I cannot (said he) render you service, that may any way equalize the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations I owe you. Did I owe you but my life, I could be in hope of acquitting my selfe by offring you that little of it which I have remaining. But being engaged to you
<pb facs="tcp:54727:134"/>
for my honour and my life, I can neither finde words sufficient to expresse my grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor what to doe to returne a satisfaction. Neverthelesse let me know who you are, and what fortune, so favourable for me, conducted you to this wood. That little of life which my wounds have left me, beseecheth you not to retard that favour for which I petition.</p>
                  <p>Polexander, would have answered him so, as he might have beene contented; but some twenty paces from him he saw a woman of a very good countenance, though she seemed not young, who was mightily affrighted. As soone as the Dane saw her, he thought no more of what he had asked Polexander, nor may be on his woundes. He opened his lips to speake, but his strength failing he fell downe as dead: O! Heaven, cried the Lady, seeing him fall, must I needes be so miserable? And therewithall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere to one of the slaine, and a while considering him perfidious Adolphus (said she) hast thou thus betraied me? Or rather see how thou hast betrayed thy selfe. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is just, and its wisdome permits not rancor and malice to have alwaies the upper hand of innocency. Which done, she ran to succour the Dane, whom Polexander had so well assisted, and after she had oftentimes called him her Sonne and her hope, commanded a Maiden that followed her, to run quickly to fetch her Essence, and call some of her servants.</p>
                  <p>The Maiden hastned and quickly returned with all she was sent for. The Lady then powred some drops of a very cleare water into the Danes mouth, and presently he came from his swound. Wherewith the Ladies servants lifted him into a coppered chaire, and would have carried him away; but he commanded to stay, and intreating Polexander to come neere, yeelded him thousands of thankes, then giving him a picture boxe, covered with Diamonds with a great deale of civillity: Be pleased said he to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this boxe, for a remembrance of our meeting. But doe not imagine, I am so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the value of things, that I thinke my selfe acquitted of the debt I owe you by the worth of the stones on it; if I intreate you to accept it, tis for no other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that you may know if you come to the Court, the name of the man whom you have obliged. I dare not stay longer with you, Thamiris command, which calls me o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where is too just to be obeyed. At first Polexander was somewhat nice to take the boxe, but perceiving by the Danes speech, what a discontent that might have been to him had he refused it, and besides conjecturing that token might be advantagious to him in his designe, he tooke it, and told him, that going to the Court, he would not faile to bring it him back aga he. After this promise, many great compliments passed, &amp; assurd him, that if any other then the Lady who had so well assisted him, had commanded his carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thence, he would hardly have resolv'd to part with him. The Dane besought him not to be troubl'd for him &amp; said, that whither he went he ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no hazard. Polexander expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his words in the sence a Lover might give them, and for feare of disobliging, tooke his leave of him and the Lady, and so with Alcippus and Dic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>us went streight to horse, and recovering the high-way, got quickly into a great Village at the end of the wood, wherein he had met that bloody adventure. Of necessity he was to alight there, for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus was so weake that he could ride no further. He had him to be brought into the best Inne, and commanded Diceus to treate him as himselfe. It hapned as fate would, that the Hoste was an old Souldier, who after his bearing armes many yeares without bettering his fortune, had retired himselfe thither, and married an old Hostesse very well accommodated.</p>
                  <p>Polexander, desirous to free the minde of his Hoste from the astonishment he had to see Alcippus in so ill an estate, told him, how in passing by the neighbouring forrest, they had been set on by theeves. You are not the first (said he) who have fallen into their hands. There is none that passeth that way, but he loseth his life or his money if he be not well accompanied. Those are the inconveniences the wars usually leave be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them, and the disorders which happen through the negligence, or purloining of such as are appointed the Souldiers pay masters. This mans discourse made Polexander believe that he might informe him of what he so much longed to know. He therefore in a small time grew to a great familiarity with him, and to win him absolutely, put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the trouble of inventing a thousand tales, under whose probabillity he was got
<pb facs="tcp:54727:135"/>
to be of his ancient acquaintance. Some fifteene dayes he was in that Inne, for Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus cure, and one of them being wonderfull desirous to know who he might be whom he had ayded, and finding his Hoste in a good humour, asked him whether he went not sometimes to the Court? He made answere, he had beene there but too often, and how after his unfortunately living there five and twenty yeeres, he was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to retire to get his bread, and play the begger no longer. If so (said Polexander) there are then but few persons of quallity whose faces you know not? 'T were happy for me, said he, if I knew them lesse then I doe, and that their false semblances had not vainely abused my expectation, and worne out the prime of my youth. Whilst he was talking thus, Polexander opened the boxe which the Dane gave him, and taking out the picture shewed it to his Host. Scarce had he fully seene it, but he cried out, and clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Polexander on the shoulder, whence come you said he, that you know not this face? I come (replied Polexander) from wandring through most of Europe, and am but newly come into Denmarke. By chance found I this picture, and imagining it belongs to some great Lord, I would faine restore it, and that bred my curiosity to know him. You have good cause to prosecute your intention (answered the Hoste) for 'tis the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict of one who is likely to enrich you for the least service you can doe him; his name is Phelismond, our Kings Heire and Favourite, or to speake more freely, he is indeed the very King of Denmarke.</p>
                  <p>At the name of Phelismond, Polexander was so supprised, that he changed colour, and was faine to sit downe to resettle himselfe. His Host tooke notice of it, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked whether he were not well? He replied, twas the remaines of a late sicknesse, and so cast himselfe on a bed, as well to dismisse the man, as to ponder seriously on so wonderfull an accident. After a long times musing, he rising, addressed himselfe to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and told him he must participate of his astonishment, and know who 'twas whom they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> from among the theeves. Tis (said he) Phelismond; surely I know by this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>I came of purpose into this Kingdome to kill that Phelismond, whom for Alcidiana's sake I have prosecuted as the chiefest of mine enemies, and yet the first adventure which presented it selfe heere, engaged me to hazard mine owne life to preserve his. After this miracle, I bow my head, and see cleerely that heaven cannot suffer our rash thoughts to oppose themselves against the secrets of its providence. My passion presented to me Phelismond as one of those happy Monsters, whome fortune takes pleasure to raise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, to shew how far pride and licence to doe any thing dare goe. But I know quite contrary, that this Prince is adorned with excellent quallities, and his courtesie is no lesse winning then his valour is redoubtable, without whose approbation there is not a virtue, but is a vice, nor courage, but is unmanlinesse. I am no lesse guilty then Phelis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, since I have received other Lawes then those thou gavest me. Tushe, tushe, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e all these unlawfull motions, for since thou hast resolved it, Phelismond must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</p>
                  <p>When Polexander had ended, Alcippus began, and confessed there was something of he knew not what extraordinary good in this adventure; neverthelesse (said he to his Master) I admire nought at all these strange accidents which betide in what you have undertaken. You should not be the man you are if things did not befall you other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then to other men. Well, well, (said Polexander interrupting him) tis enough; once, either Phelismond or I must dye. The sentence of our deaths hath been given by the mouth of a Judge, from whom it is neither lawfull for him or I to appeale. Come let's see whether he have as much courage against love as we have been witnesses he had against other enemies. Two or three dayes after this last resolution of the King, Diceus assured him Alcippus might get on horseback, and they all three departed from their Inne, and the same day betimes arrived at Copenhagen. They lodged neere the Pallace, and understood the very next day, Phelismond was by the Kings command brought into the City, and being absolutely out of danger, was seene and visited by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one. This newes exceedingly pleased Polexander; yet resolved to attend his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb facs="tcp:54727:135"/>
health before he would make knowne to Phelismond the cause of his voyage, and thought it fit withall to restore him his boxe, and disclose himselfe, that so at his returne he might intimate to him that which lay on his heart. One morning therefore, taking Alcippus with him he went streight to the Favorites lodging, as soone as he came in, he noted there was nothing in that man but savoured of the greatnesse of his courage. His house was open to all men. No person hindred the entrance into his chamber, no not of his withdrawing roome. Tis true, he was so generally beloved, and the respect the whole Court had alwaies borne him was so strong a guard to him, that neither great nor lesse came to disturbe him but upon some very just cause. The first to whom Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander addrest himselfe to know whether that Prince was to be spoken with, offred to conduct him into his chamber, and Polexander accepting his courtesie, followed him. He went through great Halls very stately furnished, through chambers, and anti-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers far more magnificent, wherein he saw none but Phelismonds domesticall servants. This sollitude so much ravished him, that he could not hold from telling his Conductor, the Courtiers of Denmarke, were either very negligent or little ambitious, since they gave so much ease and quiet to the man, who only next the King might make them a fortune.</p>
                  <p>You see (answered his Guide) that our Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ters have no greate imployment, and there is no great crouding in our chambers. Yet tis not because our Couriers are not the most diligent, and ambitious of all men; but the Prince long since told them once for all, that he pretended not to be the most unfortunate in all Denmarke, because his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster did him the honour to love him more particulaly then others: That he engaged himselfe to serve them as often as his credit could adde any thing to their merrit, or their Princes will; but he would not promise it but on condition they would suffer him to live at liberty. Truely replied Polexander, I understand dayly there are most eminent virtues in Phelismond, though he be of their number, with whom they have been thought (even till this day) to be incompatible. The mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s of the multitude must needes be very bad, since some of them have been to wicked as to finde fault with the actions of so great a personage., It may be (said the guide) some one may have cause to complaine of the Prince; yet I intreate you to believe they are much in the wrong who make him the cause of their publick miseries. He dayly toiles to put a period to them, and when he thinkes to be at the point of relieving the people, some spirits borne for their ages affliction, alter those good designes, and inforce him whether he will or no to raise the charges and impositions, to deter the intire desolation of the Kingdome. But let it suffice, I have not in command to justifie his actions, nor condemne other mens, and see, we are at the chamber doore.</p>
                  <p>I intreate you then (said Polexander) to see what the Prince doth, and if you thinke it fitting, to tell him, that the Gentleman to whom he gave a picture boxe, is come to restore it to him. At that word, the Guide smiling, left him, and presently returning, said, that Paelismond intreated him to come in. At his first step into the chamber, divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen came and saluted him, and all with a great deale of civility, led him to the Prince his bed side.</p>
                  <p>He raised himselfe halfe to embrace him, and received him with so great expressions of joy and sensibility, that Polexander had not been worthy to have lived, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e not been moved with his courtesie. He began his compliments by the boxe he presented him, and often besought his pardon for the long unacquitting himselfe of what he owed him. Phelismond, embracing him againe, tooke him from the continuing those civilities, and wringing his hand, I see well (said he) that you have no better an opinion of me, then of custome men have of such who are in the same degree of fortune with me. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one believes, that no man can be a Favourite, but he must instantly forget himselfe. But if I might have the happinesse of seeing you often, I hope you would change your opinion, and finde, that I left not to be rationall when I came to be a Favourite. I aske your pardon for this ill discourse; but I am so much afraid to be taken for another, that by this declaration I begin my acquaintance and friendship. To this Polexander answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with so much freedome and gentlenesse, as if he had not beene Polexander, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phelismond; he felt within him an extraordinary deba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

her accustomed effect, compelled him to love his Rivall, and Alcidiana's enemy. At last his passion, and that Princesses command got the upper hand. Hereupon he resolved his owne ruine, or to avenge both, and for that cause would be but a little with Phelis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, who did all he could possibly to stay him: But Polexander came off so gently, that without any incivility he had the liberty he wished. When he was returned to his lodging, he began to muse on his fortune, and passing and repassing through his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry all P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>elismonds endowments; I am (said he to himselfe) reduced to two extremities, far differing from one another. If I put not in execution what Alcidiana commands me, I am a coward, a traytour, and ought to thinke no more on the meanes to finde the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible Island. On the other side, hath any man seene an example of brutallity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>No, no, she must be obeyed. Let those who know not how to love aright, reprove my ingratitude. Let them convince me of extravagancy, and take me either for some in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Alcidiana is more to be feared then all these accusers. I will act what I ought; Phelismond can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame me for it, and whosoever is truely generous, shall (at the same instant he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the misfortune of so accomplished a Prince) set downe among his first examples of Loyalty, the excesse of my blinde obedience. After this discourse with himselfe he began to thinke on the meanes of bringing his resolution to a good issue, and after a long meditating on it, came forth with Alcippus to revisit Phelismond, and met with his first Conductor, who assured him his Master was impatient till he saw him againe, and that all the afternoone he had entertained his visitants with nought but his ingenuity and cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Polexander, answered as he ought, and so ascended to Phelismonds Chamber. He found him up, and was received with a great deale of joy and gentlenesse, behaviors ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e, in men of that condition. Long time the Prince embraced him, speaking, as he had knowne the secrets of his soule. When (said he) shall I have the happinesse to see you as really my friend as I wish it? Polexander, who could not betray his conscience, nor indiscreetly offend so generous a Prince, studied an answere that might satisfie him, and yet be no prevarication in what concerned Alcidiana: The sole cause (replied he) which deters me from receiving the honour you doe me, is a feare that when I shall be more particularly knowne to you then I am, you will be inforced to cut off a great deale from those favours you doe me.</p>
                  <p>Phelismond, at that word stopping him; assure your selfe (said he) that neither you nor all men breathing can by any action whatsoever take from me my intention and will to be entirely yours. But fearing least you may imagine that rather some other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration then that of your virtue hath obliged me to woe your friendship; I asked it you, without the knowledge of what you are, not what you can doe. These courtesies of Phelismond, so distracted Polexander, that but with a great deale of trouble could he frame an answere to so many noble speeches. In the meane time, Phelismond, who had a designe to gaine him absolutely, smiled to see him at a nonplus, and thus came on againe. Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If you be so good a husband of your friendship, as you will sell it, either it is ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimable, or I have that which will buy it. Or if you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>id to himselfe) Alcidiana was unjust in desiring the death of so perfect a Prince. At last he overcame the agitations of his minde, and resolved not to discover himselfe, but to declare to P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>elismond the cause of his journey, and by consequence what 'twas which hindred him from accepting his friendship. See how he came off from so diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb facs="tcp:54727:136"/>
a straite, and under what tearmes he hid the truth of his life: Since (said he to Phelismond) you will have me absolutely accept the honour you doe me, or give you reason for my refusall, I will make use of the liberty you give me, and freely tell you, I cannot receive your offers, how advantagious soever they may be to me, nor yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you my service, till I am disingaged from an affaire wherein your selfe is in some sort interrested. Of what nature soever that businesse be, (replied Phelismond) I sweare to you, if you please to doe me the favour to trust me, I will ever conforme my selfe to what shall be most agreeable to you. This protestation full of candor and affection, obliged Polexander to trifle the time no longer, but thus to goe on with his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I am a French man (said he) and my birth good enough for satisfaction. I have been bred up among the troubles wherein my Countrey hath laboured within these few yeeres, and fortune hath been so favourable to me, that I have had thence more then I expected. But when I adapted me to tast the fruites of my labours, she hath raised me a fearefull enemy, and would have put him in possession of all that good I promised my selfe.</p>
                  <p>Yet when she was in hand to put him the enjoying, she found her selfe too weake to performe it. That Favourite hath met with more obstacles in that he would deprive me of, then the greatnesse of his quallity could imagine. He hath seen his hopes, as well as mine, take their end when they should have had their beginning, and when I should have complained of his violence, he obliged himselfe to give me satisfaction by waies that were not honourable. Pardon me if you please (continued Polexander) if I name not my Usurper, for he is so well knowne in this Court, and you have so much cause to affect him (as I have been told) that I feare for his sake you will forget all your promises to me. Believe it not (replied Phelismond) I heere againe engage my selfe to make good what I have promised.</p>
                  <p>Since you are so generous (said Polexander) I will lay open the summe of all my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse: My enemy unwilling to have our quarrell decided otherwhere then before the King your Master, sent that he would meet me heere to give me full satisfaction, and that at farthest I should heare of him within a Moneth. See Phelismond my fortune, the cause of my voyage, and wherefore I dare not believe you can love me. You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by this that I am come into Denmarke to fight by the Kings permission; and to petition him that in his presence, I may force satisfaction for an injury which will not suffer me to live without its resentment. After this last overture, if you have yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning disposition to oblige me, suffer me not to have made an idle journey. My Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not now in case to make a joynt petition with me to the King, but he is a person so noble, that he would not for any thing faile of his word. If I therefore dare to hope ought from your goodnesse, or rather if my fantasticall designe hath made no change in your opinion, I conjure you once more by that virtue which is so habituall to you, to free me from my continuall molestation, and to imploy a part of that power you have with the King in getting me his permission for a combate. Phelismond, observing in all Polexanders discourse the mildnesse, and well temperature of his speech, answered him thus; I will make you see how much I value this your greatnesse of courage, which no lesse apeares in your resentment, then in all the rest of your actions; I therefore promise to serve you at what hazard soever, and either to lose all my reputation, or give you that content which you hope for by your combate. But (if you please) it shall be on condition, that you finding nothing in this which may hinder your being my friend, you will grant me that which I have often sued for. When Polexander saw his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse goe on beyond expectation: I should (said he) be unworthy of the honour you doe me, did I not confesse that my desire to be your servant is equivalent with that of overcomming my enemy.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding, since it is very likely you would not treate a friend to lose him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; let, (if you please) our inclinations rest in suspence, till the day which may by chance finish them, and besides thereto adde so much as may last us the rest of our lives. There must (replied Phelismond) needs be some hidden mystery in your reservednesse in a businesse which seemes to me so just, but I content my selfe with what you thinke fit; and will have so much command on my selfe, as to regulate my will by yours. In the
<pb facs="tcp:54727:137"/>
meane time I assure you that even to morrow the King shall know what he ought of your businesse, and that I may serve you effectually: I will take my time for it, when he pleaseth to doe me the honour to have me retired with him to treate of matters which concerne his service. How infinite is your noblenesse (replied Polexander) and how much more ought I to acknowledge what you have done for me, and otherwise then I have yet performed! Doe not speake so (said Phelismond) the respect I beare you is sufficient to make me performe impossibilities, and (if need were) to proclaime me an enemy to my selfe.</p>
                  <p>O valour! (cried Polexander, interrupting him) before whom all other things have nought but of what is base; why should a cruell and powerfull necessity bereave me of the meanes of acting what I ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>? After this stirring, which in truth was not sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, Polexander recalled himselfe, and besought Phelismond not to acquaint the King to hastily with his businesse, since he was certaine his enemy could not be in case to answere him for a moneth. He fained this excuse to give Phelismond the more time for his strength. The Prince paused a while before he answered him, at last he tooke him by the hand, and wringing it as if he knew his designe; I will doe whatever you please (said he) and till you command me, I will speake nothing of your affaire. Till that happy houre be (replied Polexander) with your leave I will take a view of this great Kingdome, and satisfie my curiosity with the infinite number of rarities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall your Seas and Islands are replenished. I could wish (replied Phelismond, you had no such intention, and would trie to make you spend the time with more ease and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; but since you desire to travell, I will not deprive you of that contentment, but on the contrary give you a guide, for whose fidelity I will be answerable both for your person, and the successe of your voyage. Polexander thanked him for that new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the next day having made himselfe ready for his journey, tooke his leave of the Favourite. I should transgresse the liberty I allowed my selfe, if I related all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they gave our King, and his worthy intertainments in all Townes where he came. Tis enough to say he saw many strange things, and particularly all those varieties where withall nature pleaseth to disport her in that end of the world. After his being neere three moneths at sea, he landed againe at Copenhagen; where he found the Court, and was welcomed by Phelismond with such embraces and excessive favours, that he was a hundred times about to confine himselfe to some corner of Norway, to leave him the liberty of serving Alcidiana. But what cannot a true love doe? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the most accomplished Princesse of the worlds beauty, soone made him alter his resolution.</p>
                  <p>The very next day he betooke himselfe in earnest to his businesse, and to stick constant to the execution of Alcidiana's commands, stopped his eare to all that reason, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyre could perswade him. He went to Phelismond at his arising, and assured him of his enemies arrivall, besought him to perfect his affaire. Phelismond promised he would, and that very day obtained all he desired. Presently he advertised our King of it, and demanded if there were any thing else to be done? Yes my Lord (replied Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander) tis not enough that we have leave to fight, but that we have the time and place assigned us.</p>
                  <p>Phel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>smond assured him how that very evening he would try to get the Kings consent it might be in his presence, and in the great place of Copenhagen. For the day (said he) tis fit wee leave him the liberty of appointing it you at his pleasure. Yet this one thing I will promise you, that you shall not be long in expectation. Herewith Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der left the Favourite to take order about his affaire, and returned to him againe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his bed time to know the Kings pleasure. He was told that the King put off the combate to the last day of the moneth, and that tearme is very short, for tis the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

See, at last you have your desire; but believe me, that with griefe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough I have served you in this occasion; but since 'twas your will, I thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out your contentment. Polexander thanked him for the continuance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and besought him to believe that nothing grieved him, but his being constrained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:54727:137"/>
had two of the best horses in Denmarke, and was troubled at nothing, but how he might become the Conqueror, and yet not afflict or disgrace Phelismond. At last the the day for the combate being come, Polexander went very early to Phelismond, and finding him ready, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>treated him to make a turne in the Garden. Phelismond agreed, and imagining Polexander requested it not without some designe, commanded none should follow him. When he was descended into a walke of Pines, Yewes, and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres, he stopped, and intreated Polexander to speake freely to him. Our Heroë kept constant, and making no shew of any emotion or tartnesse, thus bespoake him: The first thing I have to say to you Phelismond is, that I am extraordinarily in love, and with the fairest Princesse of the world.</p>
                  <p>After this Declaration, I doe not only believe you already have excused me for all past faults committed in your presence; but that you will like wise approve of all my offences hereafter. I would not promise my selfe this grace from you, if you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved; but when I call to minde the power Thamiris hath over you, I finde where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to justifie the most remarkable crimes which love can possibly make me perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate. Is it not true Phelismond, that Thamiris beauty, and admired graces are by you held in that esteeme, that there is no man living, nay I say even the King your Master, whose enemy you would not declare your selfe, had he an intention to rob you of them? Heere he stopped, and did it of purpose to give Phelismond time to answere. Though I see not well whereto you tend (said that Prince) yet I freely confesse to you, I am of your opinio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have well perceived (said Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander) your love to Thamiris is very violent, and tis by that example, which I would prepare you to judge favourably of such things as love commands me to put in execution. I will make knowne to you heere on what tearmes I am with Thamiris, nor what the cause is which makes me so much affect her. It shall suffice me, that you know, I love in so high a place, that all the virtues and beauties of the world have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired together to compose the object of my love: Let the Reader imagine whether Polexander were sensible of these words or no, whether the jealousie they imprinted, were not power<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Polexander suppressed his first agitation, and returning into cold blood, thus went on againe. Ther's no more time left to conceale my selfe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Come Sir, you that are happy in all things, let us hasten her revenge, and satisfie her justice by the death of this Northerne Monster. This new proofe of Phelismonds ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerousnesse, so cooled Polexanders blood, that it neither left him the power, nor the desire to doe what he had so often resolved. Neverthelesse after he had a long time contested with himselfe, it seemed to him that Alcidiana upbraided him with his thoughts of pity, and accused him of private correspondence with her enemy. This made him give Phelismond this answer.

But let us not amuse our selves (if you please) in condemning the disorder we finde in our adventures; but since that great Princesse will is the sole Law we ought to keepe; let us on where her absolute power calls us.

felt the aire but he came to himselfe, So could not Phelismond, for he had lost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all his blood, and was in so ill a case that they believed him dead. No body was seene so much grieved as the Lady, who so happily arrived; long wept she, and at last, said, it was not fit the death of so generous a Prince should be left unpunished. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she had much vexed her selfe, she came to Polexander, and gazing on him as if she knew him, she called one of her women, and giving her a paper; goe (said she) shew this to the King, and tell him that Phelismond hath deceived him. The Damsell went, and was presently with the King. In the meane time the noise which was begun by the vailed Ladies arrivall, increased with clapping of hands, and unusuall clamours. During this tumult, the King came into this place, and drew to Phelismond. Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was risen before he came, and as soone as he saw the King, stood still (as well as his weakenesse could suffer him) and perceived he was no lesse afflicted then angry. He cast himselfe on the body of his Favourite, wept long, and on a suddaine rising up in a rage: He shall dye for it (said he) that miscreant, who came to murther me in the person of Phelismond.</p>
                  <p>In saying so, he turned him to Polexander, and full of rage, thou shalt not have the honour, said he, to perish by so glorious a hand as that of Phelismond, and when he had thus threatned, he looked on the Captaine of his Guard, and commanded him to lay hold of Polexander, but before he had time to execute his charge, Polexander came to the King, presented him his sword, and in offring it spoke thus: I know what respect is due to Kings. Since your very Subjects protract time in obeying you, so much feare have they lest you should be accused of perjury. I will act what they dare not. Take here (if you please) this sword, the cause of your displeasure, and assure your selfe, that your just griefe shall advise you to nothing which I will not undergoe without a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure.</p>
                  <p>These words surprised the King, and cooled his choler. Yet his love not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to make use of his judgement; you imagine (said he) that your courage can finde nothing, which it cannot overcome; but since you have contemned my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, I will make you see what my power is. Polexander could not answere him, for he had lost so much blood since he got up, that all his strength failing him againe, he fell so, as the King was faine to prop him, or he had run the hazard to have fallen with him. He therefore commanded five or six of his guard to take and carry him into the great Tower of the City, which was instantly performed whilst he was in his swound. The King of Denmarke freed from the object of his choler, cast his eyes on his deare Phelismond; While he thought of nothing but to have him carried away. Alcippus and Diceus rushing out of the croude, where they concealed themselves, came and fell at his feet, and besought his eare. What are you, said the King? We are (replied Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus) servants to that Prince whom you treate not conformably to the Covenant, whereby you permitted him the combate.</p>
                  <p>But in the name of Heaven Sir, hearken to reason how just soever your resentment be, and call to minde what you have sworne! The keeping of your word ought to be no lesse deare to you then the preserving your Authority. But if you thinke you have no cause on this occasion to stick to it, reflect on the greatnesse of your prisoner, and decree nothing against him: till you have well pondered who Polexander is. I know what I have to doe, answered the King. In the meane time, I command you to get out of my Court within these foure and twenty houres, if you will not run the fortune of a man who within these two dayes was but a meane Gentleman, and now forsooth must be taken for one of the prime P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>inces of the world. But I sweare to make of him an example, and at once give condigne punishment for the imposture, and the murder. Alas! Sir (replied Alcippus) I beseech you humbly not to suffer your selfe to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by your indignation. Your Majesty shall pardon me if you please, should I say you would lose the respect I owe you. The King justly offended at Alcippus indiscreet zeale, grew more in rage then ever, and commanded him with Diceus to be carryed to prison. Both of them thanked him for that favour, and (uncompelled) went whither they would lead them. They were shut up in the same Tower where their Master was, and presently after they sent him Physitians and Chyrurgions to see his woundes, which
<pb facs="tcp:54727:139"/>
they found to be great and dangerous. But Diceus was not of their opinion, and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he might dresse his Master. Those good people that were no more cunning then they should be, thought this request was not to be denied, and therefore gave way he should looke to him, which he did, and neglected nothing that might prevent those accidents which cause woundes to become mortall. In the meane time the King of Denmarke was much troubled for Phelismond. He had commanded six of his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to take and carry him, and not only went with him to the Pallace, but had him laid in his owne bed, where he was visited by all the Court Physitions, and looked too for all things necessary, as Heire to the Crowne.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse, for all they could doe to his hurts, they were so dangerous that till day breake, all thought them incurable. His Master went not to bed that night, and swore, if Phelismond died, he would instantly command Polexanders head to be stroake from his shoulders. After 'twas day Phelismond grew sensible, and (as soone as he could open his mouth) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>asked where his King was, and what was become of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The King kissed him often, and shedding teares for joy to heate him speake, my Phelismond (said he) take heart, and aske after nothing but thy cure. He for whom thou inquirest is where he wants nothing, since I saw by the letter thou writtest to Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miris, thy desire he should be treated as thy selfe. Ten or twelve dayes slid away, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which time, the two Rivalls woundes, threw forth part of their fire, and cast them into such violent Fevers, that their youth was the best preserver of their lives. Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismond now grew to be out of danger as well as Polexander, when he called to minde he was not to faile of his word given him. That consideration moved him to supplicate the King his Master, he would be pleased he might be carried to the place where Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander was: Phelismond (replied the King) whilst the greatnesse of your woundes, made me feare what would become of you, I dissembled my resentment, and would not thinke of your offending me; but now you are out of danger, I will tell you my minde, and command you, as I am your Master and Father, to invent no pretext for having any cause to contradict me. I have so much affected you Phelismond, that in my life time I would have setled the Crowne of Denmarke on your head. This extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary token of my love, should intimate how deare your safety is to me, and indeed it is so much, that there is nothing which I would not doe to give you all the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you can desire. Yet there is one thing I receive to my selfe, and for which I will neither lend lend eare to my affection, nor your intreaties. 'Tis the life of that stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who without doubt hath bewitched you, since you love him even after he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himselfe your enemy, and without regarding so many generosities which should perswade him, hath done what in him lay to deprive you of your life. Phelismond the most noble of men, answered so advantagiously for his Rivall, that his Master imposed him silence.</p>
                  <p>I will hold my peace, Sir, (replied he) since your Majesty commands me; but I must submi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>nd, replied the King, tis too much, anger me no more, and call to minde that my crowne and amity deserve your care of pleasing me. Phelismond would no longer exasperate his Master; but put off further discourse of that businesse till another time. Polexander was this while in prison very well treated, and served with as much care as if he had beene even in the Island of Alcidiana.</p>
                  <p>Besides, Phelismond who was not able to be wearied with shewing his generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse towards him, sollicited his deliverance, but his Master grew obstinate in refusall. One day, when the Favourite had but two or three woundes yet open, he would needs try his last indeavour, and utmost power, to see whether his Kings minde might be changed, and to that end made to him a long and well laboured Oration, desirous to remonstrate by all waies of reason, as well of State, as of what was seemely and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofull, that he ought very honorably to send home Polexander. The King answered according to his custome, and Phelismond replied according to his owne, so that at last they grew both so hot, that they were long time in contestation. But when the King
<pb facs="tcp:54727:140"/>
saw his reasons were too obstinately disputed and opposed by those of Phelismond, he arose all in choler, and being unable to containe himselfe any longer: Content your selfe (said he to him) that you have displeased me, and never speake to me more of a man who shall feele how heavy that Kings arme is, who will not be wronged without a just punishment. Phelismond then growing calmer, and more humble, as his Master waxt hotter: Sir (said he) tis most just, you be obeyed, and most of all that I receive an infliction for my losse of respect; I therefore here vow never to supplicate for ought that may displease you. This humility of Phelismonds met with the King so much transported from himselfe, that it won nothing of him. He walked with hasty strides in the chamber, without turning his eyes towards Phelismond, and on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine thrusting open a window which looked into the Pallace great garden, he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there about a quarter of an houre, musing and disgesting his choler. Longer had he beene there, but for the shriecks which on the suddaine were heard behind him. He turned his head, and saw that Phelismond servants and Chyrurgions were round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his bed, and held him for dead.</p>
                  <p>He ran thither, and found that poore Prince in the most pitifull posture could be i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined. He was fallen in a swound, or to say better, as it were drowned in his own blood. His woundes were all open and the bloud which came not out but drop by drop, was a certaine signe there was not much more behinde in his veines. His body was halfe out of the bed, and his armes and head almost touched the floore. They jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged he had done himselfe that violence, because he held yet one of his swathes which because it was knit about his arme, fell not with the rest. The King yet tooke no heed to it, for he was so transported, that he could not utter a word. When the first astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was over, he commanded the Chyrurgions to use all their art for Phelismonds safety, who poore Prince lay all that day without any signe of life. The King in the meane time was extreamely afflicted, and asked every one the cause of this new disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, but no body could satisfie him. The Chyrurgions, and servants told him, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Chamber to dresse Phelismond, they found him in that deplorable manner. The King began to weigh what might cause this affliction, and could attribute it to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his owne generousnesse.</p>
                  <p>I will (said he then) save Phelismond, though I never receive satisfaction, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. After these words, he set himselfe at his beds head, and stirred not thence till he heard him sign, and thereby gave hope he had some life in him. Halfe of the night was spent ere the King retired, and yet slept not, but sent hourely to know in what estate Phelismond was. He was at the extremity the first three daies, nor was he much better the foure following, and so lay betwixt life and death till the seaventh. As soone as he began to speake ought at all, the King asked him the cause of his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence on himselfe. 'Twas the feare of displeasing you (said he) and if your Majesty think it not fit that I importune you againe, tis in vaine for you to endeavour the saving my life. He so often repeated the same discourse, that he made it appeare he was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly resolved to dye or to free Polexander. And the King howsoever, fearing to lose so incomparable a Successor, resolved absolutely to give him that satisfaction, without which he saw there was no meanes of curing him. He came then in person to visit Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, and could with much dexterity colour his rashnesse, that our Heroë confessed he deserved to be far worse dealt withall then he was. The King imbracing, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him his Sonne, said a hundred times that he rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ted of what had passed; but that the circumspection of his authority, and the ordinary mutining of his Subjects permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not to doe otherwise. That he was not ignorant how far the promises of Kings should be inviolable, and principally when they were made to Princes. But that he knew withall, that the Law of Nations gave no security, nor exempted from any ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in strange Countries, the greatest Princes of the Universe, when they came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concealed, and would not be esteemed for what they were. This being so (said he) you will grant with me we are both equally in fault. You for not making knowne your quallity, and I for being too quick with you. After Polexander had heard him speake so judiciously, he replied, 'twas he alone that was in fault, and therefore asked his pardon, and humbly besought him to believe, that had he not been compelled by a
<pb facs="tcp:54727:140"/>
necessity more urgent then all kindes of considerations to fight against Phelismond, he had not so slightly come to disturbe the Court of so great a King: The Prince replied, he would not dive into his secrets, nor engage him to discover them: But (said he) we trifle too long, let us goe visit Phelismond, and get him from that passion wherein he lies, and render to him that quietnesse he enjoyed at the very time he knew you were a prisoner.</p>
                  <p>With this he tooke Polexander by the hand, and lead him to the Pallace. Alcippus and Diceus went out with him. When the King of Denmarke was returned to his Court, he retooke Polexander, and leading him to Phelismonds bed side; see heere (said he to him) your friend, whom I have (my selfe) been to fetch to you. I will not relate to you the apparant alteration Polexanders presence wrought in the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Phelismond. He wept for joy, and found not words enough to expresse his expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. His Rivall he called the second cause of his life and his honour, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by an excesse of humility that all the honour of the combate was due to him, asked his pardon for his ill treating since, and assured him, his King had been forced by very great reasons to cause him to be staied. Whilst Phelismond was thus talking to him, the King made divers turnes in the chamber, and after he had long mused, he came to Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismond, and asked if there were any thing else to be done to content him. Phelis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond tooke hold of his hands, and transported with joy, raised himselfe halfe way up in his bed to thanke him.</p>
                  <p>Phelismond (said the King) take heed your joy bring you not into the same case your griefe had reduced you. That which is to be done by you and your friend, is to consider how you will live your selves hereafter. For my part, I promise you both that I will follow your intentions, and in all you desire there shall neither be found difficulty, nor delay. The two Rivalls thanked him with an equall resentment, and Polexander for his particular intreated him to be pleased he might speedily returne to the Canaries. The King replied, he was at his owne liberty to doe what he pleased, and when he had a minde to depart he would furnish him with men and shipping. Sir (said Polexander) since your Majesty will so much favour me, I beseech you humbly to doe it intirely. I came into Denmarke with a Gentleman and a servant, and I desire (if it please you) to returne so.</p>
                  <p>You shall doe as you list, replied the King, and finde in Denmarke as many friends, and as much observance as in your owne Territories. These complements ended, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander resolved to be gone as soone as he could, to the end he might returne againe to his wonted and unprofitable inquiry. Phelismond shewed an extremity of griefe to see him so neere leaving him, and did all he could possibly not only to retaine him, but to perswade him that his Master bore him a great deale of affection. Phelismond (said Polexander) I will not contradict those reasons, whereby the King your Master may justifie his act, nor I assure you will I ever complaine of it. For your selfe, believe it, you never have had a servant or a friend, whose love hath been more true then mine. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana shall know (if I can possibly) your value, and her aversion cannot be of that force but it may be surmounted by the infinite number of your virtues, when they shall once be made knowne to her.</p>
                  <p>When Phelismond heard his Rivall speake thus, he raised himselfe to imbrace him, and when he was as it were glued to him, made this answere. I know what I owe you, and am not so much an enemy to true honour, to fancy to my selfe I can pertake with you of any in our combate. It is intirely due to you Polexander. Go then and gather the fruits of it, and (if you please) assure Alcidiana, that the fortune of armes having confirmed the sentence of death she hath pronounced against me, I will not faile to execute it my selfe. If I toke time to doe this execution, tis for no other cause but to serve her in that person, which of all the world should be most deare unto her, and to undergoe the longer time the pennance for my offence committed, in daring to adore her without being first worthy. Phelismond (replied Polexander) if the greatnesse of your courage, were not knowne to me as it is, I should hardly suffer a discourse that wrongs the wonderfull actions of your life. Live happily, and doe not so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to our great Princesse judgement, as not to expect from it a recompence proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
<pb facs="tcp:54727:141"/>
to your deserts. Hitherto you have not beene so well treated only because you were not knowne. But when Alcidiana shall understand what Phelismond is, and heare it even from the mouthes of such whom she cannot suspect, assure your selfe she will change her opinion. Grant me then the request I am to make you before your seperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tis that you intend you recovery, and be not transported to any dispaire, till you have received a new command from Alcidiana; it you doe otherwise, I denounce on her behalfe, you shall not only offend her virtue, but demonstrated by your owne disobedience you never truely loved her. To how many new Tortures (answered Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismond) doth your request ingage me? But I refuse nothing (said he) raising his voice, since tis for the honour of Alcidiana, and the increase of her renowne. Yes, you most generous man on earth, I will punctually observe what you p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>escribe me. Yet (if you please) it shall be on condition that I may enjoy your company yet for three dayes. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander granted it, and unable to be wearied in the admiration of his valour, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him the time he desired: During which, they almost spoke of noth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ng but the virtue and beauty of Alcidiana, of the impossibillity of getting to her Island, and the number of Lovers her pictures had acquired her in all parts of the world. This inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining had not ceased, but that by the King of Denmarkes presence it was often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
                  <p>At last the three dayes being expired, the businesse was of taking of leave. Phelis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, though ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Heroe, over-joyed at his happy fullfilling of Alcidiana's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, sayl'd through the vast extention of the Germane sea, and driven by a winde, which Love seemed to fanne with his owne wings, forsook the unhappy climates of the North, to returne to the delicious countries of the South: and, seeing himselfe so much smil'd on by Fortune, he conceived no thing lesse then the infallible hope of quickly finding the inaccessible Island, and in his compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency with himselfe, durst even promise to him the possession of Alcidiana. This contentment, though imaginary, too pleasingly deceiv'd him for not incensing the Demon which had resolved to crosse all his happiness. Hee was therefore troubled from the first daies of his navigation, for as he entred the Sleeve which separates France from England, hee was like to have been lost, by meeting with an adventure extreamly tragicall. A contrary winde stopping him right against Calice, he was forced to aleere up and down a whole night, to avoid his returning back againe: As hee was in this troublesome exercise, a ship, driven by the fury of the winde, strook against his, yet so fortunatly, as hee received no other hurt then the bruising the side of his ship. This shock, awaking the most sleepy, made all think on more then was betided: Polexander would needs know who 'twas that so secretly assayl'd him, and therefore commanded his Pilot to make after. At day-break they descryed the adverse ship, and presently came up and laid her aboard. Our Heroë was the first that leapt into her; but hee was amazed when he saw nought there but an horrible solitude. Never was there presented on the sea, though it be the theater of prodigies and novelties, any thing so strange as the spectacle which astonied him. When hee was come so far as the maine mast, hee saw a most faire Lady, richly clad, ty'd to it by the hands and the feet; before her were four posts, on which were nayled the heads of four men, so fresh, that it might easily be guess'd, they had not been long severed from their bodies. The miserable spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatresse on these dreadfull objects, pitifully turned her eyes now on one, and then on another of them; and though Polexander presented himselfe before her, shee interrupted not her mournfull exercise. The Prince, noting her admirable beauty, even through her afflictions and teares, was extreamly mov'd to see her in so deplorable an estate; and imagining, because of the neernesse to France, shee might understand him if hee spake French; told her in that tongue, that hee was come to offer her all his utmost ability, either for her consolation, or revenge. The poore distressed Lady made no shew of hearing him, but kept still her eyes fixed on the distruncked heads. This attention and fixednesse doubled Polexander's astonishment, and commanded some of his followers to goe into the Cabines and descend under hatches, to see if there were any that might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand him. Alcippus and Diceus searched every where, and neither finding any one dead or alive, returned, and assured the King their Master, hee should learne nothing of that adventure, if hee had it not from the mouth of the bound Lady. Hee therefore came againe to her, and employing the best words his desire to make her speake could
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54727:142"/>
furnish him with; besought her to take heart, to think of avenging her on the cruelty of her enemies, to make use for that revenge of the assistance which heaven had sent her, and promise to her selfe from his arme a part of the satisfaction which the resentment of her griefs ought to make him wish for. He added many other considerations to these, and so pressed the miserable woman that shee cast her eyes on him, but in such a manner, that a man might say, shee saw him not: and after shee had often sighed, Why (said she sadly) come you againe to fore-slow the end of my miseries? Are you sent by that pernicious enemy, who hath brought me to the extremity I am in, to the end she may glut her malice in making me die often? Madam, (reply'd Polexander) I know not the monster of whom you speake; and would your griefe give you leave to heare mee, you should know, I come not hither for any other cause then to free you from all your torments. Your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerosity is great, (reply'd the Lady) but it can availe me nothing, unlesse you could give back againe the lives of those unfortunate wretches whose heads you see here. I wish them their lives, because I have been the cause of their deaths; and desire it, because they would disapprove my most cruell enemy, and justifie my innocence before a Prince too credulous and too easie to be deceiv'd. Polexander would faine have insensibly drawne her on, and engaged her to relate him her fortunes, had hee not been hindred by the approach of a tall ship, which streight denounc'd warre against him: Our Heroë therefore went back into his owne vessell, (but kept still the desolate Lady's grapled with his owne) and made answer to the enemies signes, by others, which stay'd the fury of those which would have assaulted him. Initantly they sent him one of theirs in a shalop, who coming up to them, asked who hee was, and for what end hee had stay'd the English ship. Polexander made reply by Alcippus, hee was a French man, and an enemy to those that would not joyne with him in the avenging a Lady whom some accursed miscreants had expos'd to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the sea. When the Messenger heard that answer, hee reply'd with a great many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and after divers threatnings, hee return'd towards his companions. No sooner was hee got on boord againe, but they fell on Polexander, and quickly repented them of their rashnesse; for our Heroë, giving them at two vollyes an hundred Cannon shot, brought them to implore his mercy. Polexander, promising their lives, commanded the conquered vessell to come neere, and entring her, found there so few souldiers, that hee was neere to put them to the sword, for daring to assayle him; but at last his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy getting the upper hand of his resentment, he pardoned all; and seeing one of a better aspect and presence then the rest, called him aboord his owne ship: Hee asked him in particular, why hee would not accept of friendship when hee had offer'd it him, and what interest hee claimed in the barke that floted before them. The other humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought, that, before hee reply'd, hee would doe him the honour to make known whether the Lady in the other ship were yet alive: our Heroë assured him shee was when hee left her. Try then (said hee) to get to her againe, that you may the second time preserve her life; for had you not broken the designe for which wee set to sea, shee had been, by this time, at the bottome of the Ocean. Goe then, goe (if you please) and finish what you have begun; and doe not think, in succouring that unfortunate Lady, you doe onely an act of Charity, for you execute likewise another of Justice. You will protect innocence against Calumny; and a wretched, and disarmed goodnesse, against a powerfull, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable villany. Polexander, unwilling to heare any more of that discourse, till hee had freed from danger the persecuted Lady, got her bark againe, which had but turned, and by consequence, was not gone farre off. As soone as hee had her, hee went aboord, and his prisoner with him, who presently ran to the Lady, and making himself knowne, Be of good heart, Madam, (said hee) your innocence is acknowledged; the accusations of your stepmother are found untrue, and the Prince, your husband, is even desperate for not knowing how fortune hath disposed of you. The Lady, by a modest smile, seeming to be pleased with what was spoken, lifted her eyes to heaven, since she could not her hands; and after shee had some time kept them fixedly open, sweetly let fall their lids, and droop'd her head on her incomparable breast. Polexander, thinking shee was swounded, cut the cords from her armes, whilst the Prisoner did the like to those on her legs; and wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>n shee was unbound, laid her all along. Diceus presently came in, and looking on her, told his Master shee was dead. The King could hardly beleeve that ill newes, but being confirmed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54727:142"/>
by his owne sense, hee could not otherwise then bewaile the losse of that innocent Lady, and wish from heaven a just punishment on her persecutors, which instantly hapned; And thus Polexander's mariners, descrying an English ship bearing up to them, called out, they were like to be set on. Before our Heroë was disengaged from his pious and charitable endeavour, hee saw the English vessell fall fiercely on his. His Prisoner infallibly doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the businesse, My Lord, (said hee to Polexander) let not the coming on of these men trouble you, they come for her assistance who is not now capable of it; and if heaven doe not av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rt the sequele of begun mischiefes, I foresee yet more violent ensuing deaths then the former. Scarce had he spoken these words, but hee heard most fearfull and lamentable cries from the English ship; and presently after saw a man of a good aspect, and middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, who violently drawing an old woman by the arme, forced her to follow him. Come (said hee to her) cruell, and jealous mother; come and see the innocent Eolinda in those miserable torments which thy calumnies have inflicted on her. Excuse not thy self by the excesse of love. Eolinda's afflictions are the product of thy envy and ambition. The love thou feign'dst to beare me, is but a cunning and deceitfull vizard, under which thou hast alwaies hidden hatred to this innocent. Polexander, having some glimpse (of what had passed) amongst so much obscurity, thought that the English man who complained had need to be arm'd against those which the death of Eolinda, and despair were about to throw on him. Hee therefore, with his Prisoner, went to him, but before hee could speak a word to him, the English man perceiving the Prisoner, Altoph, said hee to him in fury, what have they done with Eolinda? My Lord, answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But the old woman, whom he drew alter him, resisting, hee was forced to give a strong pull to make her follow him, and when hee had his foot on the side of the vessell, his heart failing him, hee fell down, his head foremost, between the two ships, and dragg'd his mother a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d so well, that one of them coming from under water, lighted on the English mans mother. Those that were gotten into the shalops, seeing him come up, made to him, and tooke him in with his booty. But the taking her out of the sea sav'd not her life, for whether she had hurt herselfe in falling, or that her age had not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rength enough to resist the harmes shee had received: shee dy'd as soone as they had her into that Lady's ship, whom shee had so cruelly afflicted; for her son they saw him no more after his fall, he having the happinesse in his unfortunate end, not longer to survive his deare Eolinda. Polexander griev'd very much for his losse, because hee judged by his actions, (which hee saw) and by the words hee had spoken, that hee lov'd much and was very generous. This consideration giving him a desire to know his adventures, he called his Prisoner, and told him, hee should not returne into England till hee had pay'd him his ransome: But doe not imagine (said hee) that I will have an ordinary one; you must tell me the beginning of those things, of whose lamentable end I have been a spectator. After he had thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his minde to the English man, and saw him ready to pay his ransome in the coine he demanded, he commanded his pilot to steere on his first course, and to all the English to follow him. This order being given and presently put in execution, Polexander shut himselfe into his cabin with his prisoner, and intimating his desire to heare him, obliged the other to begin thus: Henry the Seventh, that now reignes in England, is come to the crowne, by waies which some hold very honourable, and others very faulty. However, he was compell'd to make the body of his predecessor a staire to mount up by to his throne; and to ruine many great families, not onely to take from his enemies the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king head against him, but likewise to conferre on his adherents such dignities and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, as were proportionable to the services he had received. Hee, whom you lately saw buried in the sea, by these revolutions, being rais'd from an ordinary Gentle-man, to the degree of a Prince, and from a man much necessitated, to immense riches, thought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then of giving his curious and voluptuous senses, things fitting not onely to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54727:143"/>
satiate, but to keep them in a perpetuall appetite. Amongst all his passions, that of love was the most violent: this torrent, which had beforetimes been restrained by two power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full damms, travell, and necessity; having at last broke through them both, by the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of wealth and peace, so spread it selfe beyond his bounds, that it ran through all the English shires, and thence into France. For this Prince enquiring after some beauty, on whom hee might fixe all his affections, was so nice in his choice, that among the infinity of beauties which flourish in our Isle, he thought none worthy of his perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Hee therefore sent those, of whom hee made use in those plots of love, into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germany, and France, to chuse him some beauty, not onely of capacity to vanquish him, but to continue also a long time victorious. They found not in Scotland, nor Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, any one from whom they could promise him that miracle. France was the place which in the opinion of these new Judges of beauty, had wherewithall to content the nicety of their Master. After they were come from the court into the Provinces, they met with this rare and to be lamented beauty, whom inconstant fortune, by an abhorred trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, depriv'd of an heart whereof she should have been eternally victorious. But I speak not as I ought, Eolinda hath lost nothing of that glory which her charmes had acquir'd her. You have seen her depart the world with palmes in her hands, triumphing over all calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, cruelty, and jealousy, and, in a word, over all those enemies who had plotted her ruine. But I am too long in the relation of an adventure which cannot be too soon end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The English Prince's Negotiators sent him word, they had found the Phoenix he had been searching in so many severall countries. That how nice, nay how loathing soever hee were, hee would approve of their choice, and even find in it such rarities as his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination could not figure to him. That the beauty they had discover'd was of lustre, live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and full of majesty; of an age that had nothing of infancy, but the freshnesse, and sweet, and round fulnesse; of an admirable wit, but milde, and obsequious; of an illustrious birth, but by the mediocrity of her fortunes, ignorant of all pride and insolence. At the only recitall of these wonders, our Prince became passionately in love: he burnt, he grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and would even have abandon'd the place he held neere his Soveraigne, to go testifie himselfe to that visible Angell, with what flames of love shee environed him without the seeing her. But those who had power over his inclination, and principally his mother, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained his first agitations, and strove even to smother this growing passion. He grew an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at their remonstrances, and without neglecting the respect which nature obliged him to preserve; he discreetly made knowne to his mother, that love was a thing more imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and of greater power then maternity. In briefe, he wrote to his Agents they should make all necessary overtures, but not engage themselves till they had sent, and he received her picture. He was obeyed in it, and so conformably to his intention, that he accus'd his Confidents of stupidity, or envy, for describing the faire French Lady far lesse attractive then hee found her. He presently sent them commission to treat with the Parents of that beauty, and the conditions he propos'd being infinitely beyond their hopes, he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with a great many thankes; and the faire and innocent Eolinda being delivered into the hands of the English, was soone after presented to her lover. I will not speak of his overjoyednesse, his transports, and extasies, at the sight of that beauty. I cannot better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the greatnesse of it to you, then in telling you it cannot be done. Once the admirable Eolinda was brought to London, and receiv'd, not onely by private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but by the King and Queen, with so many tokens of estimation, that she could conceive her happinesse to be but a dreame, or an enchantment: Oh, how happy had she been, had shee dy'd in those fortunate times! Truely, for her quiet sake 'tis to be wished it had hapned then, but it had not been so much for her glory: For the proofes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and generousnesse she hath since made evident to the world, (if we consider well of things) is the most faire and noble part of her life. Within a little while of her arrivall, her marriage was celebrated, and that with such justs, turnies, maskes, and other gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as the Kings owne was not more magnificent. You may well imagine what the Prince's joy was for that day; 'twas incomparable, and followed by a satisfaction which had lasted till this day, if it had been possible, a man extreamly in love, and exceeding knowing in the worlds corruption, had been capable of possessing, without jealously, a Lady so wonderfully desired. Yet this poore Prince, (at least I will beleeve so) had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54727:143"/>
been free from that cruell fate in marriage, if even those, who were obliged to divert his suspicions, had not fomented them. He had not been married a yeer, I speak according to mine owne accompt; for according to his 'twas not a day, when his mother who was a Scottish woman, and who with her milk had suck'd in all that could be of hair-braind, savage, and cruell in Scotland, became jealous of the power of her daughter in Law, and enraged with the diminution of her authority. She kept it secret, or made it known but to her most particular Confidents: For to undertake any thing against Eolinda, was to put her self to the hazzard of her owne ruining; and in that this stepmother placed the height of her misfortune. But after she had a long time undergone it, she resolv'd to quit her self of it at what price soever; and falling into all those extremities whereto a wicked woman is incident, intended either to perish her self, or to ruinate the authority of her rivall. In the meane time, this young Princesse was admir'd of all; desired of many, and serv'd, but without her consent, by two young Lords, who flattered themselves with the hope of winning her, either by the profusion of their riches, or by the greatnes of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices &amp; constancy. They are now dead, and I may therefore speak of them without being accused of flattery. I will say then, take from their lives the fault of attempting against the honour of a married woman, there could be nought found in them but exceeding rare qualities and most eminent vertues. This unhappy love, which disturbes the most perfect harmony, and makes desolate the most flourishing families, with one selfe-same arrow pierced the hearts of these two young Lords. They sighed one griefe, they burnt in one desire, they attempted one designe, and yet concealed that from one another, and never spoke of the disease which they equally suffer'd. The youngest was an Earle of an high heart, daring spirit, and so free an humour, that hee, thought he committed an offence, not in affecting any faire subject, but to affect it and not make it knowne. The other, who was two yeeres elder then he, was no lesse free and generous; but he affected fame lesse then vertue, and so that he performed worthy actions, it imported him not whether it came to the knowledge of any man or no. Being of this humour, 'twas no hard matter for him to hide his passion, observe silence, and keep that respect whereto Eolinda's vertue, and the quality of her husband ought to oblige him. The one then by a prudent boldnesse, and the other by a generous timorousnesse advanced unperceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably his designe; and let no day passe without trying to make knowne to Eolinda there was in their civilities something more then that which is spoken onely by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and cometh from franknesse of humour. She no sooner doubted of their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but she dextrously avoided their converse, and behav'd her selfe more coldly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, then the agreeablenesse of the Court permits. But when she saw these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies were not strong enough to cure so great an ill; she feign'd she was sick her selfe, and was neere two moneths from visiting the Queen, that her long absence might heale those whom her presence had wounded. But 'tis bootlesse to pretend by resisting to have the upper hand of generous spirits. Those two young Lords perceiving that Eolinda's sicknesse was a disease that might prove mortall to their affection, had recourse alike to preservatives and speciall remedies. They prepar'd themselves to suffer for a long time, to dissemble much, and to grow obstinate against all difficulties. They even gave thanks to love, that in Eolinda they met with a vertue able for a long time to exercise their great courage. On the other side, Eolinda beleeving they thought no more on her, left her chamber, return'd to the Queen (who could not almost live without her) and came againe with a lustre which she had not before her feigned malady. If the ordinary gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants did redouble their sighes at the sight of this new Sun, imagine what the two true Adorers did. Their quality gave them accesse every where where the King was, and their gentlenesse had acquired them so much familiarity amongst the Ladies, that the Queen her selfe missed them as often as they were not in her matches and associations. These priviledges were the cause why Eolinda could not avoid the occasions of seeing them. She must in spight of her selfe endure it, or make it knowne, (and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence make a noise) and she found no lesse perill in the one, then in the other. For on the one side, she considered, that should she endure this research, without disclosing it to the Prince, and he should come to the knowledge of it by some other who might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, he would have just cause to beleeve she was very well contented with it. On the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54727:144"/>
other side, she represented to her selfe, that in making shew of her discontent, she should be the subject of all the Court talke, give a faire pretext to all detraction to invent what it lift for her destruction; and what more troubled her, she should engage the Prince her husband in those broyles, as could have none other then a dismall successe. On these considerations, she took a way, worthy a soule, high and faire as her owne. Shee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to endure all the extravagances, all the talke and prattle, and all plaints of those two lovers, as long as they could be interpreted to her advantage, and thought on but as the ordinary freedome of entertainment or gallantry of young men. But if ever they hapned to make known their love to her, or to search for occasions to see her in private, she resolv'd with her selfe to discover it to her husband. After this resolution for six moneths, was she forced to suffer the follies of those two lovers. She heard them every day sighing by her, she saw them blush, waxe pale, and muse in beholding her, and many times she was compell'd to shift place, that she might not heare the excessive praises which they gave her beauty. But heaven having denoted the fatall point, where the mis-fortunes of so many illustrious personages should have their beginning; the Earle broke his long observed silence, and, by mischance, seeing Eolinda as she was going in to the Queen, stay'd for her at the going forth of that chamber where she was to leave her squire and women. He intercepted her in the passage, and humbly besought her to accept of his attending to the Queens privy chamber. She trembled from head to foot, seeing her selfe in a straight which shee had so often, and so carefully avoided: and standing steadfast, was so some small time without walking and answering. The young Lover in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting this disquiet to his owne advantage, thought he was no indifferent man with the Princesse; and to oblige her by his discretion not to be frighted another time. I see well, Madam, (said he) I have committed an incivility, in thinking to tender you a small proofe of my most humble servitude. I will doe penance for it; and, to make it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to what the greatnesse of my fault requires from me, I condemne my selfe to passe the rest of this day, without the being enlightned by those faire eies which onely give me sight and life. In saying so, he made her a great reverence, and so left the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Eolinda. The mother in law to the Princesse, at the same instant coming out of the Queens chamber, entred into that where our Lover took leave of his Mistresse: The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Scottish woman saw the last complement, perceiv'd her daughters confusednesse, noted she blusht at her seeing her; and when she came neere, she found her so troubled, shamefac'd, and confounded, that had she bin lesse wicked then she was, she would not have forborne to beleeve there were very particular intelligences between that Princesse and the young Earle. Presently she resolv'd to draw a great advantage out of that meeting; and in her malice causing in her some thoughts of the Divinity, which could not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wise then as of a man as wicked as her self, she gave thanks to it for what she had seen, with a prayer to be assisted in what she went about to enterprise for the ruine of her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in law. The unfortunate Princesse being a little come to her selfe, would have made her some excuses, but the abominable hagge spoke thus: Doe not trouble your selfe to seeke for excuses, that's for me to doe, for coming so unseasonably to trouble you: and with that went her wayes directly to her son, to give him, under pretext of affection, the mortall blow which hath so tragically made him expire before you. He was not at home, and though the old woman sent on all sides to find him, and to effect his coming her as speedily as hee could: yet for that time her devilishnesse had no successe, and got not the Prince to swallow her poyson, till after Eolinda had strengthned him with an excellent Antidote. The Princesse seeing her selfe falne into that misfortune she so long feared, did nothing all the while she was with the Queen, but consult with her self in what manner shee might make that ill potion pleasing which she was to give to the Prince her husband. Presently shee turn'd her thoughts on heaven, implor'd assistance from thence, and its testimony in so tender a businesse; and petitioned to be from thence furnished with words which should be proper for the confirming the Prince in that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had continually held of her chastity. Shee had no sooner made this prayer, but her agitations and feares left her, her mind retook its former serenity, and as her face was sensible of the troubles of her soul, so did it also resent the recovery of her quiet. Shee was with the Queen all the evening, and was so pleasing in her conversation, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54727:144"/>
her husband who came thither with the King, could not sufficiently admire her sweet humour. The King and the Queen being retir'd, the Prince and Eolinda did so too, and being come home, severed themselves for different businesses. The husband entred his withdrawing chamber to dispatch his most urgent affaires, and the wife into her Oratory to implore againe assistance from above; and petition for that powerfull and necessary art whereby truth may be beleeved by her greatest enemies. Whilst she was in this exercise, her husband came into the Oratory: I know not (said he) what my mother would have with mee, shee hath sent five or six times, man after man, and intreates mee to goe to her before I goe to bed, about something that concernes me more then my life. What doe you think it should be? Eolinda, who was risen as soone as shee heard her husband, My Lord, (said shee) I will tell you if you please; but since 'tis a thing which should not be knowne to any but your selfe, be pleased I may shut the doore, that I may the more freely speake to you. The Prince did it himselfe, and holding her between his armes, with as much joy as a covetous man fixeth his eyes on his treasure: Tell mee (said hee) this strange businesse, and falsifie it not, for feare you anger me: what bitternesse soever there be in it, I shall there finde sweetnesse, since I have it from thy faire lips. Eolinda considering the kind speeches of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as so many witnesses of that miraculous assistance shee was to receive from the goodnesse shee had implor'd: took a crosse which was on her deske, I desire (said shee to him) to lose that part of salvation which was wrought on that tree whereof this is the figure, if in the matter you command mee to relate, I either adde or diminish any thing for my justification. The Prince much astonished to see his wife at the end of so blithe a humour to fall into an act so serious: Is it in good earnest, or in jest (said hee) that you have put on such an austere countenance? Those things I make use of (repli'd Eolinda) are too sacred and venerable to be imploy'd for so profane an use. My Lord. I speak in earnest, and I humbly beseech you to beleeve, the businesse is the most serious and important that you ever had yet in handling. Without doubt (repli'd the Prince, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) my honor is in question; my mother hath discover'd that Eolinda hath her gallants. Well, well, henceforward I shall take better heed to what concernes me. Ah! my Lord, (cry'd Eolinda) if it be true that I am dear to you, and that I hold of your heart by stronger bonds, then those of I know not what you call beauty; I beseech you not to jest with that which regards your honour, and to grant me at last the request I have so often made to you. What request, repli'd the Prince? 'Tis, my Lord, that you would take me from Court, and draw me by a most pleasing absence from thence out of a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which every day renewes it selfe. The Prince laughing now with a better heart then he had done, I see then (said hee) that I have divin'd it; and thereupon embracing his wife againe, Tell me (said hee) who are your gallants and how many be there of them? I will waite on them, and bring them to thee. Eolinda, that could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this scoffing, got from her husband, and casting her selfe at his feet, Doe not make mee beleeve, my Lord, that we are no more the same we have been hitherto. Doe mee justice, examine my life and my offence, and throw me not headlong by your indifferency from the top of all felicities, where your onely goodnesse had rays'd mee. The Prince desirous to give his wife the content she desired, grew to be serious in spight of himselfe, and granted her all the audience she requested. Eolinda forgot not the least particularity of her meeting with her lover, and her mother in law; and having related all, would have falne on long justifications. But the Prince her husband stopping her, You are a foole (said he) and if respect could permit it, I would say that my mother is not very wise. You both vainly trouble your selves, the one for having too much experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the other for having too little. But I will take order this trouble go no further, and get not to mee. I confesse, my Lord, (repli'd Eolinda, sighing) I have but little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; yet have I enough to know that of the like sparkles which have not been quenched in their births, there have proceeded such flames, that the least distrustfull have been the first involved in them. Never trouble your selfe about it (repli'd the Prince) I will so well smother these, that they shall neither fear nor hurt you. Do you so too, and suffer not a poor lover whom you burn so.—He could not make an end of his new gybe, for Eolinda put her hand on his mouth, and wept with so much violence, as if her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54727:145"/>
had made her undergoe some cruell effects of a true jealousie. Hee so left her to comfort her self at leisure, and went to his mother, who after the long discourse to him of a cunning and scandalous old woman, ended it by this pernicious conclusion: That that man hath neither honour nor courage, who suffers his wife to take those freedomes which may be ill interpreted. Then shee filled his head with examples of fore-passed times, represented to him how much the present were perverted, how dangerous the Courtiers were, and what a hard thing it was to preserve a great deale of vertue, with a great deale of beauty. This discreet son gave his mother leave to speak as long as shee would; but when she was weary, and yet not satiated with depraving the innocent Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda, in these few words hee answered her: I must needs take a liberty to me, which at first will not seem respectfull enough to you. Yet could you retire into your selfe, and make your selfe mistris of that choler which hath as it were plucked you thence, you would acknowledge my freedome to be very just. Be pleased not to interrupt me and permit me to tell you, I never expected from a person, so filled with honour and vertue as you, a discourse so declining, and so much an enemy to them both. 'Tis the annotation, or signe of true goodnesse, to interpret all others actions to the best sense; and not to beleeve them ill, till a long time after there is no permission to doubt them so. But now, in lieu of calling to mind who you are, and of observing those lawes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on you by your owne vertue, you would become a slanderer, and insteed of judging my wife by your selfe, your judgement of her is no otherwise then if it had come from one of the pratling gossips of the Court. If through too much love of me you have so grosly erred, I beseech you to lessen some part of your affection, to the end you may not hazzard the making the like slips; and to beleeve, that Eolinda, having you for her domesticall example, will preserve alwaies an infinity of vertue, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany an extremity of beauty. The old woman growing mad at her sons wise remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances wonderfully upbrayded him, reviled him, and threatned him with her maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, protesting shee would never take any more into her consideration either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or his affaires. The night will better advise you, (repli'd the discreet Prince) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to be led by it, and when your choler is over, to reflect on your self and me, that you may know who is most faulty. In the meane time I bid you goodnight, and so presently went away. The old woman, all enraged, being got to her bed, and unable to take any rest, by reason of her rage and malice, which equally deny'd it her, spent the best part of the night in devising new plots for Eolinda's destruction. When she laid the ground of her abominable devices, she rejoyced with her selfe at her good inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and turning her thoughts on the small regard her sonne had to her advertisements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His father did the like, (said she) the first time my enemies would have made him jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. But a little while after he made me know well enough that he had swallowed the poyson which in all appearance he had utterly rejected. All manner of men, how ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and wise soever they be, nay, though they have never so good an opinion of their wives, are apt to be caught in this trap, if they be brought to it by a dextrous and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning contriver. My sonne, who now laughes at my advice, and would for a need turne Knight errant, to maintain the honour of Ladies, shall not passe this night without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then once on the young Earle. He will represent him to his owne thoughts, yet more faire and gallant then he is. He will say to himselfe, that man leanes on a weak prop, who trusts to the vertue of a woman; and I dare lose my life, if the first journey hee makes, he wake not in the night, to ponder on what may be done at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and going further on, My wife (will he say) may now doe somewhat else then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my absence. This accursed woman, having spent all the night in these execrable meditations, arose with the Sun, and resolv'd the same day to begin, and wholly betake her selfe to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> designe. Scarce was shee drest, when the Prince, her sonne, sent to know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> she did, and to aske leave to visit her. She had resolv'd before in the night to come in to him againe, because, without that good correspondency, she saw no meanes to ruinate Eolinda. She therefore told her sonnes Gentleman, she should be glad to see him. As soon as she heard it, he came to her, and accosting her with all the excuses and submissions which a good sonne should make use of for the satisfaction of those who brought him into the world, kissed her oftentimes, and entreated her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get

                  </gap>eigned she had no grudge at all at her, but that she loved the Princesse as if shee were her owne daughter. To perfect this reconciliation, shee went and dined with her son, and so cunningly forced her humour, that the innocent Eolinda overjoyed at the cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shings of the old woman, thought her selfe at the height of her happinesse. She related to her with the sincerity of a pure soule, all the affliction she had suffered by her to Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, besought her to be a meanes for their period by one way or other, and to take that businesse into more consideration then the Prince her son had done. The old woman seeing so good a beginning to her enterprise, doubted not of the successe; she therefore promised her daughter in law all her assistance, assured her of her affection, and then changing her minde and discourse, according as her malice prompted her, forgot what she had told her sonne the evening before, and read to her daughter lessons of far higher licentiousnesse, and Court gossiping. The innocent Lady blushed at the indiscretion of her stepmother, and to let her know, that she was not so simple as not to discerne what the befittingnesse of her condition permitted, from what it permitted not: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse (said shee to her) it is impossible to live in the Court as in a cloyster; wee must be seen and talked withall whether we will or no. But 'tis not fitting, that by the affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some gesture or ornament which is not usuall, wee should draw on us the eyes of young men: For my owne part, I have ever been of opinion, that none can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame, (though it be not done of purpose) contribute any thing to the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of so many fooles wherewithall the Court is composed. The old woman perceiving Eolinda's minde was not to be infected by the contagion of her maximes, sought for some spirits lesse strong to corrupt them. She had prefer'd to her Daughter in law a Gentleman-usher, and a Gentlewoman of her chamber, and thought those might be very fit instruments to set her engines on work which she could not agitate her selfe, without discovering her designe. She therefore spoke to those two whom she had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the most savage of the highland Scots, that is, from among beasts lesse ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall then wilde bores or beares; and commanded them to have recourse to her as secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they could, to heare of such things whereby they might in short time attaine to great fortunes. Pantaira, so was the Chamber-maide called, fail'd not the next day to be at the old womans uprising, and to make knowne her hopes solely depended on her, declaimed against the French pride, and the imperious severity of Eolinda. The old woman, delighted with these depravings, told Pantaira, that if she had been heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, her son had never fetched a wife from the enemies of her nation. But (said she) why doe not you speak to me of your Mistris subtility, as well as of her pride. She doth not think her selfe meanly faire, nor is she of those who neglect their beauty to avoid the importunity of Lovers. Ah! Madam, (repli'd Pantaira) I have something to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to you of good importance on that subject. What? hastily asked the old woman. 'Tis (answered Pantaira) a secret not yet vented. The Earle of Lettidur is desperately in love with my Lady: I cannot tell you whether she know it, but I may well say, hee doth his utmost to winne me for him, and solicites me by the best of my friends: hee promiseth me what I would aske, so he might have my service for him to my Lady, and deliver her his letters. Thou wouldst say, the Earle of Trinobant, repli'd the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Pardon me, Madam, (said Pantaira) 'tis the Earle of Lettidur, who, within this yeare and halfe, is returned from Italy. The old woman entertaining with all her heart this new occasion for Eolinda's ruine; And is that Earle (said she to the perfidious Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taira) so enamoured on thy Mistris? He is so farre gone (repli'd Pantaira) as he would gladly winne her favour with all the meanes his father hath left him. He is continually prosecuting his intention; and when my Lady is where hee cannot see her, hee present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes to my friend; and never comes thither but to discourse of his love, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige her by his gifts to perswade me to serve him. That woman is become rich with his presents within two or three moneths; and but for the feare of disobeying you, I had had a good share in his liberalities. Thou hast done well (said the old woman) in not engaging thy selfe in that commerce without my knowledge. But now when 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoovefull for my sonnes satisfaction, that wee know all the Earle of Lettidur's intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deale boldly with him, promise thy service, let him see what credit thou hast with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54727:146"/>
thy mistris; in a word, take all he will give thee, and make him hope he shall possesse all he can desire. After she had so well instructed the chamber maid, she dismissed her; and the very evening of the same day, finding a convenient time to speak with Eolinda's Usher, Lycambus, (said shee) I begin to complaine with thee, for the small benefit accrewes to thee from thy service: had I thought my daughter in law would have done no more for her servants, I had been more wary of taking thee from thy former place, to make thee loose thy time in serving so ill a mistris; but there is an occasion presents it self, wherein, without being beholding to her, thou mayst raise thy self an honest fortune. I will assist thee in what I can, and promise thee withall, the same from my son. Be then thine own friend, hazard thy self for thy advancement, and make use of the means I will shew thee. The Earle of Trinobant is extreamly in love with thy mistris, and hath an intent to imploy thee in his suit; my sonne knowes it from a good hand, and inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he is confident of thy fidelity, and that it much imports him to know all the Earles pretentions: he desires thou wouldst prevent him, and handsomly go offer him thy service. Fit thy selfe therefore to make good use of this occasion, obey punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thy masters commands, and worke those furtherances which may be necessary for thee to screw thy self into the Earles trust, and confidence. Lycambus who had no more braines then a horse, ne're thought of asking time to give an answer to her propositions The first thing he took hold on was that of gain; he grew dazled with the lustre of his approaching fortune, and scarce being able to contain himself in his excesse of joy, was like to expresse the height of it by throwing his armes about the necke of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. She hindered that brutishnesse, and told Lycambus he should yet have more then he expected, provided, he were vigilant, ready, faithfull, and above all extreamly secret. Lycambus laugh'd at these conditions, as at things which were easy to be perform'd, and so returned to his mistris, with a firm resolution to bet ray her assoon as possibly he could. In the mean time the innocent Lady beleeving she had fully justified her selfe and shut up for ever those winds, which are wont to trouble the calmes of wedlocke, sail'd securely on an unfaithfull sea. And inlarging her self from her usuall severity, at the intreaty of her husband, and counsell of her false mother in law, tooke delight in tricking her self, and to make it appeare that the French beauties are not parallel'd but by themselves. She was the glory of the English court; and acquiring still new charmes by the quietnesse of her mind, and the extream love of the Prince her husband, made as many conquests, as there were sensible hearts. But amongst so many different passions, there were none like those of the two Earles, their desires increased every moment, and their impatiency made them have recourse to the most extraordinary remedies, to get them some little lessening of pain in so great a malady. Pantaira and Lycambus fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the order prescrib'd, offered themselves to these sick men, and so highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd the goodnesse of their drugs, that they sold them at their owne price. Pantai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, receiving at first a quantity of jewells from the Earle of Lettidur, took a letter hee had written to Eolinda, and promis'd to deliver it to her. I dare sweare she durst not so much as name him to her, much lesse deliver his letter. Yet she made that Lover beleeve, it was receiv'd and read with a signe of affection, and by the answers shee made him her self by word of mouth, oblig'd him to write above a dozen; all which she shewed to the pernicious old woman, and by her counsell, hid them in the bottome of a cabinet wherein Eolinda's jewells lay. On the other side, the Earle of Trinobant beleeving he had found a treasure in acquiring Lycambus friendship, wholly reli'd on him; and indeed he was so well serv'd for his money, that Eolinda went no where but he had notice of it. 'Twas to small purpose her seeking out the Churches least frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for feare of meeting him, for being betray'd by her Usher, the Earle was alwaies there before her, She could not make a visit, but she there met the same displeasure, and if by chance she scap'd his importunities, she was sure to be persecuted by those of the Earle of Lettidur. Who, poore abused Lover, imagining (according to Pantaira's assurance) that she affected him, oftentimes would let slip some words, and intreat Eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda not to treate him worse in publick, then she did in private. She that was far from understanding his speech, could not but be offended at it, and told the Earle one day, he wrong'd such personages as were powerfull enough to make him repent of it. I have
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54727:146"/>
done, (repli'd the Earle) and since you are so scrupulous, I will not take the boldnesse to entertaine you any more, but by my usuall mediatour. Eolinda was as far from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he meant by these words, as by the former; yet she fear'd lest there were a great deale of venome hidden under them: and as soon as she was alone with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, renew'd her complaints to him, and entreated he would goe passe away some moneths in a faire house he had some twenty miles from London on the side of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Thames; but hee gave no more heed to her request now, then he had done before. Yet, a while after, by the diabolicall subtlety of his mother, perceiving some commerce between Pantaira and the Earle of Littidur, and the like between Lycambus and the Earle of Trinobant, he began a little to suspect, not the vertue of his wife, but the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidy of those two mercenary soules. He therefore set a watch on their deportments, and since these watches had order not to hide themselves from him, 'twas an easie matter for him to take them in the manner, as he did Pantaira, coming out from her copesmate, who gave her a letter which she had newly receiv'd from the Earle of Littidur. He read it, and finding therein some passages, not only of one amourous, but of an amourous man much belov'd againe; he was like to have cast himself headlong in the Thames, on whose banckes he walked and read the letter: But he with-held, and would not act so notable a folly, after he had made shew of so much discretion. He kept the letter, and commanded Pantaira to say nothing of what had betyded her on paine of her life. When he was come home, he shut himselfe up in his closet, and after he had a while suffered himselfe to be swayed by the impetuosity of his anger, he recollected himselfe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting as hee had been dis-interessed in a businesse of so great weight: I see not yet (said hee) but some light presumptions; for to beleeve a thing so beyond appearance, 'twere not too much to have the testimony both of mine eyes and eares. I must not make known my resentment, but to very good purpose, nor discover this secret to my mother, but in case of extremity: For hating Eolinda as she doth, she will never leave till she have forc'd me to work her confusion. Let me reserve to my selfe the knowledge of this matter, and not give that advantage to my enemies, to publish to them my self, my weaknesse, and dishonour. In this good resolution he abode some few daies, and had power enough over his thoughts, to disclose nothing of so intricate and perple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed a businesse. But Fortune, or rather the Justice of heaven, which would deprive this poore Prince of those felicities, for which he had been unthankfull, let him fall into the pit he had digg'd himselfe. The King, who had been inform'd by some of his spyes, of the Earle of Littidurs practices, told the Prince of it, and advis'd him not to be so farre a good husband, as not to take into his consideration the preserving his royall house from dishonour. Imagine whether this counsell touched him to the quick or no. He went straight out of the Palace, and walk'd towards the Earles lodging, expresly to work him a mischiefe. 'Twas at twilight, and by reason of the ill weather, there was no body in the streets. When he came within twenty paces of the gate, he saw come out of it Pantaira's brother, who betook him to his heales and ranne away as fast he could. The Prince now doubted no more of the losse of his honour. I must needs praise either the wisdome or love he shewed in so cruell a combination. He went to his wife, and inventing some cause of discontent against Pantaira and Lycambus pray'd her very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to dismisse them. Eolinda, who was the best mistris of the world, took in hand the cause of her servants, and besought the Prince to tell her wherein they had offended him, promised to reprove them soundly, &amp; did what she could to obtain their pardon. If they be so fitting for you (repli'd the Prince) I will not discontent you so much as to put them from you, but you shall do me a great kindnes, if you could be without them. My L. (repli'd innocently Eolinda) if I had brought those two servants from France, I would presently have consented to their sending back again, for fear lest in retaining them, I might be suspected of some ill correspondency: but since they were prefer'd to me by the Dutchesse your mother, to have an eie over all my actions, I fear their putting away; and that apprehension throwes me at your feet, to beseech you thrice-humbly not to put from me such people as are so needfull for my quiet. The Prince left her without make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any answer; and that grace which he had too long neglected, abandoning him in that fatall instant, he lost with her all the virtues which bare her company. This unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54727:147"/>
man suffering himself to be carried away by his fury, and to be governed by two passions alike blinded, made as many falls as he made paces, and one error drawing on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, he came not to himself till it was to no purpose, but altogether unprofitable for him to do so. In this case he went to his wicked mother, who throwing brimstone into a fire already too much kindled, put him forward to those extremities which shall for ever be the grief and opprobry of England. This fourth Fury was not contented to have made him suspect the vertue of his wife; but she would withall justify her complices, and said to that poor Prince, how Lycambus and Pantaira were very excusable in their crimes, since they had not offended but out of fear of disobeying a personage who in the very instant of their disobedience, would not have failed to ruine them. This reason had been of no validity, if the Prince's wisdom had been as at other times; but in the blindnesse he was, it pass'd for a convincing argument. He return'd home thence, and made a mighty hurly-burly; and not desiring to see Eolinda, bur only to afflict her, went to lye in the towne, and stay'd three daies ere he came home againe. During that time, he was almost alwaies with his mother, and secretly sent for Lycambus and Pantaira, interrogating them, and learnt more then he desired. The businesse was, how so many accusations could be verified; and then his wifes cabinet of jewells was the most certaine proof of them. He sent to take it thence, broak open the lock, and found the Earle of Littidurs letters in it. After so many evidences, beleeving there was no more doubt to be made of his wifes dishonesty, he was so imprudent, that he never so much as ask'd those wretches how long it was since Eolinda had been engaged in affection to those two Earles; what favours they had obtained from her, which of them was best loved, where was their usuall meeting place, or at what times they met together, and many other the like particularities, which all had serv'd for Eolinda's justification. But the houre of his miseries was come: For the punishment of his sins he must be imprudent, blind, and enraged. He resolv'd with his mother to bring his wife to a castle of his by this seas side, on one side Dover; and to that end he went the next day to take leave of the King, who liked not the suddennesse of his departing. Yet hee would needs follow his owne brain, and all the supplications Eolinda could make, were not able to obtain any thing from that furious man. When he was come to his house, he shut up his innocent Lady in a chamber, whose windowes on all sides were grated with iron barres; and keeping her there two or three daies, he came at last with his mother to see her. He threw the Earle of Litridurs letters to her, and, Regard them well (said he to her) thou infamous woman. Your sport is found out, therefore aske me no more the cause of my anger. Eolinda opened the letters, read some of them, and not divining from whence they should come, because they were not sign'd: My Lord, (said she to her husband, with her wonted moderation) have these papers any thing common, or in relation with or to my disgrace? From whence come they? To whom are they directed? Why do you shew them me? See (said the old Dutchesse to her son) how cunning she is! O, how well she is vers'd in her trade! Madam, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd Eolinda discreetly) I know you are my accuser, doe me the favour not to be my Judge too. The furious Prince causing his wife to be silent, by a cruelty beyond exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Thou hast no other accuser then thy crime, (said he) nor shalt thou have any other Judges then my mother and my selfe. Answer us therefore without any falsification, and tell us what privancies you have afforded your Gallants. There is no other way to save thy selfe but that confession. My Lord, (repli'd Eolinda modestly) is it possible you should beleeve that which you aske me? But art thou thy selfe so impudent (answered the Prince) to make me that question, seeing so many witnesses which accuse thee of that crime whereof thou feignest to be ignorant? If these be the witnesses which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse me (repli'd Eolinda) they are false witnesses, for we never had acquaintance with one another. How, wretched woman, (said the Prince) can'st thou deny that the Earle of Littidur writ thee these love-letters? At the words Eolinda gave a great shriek, and melting into teares: But rather, my Lord, can you possibly beleeve it? If you have but only suspected it, Eolinda is then no longer innocent; she hath done worse then that whereof you accuse her; she hath prostituted her self; she hath lost her honour, and deserves not to live one quarter of an houre longer. This was all she said then, and since
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54727:147"/>
that time, for all their threatnings, and all the tortures presented to her, she never spoke but once when the Prince came to her chamber. Two or three daies after this cruell proceeding, that unfortunate Prince was inform'd that the Earle of Trinobant was abroad in the country with a great many of his friends, and the Earle of Littidur, disguis'd like a Fisherman, had pass'd in a barque divers times under the castle. This news startled him, and made him looke as well after his owne preservation, as well as the ruine of his pretended adulterers. After hee had meditated on diverse evasions and was to avoide that mischief, hee found none better then to force Eolinda to write to them; and under a pretext of an amourous appointment, to make them fall into the trap where he desired to catch them. To give more colour to this assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, he sent back his mother to London, and putting his wife into the custody of an old gentleman, who had alwaies very faithfully serv'd him, prepar'd himself to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Court. He took horse at full noon with all his houshold, but at the first lodging he feign'd himself sick, and put one of his Confidents into his bed to amuse the world. In the mean time he got on one of those admirable gueldings which will run you some hundred or six score miles in ten or twelve houres, and so in two and an half return'd to his house. At day-break he came into Eolinda's chamber, where he found her at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers at her beds feet. As soon as she saw him she arose, came towards him with such a respect and meeknesse as would have mov'd the heart of the most barbarous man alive; and falling at his feet, My Lord (said she to him) I hope much since I and you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in this chamber. Thou must (said he rudely) obey me, if thou wilt hope with reason. I never had any other intent (amourously repli'd Eolinda). Hear me then (said her husband) and bethink thy selfe well of the answer thou wilt make me. The Earle of Littidur and the other of Trinobant are not far hence, and without doubt, are come upon some advertisement thou hast sent them. If thou wilt save thy life thou must write to either of them according to my minde; but doe not look to be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, for I condemn thee either to write to them or dy. My Lord, (repli'd Eolinda) I do not fear death, since it is the certain repose of innocent creatures: but had I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that treason, which my enemies have constrain'd you to alledge, I should be so faulty, that I would think my self worthy all the torments prepared for the damned. Ah impudent woman (cri'd the Prince) what yet more testimonies of thy incontinency? I endure these injuries (repli'd Eolinda sweetly) because heaven hath given you all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over me; but since I am not thereby commanded to obey you, when your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are offences, be pleased that for this time I may be disobedient. Thou must then dy, said the unfortunate Prince. I am ready prepar'd, (repli'd Eolinda) strike bodly, my Lord, (said she) modestly opening her breast, I will receive the blow without fear, and blesse the hand that gave it me. I will have thine own to be the executioner (said he:) That is not yet permitted me (replied Eolinda:) besides, it would give you the greater satisfaction if you your self avenge your honour, since you beleeve I have wrong'd it. These words penetrated the hardnesse of the unhappy mans soule. In that very moment he remembred what he had been before-times. The standish and ponyard which he held, fell out of his hands, and pitifully looking on her, Would to heaven (said he) thou wert innocent! I am so, (she repli'd) yet I deceive my self: No, my Lord, I am not, since you have been capable of mistrusting me. The unfortunate Prince, not deserving the grace of coming to himself, departed the chamber, overcome, but not perswaded. He lock'd her up, and keeping about him the keyes of the door, went to walk in his Parke, to deliberate on what he should lastly resolve. As long as 'twas day he did nothing but go and come, and was above thirty times to see what Eolinda did, through a little hole in the door, and found her still on her knees, holding her eies and hands towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and understood plainly once that she beg'd thence a pardon for her persecuters, and that it would have commiseration on her husbands error. Those words almost wrought that miracle which she would have requested from heaven; and the unfortunate Prince began to be himself, when his wicked mother arrived, according as they had agreed at parting. He told her what he had done, and alledg'd the new doubts Eolinda's words had wrought in him. The abominable hagge sharply reprehended him, to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be so easily seduced; and to confirme him in his former resolution, said, That it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54727:148"/>
behoov'd him to send Pantaira and Lycambus to the two Earles, that by the successe of their voyage, he might draw the last manifestation of his wifes incontinence. Those two wretched agents were hereupon sent, and so well instructed by the old woman, that for the further misery of many innocents, their journey took alike effect. Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cambus met with the Earle of Trinobant, and propounding to him the facility of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering his mistris, and by consequence, of enjoying her; he wonne him to hazzard himself in that enterprise, with all the rashnesse of a man very young and very valiant. The brutish high-lander conducted him even to the place where his master lay in ambush to surprise him: where he was enwrap'd overloaden with cassockes and cloakes, gag'd, and so led away to the Castle. The Earle of Littidur, with the same easinesse was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in his fisher-boat, and as unworthily handled as his rivall. They were presently shut up in two chambers, and severally examined by the Prince himselfe. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd they were to blame, and had no other excuse for their offence, but the extream beauty of Eolinda, and the tyranny of love. But the Princesse (said they both) had other meanes enough to free her self of us, without blemishing her vertue by so base a treason. She needed but have made known the aversion she hath alwaies had to us; (though some traytors have told us the contrary) and we would have shewn to her by a faire death, that our lives were lesse dear to us then her favour. You shall neither of you save your selves by these crafty excuses (said the Prince). Confesse your crime, if you will have pardon. Our offence (repli'd they, each one in particular) is already confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. We do infinitly love Eolinda, and would willingly give our lives to have some small part in her good opinion. It hath not cost you so much (answered the Prince). There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepare your selves to wash away with your bloods the staine you have thrown on the house of your King. We dare die (said those unfortunate illustrious Gentlemen) but we protest to you for the discharge of our consciences, that if the intention be not a crime worthy of death, we shall die innocents. The most condemnable Prince, having lost all humanity with his reason, and being truly possest with the Devill of blood and fury, which serv'd for a soule to his mother, hastily resolv'd the death of those young Lords; and brutishly had them ponyarded by foure Irish men. After this execution done, he would have gone to the innocent Eolinda's chamber, either to have cut her throat, or done her some other bloody indignity; but as he was in a place of the staires, whence you might see Eolinda's chamber doore, he heard somebody call him by his name, and forbad him to goe further. He cast up his eyes and saw in the doore of that chamber a young English Gentleman of his houshold, who with his sword and pistoll in hand, threatned him to throw by all respect if he came any neerer. The Prince ask'd him the cause of his extravagancy. Aske me rather (repli'd the generous Englishman) the cause of my just resentment, and I will tell thee, blind and enraged Prince, that I am here to protect, as farre as my life can, the innocent Eolinda, against the persecutions of thy wicked mother. The Prince threatned to have him punished according to his desert, and commanded two of his murderers to seize on him. A great Irish villain stept forth with a partisan in his hand, but when he came within a few paces of Eolinda's generous defender, two pistoll bullets stopt his journey, and roul'd him to the bottome of the staires. His fellow, beleeving that the brave Englishman had no more fiery wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, furiously came up towards him, with an intent to strike him through with his halberd, but he had not time to perform that brave thrust, for he received a like chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his companion for the like offence committed. They perceiv'd then the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant English man had forgotten nothing of what was necessary for his long defence. Indeed, he had yet three pistolls charged, and was so advantageously placed, by reason of the thicknesse of the wall that he could not be set on but before. The Prince would have obliged the two other Irish men to revenge the death of their companions, but they would doe nothing unlesse they had peeces: They therefore brought them two long fowling peeces, and the villaines discharg'd them both on Eolinda's courageous martyr. O heaven (quoth hee, feeling himselfe shot in so many places) receive my soul and my life, which I have freely expos'd for the defence of vertue! and with those words fell downe dead; yet, for all that remained vanquisher: For the unhappy Prince, having had leisure to bethink him of the execrable murder he would have committed, or else
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54727:148"/>
with-held by the last words of the heroicall English man, return'd from whence hee came, and told his cruell mother he would never kill one whom he had so much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The damnable hagge, after she had some time grumbled, told him, he worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserv'd his dishonour, since he took pleasure in preserving the cause of it. The Prince, offended with this reply, entred the great hall of his Palace, and the first that came before him was the execrable Lycambus, who very likely came to demand the reward for his treason: And art thou there then, thou infamous and perfidious slave, by whose assistance I have lost mine honour and comfort? The miserable Scot cast himself at his feet, and the Prince, taking him by his long haire, dragg'd him about a great while, and then (with a bro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ad sword that he had) stroke his head from his shoulders. The tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to save his life, would have accused the old Dutchesse, but before he could speak a word, there was neither speech nor life in him. The Prince then called for Pantaira, but she was so close hidden, that it was impossible to meet with her. His mother see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in such a fury, ask'd him if he could not distinguish between the guilty and the innocent: You should discharge your choler (said she) on that lascivious French wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and not on those wretches who durst not disobey her. Never doubt it (said he) Eolinda shall have her punishment with the rest; but it shall be so, that no one whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of mine shall besmeare their hands in the blood of that miserable woman. Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his wit furnishing him with a new kind of punishment, he commanded that barque to be made ready, wherein you saw, the innocent Eolinda die, and cutting off the two Earles heads, and that of the charitable English man, made them to be nayl'd (with the other of Lycambus) in that manner as you saw them. Then went he into Eolinda's chamber, and though she fell into a swound at his entrance, yet he caus'd her to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the vessell, and set her in the same posture you found her. That done, he commanded all his followers out of the barque, the sayles being all hoys'd, and tow'd her into the open sea by two shalops, and then abandon'd her to the mercy of the winds. See a great many tragicall events, yet am I not at the end of all; for scarce was the Prince got up againe into his chamber, when Pantaira (it may be repenting she had been the cause of so many murders) came to him, and beseeching him to heare her, confess'd, that neither Lycambus nor her self had done any thing but by the command of his mother. Protested boldly, that Eolinda never knew ought of their practices, nor done any thing misbeseeming the vertue and honour of a most chast Lady. That shee had never seen, but in publick, any of the two Earles; and that the letters which were found in her cabinet, had been conveigh'd thither without her knowledge, and that she had never seen them. She had told more but that the old Dutchesse flew on her, and in the fury she was, would have strangled her, if she had not been taken out of her hands. The Prince in the meane while, filled with horrour at what he had heard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting presently into himself, What hast thou done, (cri'd he) unnaturall mother? I now doubt no more, Eolinda is innocent! and with those words fell into a swound, and had not I borne a part of his fall, he had infallibly broken his head against the floore of his chamber. We laid him on his bed, and whilst his faithfull servants bewail'd his misfortunes, and strove to recover him from his fainting his wicked mother caus'd Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taira to be strangled, and sent to make ready a ship of warre which lay in the rode, with a secret order to her most Confidents to make after Eolinda, and to throw her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea. All this could not be done presently. In the meane time the Prince reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his spirits, and spying me at the head of his bed: Altoph (said he) if my faults have not taken from thee that amity thou hast alwaies borne me; goe quickly, and strive to save Eolinda. If thou bring'st me her not alive, be secure thy Prince is dead. I presently went forth, not knowing where to finde a ship to goe after Eolinda; but as I came out of the Castle, those whom the old Dutchesse had sent to make an end of the innocent Lady, told me the ship was ready, and if I would be of the party, I should follow them. Though I was ignorant of their designe, yet I took hold of the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and imbarqued my self with them, and understood the command they had, a little before our mariners had descri'd your ships. I can tell you nothing of what past betwixt the mother and the son after my departure; but by what hath hapned in your presence from the one and the other it is very easie for you to imagine how matters pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54727:149"/>
them. Thus the Englishman ended his mournefull relation, accompanied with many a sad teare. Polexander let fall some to the memory of Eolinda, and having bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the imprudency, and bewayled the misfortune of the Prince, sent back all the English, and commanded his Pilot to put off from the coast of England. If the notes which are left me of the life of this great King, have beene carefully written, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to him any adventure worthy to be published, from the coast of France, to those of Spaine, which are the neerest to Africa. But it is remembred how in that place he made use of that incomparable valour, and greatnesse of soule, which had ever made him triumph over all dangers, all fortunes, and even of death it selfe. He was beset with above thirty sayle of ships, which falling in upon him, without any observance of the ceremonies used at Sea, assayled him so hotly, that he had scarce time to put his men in case to defend themselves. He fayled not to carry in a combat so unequall the same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of spirit he was wont to shew in his other combates. But seeing no way of safety, he would at least dye in one of the enemies vessels, and make himselfe a glorious tombe of their bodies whom he had slaine. Through sword and fire therefore he made up to the greatest vessell, and grapling with her, leapt in, to make a terrible but chery of his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous affailers. He had no sooner put his foot into the ship, but he was knowne by him that commanded her. Hold, cryed the Captaine to all, (he was clad after the Turkish fashion) lay downe your Armes, tis the King of the Canaries. These words went from one end of the ship to the other, and flying from ship to ship, all the fleet knew in an instant, they had beene like to have ruined the famous Polexander King of the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. In the meane while, he who had first divulged this verity, intimating to our Hero a great deale of joy: My prayers are heard, said he, I have somewhat satisfied the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations I owe your Majesty. You once gave me my life, and I dare say, this day I have preserved yours. For, I most certainly know, that at last you would rather have chosen an honourable death, then an ignominious servitude. I am the same Hamet, whose life you preserved in the presence of Bajazet, Iphidamantus and Zelmatida. Know more Sir, you are here amongst your servants, since all of us know no other Soveraigne then the great Bajazet. Hamet (replyed Polexander) this meeting is so strange, that I can scarce beleeve what I see and understand. But tell me, I prethee, where is Bajazet, and why lyes his fleet on this coaste? Sir, (said Hamet) my Generall is sick in his Island, and sick with griefe that he cannot recover the treasure he hath lost, which if fortune and our diligence render not the sooner to him, this Age will lose the rarest Jewell it hath next your Majesty; and chiefly to prevent that mischance came we to Sea. My compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and my selfe have altered our condition, and suspending for Bajazets sake our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer trade, we are no more Pirates, but to get into our hands the fairest women. We flye up and downe to every place where fame tels us the most beautifull are, and not dreading the hazard we run in so difficult and fantasticall an enterprise, we place out highest felicity in the preservation of our Generals life. Since you parted from our Island, we have sent him twenty of the fairest women of the world, but she whom he longs for is not among that number. Two dayes since we tooke one in Portugall, who is certainely the rarest and most wounding beauty can be looked upon. She will not tell us what she is, and that makes us believe it may be the same which Bajazet desires. Hamet could say no more, because ten or twelve of his companions came and did obei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance to our Heroe. He entertained them with a courtesie which charmed the most barbarous, and by a brave speech, amplifying the fortune they had made him run, told them, twas not without cause, their meeting was more feared on the Ocean, then that of rocks and shelves. The Pirates answered this commendation as well as they could; and the aged Achaim among the rest told him, it was farre from any intention of theirs to turne their forces against him, for (said he) we have an expresse order from our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, to obey you as himselfe, and to follow your Majesty in all occasions, wherein you please to do us so much honour as to make use of us and our armes. Tis not yet fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes, since at the sacred name of Polexander, we released one of the fairest ships we ever tooke. She came from that inaccessible Island, whereof all the world talkes, and no body can see. The Pilot which guided her, a very venerable old man, assured us, he came from the Island of the Sun to see you at the Canaries, and impart very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54727:149"/>
newes to you. At these words the bloud flashed in Polexanders face, and he felt a beating of his heart which was not usuall with him; and being not able to suppresse this amorous emotion, entreated Achaim to tell him, what course he had seene that vessell steere. We left her on the coast of Morocco, (replyed Achaim) and the Pilot told us they went then to the King of Senega. Polexander had gone away presently, if his ship had beene in case. But she had received so many Cannon shot, that the highest sayle or top-gallant saile, the maine mast, and that which bore the sprits saile were shattered; the maine sheet, and the greatest part of the yards were torne and broken; the very body of the ship was shot through in many places; &amp; it required time to rectifie all this, which Polexander was forced to give, in spight of his impatiency. To divert him, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met propounded to his companions the shewing him their faire prisoner, and his advice being approved, Polexander went out of that ship into the Rover Selims, and there into a Cabin where the faire Captive was kept. Hee understood by Hamets dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course whence she was, and therefore did all his complements in her owne tongue, and so pleased her, that to shew what contentment she tooke in his company, she put in practise all the best of her language. Polexander replied with his accustomed coole temper, and told her, he thought himselfe very happy to be in place where he might do her service. And I, replied the Portugall Lady, shall be more happy then you, if after the recovery of my liberty by your meanes, I might carry yours with me into Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall. You are not charitable (said Polexander) in rendring evill for good; but I see you sin out of custome, for it being so common a thing with you, and so easie to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and make slaves, you thinke to do it still, even during your owne captivity. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse (replied she) I do very much affect to make captives, but desire from them nothing but good deeds; and that you may have a desire to be one, I would have you know, that the great Emanuel King of Portugall thinks it an honour to be in my fetters. Her free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of humour and talke lasted till night, so as if Polexander had not bent all his thoughts on Alcidiana's Island, he would have found in his meeting with that Lady wherewithall to have entertained himselfe with a great deale of delight. When their first discourse was ended, and that those two excellent wits had begun a more regulated conversation, Polexander besought the Portugesse to tell him who she was, and by what mischance she was fallen into the hands of the Pirates. She replied presently, I am the daughter of the Count of Ebora, my name is Ximena, and by that denomination have acquired so much fame and glory, that there is nothing neither in Portugall nor in Spaine it selfe, which can be compared to me. From my infancy I have beene highly affected by Emanuel. He hath been inflamed for me as much as he could possible; and burnes yet with the same fire, so that had I not preferred his greatnesse before mine owne, he had lost (to have enjoyed me) far more then the Crowne of Portugall. The very day he was King, he resolved to divide with me that power to which my generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse had raised him; but I loved him too well to give consent to my owne advantage, I opposed the reason of Sate to that of love. I told him, his fortune was but begun, and to place himselfe at that point where he deserved to be, he should marry the daughter and heire of Ferdinand and Isabell. This alliance which might have brought him five or six Crownes, was at first word odious to him. He called me his Crownes and fortune, and told me he was powerfull enough, so he might have the happinesse to reigne with me. This generous answer had overcome me, if I had not yet beene more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. I commanded him to obey me, and at last inforced him to marry the Princesse of Castile. She hath beene his wife two yeares, but in that time Emanuel is growne twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares elder. He eternally complaines of that absolute power whereby I have thrown him into that irkesome slavery; and comforts not himselfe, but in the assurance he hath that the Queen his wife cannot long live. Tis above a month since I left my house and came to lie at Court, to give some intermission to his afflictions. I went to Lisbon, and was at the great feast which was solemnized at the departure of the navall Army, which should have reconquered all the Canaries. Polexander was about to have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted her at that word, to know what was become of that fleet; but the power he had on himselfe, made him appeare to her, as one to whom an intelligence which so neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched him, had nothing at all concerned him. Ximena therefore continuing her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54727:150"/>
discourse. After the fleet (said she) was under saile, I retired to a very faire Castle, which the King had given me, some two leagues from Lisbone. I have seene him there often, and two dayes since having sent me word, he would come to me by Sea, I got me into a little Galley to go meet him. The night overtooke me on the water, and the calmenesse of the ayre being as great as that of the Sea, I intended not to retire till day breake. But when I was come within a mile of my house, two Barks comming from behinde a rock set on my Galley, and being overcome, notwithstanding my servants resistance, I was taken and brought where now I am. See in short all that you desired to know. The name of the faire Ximena was knowne to me, said Polexander, but I may well say, I knew not what I did know before I had the happinesse to see the faire Ximena her selfe. The King of Portugall is too happy to have so winning and generous a Mistris, and were it not for feare to offend the worthy subject of his passion, I would accuse that Prince of two much reason and obedience. Of a truth Ximena is a faire piece of Nature, for the honour of whose enjoying there is neither glory nor Empire which is to be taken into consideration. This speech displeased not Ximena; and Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander, (after he had some time continued it) thus went on: I entreat the faire Xime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, not to take in ill part my curiosity; I would humbly entreat her to let me know what is become of that fleet which is gone for the Canaries. The newes of them is not good, replied the Lady; for the famous Polexander fights there though he be absent. His Genius is, where he cannot be himselfe, and conquers for him in those places where he cannot be in person. Besides, tis related that a Prince of the new world, called Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida, is (unhappily for us) in the Island of Lancerotta, and defends it with so much valour, that our Souldiers have no lesse esteem of him then of Polexander. To this they adde, that within these fifteene dayes, there is got into the Isle of Teneriffe, a Prince called Iphidamantus; that he hath already given two great on-sets to his advantage, and knock'd our troups back againe to their shipping. You have well satisfied my curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, (said the Prince) and tis but justice that Ximena should be so too. After this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he took leave of her, and went to the Pirats. He told them who Ximena was, and entreated them to send her back to the King of Portugall. You shall not (said he) lose her ransome, for I will give you a hundred thousand cro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s assoone as we arrive at the Canaries. His last words were very harmonious to the Pirates eares, and they all said to Polexander, he might dispose of Ximena as he pleased, and that they forgave him her ransome. No, no, (replied Polexander) you shall not if you please refuse me. But I tell you, that summe is but the earnest of a greater payment. Yet, before I discover to you what I conceale, I pray send back Ximena; Alcippus shall conduct her into Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, if you will lend me but the least of your vessels. Hamet offered his; and whilst they were providing to goe, our Hero withdrew in private with Alcippus, instructed him what he should say to the King of Portugall, and appointed him to goe thence to Fez and Morocco, and so to Senega, if at the two first townes he heard no newes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana's ship. Enquire (said he) every where for it, neglect nothing; and never think of returning to the Canaries, if thou bring me not some good newes, and I will stay there for thee. Ximena understanding by those that guarded her what Polexander had done for her liberty, gave him extraordinary thanks, and after she had bid him farewel: I was not yet weary (said she) of being a prisoner in the hand of so magnanimous an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Our Hero as bravely answered her; and assoone as he saw her under sayle, he sent to entreat Bajazets chiefe Officers to come aboard him. They did so, and when they were come together: My companions (said hee) there is a faire occasion offers it selfe to enrich you. The King of Portugall hath sent a fleet to invade my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. If you will set on them, you are sure of their defeate. Let's flye then to so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a victory, and by the great number of prisoners and vessels which cannot escape you, make your selves more formidable then you are to all the force of Spaine. The Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates all at once arose, and laying their hands on the guard of their Cymeters, See, said they to Polexander, wherewithall to confirme the good opinion you have of our cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. Let's on then my Lord to these Portugals, who are certainely lost if they dare to attend us. The Councell being thus ended, they thought on the meanes of rightly put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in execution. Our Heroes great ship was all new fitted in lesse then foure and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54727:150"/>
twenty howres, and all the rest put in good equipage for fight. A favourable winde arising the second day, Polexander and the Rovers set saile, and in a marvellous good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der steered towards the Canaries. They were six dayes ere they could see it; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, they descried the prodigious mountaine of Teneriffe, and the eighth, they began to distinguish the Isles. Polexander held a counsell of Warre in the fight of his deare Countrey; and finding one same heart, and one same will in all the Pirates, bore up right to his enemies. Did the copiousnesse of my subject permit me to expatiate my selfe in the description of combates by Sea and Land, of sieges, of assaults, of taking of places and vessels, of duels, of considerable deaths, and other glorious adventures which accompany the act of warre: I should have in this warre of the Canaries, sufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to obliterate the illustrious and proud events wherewithall the renowned Cities of Troy, Thebes, Carthage, Hierusalem, or any else have furnished their Poets. But I must smother all those brave acts; and besides, having consecrated my pen to the honour of Alcidiana, I veyle without sorrow a part of Polexanders, his brothers, and Zelmatida's. That which comforts me in the wrong I doe them, is, they praise my ingratitude, and had rather I should speake of their misfortunes, then of their achievements. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imitate their example in this warre, and relate it with as much nimblenesse as they executed it. The Portugals being advertised of the forces were comming on them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke the great Canary, since they could not keepe it without their owne losse. They dismantled in the other Islands the sorts which were not yet defensible, or too hard to be kept, and leaving a good Garrison in the rest, shipped themselves; to encounter Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, or at least wise not to have at one time their Enemies both before and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them. Our Hero trifled not the time, but put himselfe in battalia within Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non shot, and compelled them to forgoe their usuall slownesse. The fight was bloudy on both sides, but incomparably more on the part of the Portugals, then Polexanders. I must needs expresse, to the praise of the Portugals, that to know how many they were, there needed but to count the dead and the prisoners. There was not a vessell saved, for all that were aboard them had made a vow to overcome, or to dye. Ipidamantus and Zelmatida at the noise of this battaile, left their postes, got a shipboard, and comming fitly in, performed so many heroicall actions, that the least of their glory was to come off victorious. The Pirates fought as people who were certaine to carry away all the booty; and indeed, though the recompence were great, yet was it below their Service. The fight being ended, Polexander highly praised them, and sent away that very day to Bajazet to give him notice of his victory, and the hardinesse of his followers. Zelmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and Iphidamantus, who during the battell, had often admired the incomparable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of our Heroe, (who had likewise his eyes for witnesses of theirs) came up to him in the Port of Teneriffe. Their joyes, their civilities and praises were great and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Polexander oftentimes asked Zalmatida's pardon, for so long time abusing his goodnesse; called him the Defender of the Canaries, and the revenger of the growing slavery of his world. Zelmatida in lieu of an answer, onely sighed, and gave way for Iphidamantus complements. Polexander forgat not to render that testimony he ought to his courage; and said aloud, that to be master of his Art, he was bound to be taught by his younger brother. Iphidamantus modesty hindered the continuation of that speech; and that being done, they landed on the Isle of Teneriffe, and because it was that, wherein the Portugals had most fortified themselves, he resolved to make there his beginning of driving them out of the Islands. The Canarians were not idle, whilst their Masters laboured so happily for them. Some of them cut the throats of their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons; others went and assaulted the Forts which kept them in awe, and those of the best sort came to the three Princes Army. Some Portugals defended themselves in their holds, even to the extremity, in hope there would arrive a new fleet. Others more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, knowing they could not be relieved, yeilded themselves to the discretion of the Conquerour; so that in a month all the Isles were free, and no other Portugals were seen there, but such as they sold in the markets, and carried hither and thither, to end their lives in that servitude which their ambition had deserved. Polexander yet was not satisfied with the driving so unjust and obstinate Enemies from his dominions; but would needs fight with them within their own wals, and by some great and remarkable
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54727:151"/>
losses imprint in their minds for a long time the feare of his Name and Armes. After he had therefore a while refreshed his Troopes after their long travels, with Zelmatida and Iphidamantus, he joyned his own fleet with the Pirates, and having paid them even to prodigality for their service done him, and principally the ransome he promised for Ximena's liberty, he embarked himselfe with a favourable winde, and staid not till he came before Lisbon with an Army not only victorious, but invincible by his presence, and that of the other two Heroes. All the coasts of Portugall felt his arrivall. Many townes were pillaged, many burnt, and an infinite number of young and old, of poore and rich, were sacrificed to the just resentment of the Canarians. Lisbon it selfe was got to the point of her ruine, and the fire and sword were about to make of it a horrible place of buriall; when our Heroe considering this neere desolation, staid his anger, and was moved with the horrid object which had followed the sack of so stately a City. Let us pardon the guilty (said he to himselfe) for the innocents sake. Let those live who have provoked us, for the love of them who never offended us. Let us not arme against our selves the cryes and teares of a great number of orphanes, of widowes, and virgins. The astonishment which his arrivall had cast as farre as into the heart of Spaine, was so great, that Ferdinand and Isabell shut up in Valledolid, were a great while without knowing how to oppose this tempest. They imagined that all the Moores were againe comming out of Africa into Spaine, and to reconquer it in farre lesse time then they had lost it. But Polexanders departure calmed all their troubles, and dissipated their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions; and if he returned without being King of both the Spaines, twas because his justice, and noblenesse would never consent to it. He returned home by Africa, drove the Portugals out of all the places they were possest of, and razing the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would have both the Christians and Moores to know that he came into the world onely for the extirpation of tyranny. The King of Morocco hearing of our great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors being so neere his territories, sent him a solemne Embassy. It was received after a new way of State, for twas at Sea, and in the midst of a fleet, consisting of above three hundred saile. The Embassadors having had their Audience, and done the accustomed complements, returned loaden with presents. Polexander seeing them upon parting, asked Iphidamantus if he would send no newes of himselfe to his old servant. I doe not think (replied Iphidamantus) but that after the turne I shewed her they would be very welcome to her. Truly said Polexander, you cause me to remember a promise you made me long since. You must now acquit your self with putting it no longer off. And in so saying, and taking Zelmatida by the one hand, and his brother by the other, he shut himselfe with them into his Cabin. Zelmatida understanding whither he was led, and to what purpose, was wonderfully joyed at it; and pressed Iphidamantus as much as the King of the Canaries, to tell him how he fell into the hands of the King of Morocco, and by what meanes he got thence. The brave Prince not able to deny two so dear to him, and so considerable; told them, he had no other will then what they might command; but (withall said) he had already so often troubled them with the recitall of his fortunes, that he could not resolve to go on. Yet (added he) since I see you wil abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely have it, I am ready to obey you. Know then, that after the mis-haps which hapned to me at the siege of Lepanto, and after the tragicall end of the too constant Hysteria, I left all the pretentions I had in the court of the Grand Seignior, and made a vow never more to present my self to my most dear father and worthy Lord Achomat. In speaking which words, Iphidamantus fighed often, and Polexander noting it; You sigh (said he) if I be not deceived, and at the remembrance of your losses, what a change is here? What is become of that insensibility which equall triumph'd over all things? Hath Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet turned that heart of marble into a heart of flesh? You may justly jest, replied Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus, sighing againe, but let's give over this talke, if you please, and give me leave to relate what you desire to know. Assoone as I was at Sea, I called to minde that which the generous Basha Achomat had told me not a yeere before, touching my birth, my captivity, and the misfortunes of our house. This remembrance, bred in me a desire of returning into my native Countrey, to the end I might learne, whether or no I were the sole man left alive of our race. With this intent I came to Argier, and habit and language having gotten me a great many friends in a small time; I understood, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54727:151"/>
Canaries had not changed their master; and how the great Polexander of whom I heard so much spoken in Constantinople, was not only king of them, but what more astonied and extraordinarily pleased me, was, that Aladin Bashaw Vice-roy of Argiers assured me, that that Prince was the son of Periander and Axiomira, and by consequence, the unfortunate Iphidamantus had the honour to be his younger brother. Polexander having smil'd at the quaint phrase of his brother, We will, said he, make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer another time to these fine words; for the present, Zelmatida and my selfe have no other designe then to heare you. Proceed then, if you love us, and plainly satisfie our cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity. Iphidamantus, resuming his discourse, thus continued it:</p>

                     <hi>THE ADVENTURES</hi> OF IPHIDAMANTUS.</head>
                  <p>AS soon as the Vice-roy of Argiers had intimated to me the prosperity of Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders worthy successor, I got to sea again, and with the most diligence I could sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the coastes of Barbary: I was like to have been lost in the straights of Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and but for the extraordinary skill of my pilot, my ship had been split in peeces against the point of an Island in the midst of the straight. At last I got into the open sea, but 'twas to be beaten with new tempests. The second day that I was got into the Ocean, my mariners, who had never sailed but on the Mediterianean sea, were intertained by a winde they knew not, and against which by consequence they could not defend themselves. The billowes went so high, that for three daies we were every foot carried from heaven to hell, and from hell to heaven. At last the winde threw us on the coastes of Morocco. 'Twas there, that the storm redoubling, and that the elements having made a particular combination to punish my offences, turned topsy turvy (if I may say so) the first order of nature, reconciled contrarities which should be everlasting; found nourishment for flames in the water; composed two rights of what should be one day, and made both the land and the sea equally dismall unto us. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leagues on this side Morocco there is seen a rock, on which is built a Castle which they call Guargetsem: the tempest bore me right against it. Twice did my ship strike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this fearfull rock, and by the impetuosity of the shock, not only opened it in the mid'st, but was thrust off farre into the sea, that of all those aboard, there was not one who saw not his certain death before him. Every one therefore got hold of what he could, to hinder their sinking with the vessell, but the storme made all their forecast bootlesse, for the justling of the waves, which confounded themselves one within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, swallowed up all my mariners and souldiers, with that which they had gotten to save themselves. I only (who without doubt had not suffered enough for my many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) was frustrated of that quiet which my companions found in the armes of death. Having therefore (without faining) no intent to preserve my miserable life, I was thrown by a wave into a Cavern which time and the surges had digged under the rock of Guargetsem. When the sea is very high, or that there is a violent storme, as there was then, the water enters into the bottom of that Cave, and throwes in what it brings with it; but when the waves retire, or that it is calme, the place is dry; and hath some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with those grottes which Art hath invented for the imbellishing of Gardens. For an hour or two I was but ill at ease within that cave, for I was upto the neck in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and knew not where to place my selfe better. At last the sea went out, and then I found I was out of danger. The Sun which inclined towards the West, and was then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near to the Tropick of Cancer, suddainly striking through the thicknesse of those cloudes which had been so fatall unto us, enlightened the most obscure corners of my retreat. I set me at the mouth of it, to injoy the suns heat and dry my clothing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an houre after I had been there, I perceived some fishermen: who questionlesse
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54727:152"/>
were got out in their boates to gather the remaines of our shipwrack. I will not tell you that surely chance was the Author of the good fortune befell me at that instant, but will let you know, how those fishermen being desirous to get a chest which floted on the waves, and which I knew to be the same wherein my servants put my best habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) drove right to my Cavern. As they were about to take it in, I cried to them for helpe; and my voice on a suddan comming out of that cave, so affrighted them that they left the chest, and betooke them to their oares. I besought them to take me in, and told them, the chest which they were about being mine, I would freely give it them, if they would bee so charitable as to carry me to the next shore, and tell me on what part of Africk I was shipwracked. My habit and language make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me passe for a Musulman, the fishers believed, that Mahomet had sent them thither to exercise the hospitality which he so strictly recommended to them. They therefore tooke me into one of their boates, set my chest by me, not permitting me to open it for their reward; and betaking them to their oares, brought me to a little-port, which is as the entry of a Suburb by which they ascended to the fortresse of Guargetsem: There the fishers dwelt, and they received me into their Cottages built of clay and straw, with a great deale of humanity; and carried my chest into a place under ground, whereof they gave me the key. I refused it, and to obliege them to the continuation of their affection, tooke out of my chest some chaines of gold, and rings, which I distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst them: They grew ravished at the richnesse of my presents, and judged by them that I was a person of great quality. I thought it not amisse to keepe them in that opinion; and to that end, I went presently to put off my spoyled sea weeds, and take on others of cloth of gold, enriched with buttens of rubies. When I had fitly clad my selfe with the richest cloathes I had, I came in to my fishermen, and astonished them farre more by this second sight, then he had done at first. They lifted up their hands; they whispered together, came and peered me in the face, handled my cloathes, my belt and Cymiter, and asked me often whether I were an Angell, or a man. When all their wonder was over, they told me in what place I was, and assured me, their King would already have sent to entertaine me according to my desert, had he been advertised of my arrivall. I asked them where he was; and after they had by their answer informed me he was come a few dayes besore into the fortresse of Guargetsem, I thought there was no better course for me, then to make my selfe knowne to that Prince. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent one of those fishers to the Castle, and expresly charged him to relate truly how I was shipwracked. He went up, and presently came back againe with Moores. The first that saw me, blinded with the lustre of my Jewels, or surprised with seeing me, stopped on the suddaine, and turning to his companions; Ennoramita (said he to them) Ennoramita. The rest gaz'd on me, and all with one voice cried out, that I was Ennora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mita. Straight they cast themselves at my feet, kissed my hands, called me their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and entreated me to go to their King. They drew me out of my cottage, and causing all the mountaine to ring againe with the name of Ennoramita, carried me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I would or no up to the fortresse. Some of them being run before, to advertise Hely of my arrivall, so ravished him with the newes of it, that forcing his weake legs to uphold him, maugre their feeblenesse, he came to meet me, welcomed me with a great many pleasant huggings, repeated a hundred times over the name of Ennoramita, would even adore me, and gave me the title of a Goddesse, and sometimes that of an Angel. He entreated me straight to tell him how I escaped out of the hands of the cruell Nephizus, brought me into a chamber, the best furnished I ever saw next to those of Zelmatida, and Bajazet; and entreating me to take my bath, withdrew, with a great deale of respect. Presently came in diverse white Eunuchs, and seven or eight black. The last fetched all that was necessary for my chamber; and the women having brought me into a great withdrawing roome, shut the doore on us all. If I were wonder-strooke at what I had seene and heard, I was farre more when I saw my picture (done like a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) hanging under a cloth of Estate, made of cloth of gold. I asked those who would have undressed me whether I would or no; for whom that picture was made. They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered me all at once, twas for the Princesse Iphidamanta. At that word I was like to have falne downe, and certainely believed I was got into the house of some one of those
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54727:152"/>
Enchanters, which every day worke so many prodigies in the townes of Africa. I knew not which way to be cleered of my doubts. In the meane time I was in an extreame perplexity. But perceiving that Hely and his servants had no other intent then to serve me, I said to my selfe, I should be very unwise to dis-obliege them. I went therefore into the bath, but so dextrously, that I discovered not the difference betwixt Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus and Ennoramita. Assoone as I was dried, persumed and clad, Hely reentred the chamber where I was, and shewing me my picture: See (said he) that which hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served my life in your absence. At that speech I put on a very serious countenance, and told him I had beene in so great an astonishment, by meanes of that which had betided me since I was taken out of the Sea, that I could scarce reserve to my judgement suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to know whether I were yet my selfe or no. But let me tell you. I am a man. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly smiled, and shooke his head, hearing me say so; and taking me by the hand, faire En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramita Iphidamanta, replied he, do not think to hide your selfe from those eyes which love hath made so clear-sighted. You have now nothing to feare. The traytor Nephizus is not in this countrey, and Abdelmelec hath acknowledged his offences. You are absolute Mistris of me and my Estates. Command solely, and you shall be punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obeyed. I grew almost mad to see my selfe treated like a maid, and in that choler, I spoake to the King any thing that came first to minde. At last recollecting my wits: I cannot imagine (said I to Hely) how you came to know my name to be so neere to Iphidamantus. But you may know that that Iphidamantus was born a Prince, and bred up in the Port of the Grand Seignior, by the name of Solyman. I see (said I) you do not beleeve me; but since your credulity is so wilfull, I will make you both an eye and hand witnesse that I am no woman. Presently I unbuttoned my robe, and would have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him my brest, that he might know I wore not garments unbefitting my Sex: but he clapped his hands on his eyes, and protested, he had rather dye then engage me in any action which should displease me. No, no, (said I) I will do nothing unseemely. Come, see, and disbeguile your self. That old foole, holding his hands still on his eyes, told me, he was too certaine of who I was to desire new testimonies. Should my eyes (said he) now tell me the contrary, I would say they lied, and hold them for Impostors. Be therefore still (if you please) what you have beene. Be Iphidamanta, be Ennoramita, be a Shepheardesse, be a Princesse; you shall still be that visible Divinity which Hely will adore whilst he lives; and the onely beauty he will enjoy in that Paradise which his great Prophet prepares for him. Nay, Iphidamanta shall be the chiefe part of my beatitude. She shall be the most delicious dish I will taste of in the eternall feastings, and her divine allurements will make me look with contempt on the miraculous Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citrons which our Prophets Angels will give to his believers for the accomplishment of all their pleasures. And to speake truth, how rare soever the beauties of those celestiall fruits are; what is there in them that can be compared to the charmes of Iphidamanta? This discourse, composed partly of that poor Princes errors, and partly from those of the Alcoran, gave me good cause of laughter. Yet I could not hold, but at last grew angry; and had I given way to my first thought, I had made Hely repent him of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy. But when I called to minde, that I should avenge my selfe on a poore man whom age had deprived of judgement: I said to my selfe, I should be more senselesse then he, if I went about to wrong him. For three months together, I had as much of this as was possible. I patiently endured the Kings highest impertinencies. I coldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Idolatries; I gave care even with pleasure to his supplications, his idle talke, and his wayanentings. In a word, I almost became the same which that foole tooke me for; and tooke in hand as well the rest, though much against my will, the needle and the spindle. At last, Hely brought me to Morocco, and caused me to be received with an incomparable magnificence. But after I had beene there a while, and was growne of so ridiculous a life; I resolved to beguile, or to bribe the Guard that was night and day set over me; and to take my time, when some strange ship should be ready to set saile. There chanced an excellent combination to perfect my designe. Postes came from Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>is, from Argiers, from Fez, and many other places; who all solicited Hely to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field those troupes which he had promised for the invading of Spaine; and assured him, that within few dayes, the Grand Seigniors fleet would be at the generall Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54727:153"/>
These newes a little suspended my old Dotard's follies; and made him turne his thoughts on more important businesse. Hee sent notice to Abdelmelec hee should be in a readinesse. Who answered him, he staied onely for the ships which the Vice-roy of Argiers had promised him for his troopes. That his Army was brave and very resolute, and that ere long he would send him farre better assurances of that verity, then words and letters. I understood from Hely how the Grand Seignior (offended with the Portugals beginning by their East-Indian Navigations to breake the trade of Spice, which from all times before had beene through his Dominions) was resolved to invade Spaine, and by a continuall warre, take from them the meanes of sayling into the East. Twas for that intent this great preparation was made. You have seene the event in the battaile which the Turks lost; it will be therefore superfluous to relate the particulars. Assoone as Hely had made good his promise, and drawne out of all places all that were fit to carry Armes; he brought me back againe to Guargetsem, that he might be farre enough from the noise of warre, and by a sound repose satisfie his ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous passion. After we had beene there a month, Abdelmelec sent to the King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a great Gallion which he had taken from the Portugals, and with that vessell above three hundred Christians of severall Nations. When I saw that vessell, I said to my selfe, the Prince of Morocco had rather sent it to me, then to the King his father, and in that moment, put on my last resolution of freeing my selfe. Hely having extolled to me Abdelmelec's valour, and desirous to let me see the proofes, brought me into a very great roome where he had put all his slaves. I looked on them, and though they were all wounded, yet I found them exceeding constant in their adverse fortunes. I bid them (in Spanish) to be of good heart, and told them I would take care for their safety, and labour for their delivery. They gave me thanks, and one amongst them, of an exceeding good aspect, said softly to me, that if he and his companions could but get weapons, he assured himselfe (as incommodated as they were) to get againe what they had lost, and something more. That mans freenesse was like to have ruined him; for Hely suspecting what he said, gave command he should be presently strangled. I besought him to spare his life for my sake: and I had no sooner requested but it was granted me. From the prison we went to our ordinary diversions; and from that day set my wits on worke for the advancement of my Enterprise. I promised so many things, and gave so much to two of my Eunuchs, that by their industry I secretly got Armes out of the fortresse, and as closely sent them to the Christians. Assoone as they were in case to make use of them, and that they had as many as they needed, they broke open their prison, cut the throats of the small Guard they had, and got aboard their ship in the roade of Guarget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem. At the same instant the tumult began, I got to the secret staire that went downe from the fortresse to the Sea, and by which my deare Cydaria saved her selfe as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured by the ordinary discourse which Hely had with me. When I was got downe, I found a boate ready for me, and my two Eunuchs in it. We got speedily to the ship, and being aboard, the question was, what way to steere, to avoid the falling againe into the hands of our enemies. All the Christians having chosen me for their Commander, besought me still to be their Releasor. The fafest course for us (said I) is to make off from the coast of Africk, because of the great number of Turkish ships which get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But since our ship hath all the markes of those of Turkey, and that our Armes, our Turbants, and the rest of our cloathes, may make us passe for some of their party, let us not lose sight of these coasts, nor engage our selves in a Sea we know not. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise was followed; but had it not beene for the ignorance of our Pilot, who the very first night was run out of the way, it had cost us our lives, or at least our Liberties. For Hely assoone as he heard of my escape, sent forth foure great barkes well armed, which he had for the defence of the place, and commanded those that went aboard them, to follow me to the worlds end, rather then let me scape away. Our Pilots error having preserved us from that danger, cast us into another as great. For, we lost sight of land, and were two or three dayes wandring up and downe the Ocean. At last we descried the high mountaine of Teneriffe, but knew it not; and as we were about to land there, a storme cast us on the sides of a little Isle, where I learnt (said he, addressing himself to Zelmatida) at the cost of my bloud, how fatall Polexanders valour is to those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54727:153"/>
it. Our Hero being oblieged to answer to these words, extraordinarily praised Iphidamantus; and related to Zelmatida particularly with what generosity his brother had taken Alcidiana's Pilot into his protection, and with what boldnesse he came alone to assaile his whole fleet. After this discourse was ended; Iphidamantus intreated his brother he would be pleased to let him prosecute a design for which he had left Bajazet; and that taking again the ship which he brought from the Pirats Island, he might make an end of his unhappy destiny. Polexander imagining by his words, he laboured under some great perplexity, and loath to use the authority his age gave him over his brother; told him, he might do what he pleased: though (said he) Zelmatida and my self would gladly enjoy you longer with us. But since you are cal'd otherwhere, go when you please. And, who knows but love may be the cause of so speedy a separation? Iphidamantus fighed at his brothers last words, and having taken leave of them both, caused his men to make towards the mouth of the Straights. Achaim, Hamet and many other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Pirats, came likewise to bid adieu to Polexander; and giving him extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thanks for the honour and riches whose acquiring he had beene the chiefe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, swore to him many times, they would eternally preserve the memory of his benefits, and a desire to merit them by their services. Our Hero having bid them all farewell, had now no other thought (if we except the commanding and perpetuall thought which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>nseparably linked him to Alcidiana) but to bring back his victorious fleet into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of the Canaries. This resolution was attended with all the happinesse which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him when he tooke paines for the contentment of others; and his returne was such a plentifull sourse of delights, as his Isles, how fortunate soever they have beene alwayes esteemed, were ignorant of knowing any the like till to that day.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Inhabitants of Africa were not the sole nation which admir'd Polexanders victories. All men who had heard of them, spoke with astonishment, and the Canarians rapt with so many more then mortall acts, promis'd to themselves by their Prince's valour no lesse then to become (one day) the absolute Masters of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean. These transcendent hopes infinitly increased their former affections, and caused them to imploy all that they had of most cost and value, to make our Heroe's return as triumphant as his absence had been honorable. They prepar'd for him stately entrances in all their capitall cities; but Polexander neglected those popular vanities; and looking on himselfe with more cleer-seeing eies then those he was survey'd with either by his subjects or his neighbours; They provide triumphes for me (said he) who am beaten both by heaven and fortune; All conspire my ruine, and yet these men perswade themselves, that the chance of war, and the eternall order of nature are changed and conducted as it pleaseth my destiny. Pluck off, pluck off the band which blindes so many, and let us teach these ill censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of humane adventures, that all their judgements are rash, and make them see how this Polexander whom they call the most happy, is a miserable man which hath not so much as the hope of that blisse which their wishes and blindnesse bestow upon him After hee had thus spoken to himselfe, he dismissed the Canarians, and, for feare, left in his absence the Spaniards might make them repent of their change, he gave them governours, who in the precedent passages had been known for men of courage and government. As soon as he was disingag'd from those cares so incompatible with the thoughts of a lover, he retired himselfe to meditate more at leisure, and finde out some new way to get to the inaccessible Island, or the sooner to his death. Above two houres was he musing on these imaginary courses, but his wits being vainly drawn dry on them he was forc'd to give himselfe for vanquished to that despaire which he had alwayes contested with. Then our illustrious mis-fortunate Prince, beleeving he had good cause to accuse himselfe, Why then (cry'd he) Proud and cowardly reason, hast thou so long time resisted, since to our common shame thou should'st have yeelded, and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed at last that thy obstinacy was an effect of thy feare, rather then a signe of thy constancy. After he had thus reviled himselfe, he grew silent, and began to walke up and downe the chamber with such a pace as shewed how tragicall the thoughts were that rowl'd in his mind: at last he stood still, and turning his eies towards that quarter of the world where he imagined the inaccessible Island lay; Faire place (said he) which jealous of thine owne happinesse seemeth to conceale thee from thy selfe, I give over my importunate searches, and to tell thee with what respect I consider the Temple whose Goddesse I adore, I submit my consent and yeeld to that rigorous necessity which will not permit me to see thee againe. But what infamous counsell doth my more infamous despaire give mee? What? shall I wave my desire of seeing Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana because I have no hope of it? and since by my own strength, I cannot raise my selfe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54727:154"/>
to heaven, shall I dare to conceive such a crime as the renouncing all the felicities there? No, no, faire Alcidiana, I will never lend an eare to these detestable Emotions. I am resolved to spend all the rest of my life in an Enterprise which shall not be lesse glorious to me then I find it impossible: and since Almanzors example is a perpetuall advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the obligation of dying without seeing you, is fatally incident and knit to your adorers. I will (without expecting ought from love or fortune) go, &amp; acquit my self of what I owe to your incomparable merit, to the necessity of my condition, and to mine owne thoughts. After this he called for his trusty Diceus, and by a command he gave him, made well knowne, that contemning againe the fruite of his victories, and all regall delights, he was about to re-begin that wandring and desperate life to which he had so often and so unprofitably abandoned himselfe. At the same instant Zelmatida entred Polexanders chamber, and his owne agitations not giving him leave to take notice of another mans: Have pity on a wretch (said he) whom heaven in the very fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his misfortune resuseth him the knowledge of it. My eies are witnesses of Izati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's death; they have seen the monument where she lyes buried, and yet by I know not what error, they begin to bely themselves, and would have me doe so too. O Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander what shall I resolve on? If Izatida be alive, and that I do not beleeve them, I make my self for ever unworthy to be looked on by her, and become so mortall an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to my self, that one death were not sufficient to avenge me of my unworthinesse. Doubt then still (repli'd Polexander) interrupting him, since so many advise you to it, and thinke with your selfe, that these suspitions, these doubts and halfe hopes, are the secret presages of a change in your fortune. I will beleeve you (said Zelmatida) not to draw any consolation from so vaine a hope, but rather to meet with death, who ever unmercifully flies me when I run after it, and hides her self in the havens when I search for her in the tempests. Zelmatida would have gone on, when five or six men entred Polexanders chamber, and so made him leave the rest for another time. He that came <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Polexander wondring at the Africanes intricate speech, turn'd to the person who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him, and intimating he took no pleasure in those diversions: Alcippus (said he) I well perceive that your affection hath driven you to those curiosities which you have alwaies heard me condemne; and thinke you have acquitted your selfe of your promise, if (no matter by what meanes) you bring me any newes that is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. Sir, (repli'd Alcippus) the honour to have your commands and charge is to me so dear and sacred, that as often as they are to be put in execution I collect to my assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance all the care, all the diligence, &amp; all that circumspection they deserve. And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, imagine if you please whether I would so much become so adverse to my selfe as to prophane that now which hath been so sacred to me; and whether I would imploy the impudence and imposture of a mountebank, to discharge me of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions which your excessive goodnesse deignes to intrust to my fidelity; No, sir, I bring you none of those Muhazimins, nor of those impostors which run 'up and downe Africa; I bring you here the learned Habul Ismeron, who is the oracle of kings, and the still-watchfull eie of the kingdom of Morocco. The sole desire of seeing this great Prince which his art had charactered to him for the miracle of these times, (not thehope of reward) hath made me so gracious, and so far prevail'd with him, as in the extremity of his age to quit the King his master, and the sweet quiet of his retired life.

hath said (quoth Ismeron) is true, and no lesse true then the art which I professe is so miraculous and divine, that 'tis farre beyond the reach of humane wit, or it rather teacheth us by its perpetuall infallibility, that the condition of men is not far differing from that of Angells. Yes, Polexander, I have forsaken my solitude, to see (before I dye) the accomplishment of those things my Art foretold me, and to contemplate at pleasure that master-piece, wherein heaven and nature seem'd to have contributed all of theirs that was most excellent. O what prosperities do future times reserve for you! And with what justice shall the dysasters which must fore-runne them be put into the number of those felicities? Farewell, brave Prince, destinated to extraordinary adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: Mine eies have given mine intellect that which it wanted of perfectly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. Stay me not, I pray you, for the King my master and my age presse me to be gone. Though Polexander laugh'd at the old mans predictions, and condemn'd his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, for all that he perceived the man shewed a great deale of judgement in his discourse, and by consequence, had a farre more cunning then extravagance. After he had better weigh'd it, hee judg'd him to be some excellent wit, who, as all others, having its defect and weaknes, was fallen into that vaine curiosity of knowing things to come. He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him then very courteously, and excusing himself for not performing it sooner: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (said hee) I feare (for your satisfaction) lest your Art be not so certaine as you present it to me; And I assure my selfe, that when you shall take the paines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view your calculations, you will confesse, that if you have not fail'd in the place, yet you have mistooke in the person: I say in the person, rather then in the place; because there is in this chamber a Prince which is yet more then you have discovered by your characters. With that he shewed him Zelmatida, and told him, he was King of an Empire greater then the fourth part of Europe, and richer then all Europe together. If he be such as you say (repli'd Ismeron) how then hath he forgotten the only person of the world who can best free him of his doubts? Zelmatida had not given any great attention to the precedent discourse: but when Polexander, by naming him, had brought him out of his musing, and the old man by the reproaching his forgetfulnesse oblig'd him to speake: Alas father (said he) shew me that person which I search for through the world. There he is (quoth the old man) and with that shewed the Lad which Alcippus had presented to his master. The little one cast up his-eyes &amp; fix'd them on Zelmatida; who as earnestly regarding him, knew 'twas the Princesse of Mexico's dwarfe. Habul Ismeron made use of that disturbance this agnition wrought: for when he saw Polexander was busied about Zelmatida, he slip'd out of the chamber, got again to his ship, and so set saile: He was scarce out of the palace, when Zelmatida, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his astonishment, cast his eies full of teares on the dwarfe, and drew him to the like passion too. What, Galtazis, (said he) Izatida is then dead, and cruell Hismalita could not then indure that divine maiden, who by her innocent life, too highly reprov'd the crimes of her own? Galtazis, standing a while, unable to speak, at last broak through his sighes and sobs, and rather answering his owne thoughts, then Zelmatida: Why had I not died (said he) in my desert Island, rather then be the dismall messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of so deplorable a novelty; yet (said he) doe not think I come to relate to you the death of Izatida. No, Sir, she lives, but 'tis such a kind of life, as in lieu of comforting you, should adde to your just sorrows. Weep then, Zelmatida, weep more then if my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse were dead: And know that inhumane fortune hath for ever shut up those fair eyes which our Prophets, our Priests, and our own thoughts acknowledged, for the auspicious stars of all Mexico. Zelmatida apprehended not at first what Galtazis meant by his last words, and therefore ask'd the explication: Izatida is blind, replied Galtazis sighing: Blindleri'd Zelmatida, and have the Gods (which are represented to us for so just) done so great an impiety? When that poor Prince had thus spoken, he fell down as dead, and lay a long while in a swound in Polexanders armes. After they had much troubled him, he came to himself, and being recollected, O Izatida, (said he with a dying voice) thy faire eies then, the true fountaines of light, are shut up for evermore; and mine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull and perfidious, dare have recourse to that of heaven? Pluck out (remedilesse Zelmatida) pluck out those objects of hatred, and to dare doe something which may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualize the greatnes of our affliction, teare out those unfaithfull eies, which open them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54727:155"/>
to such light as comes not from Izatida. With that he lifted his hands to his eies, and if Polexander had not hindred his resolution, hee had seen him renew that ancient desperate act, which is to this day the glorious and horrible wonder of the tragical Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Garruca, who ran to succour his dear master; held his right arme, and Polexander the other, who intreating him to remember that Izatida was alive, said further, that if he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted not this furious fit, he would make it beleev'd that he lov'd his Ladi's life far less then her beauty: after he had thus spoken, he made a signe to Galtazis to continue his speech. The little one seeing his news and perswasions, had wrought their effect farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his expectation, My Lord (said he) if that unfortunate and innocent Lady whom you justly bewaile, could receive from any other then you, the consolation which is so needfull to her in her blindnesse, I would be the first should counsell you to dy; but since Izatida's afflictions call to you for redresse, preserve carefully that life which is not absolutely your owne, and which you cannot lose without violating your faith, without becoming ingratefull, and holding correspondency with our Princesse ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I am perswaded, Galtazis, (said Zelmatida,) I will live, and since my life (as unhappy as it is) can contribute somewhat to Izatida's contentment, it shall hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be as dear to me as before it was irkesome. Relate to me therefore (I prithee) the dysasters which ensued the supposed death of thy fair Mistris; Whil'st all Mexico (said Galtazis) bewail'd the death of their Princesse, and that the people ran thronging to the place where they thought her buried: The silly Montezuma and the bloody Hismali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, rejoyc'd for diverting from them the storme which to their brutish feares seem'd ready to powre down upon them; but their joy was soon turn'd into an exteam deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Posts came to them from all parts, by whom newes was sent, you had escaped from all those traps they had laid for you, and that by the assistance of certain men who came from another world, you were resolv'd to besiege them in their owne palace. This intelligence was seconded by another more terrible to them. They knew you had landed in the Isle of Cuba, took the inexpugnable fortresse, cut the throats of some of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, given life and liberty to the rest, and freed the old Alisma, whom Montezuma fear'd more then all the rest of the Peruvians. My faire mistresse heard of all this in the prison of the Lake, where she was straitly guarded; she gave thanks to heaven for your preservation and honour, and shutting her selfe up with her Governess, pass'd over the daies and nights in praiers for your happinesse. Some little time after the cruell Hisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita came to visit her, and calling her a thousand times the farall firebrand, that was to put all Mexico into a conflagration: Go (said she) thou stranger, go and dy by some other hands then mine, since my Gods will not have me imbrue them in thy blood. The night (after these furious threatnings) being halfe spent, we saw come into the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse's chamber, some unknown men who hood-winking her eies and seising on her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness, and my self gag'd, and so led us out of our prison. By the footmanship of those posts which from place to place were laid to carry us on their shoulders, we came the third day to the Port of Calciroeca. Quitalvor, who was Montezuma's Lievtenant in that Province, having seen the directions and commands of our conductors, gave them a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe to land us in some Isle of the Caribs, to execute that murder which (to her great grief) Hismalita durst not do herself. But heaven, which had not decreed that Izatida should be freed from all her miseries) rais'd a terrible tempest, and by it threw us on coas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> unknown: those that were our conductors landed (and made us do so too) on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert shore: where, as in all places else, my fair mistris, using that solid piety which made you admire her, had recourse to heaven, and beseeching thence a protection for us and our enemies, mov'd those Savages to pity, who led her to her death. They unbound her. tooke the band from her eies, and said, they had an expresse command from Hisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita, to carry her into some place inhabited by certain Canniballs that would devoute her. But happen what may (said they) wee will not be guilty of the death of the great Montezuma's daughter. I will not tell you (Zelmatida) by what prodigy or remorse of conscience these hangmen became mercifull: But I can assure you, from that time forward, they serv'd Izatida with such care and respect, as without a miracle she could not expect it: When I call to mind the excesse of their courtesy, I say 'twas a thing against nature, and a kinde of monster by which the Eternall providence did

presage to us some dysaster, which shall never be sufficiently bewail'd eitherby you or all the vertuous people in the world: I dare say I had some knowledge of it before it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. An unknown spirit often spoak to me within, and whether I slept or wak'd, said, Fly Galtazis, fly from this shore. The fruites here are poison, and the trees cast no shadow but to kill those who come for refreshment under them. Our conductors quickly made that prediction true, after they had been a while landed, they sought a place for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, which might be lesse offensive then were the dry &amp; hot sands on the beach. At last they found one, which seem'd to have all that could be wish'd for, both for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pleasure. Many little rivelets trill'd along by the grasse and the flowers, and many trees as fair in shew as deadly in effect, fram'd naturall arbours and alleys; the leaves of them were very large, and green, and the fruit so great and beautifull, that they were so many venemous baites to betray the innocent stranger. Our leaders fell hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to them, but no sooner were they in their bodies, but they felt themselves stung as with prodigious serpents, which in lesse then four daies had eaten up al their entrails. Two of Izatida's slaves eat of them as the rest, and died as they. For her selfe her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary food being her sighes and teares, she ran no hazard that way; but by an act of that awfull power, which every day invented new accidents to try the Princesse vertue, it unluckily hap'ned that she fell asleepe under those deadly trees. Her fair eies which were shut up for a few moments, were shut up for ever: and the subtle venome of those accursed trees sliding with their shadow on that other sun, covered her with fearfull &amp; perpetuall darkenesse. Izatida felt in sleeping the strength of the poison, and awaking with it, O governesse (cri'd she) looke to me, my fight is gone, I see nothing at all; the vertuous Mexiqua (so was the name of the governesse) ran to her, and finding but little alteration in her eies, did not beleeve so suddain a mischance could be long lasting; she got the Princesse to arise, and leading her to the source of a clear fountain, wash'd there her eies a long time: but Izatida finding but little helpe by it, Give over mother (said she) this unprofitable labour. It had not been just that she should suffer but ordinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, who by her disobedience incurr'd the curse of those by whom she came into the world. Just gods excercise your justice on this malefactresse, let her feel more and more the weight of your armes; and since as parents of all men you are interested in the cause of parents, hear the prayers of mine, and though they petition for my affliction, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them not! Zelmatida at that word interrupting Galtazis: How yee gods (cri'd he) who are not so if you be not just) would ye allow the tyrannies of an insensible father &amp; unnatural mother? &amp; to be thought exorable, would ye hear the praiers of your enemies? No, no, that excesse of injustice cannot be in heaven; the curses of Montezuma and His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malita have had no power to wrest your equitable decrees. 'Tis my dismall and tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call fate which hath been the Author of these new miseries. I am the venemous tree, the contagious shadow, who after innocent Izatida's losse of peace and liberty, have lastly depriv'd her of her sight, and questionlesse will soon lose all that remaines to her of life. Thinke on thy self monster, born for the ruin of vertue. Dye unworthy Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida, and by forcing thy selfe from the world, snatch from fortune, the sole pretext she hath of persecuting innocency. What (said Galtazis) shal Izatida's blindnesse, and her other disgraces, rob her of that absolute command, which her beauty and prosperity had acquired over your will? and will you lose the desire of suffering for her as soon as you have lost your hope of being recompenc'd. Let heaven reduce me into dust! (cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Zelmatida affrighted at Galtazis words) let the earth open and swallow me, let hell be all my portion; if Izatida, although banished, if Izatida, though a vagabond, if Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, though blinde, be not as dear to me, and as much honored, as in the height of her glory and the extremity of her beauty. Believe it Galtazis, and assure thy selfe, my constancy is growing to be such, that even in thine owne judgement, it will make me be reputed a man altogether insensible. I will obey you (replied Galtazis) but let me get away (if you please) from a countrey more execrable and horrid then Hismalita; and relate to you the last accidents which ensued Izatida's blindnesse. We had been about fifteene dayes on that accursed earth, and our unfortunate company which consisted at first of above fifty persons, were reduced to five, when we saw our selves inviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thirty or forty men, such as those that brought me hither. They stood stil
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54727:157"/>
a while and gazed on us, and at last understanding by our signes rather then by our words the need we had of their assistance, they comforted us with a great deal of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and went to fetch what was fitting to relieve us in our extream weakenesse. I presently believed heaven had sent those men to assist Izatida, and therefore brought them to the place where she was retired with her Governesse, and strove by my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make them understand the greatnesse of her birth, and the misfortunes of my Princesse. They gazed on her, and admir'd her, as blind as she was: and learning from me by my signes, that this accident betided to her by the dangerous propriety of some trees, on that abominable coast, they advis'd her to imbarke with them, to make triall whether the change of Climate would not alter her fortune. She liked of all they propounded; and expresly comanding her Governesse and my self not to leave her day or night; gave her selfe to the conduct of those men who were courteous and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable but only in appearance. After we had sailed many dayes, we arrived at an Island which (if I be not deceived) is not far from that whereinto the good Alisma had been exiled by Montezuma. When we were entred a Fort which our Leaders had newly built to make themselves masters of the Isle, we were there very civilly entertained; and their Captain which seemed to be moved at our miseries, not only welcomed with great demonstrations of friendship, but treated the Princesse with as much respect as if he had known her birth. He did what he could to know who she was, but all his cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was in vain; for ours was all of proofe, and the aged Mexiqua could so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit that her craft being taken for simplicity, she wiped out of the inquisitive mans thoughts all the opinion he had that Izatida would not be known for whom she was. She (in the mean time beleeving her blindnesse was not the last of her misfortunes) often besought the gods they would be pleased to deliver her from that she was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned withall by the courtesy of those strangers. I fear (said she) O yee just dispensers of good and evill, the calme I have met in the extremity of a tempest: The excesse of my happinesse makes me suspect it; and my mind which looks on it as a kind of dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aster yet unknown to me, findes in it somthing yet far worse then my exile and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Yee Gods which are most just, and yet most good, avert from me (if you please) a calamity which I fear the more because I least resent it! and since a young maiden is but frailty and weakenesse, condemne her not to those rigorous trials, which aske all the abilities of a soul high and vigorous. The Gods (continued Galtazis) were no lesse deaf to her last prayers then they had been to all her others. They left the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in the hands of men as deceitfull and dangerous as the shadow which blinded her; for when we thought least on it, their Captain caused us to imbarke our selves in a ship which (as he told us) was to saile into Spain; and promised us we should receive in that second voyage the same entertainment we had in the former. But we found it far differing: for five or six debauch'd young men having cast their eies on Izatida (who should rather have stirred them to pity then to love) resolved on an act the most base and abominable that can be imagined. Before they would use any violence, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by way of mildnesse, and thought their words and promises sufficient enough to shake a vertue as constant as that of the gods themselves: but when they perceived their artifice thrived not, they put in practise all that their brutish and cruell soules had kept hidden of most impious and horrible. The two Mexicans which were left alive and my selfe were bound and clapt up under the lowest deck, and the couragious Mexiqua reduced to the terrible necessity of either ruinating Izatidaes honour, or kill her selfe with her owne hands. In this extremity, men gave us that succour which the gods denied us; for a Prince (called Almanzor) passing happily by the ship wherein that great villany was to be acted, and being invited by the cries of the Princesse &amp; her Governesse, came and set on our perfidious friends. After halfe a dayes fight he became Master of the vessell, and by the death of the guilty, avenged the innocency of my faire Mistris. You may please to know, Almanzor had a Mariner who understood our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and that by his meanes he was informed of Izatidaes principall fortunes. You may take notice likewise, that of all those who have beene sensible of my faire Mistris afflictions, I have not seene any (your selfe excepted) who hath beene more then that generous Prince. When by the help of his Interpreter he had heard of the cruell usage
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54727:158"/>
Izatida received from her father and mother: He cried out, O powerfull law of Love! O Alcidiana yet more powerfull! why permit you not me to saile to Mexico, and teare out the hearts of those two Monsters? After thus spoken, hee turned him to Izatida, and causing his Interpreter to speake for him, I must (said he) in spight of my selfe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake you; yet will I not leave you to the mercy of Pirates and the Sea. I have a Pilot who shall conduct you to those places, where for your comfort (I may tell you) vertue hath her due respect, and never hath it more then when she is in distresse.. Go thither then, with a confidence, you shall not be there lesse honoured then in Mexico. You shall there meet with a Queene, who is as good a Mother, as yours is cruell; and who, finding in you that which may make her forget my absence, will be engaged for her owne sake to shew you all kind of respect and friendship. I will give you a ring, which is to be the continuall gage of the love that Queen beares me. At the sight of it, she will deny you nothing; but will know by that token how much the care of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation is deare to me. At the end of this discourse, he took Izatida by the hand, and put on her little finger a Ruby, which was more to be valued for the rarity of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, then the excesse of its greatnesse, and so bad her farewell, having first set at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the two Mexicans and my self, and commanded the remainder of our enemies to come aboard his ship. He gave us for our conduct, one of his Pilots and twelve Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. These new Guides promised us certainely, that within two dayes they would set us ashore on the coasts of Senega, or at least on some one of the Isles of Cape vert. But they were ignorant of Izatidaes sad fate, who (too cruell and implacable) seeing her selfe on the point to be overcome, redoubled her forces, made her selfe more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then their Art, and to be avenged on their humanity, armed the winds, stirred up the tempests, and suffered not the Seas to enjoy a calme, till they were swallowed and buryed under the billowes. This storme carried us farre from the Kingdome of Senega, and held us three dayes and three nights betweene life and death. At last it opened our ship in so many places, that the Pilot judging we were lost, if we staid there any longer, launched the Shallop, and went presently to tell Izatida, she must quit the ship, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to dye. She said, she was prepared for whatsoever might happen, and that having lost the love of her parents, and the hope of revisiting them, she could not be more pleased then to see her selfe at the point of getting out of all her miseries. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, (said she) I will not disobey the gods, and am content to live, if they have not decreed I shall yet dye. The Pilot took her in his armes, and letting her downe into the boate, call'd thither too Mexiqua and my selfe. We had no sooner placed our selves, but a gust of winde broke the rope which held the Shallop to the Ship, and carried us furiously through the waves. We were as it were dead, till our boate meeting with a bank of sand, which made part of a little Island, slid on so happily for us, that it stuck fast without breaking. The couragious Mexiqua lost not her judgement in that extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. She knew the water must be low in that place, and on that knowledge judged that at the ebbe we might very easily get them on shore. Comming then to the constant Izatida, she told her what she conjectured; and besought her not to be quell'd by this last dysaster. Is it possible (replied the Princesse) that Death will not yet give us that rest which is so necessary for us? Mexiqua's words taking off from me halfe my feare, and those of Izatida making me reflect on the strange adversities we underwent through the barbarousnesse of Montezuma and Hismalita: O yee too rigorous gods! (said I aloud) cruell father, unnaturall mother, what hath this innocent Lady committed that makes her the object of your indignation? Izatida would not suffer me to say more: Hold thy peace wretch, (said she) Is this the respect thou bearest to those without whom I had not beene in the world? Know tis an addition to my griefes to offend those who are the causers of them. After those few words she held her peace, and kept more then ever a profound silence, which she broke not but when she was compelled. For my selfe, I could not looke on her without almost running desperate; I told Mexiqua I would walke into the Island, to see whether it were inhabited or desert. Mexiqua was of my opinion; and assoone as the sea was fully out, she took Izatida on her shoulders and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her a shore. I got thither assoone as she; and without any delay began my resolved journey. I had not gone two or three hundred paces, but I perceived some little hils at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54727:158"/>
whose feet there was a wood. I thought I might finde some house thereabouts, but there was none. The place yet was very fit to be inhabited, for there were cleere foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of fresh water, treesloaden with fruit, and an incredible number of birds. I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued my way, and went round about the Island, yet found no habitation, nor any signe there had beene any. I returned to the place where I had left my faire Mistris, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing to her the place which I thought most fitting for her retreate, got her resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to go thither. She laid one hand on my shoulder, gave Mexiqua the other, and in that manner let us leade her to the place of her future abiding. Mexiqua was overjoyed with the delightfull diversities of our solitude, and to divert Izatida, told her that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was infallibly surprised, and that she knew not the beauty of the place where she had throwne her. If possible (replied the Princesse) let us obtaine by our prayers that she never get out of that Ignorance, to the end she may let us dye in peace, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy us any more the comfort of a grave. Assoone as we were come into the wood, Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua and I sought out a tuft of trees that might be sufficiently thick to shelter Izatida from the extreme cold of the nights, &amp; those diverse discommodities which in so little a time we had undergone under that inconstant Climat. We found a better then we looked for: For at one corner of the wood there were eight or ten big trees of one same kinde which were hollow, and within each of which two persons might lye at their ease. We chose three of the greatest, one for Izatida, another for her Governesse, and a third for me. In lesse then eight dayes we were so well accommodated in that place, that if the remembrance of you, and the Princesses blindnesse had not troubled our tranquillity, we had confessed our selves beholding to Fortunes cruelty, and the fury of Hismalita. There passed not a day but I went a birding or fishing, and to do the latter with more ease, I went into our sliden Shallop. I tooke no heed how by little and little the Sea had gotten it off from the sands, and drawne it farre more distant from the shore then it was when we were shipwracked. One day, being gotten into it before the tide came in, I fell so fast asleep, that I awaked not, but at the tossing of the boate, and then I found my selfe out in open Sea. Imagine (if you please) what my feare and griefe was. Truly they were so excessive, that I cannot expresse them to you. A thousand times did I bid farewell to my faire Mistris, and making no doubt of my death, prepar'd my selfe for it with all the constancy so little a soule as mine is can containe. But death, asham'd to have ought to doe with so weake an Enemy, turned her weapons against such as were more hard to be overcome. For when the Sun was almost ready to set, I descried cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Alcippus his ship. I made signes to them, and they came and relieved me, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly; for they could neither understand my language nor my signes; and that was the cause why in stead of recarrying me to Izatida's Island, they have brought me hither into this. That which remaines for me to say to you, (Zelmatida) is, that you will obtaine from Alcippus some one of his servants to bring you to the place they found me. I know well enough from thence to guide you to my faire Princesse. But hap what hap may, hazard that voyage; and since you are so much oblieged to her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either lose your selfe absolutely, or endeavour to restore her to her former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Doubt not of it Galtazis (said Zelmatida sighing) I will follow thy advice, and desire to be held for a trayt our and coward, if in spight of all the obstacles and forces of Mexico, I see not restored to the throne that divine Princesse, who is unfortunate and miserable, onely because she would hinder my being so. After he had taken this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous resolution, he turned to Polexander, and imbracing him: Let me owe my life (said he) to him to whom I owe my liberty, and after so many different obligations, let me have one which I will esteeme beyond all the other: and tis (Polexander) that you will give me leave to be gone, and bestow on me Alcippus ship and Pilot. Do what you please (replied Polexander) and dispose absolutely of those things which Fortune hath given me. After this interparlance, they embraced and tooke leave of each other; but that same Fortune with which Zelmatida thought himselfe reconcil'd, more apparently burst out against him in this occasion, then ever she had done in any of his precedent adventures. The ayre grew darke on the suddaine, as if to make the lightnings more visible, the thunder began to grumble with a dreadfull noise, the winds added new tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults to this confusion of the ayre, and the Sea compelled to undergoe her usuall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54727:159"/>
found no quiet in her very havens. Zelmatida grew almost mad at this hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but Polexander told him there was no likelihood that storme could long stay him, and a day or two more or lesse for so long a voyage as his, was not considerable. No, said Zelmatida, I am too much used to the injuries of Fortune, to perswade my self she will so soone be weary of persecuting me. But let her do her utmost against me; let her arme all the Elements, to deprive me of the hope of reseeing Izatida: I will either o'recome her hatred by my resistance, or she her selfe shall be forced to give an end to my affliction by the ending my life. This resolution is worthy so great a courage as yours, (replied Polexander) yet if you will hearken to reason, she will tell you; it is to hate Izatida, rather then to love her, in seeking rather to destroy your selfe, then to succour her. Ah Polexander, (said Zelmatida) you had none of these thoughts when you threw your selfe into the midst of the greatest dangers, and among thousands of Enemies, onely to heare tidings of Alcidiana. Well, (said Polexander) let's talke no more of that, nor make Love either more rash, or more wise then he should be: we will send for your Pilot and Mariners, and if they thinke you may safely put to Sea, I will be the first that shall solicit your departure. Zelmatida thank'd the King for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and besought him he would presently send for his men, which he did; and within a little time his Messenger returned with five or six Mariners, to whom Polexander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated (in the presence of Zelmatida) what he had disputed with him about the unfitnesse of the season. They al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed the tempest to be extraordinary, yet told the Princes they had passed over farre greater. 'Tis enough, (said Zelmatida) I expected not so great a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from fortune. Let us on then my friends, assoone as may be, and give her no time to know what good she doth us unawares. After he had thus concluded for his departure, he (the last time) bad farewell to Polexander, and taking Galtazis, Garruca, and his other domesticks with him, presently imbarked himselfe. Polexander saw them go out of the haven, and when he had lost sight of the ship; Go happy Zelmatida, (said he to himselfe) goe and receive the reward of thy fidelity, and never complaine of Fortune. 'Tis I that am the onely and prodigious example of that unmercifull goddesses fury. I have longings, and no hope; I am wilfull and obstinate in things which I know to be impossible, I run after a shadow, a Chimera, which vanisheth when I think to catch it; and my best grounded intentions are so many waking dreames. Shall I give way to this invicible necessity, and shall I give so much content to mine enemie, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my self overcome? No, I will dye, since I cannot vanquish; and yet I will not dye as long as I can defend my selfe. Make an end then (cruell Fortune) make an end of what thou hast begun, and suffer not a man without hope or armes to contest with thee so long time for the victory. After he had said thus, he retir'd and spent the rest of the day with Alcippus. Diceus in the meane time performed his Masters commands; and when all things were ready, presented himselfe to Polexander. The Prince presently remembred what he had order'd, and asked whether it were done? Diceus told him he might part when he pleased. Let it then be presently, (replied Polexander) and though there be no hope left for us, yet let us not faile to act that which only hope makes other men put in execution. He went forth of the Palace as privately as he could, and by a by-way came to the haven; where he found his ship ready, and the winde so favourable, that had they beene all enclosed in his ship, as in that of Ulysses, he would not have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen another. He left the Canaries behinde him, and doubled that point of the Madera Island which lookes to the West, and is by the Inhabitants there called the Den, or Cove of Wolves. O what vowes and prayers made he to the Incomprehensible Power which commands the winds, makes the Sea calme or raging, and to whom only there is no place inaccessible, when he saw himselfe so neere the fatall place where all his feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city was inclosed! Had Polexander absolutely left himselfe to the guidance of that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is very likely his voyage had beene more fortunate then all the former. But his passion bringing him to have recourse to false Divinities, that Power which cals it selfe jealous, could not endure such Idolatry, but call'd those furious winds which are the Messengers of his anger and appointing them to be Officers of his Justice, delivered up to their rage our Idolatrous Lovers vessell. Those violent executioners of their Masters will, flew to the farthest of the North to finde out the cold, and the hayle; and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54727:159"/>
them to the exhalations of the South, which are still contrary to them, from thence form'd both lightnings and thunder. Polexander who imputed to Fortune the crosses which came from a higher hand, thought at this time there would be a decision of their ancient quarrell. He therefore undaunted, looked on death, and addressing himselfe to that imaginary power: Encrease (said he to it) the tempest if it can be; make the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the fire but one Element, carry me up to heaven, and then throw me down into hell: dash my ship against the rocks, or beate her in pieces by the impetuousnesse of the waves: I feare nothing, provided that by my shipwrack I escape the mis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hap of being any longer kept from the place of Alcidiana's abode. This prayer was too unreasonable, and addressed to a Divinity too weake to be heard, for that very day was Polexander driven back againe in ken of the Canaries, and from thence into that fearefull extent of Sea which separates both the worlds. The same Spirit which had stirred up the storme, taking no pleasure in mans sufferings, sent our Heroe a calme, and by a pure effect of its favour, brought his forlorne ship into a sanctuary, which Nature had fram'd with her own hands for the safety of Navigators. This haven was of an ovall forme which separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted two rocks, and is at the end of an Isle which is almost equall distant from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, the Azores and the Hesperides. Polexander much mov'd for not seeing any end of his labours, went on shore, and commanded Alcippus and Diceus to follow him. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as he was landed, he lay downe on the grasse to refresh himself, but persecuted by his secret disquiets, he arose sighing, and began to walke in a way much beaten. After he had gone some five or six hundred paces, he saw a great wood, and at the entrance into it many little houses. He shewed them to Alcippus and Diceus, and contrary to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, seeming very curious, Let's go see (said he) on what place the storme hath thrown us: And with that went towards the Cottages, and as he came neerer to them, descried such things as are not seene in the habitations of Fishermen, nor other the like Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Though they were but of wood, earth and thatch, yet were they all of one Symme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and disposed in such order, that they were joyn'd together by very thick and high inclosures. He came to the Gate, and finding it open, entred into a court not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like a cloyster of the Carthusians. After he had a while consider'd the place, and saw no body comming or going, he was afraid to disturbe by his presence the quiet of those that dwelt there. This made him resolve to retire, but on the instant he was staid by the plaints and sighs of a personage he saw not. He therefore drew neere as softly as he could to the place whence they came, and beckning to Alcippus and Diceus to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive, plac'd himselfe on the side of the third cottage doore. The party that lamented was within it, and made knowne the height of her affliction by the vehemency of her sighes. At last she betooke her again to her speech, which her sobbings had interrupted, and with a voice powerfull enough to vanquish inhumanity it self, spake thus: I see well, that in changing of place, I have not chang'd my fortune, and in carrying alwayes with me the unhappy affection, which is the sole cause of all my miseries, it happens to me as to those unpatient sick, who think to recover their healths, in forsaking the places where they lost it. Ah incomprehensible wisdome, which dost all things for the best, I do not complaine either of the weakenesse or other infirmities of our Sex! I admire the order of thy Justice in my owne calamity; and beleeve, it is not without some my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, that after thy causing us to be borne without defence, thou exposest us to those irreconcileable enemies, called men. But why permittest thou that our eyes, our hearts, and our own reason should arme themselves against us, and give us over (will we nill we) to the mercy of those monsters? Why finde we allurements in our tormentors? Why sweetnesse in our tyrants? and in lieu of neglecting them even when they love us, why doe we love them when they most despise us? And thou too amiable Po—ha! what was I like to say? I had almost named the cruell one that kils me, and thou (I say) insensible Prince, why seest thou not me in the extremity whereto thou hast brought me? But for what new punishment return'st thou into my thoughts? O get thee, get thee from that place which is filled with nought but the markes of thy ingratitude; and be not so barbarous to stay and gaze on those tortures which by thy meanes are inflicted on an innocent Lady. Her teares and sighes gave a period to her complaints, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing Polexanders curiosity, forc'd him to open the cottage doore. He there saw a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54727:160"/>
Lady laid on the earth, upholding her head with one hand, and wiping her teares off with the other. She appeared to him so faire in the midst of her sorrowes, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed her beauty was farre more then her sadnesse. The desolate faire one no sooner saw him, but she gave an extraordinary shrieke, and shut againe her doore, without speaking a word. Polexander amaz'd at the Ladies astonishment, excus'd himselfe to her, but saw her not; and fearing to displease her, went to another Cell. He found the doore of it open, he knock'd, he call'd, and for feare of committing another error, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when some one would answer him. But 'twas all in vaine, no body came; and had he not taken on a resolution to enter without leave, he might have stood there till night. He made signe to his Squire and Diceus to follow him, and entered into a hall, which had nothing of the austerity of an Hermitage. The seeling was painted black, and on the black, there were fires quenched with teares, Love-knots cut by Sythes, wings broken, mirrors shatter'd, and among so many signes of despaire, there were seene little Anchors, which seem'd to say, that the misfortunes describ'd in those Devises would one day have an end. Polexander dwelt not long on them, beeing woo'd thence by other paintings which fill'd all the one side of the hall. He stood so much surpris'd, nay truly so much astonish'd when he had well considered them, that being not able to speake, he took Alcippus by the arme, and shewed him with his finger the causes of his wonder. The Tables were all hung of one height, yet some were longer then others. The first in ranke was the portract of a Prince who by his smoaky colour, by his curled haire, by the littlenesse of his eyes, and the disproportioned features of his face, made them cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure how sensuall he was, and how inconstant aswell in his love as hatred, Polexander knew him by his Inscription:
<q>ZABAIM KING OF SENEGA, OF GUINEA, AND OF ALL THE LANDS WASH'D BY THE RIVER NIGER.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The second Table, (which was one of the longest) represented an Amphitheater, on whose degrees there were a great number of Spectators. At one of the ends was pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Knight, who held his sword to the throat of a man who seemed to be drowned in his bloud: and at the other end, the same Knight was represented betweene two Lions strucken through with many wounds, and laid dead on the sand. Above this Table were these words:
<q>THE COMBAT OF ZABAIM FOR THE INFORTUNATE ALMANZAIRA.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The third Table was as the first, and shew'd the picture of a Lady very sad and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Polexander could not know her, because there was no Inscription. Underneath these three Tables were foure more, of which, the first was the second of the longest. On that was seene a great assembly of all kinde of people, and in the midst of them a Prince and Princesse holding hands. The two next Tables were square, and the principall causes of Polexanders astonishment. The first, shew'd a young Turk, above him was writ, BAJAZET; and underneath these letters, C. L. U. A. P. D. S. Our Heroe look'd earnestly on that Bajazet, knew him for the same that was Captaine of the Pirates of the Ocean, and did all he could to compose words from the seven letters which he thought to have some mystery in them. But that which amaz'd him more, was to see the picture of his brother next to the Turkes; and the more he would doubt of it, the more was he compelled by the excellence of the Painter (which had made it perfectly resemble him) to confesse it was that young Prince which was held for the fairest man of his Age. But how could he doubt of it, since he saw these letters at the foote of the Table, I. P. H. I. D. A. M. A. N. T. U. S. After he had well look'd on it, he turned towards Diceus, and ask'd if he knew it not? Diceus answered, 'twas Iphidamantus. 'Tis
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54727:160"/>
he, 'tis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (said Polexander) and what makes me absolutely beleeve it, is, that I see him by Bajazet. That Turke loves him, and may be, more then he should. My brother tooke notice of it on diverse occasions, and hath told me, he saw his picture in a box which that Rover alwayes wore about his neck. 'Tis a strange thing to be borne in the darkenesse of false religion. The most eminent personages are in it subject to feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abominations, and their vertues are blinded with so many vices, that when a strict examination hath passed on them, they are found nothing lesse then what they are in the month of Fame. Polexander being freed from these considerations, cast his eyes on the last Table of the second ranke, and there saw a man, who in the night time, let downe a childe (from a window) which was in the swathing cloathes; and further off, the same thiefe was seene running away with the Infant. These words were at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Table:
<q>THIS WAS THE FIRST MISCHANCE WHICH BETIDED <hi>ALMANZOR</hi> PRINCE OF SENEGA.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At that name Polexander renewed his amazement, and knowing not how to fit this stealing of Almanzor, with the adventures which the mute Almandarin had made knowne to him. However it be, (said he) Fortune and Fame are very just, in filling the Land and the Sea with the brave name of Almanzor. O Prince, more worthy of envy then pity! how extraordinary is thy Fate? Thou findest Immortality in the grave. Thy glory hath as many Theaters as there are Kingdomes and Cities where valour and love are in estimation; and those very Isles which are almost unknowne, are acquainted with thy Name, and publish thy great actions. Polexander had a subject for speech too faire and pleasing to stop there. But he was constrain'd, by seeing enter into the hall a Lady, not so young and faire as the first he had seene there; yet one, who by her maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and sweetnesse was not lesse powerfull to draw his eye on her. He came to her with a great deale of respect, and after he had asked pardon for the liberty he had taken: Madam, (said he) it was not an indiscreet curiosity which made me land on this Isle. A storme drove my vessell hither, and the ill weather stayes me here. The Lady turn'd her eyes on Polexander, and taking from the sight of him I know not what secret joy, she answered him thus: Do not attribute either to the winds or Fortune, a chance which without doubt came from that mercifull Goodnesse, which after the triall of my patience, would make use of you to put a period to all my miseries. And truly, when I feele the inward comforts I receive in seeing you, I am oblieg'd to believe, the will of heaven was the Author of your arrivall, and it declares to me by those extraordinary agitations, that next that Power I should acknowledge you alone for my Deliverer. The Lady thus ending her speech, Polexander would have replied to it, but she hinder'd him. She tooke him by the hand, and leading him to a corner of the hall, for feare of being heard by Alcippus or Diceus: I have beene here now almost five yeares, (said she to him) and all this time no creature could come to know who I was. But at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, in stead of concealing my selfe as I have done hitherto, I finde I am compelled to tell you my name and fortune, without feare of any new miseries that may betide me by so important a declaration. You see here Almanzaira sometimes Queene of the fairest kingdomes of Africa, and now miserable and exil'd into this unknowne Island. Polexander was much surpris'd at the name of Almanzaira, and not doubting but she was the same whom Zabaim had repudiated, would have told her the tragicall end of Almanzor: But she gave him not time, for bringing him into a garden, which seem'd rather cultivated for necessity then pleasure, led him into a wood wherein were many faire alleys, and seating her selfe in a place inviron'd with little <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rfe-banks, invited Polexander to doe the like. Alcippus and Diceus went another way, and the Queene seeing her selfe at liberty, in this manner began the recitall of her adventures.</p>

                  <head>The History of ALMANZAIRA and ZABAIM.</head>
                  <p>I Owe the honour of my birth to that great King, who by the extent of his territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as by the strength of his people, hath alwaies disputed with mighty Belul the title of Emperour of Ethiopia. His name was Almanzor, and because the Queene my Mother was brought to bed of me upon the River Zaira, he would have me called Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira. You wonder may be, to see the colour of my face not answerable to that of my Nation, but your astonishment will cease, when I shall have told you, that my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as borne in Europe) was farre whiter then I. That Princesse had not by my birth the contentment she expected. For she never had her health past her childbirth, but dyed after three or foure yeares languishing. Almanzor having lost so amiable a wife, turned all his thoughts and care to preserve what she had left him. I was then all his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: and noting in my extreame childhood, I know not what inclinations, which bred great hopes in him, 'twas his will I should be brought up with the most of wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and curiosity. To that end, he built for me a Palace in the midst of his gardens, and gave me many Ladies of eminent vertue, that having alwayes in sight, persons of such perfection, I might at last become somewhat that was not ordinary. I profited so well in that schoole, that at the age of ten yeares I had gotten to such knowledge as bred wonder in my Father and Governesse. I liv'd in a continuall repose to my age of sixteene; but as if that sixteenth yeare had beene the utmost terme of my felicity, I found my selfe (though innocent) involv'd in crimes and infamy. Farre from the Kingdome of Congo, raign'd, under the authority of the Queene his Mother, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch feared of all Africa, whose remembrance is as deare to me as his enmity is sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Almanzaira could speake no more, but her sobs did for her, and told Polexander that, which may be she had not dar'd to say her selfe. At last she grew recollected; and retaking her discourse: Zabaim, and my deare Lord (said she) is the Prince I meane. He had not yet attain'd to his eighteenth yeare, when his desire of fame, and the curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site of seeing strange Countries made him leave his Kingdome. He got to Sea, attended proportionably to his quality. Some time he spent in the Court of the King of Guinea, from thence he went to that of Benin, and came at last to ours at Congo. Almanzor welcom'd him as a potent Prince and his ancient Allie. Some few dayes after his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, some body spake to him of my beauty and wit, and those relators told him those tales lyed the more boldly, because they were certaine I was not to be seene, and by consequence Zabaim could not convince them of imposture. At first that young King heard those praises without shew of any desire to see me, nor any great discontent if he had not: seene me yet. But assoone as he heard how my Father caus'd me be kept in a Palace whereinto none had accesse, he seem'd presently troubled, and growing in love on heare-say, or rather following the error of most young people, who affect nothing so much as what is forbidden, resolved to see me. When he had set that designe on foote, all others were suspended: and without foreseeing the difficulties of his enterprise, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in imbark'd himselfe with all the indiscretion which commonly accompanieth those of his age and quality. He might have made knowne his desire, and have asked the King my Fathers leave to present his service; but he thought it would be no glory to him to take those wayes which should be common to him with Princes of lesse value. He therefore concealed his intention from him, strove to win some one of my dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks, set his Confidents on worke, walk'd at all times neere my lodgings, and by a young mans imprudency no day past without talking to Almanzor of his depart, and yet staid without any appearance of a just hinderance. Some time past before my father had any suspicion of Zabaim, but so soone as he had reflected on his discourses, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the cunning. He therefore set his confidents as spies over him; and watched him with such care himselfe, as one evening he found him with one of my women. Be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54727:161"/>
pleas'd to imagine whether he were offended at it, he who was the most severest Prince of the world, and the most jealous of his reputation. His first thoughts were to kill Zabaim. But loath to draw so powerfull enemies on his armes, or at least pardoning the Princes youth, he thought it best to be freed of him without any noise. To that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the next morning he writ a note to him in the name of the Prince his Confident, and sent him word, his designe was discovered, the King was advertis'd of it, and that if he did not quickly save himselfe, he ran the hazard of never seeing his owne Kingdome againe. This letter was so nimbly thrust into the Princes bed, that he perceiv'd it not, though he was present. When he was laid he found it, and calling for a torch to see what 'twas, was much amaz'd when he saw his designe thrive no better. His courage yet fail'd him not. A day or two longer he staid in Court, with as good a cheere as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and inventing a specious pretext to colour his departure, took leave of the King my Father. Almanzor, somewhat troubled for thus making him quit his Kingdome, sent spyes after him, with charge, to see what way he tooke. At their returne they said for certaine he was gone towards Guinea. He thought then that the Princes passion would go no further, and that it was rather a Caprichio of youth, then a designe well framed. Time confirmed him in that opinion, and his minde was quite at rest; when the King of Benin sent his Ambassadors to him to renew their ancient Alliance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to be pleas'd that the Princesse his daughter might passe some time in my company. Almanzor thinking himselfe much oblieged to the intreaties and civilities of that Prince, dispatch'd two of the principall Lords of Congo, to restore his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ratifie the treaty of their Alliance, and to offer him aswell as to his daughter all that was in his command. Not long after the returne of my fathers Ambassadors, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Palmira, (so was the Princesse of Benin called) and was receiv'd with all magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and the first day lodg'd with two of her Ladies within some of my lodgings. Our first interview was accompanied with all that, which courtesie makes use of in the like occasion; but there was this difference betwixt my complements and those of Palmira, that mine were all heart and freedome, and hers mix'd with so much feare and humility, that I knew not how to behave my selfe to her. She had not been with us above fifteen dayes, when a strange accident discover'd to me the cause of her submissions and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. The King my Father who punctually visited me twice a day, had let slip foure, without either seeing or sending to me. I wondered at his neglect; but I did it more, when one evening I saw him come into my chamber, dragging after him a man who had his hands bound behind him. As farre off as he saw me, Almanzaira, (said he to me; with the tone of a voice which witnessed at once both his choler and griefe) where is Palmira? I answered, she was retir'd. Let her come to me, (said he) and turning to one of my women, commanded that servant to call her. Whilst she was gone, Almanzor did nothing but walke with hasty strides up and downe my chamber. Some times he lifted his eyes and hands to heaven, then he stamped on the planching, and afterwards stopping short before me: O heaven! which seest all, (cryed he) and art just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After that, he turn'd him to my Governesses, and with an angry brow, 'Tis you, (said he) unusefull and perfidious women, which one way or other are become confederates with mine enemies, and you shall receive the deserv'd punishment of your negligence and disloyalty. As he ended these threatnings, Palmira entred my chamber. She neither trembled nor look'd pale; and though in her conscience she knew her selfe guilty, yet shew'd such a height of courage, as is not usuall with maidens. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as she saw the Prisoner which my father held, she knew him to be her principall Confident, and judging by his surprisall her cunning was discovered; in lieu of being troubled at it; she spake thus to the King my father: Think more then once on what thou intend'st to do. Thy precipitation may work more mischiefe then my rashnesse hath done. Give no eare to it then; if thou wilt preserve the name of discreet, and give thy selfe patience to heare me. I call to witnesse that eternall Providence which reades my heart, and beseech it to be never auspicious to me, if I hide from thee the truth of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54727:162"/>
neither she, nor any of her women, ever knew me for other then Palmira Princesse of Benin. Let them live in that error still, and talke not to them of a crime, of which they are ignorant, that they may so continue without knowing the offender. Almanzor was staid at Palmira's words, and though he gave no great beliefe to them, yet fearing to commit a fault, durst go no further. Presently he led away Palmira, with his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and left me and my women, poore innocent creatures as we were, in such a feare, that we passed the rest of the night in asking one another what offennes we had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with Palmira. At day breake, there came into my chamber, the President, and the most ancient of Almanzors Councell: After they had put forth my Governesses, they asked me many questions, and would compell me to confesse, I knew Palmira for some other then the Princesse of Benin. (Be pleased my deare Comforter, that I open not againe an unfortunate processe, which made those who knew me not, to suspect my innocency, and was like to have utterly ruin'd both mine honour and life.) Know that Almanzor, (of a debonaire and loving father, growne suddainly a mortall enemy) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the inhumane and miscreant Baramas Prince of Anzicana, to maintaine pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely I had lost mine honour with Zabaim. In prosecution of this false accusation he gave me over into the hands of such Judges, who without doubt were wonne by that unfortunate Tyrant; and with his owne hand sign'd the Sentence of death which they had pronounced against me. 'Twas by that bloudy Judgement I understood, not onely Palmira to be that Zabaim for whom I was accus'd, but also how without any regard to the quality of a Soveraigne he was condemn'd to three strange kind of punishments. First, they enjoyn'd him to marry me, to satisfie the publique Scandall, and restore me my honour lost by his meanes. Secondly, he was to fight with Baramas, or confesse the crime whereof he was accused. And lastly, 'twas said, if he escap'd the first combat, he should be expos'd to the Lions for reparation of the injury he had dar'd to commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Crowne of Congo. In the interim, the Name of Zabaim and his regall qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity running in my minde, I long time meditated on the danger he had undergone for me; and by little and little engaging my selfe to wishes for his most advantage, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd the discretion wherewithall he had liv'd among all the liberties I had given him. Afterwards, I approv'd of his love; and finally, my memory representing him to me farre fairer then it was painted there by mine eyes, made him so deere to me. that I griev'd not so much to lose mine honour, as to be depriv'd of so true and respectfull a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. For himselfe, he thank'd the Judges for their severity; and calling them his tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gods, and his benefactors, besought them a thousand times, to cause their Sentence to be speedily executed. His excessive joy, made my father thinke, I had not so farre for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten my selfe as to satisfie the Princes desire. Notwithstanding, imagining he could not stop the speech of the people, nor resettle his shaken reputation, but by that great execu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ion, he would not have it put off. Many of his subjects petition'd for my pardon and Zabaims, and told him, that though he would not be so good a father as to have pity on a daughter whom all the world thought innocent, yet should he be so wise as not to draw on his hands the forces of many of his neighbours, who sought but an honest pretext, to proclaime warre agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>st him. These reasons, which in all likelihood should have staid, were the cause why he hasten'd the execution of Judgement. I will not tell you Zabaims extreame joy, when he was taken out of prison to marry me; nor what countenance I kept during an action which in effect was to me as glorious, as in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance it was full of dishonour. The Prince spake to me a hundred things powerfull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to obliege me to love him, yea if I had beene to that time his enemy; and seeing I dissolv'd in teares: Madam, (said he, casting himselfe at my feet) why do you so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly afflict your selfe? In troubling the peace which the witnesses of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science should give you, you justifie the injustice of our common enemies. Remember that you are innocent, and in performing the actions of a criminall, you cast blots on that most pure reputation with which you ought to returne to heaven. But what an ill Interpreter am I of your sorrow? You weepe not with griefe for your offence, since most certainely you have committed none. 'Tis the discontent to wed a Prince without Name and merit which afflicts you: and you believe without doubt that this alliance is no lesse infamous, then the crime whereof you are unjustly accused. If it be so, Madam,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54727:162"/>
be of comfort, since you shall be a widow assoone as married; and at farthest within foure and twenty houres you shall see your selfe freed from that ignominious servitude whereto a cruell necessity hath ingag'd you. I could not endure that Zabaim should say more; but entreated his silence, and my request was accompanied with such a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as sufficiently shew'd him what my intention was. The chiefe Priest of the gods of Congo, had order to come where we were; and he entred with his attendants, where omitting no ceremonies which are observ'd at the marriage of Princes, he link'd Zaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im and my selfe in such a bond, that in spight of a devilish Sorceresse charmes it holds to this day. Assoone as these Rites were performed, the Prince of Senega was conducted back againe to prison, and I was left without any other company, then my afflictions, teares and prayers. The next morning, they made me put on mourning, and in those funerall ornaments, I was brought to the place where my deare husband was to fight with the perjur'd Baramas. He came presently after me, and desiring to see me before he died, presented himselfe at the foote of my Scaffold. Long time stood he with his eyes fix'd on me, and shew'd he durst not speake for feare of offending me. I perceiv'd his feare, and (desirous to assure him of my love, by such termes as was firting for me) Our enemies (said I) have imagined they should lessen your courage, and encrease your adversaries valour, by cloathing me as if you were already dead. But their malice shall have a successe quite contrary to their hopes; and the black I weare, is a certaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of that death which your valour and just iudignation have prepared for them. For the rest, if you love me, thinke of preserving a life which is the beginning of mine; and fight with this beliefe, that one onely Soule equally animates both our bodies, and she therefore cannot be separated from yours, but it must instantly abandon mine. I will then, Madam, (replied Zabaim) live and overcome, since 'tis your pleasure; for I should doubt of that Providence which governes all, should I doubt of the victory, which its Justice and your Innocency assures me. The Prince could not answer me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his enemy was come into the field, and cryed audaciously, To the combat. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Zabaim left me, and flew on Baramas as swift as lightning, met with him like thunde, and had sooner kill'd him, then they perceiv'd he was wounded. This facility of quelling a man, which had the repute of being invincible, so astonish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>d the beholders, and so absolutely changed their first imaginations; that all with one voyce cryde out, that I was innocent. For all this, I was brought back to my prison, and my deare Lord and husband to his. But the people, confident of my vertue, and enraged at my fathers rigour, ran out of the place where I had beene justified, and ran to the Palace. Great and little, rich and poore, men and women, rushed in, and cryed, Congo is saved, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira is innocent, the Calumniator is dead, and the honour of our Prince is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Almanzor, who gave not over the being a father, though he was a Prince, and a Prince exceeding jealous of his authority, was ravish'd to heare these transports from his Subjects, and those testimonies of love. Yet would he not let goe nor forget the affront which in his opinion Zabaim had an intent to put on him. Seeing then his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects would not be appeased, he arose, and imposing silence: My people, said he, I thought my daughter would have prov'd innocent; but this is not enough, neither for my selfe, nor for her, nor for you. It behoov'd, that she should not have beene suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. Vulgar persons are as those lesser starres which may be obscur'd, and yet our eyes not lesse enlightned. But those whom heaven hath constituted Princes, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the Sun, that being borne to be conspicuous to all the world, all their Eclipses are noted, and their least blemishes not let passe unknowne. I perceive well by your actions and words, that you would have me indulgent, and you beseech me for the life of her whom you think not unworthy of her birth. Well, my people, I will remember I am a father, since that quality is not contrary to the name of Judge and Prince. I cannot erre, since heaven it selfe hath made so publique a declaration in favour of her Innocency. I give you your Princesse, but aske me no more. This impudent and daring young man, who to satiate his brutish appetite, hath caused so many troubles amongst us, must satisfie our just indignation, and restore to my daughter by another way then that of marriage the honour which we may say she hath lost, since she was in danger of losing it. The people replyed nothing to my fathers words, but went out of the Palace,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54727:163"/>
all at once blessing his clemency and Justice. Almanzor was no sooner retir'd into his privy chamber, but two of his Officers came to him. The eldest began thus: My Lord, (said he) Zabaim hath requested a favour from his Judges, which they have denied him, because it absolutely depends on you. And what is that? (my father asked) It is not (said he) that you should give him his life, nor that you should change his punishment; but that you will be pleased, the Princesse may be to morrow on the same Scaffold she was to day, onely to have the contentment to dye in her presence. He entreates you likewise, that she come not clad in those mournefull habits which accused her of a crime whereof she was innocent. That Magistrate spake no further, but attended the Kings answer. My father was pleas'd with Zabaims request, and to shew he liked it, sent one of his Confidents, to command me from him, to deck my selfe the next morrow as I was wont to do on my birth day. This command was the more welcome to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thought Almanzor had acknowledged my deare husbands Innocence, and so sent his will that I should dresse me for the solemnity of my nuptials. On that beliefe I unloaded a part of those afflictions which oppressed me. I set my minde at rest for some few houres; and my hope of being happy was prevalent enough to shut mine eyes which had not beene closed since I was a prisoner. My sleep yet was not so sound, but that it was sometimes interrupted by my dreames and affrightings. By that little light which came at day-breake into my chamber I fully awaked: and calling up those women which served me, commanded them to let my Guard know I was so. With a great deale of joy they obey'd me; and almost assoone I saw enter my chamber the Ladies who had had the care of my breeding. At their coming in all my cares vanish'd; and I believ'd that he who did me that favour, seem'd to promise me many others. Those Ladies dressed me, and their neatnesse was accompanied with so much diligence, that I was ready when I was sent for. Out of my prison I came, and saw all the streets full of people. Joy sate in their countenances, and when I entred the Amphitheater, the clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of hands, and acclamations assuring me of the publique affection, were certaine presages of my approaching felicity. A little while after I saw appeare the valiant Zaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, accompanied with his Judges, and followed by a great Guard. Never did my ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination represent him to me to amiable as he appeared that day. He intimated a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, which made no man doubt but that he was really a King. In the meane time, pity and horror seized upon me, when I saw my selfe so farre deceiv'd in my hopes. My affrightment was farre greater, when Zabaims Judges and Guard, placing themselves on the Amphitheaters degrees, left him alone on the Sand. We gaz'd on one another, with eyes which witnessed the truth of our affection. But assoone as I saw one of those dreadfull and furious beasts, which was to devoure the Prince, I fell (after a great shrieke) flat on my face, and so lay in a swound all the time which my deare husband spent to make himselfe victorious. The shoutes of the people, the noise of the trumpets, and the joy of my women brought me from my fainting. I recover'd my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ight, and the first thing I saw, was my beloved Zabaim, who planting his foote on the Lions belly, and leaning on his sword, seem'd to aske whether there were any more enemies to be overcome. A litle after that deare Prince came to me, and gave me thanks for the good successe of his combat; and saying, a thousand like victories could not make him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy my favour, he swore to me, his utmost desire was to gaine by an honourable death the glory to live continually in my memory. They gave him not time to continue his discourse, nor me leave to answer him: for all the Spectators, leaving their places, and making their excesse of joy resound through the place, came all thronging about my Scaffold. Some tooke Zabaim, and (whether he would or no) placing him on the buckler wherewithall he fought, put him on the shoulders of ten or twelve men, and in that manner carryed him about the Amphitheater. Others tooke off the Lions skins, and (with them) setting their heads on tops of pikes, carried them as trophies before the invincible Zabaim. During this little triumph, some advertis'd the King my father of what had passed, and though he seemed discontented at it, yet Zabaims vertue touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and judging, by what he had done, what he might doe, esteem'd himselfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py (in himselfe) to see me the wife of so great a King. Yet, he would not let the people perceive he was capable of so quick a change. He kept in his Palace; and though he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54727:163"/>
Zabaims alliance as much as his Subjects, yet he seemed as if he had beene yet in his first sentments. When those who caried Zabaim were entred the Palace, they ask'd to see their King: He came out on a terrace, (which was in a place from whence one might easily speake to those in the Court) and seeming to be much astonish'd; What's here (said he) my subjects? Have you chosen another Prince then my selfe, and put in my place the man I see on the buckler? The multitude confusedly answered, no: And after they had many times cryed out, Heaven save our Soveraigne Prince! My Uncle began to speake for all; and told my father, that Congo besought him by his mouth to preserve a Prince, which had not onely vindicated his innocency by all kinde of proofes, but who promised no lesse by his valour then to add to the Crownes of Senega and Gambra, those of the greatest Kingdomes of Africa. As my Uncle ended his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, I entred the Palace borne by ten Gentlemen. At sight of me, the shouts and applauses began againe. But when the people saw that Almanzor was not to be mov'd, they fel on the earth, and said they would never rise thence, till they had obtain'd Zabaims life, and the accomplishment of my marriage. At last my father was pleas'd to be forc'd, and told them he accorded to their prayer, what he would not have yeelded to the solicitations of all the Kings in the world. They thanked him for it after their manner, by shouts, clapping of hands, and other confusions. Assoone as Zabaim was at liberty, he came, tooke, and led me to my father, of whom he knew so well and with so much eloquence to aske pardon, that he got it for us both. Almanzor granted it with his eyes full of teares, as transported, he imbrac'd us both, and leaving himselfe to be wholly overcome by his owne good nature: I have (said he) erred my children; and knowing you as I doe at this present, I disavow my circumspection and hastinesse. Live happy, live long! What said I? Let us live together full of quiet and honour, that our perpetuall union may make us beloved of the good, and redoubtable to all miscreants. Zabaim cast himselfe at my fathers feet, when he heard him speake with so much affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and imbracing hard his legs; My Lord, said he, you shall never repent you of the favour you have done me. I wil give you a good account of the life you have given me, &amp; if so be the favour of heaven second my pretentions, I dare vaunt, that the glory of my forefathers shall be but a part of that which I will leave to my children. Almanzor took up my deare husband, and held him long in his armes without the power of speaking a word, except that he would forget what was passed, or would not remember it, but to affect more the person who had cost him so deare the getting. These tokens of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation having spent the rest of the day, the two following were bestowed in preparing the solemnity for my nuptialls, and the pastimes wherewithall they were to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied. For many months our Court was busied about nothing but in celebrating my mariage feast. After all the sports were ended, Zabaim tooke leave of the King my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and departed, to satisfie the request of all his subjects. For my selfe, who could not resolve to leave a personage that was so deare to me, I fell into a swound in bidding him farewell, and in that manner was carried into my deare Lords Ship. After a happy voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age we landed at Senega, and were there welcom'd with all the magnificence which the people use to display on the like occasions. Two yeares together Zabaim serv'd and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me with the same distance, and the same passion which lovers make shew of in their first pursuits. I was his sole delight. I absolutely ruled the minde of the Queene my Mother in law, I enjoyed the love all the Kingdome, and never Princesse liv'd invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned at once with so many prosperities: Truly they were excessive, and so not of long continuance. At the beginning of the third yeare, Love gave place to warre. Zabaim offended by the King of Melley, entred with his armes into his territories, and made himselfe master of them. The Kings of Temian, of Guma and of Dama arm'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to reestablish that Prince; but by the valour of Zabaim they were enveloped in the fortune of their allie. The King my Lord, loaden with palmes and honour, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to me, and renewed his former flames. A little time after the King of Guinea, who by his power had made himselfe redoubtable to all his neighbours, and who alone thought himselfe to be the Arbitrator of peace and warre, put a great Army into the field, and sent to proclaime warre against Zabaim. My deare Lord, unwilling to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this audacious Prince to goe unpunish'd, entred his Kingdome, and conquer'd it with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54727:164"/>
an incredible promptitude. But alas! how fat all were his victories to him? what did he lose in getting that great kingdome? and how cruelly did a slave belonging to the King of Guinea, avenge the defeate and death of his Master? Yes, (my deare Deliverer) du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Conquest, Zabaim by my mis-hap rather then by his fault, or if you will, by the power of charmes and philters, rather then by his levity, became so dislike himselfe, that you cannot without horror heare that which I have to tell you. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I relate to you so prodigious a change, promise me, rather to bemoane my Lord, then to blame him, and that no compassion which you shall have of me, winne you to wish him ill: for, I shall hold you for mine enemy, if you cannot love me without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him whom I love more then my selfe. Rather bemoane us both: abhorre that witchcraft which hath had power to ruine so solid an amity; and if you have ought which you can lawfully affect, beseech the Author of all love which is sacred, that he give you not over as he hath done my deare Lord and husband, to the mercy of those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Sorcerers, which corrupt the best dispositions, and make brutish the most ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of men. The three first months of my deare Lords absence, I heard so often from him, that I admir'd his care of writing to me, and the speedinesse he commanded his Couryers. The fourth, both the one and the other grew more slacke, and the fifth passing without any newes at all, I was perplexed with so great apprehensions, that both sleeping and waking me thought I still saw that deare Prince in his grave. Had I not fear'd his displeasure, I had gone to see him in his Army. But rather willing to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, then to undertake ought he might dislike; I had recourse to my vowes and prayers, and did then nothing but beg from heaven, either to take me from the world, or preserve to me the friendship of my deare Lord, without which my life was a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to me. In lesse then three weeks, I sent above twenty Postes into Guinea. Those who most truly loved me, return'd with that haste I commanded them, and brought me the Kings letters. I receiv'd them with that transport of joy you may imagine. But when I saw not in them those termes of love I had read in the former: Alas, cried I, I have lost my Lords affection. Unfortunate that I am! some one of my actions, or of my words, have receiv'd an ill interpretation. I confesse, deare Zabaim, I have erred; but how great soever my offence be, it merited not so rigorous a punishment, since my heart never consented to it. My griefe had even carried me to despaire, if my women had not used all kinde of reasons to suppresse it. Sometimes they accused me for suffering my self to be deceiv'd by vaine imaginations; then they put me in minde, that time and businesse had changed the Kings amorous thoughts into others more serious. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations did a while master my sorrow: but a little after I rejected them, and would receive no more comfort. At last, after I had well wept, written much, long expected, and made many prayers and sacrifices, my deare Lord return'd to me. I did not think to see him of eight dayes when he came into my chamber. This suddaine welcome surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall so transported me, that going to meet him, I lost at once my strength, my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and my sight. What did not that good King doe, seeing the excesse of my love? He kissed me a thousand times, and wetting my cheekes with his teares, stood a while without turning his eyes from me. When he saw I came not againe, he caused me to be carried and laid on my bed, where joyning his mouth to my cheeks, Poore Princesse, (said he aloud that my Nurse might heare him) can I be rationall and betray thee as I do? With that he held his peace; and stirr'd not from my boulster till some remedies had recovered me, which by little and little I did; and the first thing I took notice of, were some teares which were yet on my deare Lords face. That sight presently blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out all displeasing imaginations that remain'd yet behinde, and making me believe I had ill conceiv'd them, I gently let fall my head on Zabaims cheek, and thus bespake him: Your Almanzaira then is yet pleasing to you. She may yet glory she enjoyes your favour, and time hath not depriv'd her of that which love had given her. The King could not answer me. His Speech was restrained by I know not what hinderance; but his silence and teares assured me of his love farre better then his words would have done. I besought him to go take a little rest, and after so long and painefull a journey, not to give himselfe new vexations. To these words I added a many more, and entreated him so often to looke to his preservation, that he arofe from me; but in rising said: Ah Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira!
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54727:164"/>
how happy should we be, if we might be alwayes together? Though that Speech made me feare some new disaster, yet I made all other thoughts give place to that of the Kings health; and pressed him so hard to go repose himselfe, that he gave me that contentment. He was not above two houres away when he came again to me, where he passed the evening and part of the night. In all which time, he left not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine me in the same manner he was wont before his voyage. Nay, me thought, he had in his speeches more of tendernesse and of passion, then I had noted in those I had from him when his love was most violent. I know well these particularities doe but weary you, and you may laugh at my simplicity: but, pardon if you please (for this troublesome remembrance) a woman who loves nothing in the world but her husband, and yet cannot have the contentment to be with him. Five or sixe dayes together the King was in his good humour: and I already esteemed my selfe the most fortunate Princesse of my time; when I found my feares were just, my suspitions reasonable, and the Kings kinde usage but forced. He fell without any apparent cause into so deep a melancholy, and was mov'd with so much impatience and disquiets, that in all the Court there was none but I who found him supportable. My entertainement grew troublesome to him, all companies displeas'd; and not suffering himselfe to be seene but seldome, he abode whole dayes retired in his Cabinet. His anxiety went yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It made him hate his Palace, the aboade in townes and the frequency of his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. He retir'd him to a Castle which his Predecessors had built for their pleasure in hunting, and seem'd to be delighted with that Sport, to have some pretence and meanes to muse and plod at his liberty, and wander the woods alone. This life made me feele my first griefes, and search all the imaginable meanes to know the cause of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to apply a remedy. Before I had recourse to those extraordinary, I would try the most speedy and facile. I therefore went to the King in his retirement, and besought him, by his first affection to tell me the cause of his melancholy. Deare Almanzaira, (said he) if it be true that thou yet lovest me, doe not enquire after my affliction. Get thee from me, and let me undergoe the punishment I have deserved. The feare I had to displease him, kept me from pressing him any farther, or staying longer with him. With mine eyes drown'd in teares I left him, and promised in that to shew my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as well as in all other things. Believe what I am now about to tell you; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by judge of my Lords noble nature. He could not refraine from weeping when I went from him; and the griefe he had to see me afflicted, made him to teare his haire, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes beg his death from the Deities. When I was come back to Senega, my first sorrowes renewed; and feare, representing to me the future, more unfortunate then I have found it, made me leade a life so retired, as if with the Kings favour I had for ever lost the hope of seeing him againe. At last I threw my selfe into the armes of the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteds Comforter, and thence supplicated for sufficient strength to resist so prodigious a calamity. Truly, that Bounty that would not have a teare of theirs lost who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to its will, suffer'd not mine to be fruitlesse, but granted all I petitioned for See how it hap'ned. You may please to know, that among those who came with me to Senega, there was a Prince of my bloud who became so pleasing to Zabaim, as he made him his Confident, in spight of all jealousies from the Principals of his Kingdome. That Prince so wisely husbanded his favour, and so gentilely oblieged even those who had professed themselves his enemies, that by little and little he quell'd their envy, and fill'd all the Court with admiration of his vertue. In this generall approbation he had beene a yeare when he was engaged to follow Zabaim into Guinea. At his returne he avoyded all occasions of comming where I was &amp; durst not come to give me an account of those commands I had given him. I presently therefore thought him guilty, though was innocent; and not knowing on whom to throw Zabaims change, I imagin'd Almaid (so was the favourite call'd) had wrong'd me to him, that he might solely pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse him. With this beliefe I returned to Senega, and gave it not over, till I understood the true subject of all my afflictions. Zabaim one day sending to me Almaid, to make knowne the affection he preserv'd me in midst of his melancholy, or rather to hinder my complaining of his ill treatment, I conjur'd him by our neerenesse of bloud, by my sad fortune, and by the authority which heaven had given me over him, not to conceale
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54727:165"/>
from me any longer the causes of Zabaims hatred. When I perceiv'd he strove to put me on some other discourse without answering me, I redoubled my entreaties and commands, and led him into a little closet whereto I usually retir'd me to weepe more freely. When he saw himselfe alone with me, he was not a little perplexed, and much doubted, I was not come to that extremity, without having taken some strange reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. I shut the doore, and fell on my knees before him, with an intent to move him by those extraordinary submissions. Straight he kneeled too, and almost not daring to looke on me. Madam, (said he) let not your Majesty doe any thing unworthy your birth, and vertue, and suffer not a curiosity (which cannot but be prejudiciall to you) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease a malady which it cannot cure. No, no, (replied I) I will not lose the occasion I have to get out of my miseries by one meanes or other. I cast me at your feet, Almaid, not as your Queen, but as a poore afflicted Lady who hath need of your assistance. Take pity therefore of so many teares which I have vainely spent, and suffer her not to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish out her whole life, whom you can comfort by one onely word. Almaid, moved by my teares, could not hold his first constancy in so great a cause of compassion, and falling to weepe as well as I, call'd himselfe a thousand times unfortunate, and wish'd he were dead. I left him to his raving a long while, and spake to him all that my griefe prompted me, to winne him to discover to me the cause of all my miseries. But when I had long expected, and saw his pity extend no further, then to bewaile and not to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour me: I arose, as one furious, and getting out his sword: Barbarous and inhumane wretch, (said I) which hast but a false and seeming pity on my afflictions, and who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest pleasure in persecuting of Innocence by thy feigning comforts; thou wouldst have me with mine owne hand perfect that murder which thy calumnies have begun. Almaid hearing me speake in that fashion, and knowing I was resolute enough to fall on his sword, had he gone about to take it from me: Madam, (cried he) preserve that vertue which hath made you hitherto victorious over your enemies, and know your wrongs are lesse dangerous then the remedy you will apply to them. I will not propose to you these considerations to release me from that absolute command you make me. Know, Madam, I will obey it. But you must please first to promise me secrecy, to be of good heart, and to have power enough over your selfe, to suffer without resenting the most unjust contempt in the world. Were I now (replied I) to heare my Sentence of death, and that I should be engaged to execute it my selfe; I am ready prepared. I refuse no kinde of torment, so I may know what 'tis that troubles the King, and makes him hate the sight of me. You shall be satisfied, (said Almaid) and I sweare to you by that which is greatest in heaven, I will conceale nothing of what you desire to know, on condition you first render my sword. There 'tis, (said I) and do not believe, if thou deceiv'st me, but there are meanes enough to deliver me from my miseries, and make thee repent thy treachery. Almaid, judging by my actions as well as words, he must either ruine me, or discover Zabaims secret, resolv'd to save my life even with the losse of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He arose then, and assoone as he saw me set, (beginning his discourse by a long Preface, which tended to nothing but the justification of mens inconstancy) told me, it betided even the most wise to have extravagant humours, and to preferre the most abject things which they possest not, before the more excellent they enjoy'd. After that preparation, he related to me as succinctly as he could, how Zabaim in his conquest of Guinea was falne in love with a white Slave; and so fondly amorous, that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the alterations she wrought on him, 'twas necessarily believed she had bewitched him. This Sorceresse (Madam) hath not onely made him forget his first affection, but made him insensible of his owne honour, and not left him so much discretion to hide the excesse of his folly. Most commonly, the like passions are of small continuance; and though they are even strong enough to last in spight of time, yet have they not such ability as to bicker with absence. This love of Zabaim is quite contrary. Time strengthens it, absence, in lieu of quenching, feeds and augments it. Those mad men which are chain'd up, have not more fearefull agitations then this Prince hath every day. He finds no ease but in his self-vexations. He hates all company where his griefe is restrain'd. He flies into the forrest before day, and most commonly there spends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire nights. He scarce eates or drinks. He hath ever in his mouth the name of Zelopa,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54727:165"/>
(so is that Sorceresse nam'd) and if he see her not againe the sooner, I will not promise you his life. Here Almaid ended: and I, who was prepar'd to heare matters more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, found my selfe in heaven when I heard this. I look'd on Almaid with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse he expected not; and desirous to let him know how I tooke it: This is then (said I) all the cause of my Lords melancholy, and his aversion to me. Truly you are not to be pardon'd for being so reserv'd in a businesse, which hath not troubled me, but onely while it was conceal'd from me. Your extraordinary silence had been excusable if Zabaim had intended to have repudiated me, or to immure me to be starv'd betwixt foure walls. But what thought you would betide when I should know the King lov'd another woman then his wife? The corruption of all Ages, and the examples of all Princes have taught me, that 'twere worth wondring at if Zabaim should not take the way of his Equals, but have beene contented to enjoy one sole woman. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile his weakenesse, I deplore his blindnesse, I condemne his inconstancy, but I wish him no ill at all; and were not heaven displeased with his passion, I should be the first to serve him as his Agent. Go Almaid, go, and labour for that Princes quiet who loves thee so dearely. Leave him no longer in his despaire, bring her hither whom he loves, and free him from those feares he suffers for my sake. I promise thee I will not crosse his contentment, nor omit any thing belonging to the endeavour of a wife of honour. Were I in your place, I would quickly finde some specious pretext, whereby, without scandall, that happy Slave, what said I, that happy slave? that abominable Sorceresse, might live with her Lover. But why should I soyle my selfe in your ordures? All you men are ingenious enough in wickednesse, without any need that my too much love to my Lord should make me your Confederate. When I had thus spoken to Almaid I was silent to heare what he would answer. But he was so ravish'd with my resolution, and so astonish'd at my constancy, that he could not reply. At last he came out of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and falling at my feet, Madam, (said he) your wisdome this day saves all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and I hope in little time your vertue will be the Kings preservation. Since you have taught me with what dexterity this malady is to be treated, I sweare to you I will forget nothing of that which may hasten his recovery. Thus ended our discourse. Presently I writ a letter (to the King) full of respect, and sent back Almaid to him: and within short time understood how Almaid had taken the way I had prescribed him. Zabaim had a cessation from those cruell tortures his affection inflicted. By little and little he became accessible, left his country life, and recalling about him all those whom his melancholy had estranged, made the Court as full and flourishing as ever. But not to shut himselfe presently within his Cities, nor to give his subjects a new cause of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining themselves with his alterations, or rather to drive away the time whilst they went to fetch the infamous Zelopa, he would needs make a progresse through his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes. Before he began it, that journey he came to Senega, and entreated me by the love I had alwayes borne him, to forget what was passed, and to be the same with him I had beene the two first yeares of our mariage. I confesse to you, I receiv'd his excuses as if they had been true; and was as sensible of his kindnesses, as if a loyall love had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them. He was so overjoy'd to see my affection nothing lessened, that a hundred times in a day he asked my pardon for his extravagancies. For my part, I doubted not, if he had not been forced by some witch-craft, but that he would have repented him of his error, and beene wonne againe by my care and complying. In this good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency we began our progresse, and so ended it. 'Tis true, that oftentimes he fell into his frensies, and was as transported from himselfe by the charmes of that Sorceresse. But his disquiets lasted not, and the hope he had of reseeing Zelopa, joyn'd with the facility he promised himselfe from me, made him hide his passion so well, that it troubled no body but himselfe. We went even to the frontiers of Guinea, and Zabaim, resting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in a very faire towne, intended to stay there till the Spring, and resolved to passe that season in all kind of sports and pastimes. Three weeks or a month after our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, the speech went, that the onely daughter of the late King of Guinea was coming to the Court, to cast her selfe at the Kings feet, and to beseech him for somewhat whereon to subsist after the ruine of her house. This newes coming from the Town to the Court, at last entred my closet; and one day, Almaid so well watch'd his time, that he spake
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54727:166"/>
to me of that supposed Princesse, even in the Kings presence. I seem'd to believe what he told me. Zabaim was overjoyed at it, and saw well by my innocency, I would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute as much to the setling of his pleasure as himselfe. When Zelopa was within three dayes journey of the Court, I advised the King to send to meet her, and give her all those honours which appertained to a Lady of her extraction. He prais'd my courtship, and promis'd to follow my counsell. But when he saw I resolv'd to go so farre to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Zelopa as out of the towne, and conduct her my selfe to the Palace, his joy so much troubled him, that had I beene ignorant of his affection, that which he did to thank me, had beene sufficient to have too much discover'd it to me. Some five or sixe houres after, Zelopa came to a Castle which is but a quarter of a League from the towne. I went thither to her with all the Court, and neglected nothing of that which might sarisfie her pride or expectation. I found her not more faire then Almaid had describ'd her to me. But I saw by her countenance she should be very humorous and cruell. My conjectures (alas!) have beene but too true; and I feele yet daily the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects of that ambitious and barbarous minde. Let me relate to you my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in order, and you will admire, what my desire to please Zabaim made me do in spight of my inclination. I kissed that infamous woman, I spake to her in her owne language, to entertaine her the more civilly, I intimated to her the resentment the King and I had of the honour she did us, and so was with her, as she had beene the greatest Princesse of Africa. In a very ill garbe she returned my complements; and shewing a brutish pride in her actions as well as words, gave a most disadvantageous opinion of her selfe to all those that came with me. I endur'd all that fooles extravagancies for his sake that lov'd her; and forgetting the birth heaven had given me, gave her place, and with the most respect I could, brought her to the Palace. Zabaim, whose passion deserv'd pity, came out of the towne, and under a pretext of hunting, would witnesse to the Sorceresse, that her absence had nothing at all lessened the power of her charmes. But, (my deare Comforter) let us lightly passe over this fatall enterview, and be pleased, I spare him, who is so much the more to be bemoan'd, because 'twas either by force or frailty that he became guilty of my misfortunes. The pernicious Zelopa was receiv'd and lodged in the Palace as if she had beene something more then Zabaims wife. She was serv'd with so much order and State, as made all the Court quickly believe there was some mystery in those Ceremonies, and that she was not come to implore the Kings elemency. The day after her arrivall, there were by his command Justes proclaimed, and to make himselfe amiable to that foole, made the most prodigious expences that ever love joyn'd with prodigality had ever brought any man to. All the winter was a continuall succession of Sports, of Masks, of Feasts and other pastimes; and he was not in favour with Zabaim, who would not ruinate himselfe to encrease the monstrous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his luxury. Whilst these wicked riots drew the anger of heaven on the head of my deare Lord, I was almost continually in my closet, bewailing the crimes whereof I reputed my selfe guilty. But being not good enough to appease the eternall Justice, I employed in those actions of pity, all that were esteemed good people in Senega. Day and night were the Temples open, and our Priests did penance for their Soveraignes sin, oppos'd their prayers and Sacrifices against the impetuous hand of heaven and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Zelopa had not beene at Court full six months when I found my selfe with child. I conceal'd that alteration as much as I could possibly; and as if I had foreseene the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series I was to undergoe for it, did nothing but weep and afflict my selfe, till I was brought to bed. For all that, my women no sooner discover'd that which I conceal'd, but they divulg'dit; and by that declaration fill'd all our Territories with a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond imagination. Zabaim no sooner heard of it, but he abandon'd for a while her, who compell'd him to looke on me with contempt, and came to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe at my feet. Many times he kiss'd my hands, and bedewing them with his teares, Deare Almanzaira, (said he) can you endure the sight of the most ingratefull and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious of men? But I wrong your vertue to doubt of those miracles you can doe. Yes, you love me in spight of my infamies, and the case wherein you are, gives me so great and so certaine proofes of it, that I must hold those for mine enemies who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Innocency, but in witnessing the joy I had to see him. Eight dayes he staid with me; and during all that time, he either thought not on Zelopa, or thought on her but to despise her. O happy had miserable Almanzaira beene, if her Lords good motions had lasted longer, or rather if Zelopa's charmes had had lesse power on the will of so great a Prince. He seem'd to be absolutely freed from her, when Zelopa sent to aske his leave for her returne into Guinea. At the sole name of that Sorceresse, he returned to his first mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. He was likely to have falne downe flat. He suffer'd incredible agonies; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I heard him say, (turning his eyes on me as he had beene ready to give up the ghost) make an end Almanzaira, finish my miserable Destiny, and suffer me not longer to languish. No, no, my Lord, (said I) you shall never perish through Almanzaira's fault. Had your malady none other remedy then my death, it should not be incurable. Come home to your selfe then, and figure not in your thoughts those ills which are not. And since Zelopa's company is so necessary for your repose, either stay her by your love or power. With that I left my chamber, which I had not done in three months before, and went to the lascivious Zelopa. I wonder'd to see her so much altered, and beleev'd she had given out speech of her departure, by that trick to re-inflame Zabaim's affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I entreated her to stay yet some longer time in Senega, and easily had my request granted. 'Tis true, she yeelded not to me, but on condition she might goe from Court, and have the liberty to retire her selfe to some place where she might not be seene but by her owne domesticks. I carried Zabaim that newes; and may boast, by that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (which shall be ever glorious to me) I preserv'd his life. Presently he left me, to run whither he was hurried by the power of Charmes, and the next day departed the Court and Towne without bidding me farewell. He shew'd Zelopa all his Kingdome, and to take from before her all displeasing objects, he embarked himselfe with his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and carried her into the fairest and most delight some of his Islands. Shee tooke a great delight in it, and calling to her ayde all those Spirits which had made her eyes and tongue so powerfull, compell'd them to pluck out of Zabaim all his remainder of reason and humanity. The poore Prince felt the effect of those new Sorceries. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an enemy to his fame, to his people and his owne bloud. He forgot his woefull Almanzaira, and casting the respect of himselfe into oblivion, he ador'd his Crime, and lay buried in the sensualities and ordures of Zelopa. Neere three months slid away; during which, I contented my selfe in complaining alone, and weeping without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but when I saw my misery grow every day worse and worse, and that Zabaim neither sent me Letter nor messenger, I could not chuse but let my griefe breake forth. Restore me my Lord, (wicked Zelopa) cried I often, and oppose not thy selfe against the Decrees of that Soveraigne Justice which would not have thee enjoy him. My wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and friends joyn'd their complaints with mine; and (believing it would please me) said all, so great a licentiousnesse was not to be longer endur'd. Cruell and unjust friends, (I replied) to what crime will your unfitting cares of me carry you? What, shall wee revolt from our Prince? Is he not absolute Master of our lives? and can his actions be reprehended or chastis'd by any other power then that which is above his owne? The Ladies were astonished at my resolution and remonstrance: and making them knowne to their husbands, hindered them from putting in execution that which they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd for Zelopa's destruction. In the meane while, I drew necre my time, and fear'd lest by my too much tormenting my selfe I might become the murtherer of that on whom my utmost hopes were setled. Living therefore in some rest, in regard of it; I talked mightily alone, and of accusing me for too much endangering the life of a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which was Innocence it selfe: I will no more afflict me, said I; the Gods, Nature, my Duty and Love forbid it; and I should be more guilty then Zelopa, should I stifle within me the Image of Zabaim, the hope of so many people, and the cause of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching happinesse. Keepe then, keepe Almanzaira the treasure thy deare Lord hath entrusted thee withall, and deprive not thy selfe of that meanes which (alone) is left thee, for the freeing him from a Witches enchantments. With the like resolutions, I spent my going with childe, till my ordinary throwes gave way to others which were yet new to me. At breake of day was I deliver'd of a Son, which was receiv'd by all those who assisted me, as if he had beene the tutelar god, by whose vertue the power of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54727:167"/>
the Sorceresse should be absolutely annihilated. A little after his birth, they gave him me in mine armes: As feeble as I was I tooke him; and, I befeech the gods (said I to him) thou beest borne to a more happy Fate then thy Mother. Present<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>y, the Messenger whom I had chosen to carry the newes to the King, went away, and used such expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in two dayes he came to the unfortunately inchanted Island. Zabaim receiv'd the message with an appearance of joy; but sent back my Posts not giving him leave to take his repast, and made him set saile without the permission of speaking with Almaid of any other. The same day he came to me, conceal'd what might discontent me; and inventing an extreme satisfaction, said, the King had promis'd he would be quickly with me. Alas! he came not, and thought it enough to send Almaid. That generous Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, seeing me so desolate, forc'd himselfe as much as was possible for feare of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing my afflictions; but the compassion he tooke of my fortune overcame his resolution, and drew teares from his eyes. 'Twas yet worse when he would have spoken to me, for his speech failing him at the first word, he stood as knowing not what to say, and by that confusion told me, what Zelopa's wickednesse was able to make me suffer. In the meane time, that Wisdome which is the Source of all other, forsooke me not in that extremity. In lieu of despairing at Almaids discomfort, I found my selfe miraculously fortified. My courage encreased, and finding my selfe armed against all that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: What Almaid, (said I) must I contribute a constancy and consolation which I expected from you? Cannot you endure the sight of an unfortunate woman? or have you not the heart to tell to what new torments she is condemned? Almaid seeing with what constancy I bore my affliction, tooke courage; and thinking there was no need of mincing my misfortune to make it the more supportable to me: Madam, (said he) the King who is not yet well satisfied in his former suspicions, would see the little Prince before he would have him acknowledged for his Son. He hath commanded me to come hither, and to bring the child to him without delay. Let nothing hinder you from being conformable to what he desires. Doe this last violence on your selfe. Give him that admirable proofe of your love and obedience; and consider (if you please) the consequence and importance of his command. Cruell and barbarous command! cried I, but I must obey it, since my Lord will have it so; and that with the sensibility of Nature I lose all those feares which our Enemy throwes on us. Take this little In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

One same day must give and take away from me the quality of a Mother; and without doubt by a fearfull agnition that monster must offer up the Son to those Demons which have sacrific'd the father to her. Almaid having by his remonstrances and teares obliged me to put a period to my laments; Madam, (said he) if any of my actions have had the power to make your thoughts doe me the honour as to thinke me worthy the name of an honest man, I submis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let your Majesty therefore set your minde at rest, and satisfie the will of a father who is most dangerous to be provok'd. I wil not say some great hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse may succeed your obedience, but I am certaine, your refusall will render our wrongs absolutely incurable. After he had thus spoake, and told me what perill it was to detaine him, he cast himselfe at the feet of a Lady of Senega, who was most of my Counsell, and all my comfort, to dispose her to follow his opinion. I knew well I must resolve to leave my childe: I therefore call'd for it, and bedewing it with my teares: Goe, said I, little creature, unfortunate assoone as borne; goe, (under the protection of heaven which I adore) whither his commands call thee, by whom thou sawest the light. Give him a tryall of thy obedience even before thou knowest him: and when thou art with him suppresse thy cryes and teares, for feare of his ill interpretation, by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thou turn'st against him all those armes which Nature hath bestowed on thee. With these words I fell into a swound, and my childe had falne on the ground, if Almaid had not caught him. He carried the childe to his lodging, and in lesse then two houres making all things ready, put on his way with my Son, and the women which waited on him. The very day on which that desolate troupe came to a Castle on the Sea side, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54727:167"/>
heard of it, and (leaving his inchanted Island) came to see this living image of himselfe. Almaira presented the child to him, and said I beseech'd him by our first love to consider that Infant as he was the father of it. 'Tis that to which Zelopa repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents me, cried Zabaim. She would have me use that power which the name of father gives me; and would not have any thing that is mine owne to be deerer to me then my selfe. Thou therefore poore innocent creature must bethe Sacrifice, not for the expiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but the continuance of thy fathers offences. Zelopa covets thy life, weake and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Infant; and will not believe my love to be without example, till she have seene me commit a murther which shall never have any. Dye then, since my fury condemnes thee; and let my weake and captivated reason give way to that unjust necessity which pronounceth the Sentence of thy death. What, thou weep'st my childe? and thy little cries seeme to implore my assistance against Zelopa's cruelty. Stay thy teares, smother these laments, and if thou wilt have me to be pitifull, do nothing that may make me so. But alas! I see that all things conspire with thine Enemy. Nature betrayes in fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to succour thee. Thy teares, in lieu of pleading for thy safety, solicit thy destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and thy cries precipitate thy fate, in going about to divert it. Well, 'tis done, I am vanquish'd. Pity hath mollified my hard heart. I feele the force of bloud. I confesse my selfe thy father, and therefore thou must dye: for Zelopa assign'd me that fatall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and commanded me then to begin thy murder, when Nature gave me the most lively and tender feelings a father could have for his Son. Zabaim could not continue his lamentations. The overflowing of his teares, and the violence of his fobs and sighes, tooke away the use of his voyce. He stood sometime like a Statue; but on the suddaine, passing from one extreme to another: He shall dye, since you will have it so, (cried he) he shall dye, the little Monster who will not restore me the life I have given him. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid staid not till the poore Zabaim put those dreadfull words in execution, but snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Son from him; and giving no eare either to his threatnings or prayers, went out of the Castle, cast himselfe into a barke which waited for him at the Sea side, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his little Prince into a Sanctuary; where in spight of all Zelopa's devils, he hath found his happinesse and safety. Yes, my deare Almanzor, that goodnesse which I have so often call'd to thy succour, hath cover'd thee with his wings; and leading thee as 'twere by the hand to that honour thou enjoyest, would have thy very infancy to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse its beauties and wonders. Till then Polexander abode in a deepe silence, but at the name of Almanzor he broake it, and looking on Almanzaira with a kinde of astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: how (said he) Madam, was Almanzor Prince of Senega your Son? Almanzor the lawfull Prince of Senega (said she) is my Son, but he of whom you speake to me, is not. Ah Madam! replied Polexander, how you affrighted me! for if the unfortunate Almanzor had beene your Son, you must have prepar'd your selfe for new sorrowes. Almanzaira shewing her good nature even to her enemies, entreated Polexander to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late what had betided the Son of Zelopa since he was crown'd King of Senega. I am now cleer'd of all my doubts, (replied Polexander) and to make an end of yours, know that Almanzor is now no more then a little dust, and he hath suffer'd for the sinnes of those which brought him into the world. The same passion through which his father hath committed so many crimes, hath made the Son act one, which is so much the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious, since by its execution he hath cut off for ever the meanes of repenting him for it. Polexander had not continued this discourse, but seeing himselfe pressed by Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaira, he recounted to her how Almanzor at the sight of Alcidiana's picture, fell ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely in love with that Queene. That some few dayes after he was crown'd, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke his kingdome, and put to Sea, with a resolution to finde the inaccessible Island: but despairing of his voyages successe, and not enduring a Rivall in Alcidiana's love, he was forced to satisfie his jealousie by a combat. In which he had the better, but recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not so much as he hoped for, he retir'd himselfe into one of the Canaries, and after he had there caused to be built a stately Tombe, had employed his owne against his own life. Almanzaira sigh'd often whilst Polexander made her this relation; and when he had done: All powerfull heaven, (said she) lifting up her eyes, thou hast shew'd thy Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the death of that Infant of impiety, now let thy mercy beseene towards the child of benediction. The offence is punish'd, let the criminals acknowledge it, and after
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54727:168"/>
so long disorders, let all things returne to the course thou hast ordain'd him. Almanzaira and Polexander could not keepe on their conversation, because an old woman (coming in) addressed her selfe to the Queene, and said; Madam, Amalthea is dying, and peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from you before her death, the honour of a visit. The extremity wherein she is, gives me the boldnesse to entreat you, not to deferre that worke of charity: Ah good heaven, (cried Almanzaira) by what accident is Amalthea brought to that ill estate! You may know it from her selfe, (replied the old woman) in the meane time, I most humbly beseech you from her, that you will obtaine so much from this stranger, as his staying in this place till your returne. Polexander delayed not for Almanzaira's request, but offered to abide there, or follow her: and if my Service (said he) may be any way beneficiall, command me, Madam, what you please, and you know your injunctions shall be inviolable lawes to me. The old Matron casting up her wetned eyes on our Heroe. O aspect too dangerous, because too charming! (said she) how true doe I finde that which Amalthea hath so often told me? But, Madam, (continued she) addressing her to the Queene, flye from this desirable Enemy, and come understand such things, which without so fatall an occurrence would not seeme credible to you. Almanzaira comprehending nothing of the Matrons Speech, arose, and after entreating Polexander to give a few houres to the satisfaction of a personage which merited to be obliged: She is (said she) of those unfortunate ones, in whom reason is found to be weaker then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. She hath lov'd in spight of her selfe. She loves still, and hath for two yeares done pennance for a fault which deserves not that name, since 'twas never voluntary. Polexander would gladly have knowne who was this Innocent-guilty-one, but seeing the Matron extraordinarily presse the Queen, he suppressed his curiosity, and presented his arme to assist the Princesse in her walke. She very gracefully would not accept it, and to justifie her refusall, told him, the lawes of her Hermitage forbad the receiving of any such courtesies. With that she went out of the roome where she had entertained him, and making new excuses to him, wish'd him to goe see the grots and water-caves in her wood. You will there (said she) finde such paintings and rarities, as will let you know how much paines the faithful Almaid had taken to make me finde some flowers among the sharpe thornes of my Exile. So she left him, and went as fast as she could possibly to the place where she was so longingly expected.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S soone as Polexander had left the Queene of Senega, he entred an Alley wherein Alcippus and Diceus had long walk'd: and calling them, I must (said he) relate to you such adventures as surpasse all those you have ever yet heard of. He began to walke a great pace, after he had made them this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; and, as if he had suddenly forgot what he had said to them, made almost a turne in the alley without opening his lips. At last he came to himselfe, and astonish'd at his musing, I know not, said he, whence this distraction becides me; but I am an ill presager, or this is a forerunner of some new misfortune. Yet, hap what hap may, I am reduc'd to such a point, that though heaven it selfe had undertaken it, it could not make me more miserable then I am. After these words, he related to them Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira's afflictions, and amplified with all his eloquence the miracles of her patience and piety. Alcippus and Diceus were extreamely mov'd at it; and in their first emotion, besought the King their Master to take so vertuous a Princesse into his protection. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander seem'd insensible to his servants prayers, and setting another discourse on foot, I wish (said he) I were farre from this Island. Certainely I shall meet with some discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent here. I feele my selfe extremely otherwise then I use to be. My body trembles, and my agitated spirit makes me feare the explanation of certaine words which that old woman spake to me who came for Almanzaira. Whilst he said thus, he saw that Matron running as fast as she could. He would faine have avoided her, but not being able to do it without incivility, he went to meet her, and ask'd whether she desired any service from him. You may render a signall one (replied she) to the person that sends me; and she therefore conjures you by the name of Alcidiana that you will not disdaine to see her. At that word Polexander grew pale and trembled, but unwilling the aged woman should perceive it; I will goe (said he) where you please. Yet I am most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine you take me for another. With that he went in great haste to the garden gate, and there remembring his pace was not proportionable with the Matrons; he return'd to her, and so went to the same Cell where he staid at his entrance into the Hermitage. Almanzaira met him at the doore, and shewing her sadnesse by her eyes full of teares: Amalthea (said she) knew you at your first entrance into this place, and though that knowledge hath brought her into the misery she is, yet hath she an extreame desire to see you. It may be she expecteth her cure from the hand that wounded her. Be pleased then to enter, and let us see what lessening of paine that poore sick Lady can receive from your presence. Almanzaira presently led Polexander into Amalthea's chamber, and plac'd him where she might see him. 'Tis he, cried the dying Lady, 'tis even he; but miserable Amalthea regards him not. The desire thou hast made knowne to see him, is certainely a temptation of those cruell Enemies who would retard thee from that rest which vertue hath prepared for thee in heaven. With that she shut her eyes, turn'd her head aside, and calling Almanzaira: Madam, (said she to her) let him depart if he please, and when I am dead, give him the letter which you shall finde under my beds-head. She spake so low those last words, that the Queene well deem'd she was departing. She
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54727:169"/>
lamented her as much as if she had beene her owne daughter; and to performe her last will, tooke the letter which she had laid under her boulster, and gave it to Polexander. The Prince unwilling to stay in a place where his sight was so deadly, went forth much afflicted; and felt in Amalthea's death one of those new disasters whereof a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had spoken to Alcippus and Diceus. He forbore not to open the dead Ladies Letter; but he durst not reade it; for all his imaginations having no other object but Alcidiana, he conceiv'd he should therein meet some great example, either of that Princesses anger or contempt. After he had well considered on what he had to do, he ventur'd to reade the letter, and first found these words on it: To the unfortunate Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander. 'Tis to me indeed (said he) this letter is addressed: For, though there may be other Polexanders in the world, yet there is none that can dispute with me for the title of Unfortunate. Reade then Polexander, reade a Letter which must bely its super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, if it be not extremely dismall to thee. After these words he leant on Alcippus, and found in the paper this that followes:</p>
               <p>SOme other may talke to you of my life; for mine owne part I will give notice to you of nothing but my death; I say of that long and cruell death, of which I have beene three yeares, or rather three ages dying. I was with the divine Alcidiana, and liv'd in that delightfull and continuall repose which Innocence crownes youth withall, when the Queens Sacrificers and Pilots publish'd in the Inaccessible Island the wonders of your life. They spake of your courage, as of that of the ancient Semi-gods. They extold your generosity beyond all others; and prov'd your incredible prosperities were the pure effects of your excellent vertue, and not the favours nor Capricioes of fortune. I confesse it, unfortunate Polexander, I was struck to the heart with the recitall of so many miracles, and Love, whose name and maliciousnesse I knew, tooke the maske of esteeme and admiration, to gaine under that disguise what he could never have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of himselfe. I was in Alcidiana's privy Chamber when this mischance betided. I lost the respect I ow'd to her quality, and that to mine owne birth, and declaring to her my folly: Madam, (said I) is it possible you have so long time beene ignorant of these things, or have you envi'd your Subjects the protection of so brave a man? Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana blush'd to heare me say it, and ask'd me whether her people had need of any other safeguard then her owne? Nature (said she) hath beene too favourable, to reduce us to the shamefull necessity of imploring the help of man. We have no need of Polexander. For, had we beene so unfortunate as to have occasion to use his courage, we would have retain'd him, when Fortune cast him on our Island. Have you then seene him (said I) interrupting him, and can you keep this indifferency, or rather so cruell a neglect? Ah Madam! your insensibility will be one day punish'd. I durst not prosecute this discourse, because I perceiv'd by Alcidiana she lik'd it not; but desirous to leave to her Subjects a memorable example of her severity, she not onely forbad them to speake of you, but by a declaration contrary to her owne inclination, condemn'd your memory to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall oblivion; and any whosoever of her Priests or Pilots which should conduct you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Inaccessible Island, to be expos'd with you to the flames of the Altar of Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. All these rigours no way lessen'd my passion. It got new strength in growing elder, and when I knew it proceeded from love, I found my selfe too weake to suppresse it. One day finding my selfe alone with the Queene, I cast my selfe at her feet, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought her with teares in mine eyes, to let me know all she had heard of you. She grew extremely cholerique at it, but seeing her anger did but the more stirre up my desire and impatiency: I will (said she) give you that vaine contentment; yet I vow your extravagancy amazeth me. A hundred times I kissed her hands in lieu of being troubled, and confessed to her I was no more rationall. In the meane time, my teares, my sighs, my dying looks, and my faintings wrought so much pity in the heart of that Princesse, that she told me of your arrivall in her Kingdome, and the command she gave for your departure thence assoone as she knew your affection. By the content she tooke in that narration, I judg'd you were not so indifferent to her as she would make me believe; and that her passion betraying it selfe, discovered that which she held with so much difficulty. Assoone as she had ended her discourse, I felt my selfe cleane alter'd
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54727:169"/>
from what I was before. Reason which had forsaken me, tooke her place againe, and setting before mine eyes the fault I committed against my selfe, made me condemne my first inclination. I retir'd from the extremity whither my disposition had hurried me, and contemplating you as destinated for the sole Alcidiana: Amalthea, (said I to my selfe) thou canst not love him without a crime: for, to enjoy him, thou must either betray the Queene or thy vertue. Give over then; leave that so amiable Polexander to his just Possessor. But art thou so silly as to perswade thy selfe, that he who so much disquiets thee is so lovely as they would have thee beleeve? Ask some who are lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed then a Mistris and her servants, and thou wilt finde, there is a great disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the true Polexander and Alcidiana's. I did what I said, I chang'd my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and would have let the Queene know it, but she prevented me, and ask'd what I thought of Polexander? That which I thinke of all men, (said I) and I sweare to you, Madam, by the duty I owe your Majesty, that I never enquir'd after him, but onely to satisfie my curiosity. Alcidiana smil'd at my answer; and strictly embracing me: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malthea, (said she) I will fully content that affectation when thou pleasest. Thus wee parted. For my part, I got to my bed. But all night long I did nought but call to minde the defects which they usually cast on men, to give me just cause to neglect you. Not to lye, I had almost effected it, and my imagination had already halfe cured the wound it had made: when Fame contemning Alcidiana's declarations, brought you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Inaccessible Island as a Conquerour over the Kings of Castile and Portugall. I look'd on you with excessive joy, in a table where you were drawne, defending alone the Port of one of your Isles against all the Enemies fleet. The Sea was stain'd with their bloud, and the shore strew'd with Spaniards, which seem'd to have come offer themselves to your sword, that they might have the honour to dye by your hand. O! how fatall was that sight to me! I confesse it to my shame, Polexander, I felt my selfe burne with so sweet a fire, that in spight of all the remonstrances of reason, I tooke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in being consum'd by it. My extravagancy, which till then had beene conceal'd, at that time burst out, and made me stop mine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ares to all prudent counsell. Neither the consideration of Alcidiana, nor the care of my reputation, nor the feare of heaven could make me alter my resolution. I got from the Inaccessible Island, and not daring to take leave of Alcidiana, put to Sea, without other Guide then my blinded passion. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven could not suffer my unbridlednesse, nor consent to my ruine. It staid me on the brink of the precipice; &amp; by a violent fever made an end of another that was far more burning That sicknesse was my health. For that great Physitian which never leaves his cures im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, so strengthened my soule by the weakenesse of my body, that he made me ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of that horror we should have for all the ordures of the earth. I renounc'd the greatnesse of my birth. I tooke leave of the world, and to do a long penance for the errours of my youth, came and confin'd my selfe within this Isle. Almost two yeares have I tried to appease the anger of that incomprehensible Spirit, that is no lesse just then mercifull. I have bewail'd my loving the Creature more then the Creator. I have fasted, I have prayed, I have wept; in briefe, I have omitted nothing of all that which might restore me the Innocency which my frailty had rob'd me of. My sufferings have beene followed by consolations; and though my minde hath beene often tempted by the charmes of your remembrance, yet I can say it came off victorious. Yes, I dare brag now I am certaine of my victory. I see the end of my combat such as I desired. Heaven opens it selfe to receive me, and shewes me that immortall Crowne it hath prepar'd for all those hardy Combatants who know how to tame the rebellion of sense and the disorders of the will. Farewell then Polexander, admire the vertue of Alcidiana, and condemne not the infirmity of Amalthea.</p>

                  </gap>ve (said he) this letter would be to me a Source of new disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. O fortune! O Alcidiana! O love! O death! which of you foure wil have so much pity as to put a period to my miseries? This sad cogitation having a long time tormented him, he call'd to minde the assurances Amalthea had given him by her letter of Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana's favour to him. But he had not beene scarce a moment setled on so pleasing a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54727:170"/>
when despaire and incredulity depriv'd his thought of all those faire Idea's. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd againe to those old distrusts of himselfe, tooke for lyes Amalthea's verities; and rejecting his least hopes as rashnesse worthy thunder, made himselfe as miserable as he had cause to think him happy. Thus, to no purpose he persecuted himselfe when Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira came out of Amalthea's chamber as much afflicted for the death of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse as for her owne misfortunes. At the first word Polexander was about to speake to her, she interrupted him, and shewing him a man who then entred the Court of the Hermitage; 'tis Almaid (cried she) and presently ran to meet him, and said what was fitting to oblige him to speake freely before Polexander. After that declaration Almaid was not fearefull of being knowne; therefore addressing him to his Queene: Madam, (said he) give heaven the thanks which its justice and pity deserve. Your misfortunes are at an end, and your enemies power is extinguished. I know, (replied Almanzaira) the unfortunate Almanzor hath slaine himselfe. 'Tis true, Madam, said Almaid, the brave Polexander which seemes to be descended from heaven, on earth, to free the world of tyranny, and exterminate monsters, hath deliver'd you from two the most fearefull and cruell that Africa ever bred. Polexander in lieu of making himselfe knowne, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke Almanzors defence; and addressing him to Almaid: Our passions (said he) are disorders of the soule, and therefore the harder for those by whom they are govern'd, to preserve either all their judgement or all their imagination. This being so, I wonder not your affection transports you so from your selfe as to draw your sword against a woman, and pardon not the memory of the dead. I am farre from justifying Zelopa, since her actions accuse her, and being condemned by Almanzaira, she is so by the mouth of Justice it selfe. 'Tis Almanzor I defend, not onely for being Zabaims son, but because I knew his vertues, and that he never consented to the crimes of his mother. Besides, his valour was so extraordinary, that all these Seas have beene the Theater of it; and if he had not coveted death, he by his acts would have shewd himselfe the worthy son of that great Monarch who is the Author of his life. Polexander never vaunted he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, and that report which attributes to him the glory of it, is even more injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Polexander then to Almanzor. Almanzaira knowing that Almaid could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this speech but with bitternesse, interposed: and addressing her to Polexander as not knowing him: Your generosity (said she) agrees well with that pity I have for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor. I confesse him to be more worthy our bewailings then our reproaches, and I should not have lesse love to my selfe then Almaid witnesseth, if the just cause I have to wish ill to the mother, should make me descend to hate her son. But tell me (said she) turning to Almaid) how was Almanzors death taken in Senega? Madam (replied Almaid) after Polexander (no matter what they say to the contrary) had overcome the false Almanzor, and the newes of his death was spread through all Zabaims dominions; there was so great and so generall a joy, that the most time-serving, and most interessed Courtiers suppressed their infirmitie and cowardise, to be the first to let Zabaim and Zelopa understand an accident which was to be so insupportable to them. Zelopa was sicke for her Sonnes absence, and had resolved to put to sea to seek him, when her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents brought her newes of his death. At which shee became as immoveable as that Queen whom a like accident had before time turned into a Rock. But when that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall insensibility had even given place to those fearfull resentments, which grief, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, and rage, hurle on all miscreants. Zelopa not onely grew furious, but seemed to be fury it self. She cast her self on the earth, tore her haire, scratched her face, and talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of nothing but what was horrible, called an hundred times for all the Devills in hell to assist her. No, no, cried shee afterwards, come not at all, poore, weak, and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spirits; you cannot give me back the life of my Son, and I desire nothing else from you. The rest is in my power. It must be executed, and by an act worthy my courage, and plunge all Senega &amp; her King in a calamity which shal have no end, but by the death of the one, and the intire desolation of the other. Every one trembled with horror to heare the threatnings of that Fury, and some ran to advertise the King of his wifes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration. Hee came with all speed to comfort her, but he found her weltring in her gore, and yet holding the ponyard in the wound she had made. When she saw him, she cast her furious and gastly lookes on him, and drawing the weapon out of her wound,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54727:170"/>
Hold here Zabaim, (said she) see the last pledge of our abominable allyance. Take it yet reeking with my bloud, and making an end of that murther I have began, appease the shades of thy wife and Son. With that she gave up the ghost, and let fall the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyard she presented to Zabaim. At that word Almanzaira, interrupting Almaid: Alas, (said she) for heavens sake tell me what became of the King my husband? He did strange things, replied Almaid: He tooke Zelopa in his armes, lamented her in termes full of impiety, a hundred times kissed her wound, and all bloudied with his horrible kis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, carried that miserable creature into his closet. The very day of that murder I came to Senega, and caused to be published in many places, not onely that you were not dead, but that the true Almanzor was yet living and full of honour. Assoone as I had spread abroad this newes, and had understood in what manner the false Almanzor was slaine, I put to sea to advertise you of it. That which you are to doe, Madam, is presently to leave the place of your long banishment, and by your presence give content to the longing eyes of so many people which by your returne expect that of their former fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity. Let's go, (replied the Queene) and quickly, to render what we owe to my deare Lord, and not permit (if it be possible) the Sorceries of Zelopa to last after her death. And you, O my deare Comforter, (said she to Polexander) I beseech you by your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerousnesse and your obliging offers, not to forsake me till you have seene the end of those adventures whose beginning I have related to you. I shall have need of your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, your counsell will be behoofull to me, and the same Genius who in comforting me by your sight presag'd my happinesse, tels me, that without you it cannot have its accomplishment. Though (replied Polexander) I account my selfe unable to contribute any thing to the perfecting a worke which more excellent hands then mine have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, yet I will waite on you; and not being capable of performing any more, at least I will testifie my obedience to you. Go hence then Madam the soonest you can, and think how necessary for Zabaims preservation those moments are, which my considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes you lose. Almanzaira went presently to take leave of her Company and Hermitage, and then ran towards the Sea. Polexander commanded Diceus to embalme Amalthea's body, and that when he had caused it to be brought aboard his ship to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to Senega. Alcippus went with his Master, and embarked with him in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids vessell. Almanzaira fearefull, least there might happen some slightnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, did what she could to make them discourse often together: and taking the occasion of letting Polexander know the sequell of her fortunes: I have, said she to Almaid, related to this Knight all that hath betided me to the day that you went to Sea with my Son. I entreat you to let him know the rest. Almaid, who to himselfe had much esteemed the generousnesse of Polexander, was glad an occasion was offered to oblige him. At first he entreated to be excused if he repeated such things as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready heard, and adding to that request other civilities, in this manner continued the adventures of Zabaim and his wives.</p>

                  <p>THat generall peace which reignes so absolutely from the height of heaven to the very depth of the waters, makes me call to minde that most happy day wherein I violated the humane Law to observe the divine: and wherein by a just disobedience, I chose rather to expose my selfe to the danger of losing the fathers favour, then to lay open the Son to the hazard of losing his life. But before I relate to you the strange ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of my voluntary Exile, and the faire adventures which accompanied the youth of the lawfull Prince of Senega; be pleased I recount to you the misfortunes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira, and the dreadfull resolutions which the too much blinded Zabaim tooke, through the ambition and fury of Zelopa. When that Sorceresse understood by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of her Idolater, that the young Prince was got away, she sent all the ships she had
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54727:171"/>
after him, and commanded to bring back againe dead or alive Almanzor and Almaid. Whilst the Instruments of her cruelty strove to execute her horrible commands, she turn'd her fury on Almanzaira, and either by her death or banishment would force the throne to be yeelded to her. To bring that to effect, she altered her ordinary course of life, she avoided all occasions of being with Zabaim, and when she was engaged to see or speake to him, 'twas with such a coldnesse, that not a King, but a slave would have beene troubled to endure it. After she had a while thus dissembled, and saw by her disdaines and cunning refusals, that Zabaim had more love and lesse reason then ever: she counterfeits one very passionate, and complaines that her too much facility hath made her the scorne of him she so highly adores. Zabaim, not able to resist her charmes, cast himselfe at the feet of that harlot, gave her such honours as are due to none but a Deity, confirm'd the vowes of his eternall servitude, and (excepting nought in the world, protests not to retard any thing she will command him to execute. When Zelopa saw him in that fury; What am I the better (said she) for all these protestations, since they prove at last but false hopes and vaine words, whilst another is plac'd in the throne, and solely acknowledged for Zabaims wife? She must likewise onely enjoy you, or if I doe, 'tis fit, I see no more such a difference betwixt her and me as may make me justly doubt of your affection. Ah Zelopa, (replied Zabaim) you know my love is unfained) and that every moment I lay at your feet those Crownes which Almanzaira weares on her head. If that be not enough, exact from me stronger proofes of it, and he who to please you hath not spar'd his owne Son, will not stick at things of lesse moment. Put therefore out of my thoughts the displeasing object of Almanzaira's happinesse, (replied Zelopa) and let not my love have any more the affliction to be crossed by so powerfull a Rivall. Zabaim contented, if not to the death, at lest to the banishment of his wife. But when it came to the point of pronouncing the Sentence, he was strooke with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme remorse, and would not have Zelopa's Instruments employed in that Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He chose one of his Gentlemen, whose age and vertue assured him he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himselfe of it with as much addresse as modesty. Him he sent to the Queen, who since the losse of her Son, was falne into such a strange disease, as she had scarce strength to stand, and yet was it impossible for her to endure either lying or sitting; she was walking in her Palace-garden, when Zucalin, (so was the discreet Gentleman called) came to her. Assoone as she saw him, you are welcome, said she, and pronounce boldly by what death Zelopa would have me end my miserable life. Madam, (replied Zuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim) that is hapned at last which all good people forelaw. Ordinary crimes have drawn on extraordinary; and the love of a Strumpet after it had quench'd that which Zabaim ought you, now enforceth him to account you for his Enemy. O heaven! cried the Queene at that word of Enemy, doth the King then beleeve after so many proofes of my obedience and love, that 'tis possible for me to hate him? Yes Madam, (said Zuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin) He beleeves you plot against his life, and use all kinde of meanes to oblige his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take Armes against him. Almanzaira could not answer to that supposition, but lifting her eyes to heaven; Thou knowest it, infinite Intelligence, who seest the hearts and thoughts of all men, thou knowest it, said she, weeping: Yet avenge not that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny laid on me, for I feare Zabaim may be compris'd in the punishment. Zucalin ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the resignation and vertue of Almanzaira, told her, he had an expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to see her out of Senega, and to conduct her to Melly. Do you imagine whether these newes might touch her? Yet she received them with a constancy which seem'd insensible of all kinds of persecutions. But when Zucalin told her she was to prepare for her departure: How (said she) shall I not be permitted to see yet my Lord once more? and be able to assure him in my leave-taking, that not onely banishment, but even death would be welcome to me, if he had commanded it. Madam, (replied Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calin) that contentment is taken from you, till your Innocency after better examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be generally knowne. Ah Zucalin! (said the Queene) 'tis not credible that the King feares my Innocency. But I can yet well undergoe that last of misfortunes for his sake. After that, she went to a Chariot, which to that end attended her at one of the Palace <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54727:171"/>
as in triumph, and within a few dayes after the blinded Zabaim was publiquely marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Sorceresse: and not onely caused her to be crowned Queen of all his Realmes but declar'd that the children he should have by her, should be the onely lawfull Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. At that word Almaid turning to Polexander: Since you knew the false Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor (said he) I doubt not but you have heard how six months after the crowning of Zelopa, she was brought to bed of him, and in her lying in, receiv'd a discontent, which in all likelihood she could not expect from Zabaim, if Almanzaira had been as deere to him as she was before her banishment. The King of his absolute authority, and may be to testifie to his Subjects he yet remembred and affected Almanzaira, would have Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopa's son to bear the name of Almanzor. The tears, the prayers, &amp; the fury of that cruell &amp; ambitious wretch, could not alter his resolution. She was forc'd to let her Son carry the name of her mortall Enemy, and to avoid by that little disgrace those greater which threatned her. This rebellion of Zabaims will contrary to hers, made her verily beleeve that so long as Almanzaira liv'd, her name would never be blotted out of that Princes memory. She therefore stood no longer trifling out time, but resolved to make her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and to that end gave an accursed Commission to such as she thought fit for such an imployment. But Almanzaira having twice or thrice escaped the knife, and doubly the poyson, after neere fifteene yeeres of imprisonment, was advised by her most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Servants to free her selfe from Zelopa's fury, and by a feigned death to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert a true one. Zucalin (who by Zabaims expresse command had her alwayes in guard) thought notwithstanding all his care and precautions, she would at last fall into Zelopa's traps, and he was the first who gave her that judicious counsell. She consented to him, and after a sicknesse of some forty dayes, which was not counterfeited, but in the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, the report went that Almanzaira was dead. Her women (who the better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive others, were the first deceiv'd) so lamented her losse in speech and behaviour, that in seeing them Zelopa's Spies and the Queens Enemies could no more doubt of her death. At that very time I came to Melly, and confirming the Princesse in her resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I got her by night into my ship, and brought her into the Island we now came from. In the meane time Posts were sent to Zabaim to give notice of the Queenes death; and the more to beguile him, a supposed corps was brought to Senega with all royall pomp and Ceremony. Every one bewail'd her death, and the King himselfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging a part of his faults, gave the Herse such honours, as would have madded Zelopa to have seene them bestowed on Almanzaira alive. Let us leave Zabaim in his just teares, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>erpassing all the revolts and warres which follow'd the Queenes suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed death, <unclear>return</unclear> we to the young Almanzor, who, with my selfe, fled from the fury of his father and his future step-mother. After our ship had sayled all the rest of the day and the following night, I thought the young Prince could not (without an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary mischance) fall into the hands of those whom Zelopa had sent to retake him. I therefore bethought me to finde out some place of safety where I might have him bred up while Zabaim's want of understanding kept him from the knowledge of his errors. I was oftentimes tempted to land in Guinea, but I straight called to minde, Zelopa was there exceedingly belov'd, by reason of the great priviledges she had obtain'd for all that Countrey: and therefore to keepe him safe, 'twas fittest to carry him into some regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose name his cruell Enemy had not so much as ever heard of. But that eternall Providence which is not lesse pitifull then cleere-sighted, tooke me from my superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous care, and let me know, that as Almanzor's birth was the worke of its hands, so would it not that his preservation should be imputed to any other. Our calme was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turn'd into a furious storme, and after ten dayes danger we were freed from it by shipwrack. Farre from the Countries warred by our fertile and delicious Senega, is a Kingdome which on the East hath th' Estate of Biafar, and the deserts of Borea. On the West it is bounded by Guinea, on the North by the wildernesse of Zanfra, and on the South by the Ocean. 'Twas on the rocks which seemed to defend the entrance into the Country that our ship split, and cast us, as I may say, into the armes of a King, who by his excellent qualities and vertues more then mortall, justly merited the title of a Deity which his people gave him, if it be lawfull to communicate to man a prerogative which befits none but him that made them. When I perceiv'd our vessell was ready to run on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54727:172"/>
the rocks of that coast I caused Almanzor's Nurse to be bound fast on a bundle of Corke, and commanded the strongest of my Mariners not to forsake her, but to strive by his utmost power to bring her to shore. For mine owne part, I tooke the little Prince, either to save him by swimming or to dye with him, and with no more trouble expected the wrack which in all likelihood our ship could not escape. Presently our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners perceiv'd we were running on the rocks which lay even with the water, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out we were all lost. They spake parrly true, for our vessell being (I may say) mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously thrust in betweene two rocks, opened by the sides, and yet stuck so fast that it could not finke, nor yet be carried away by the waves. Those whom the feare of death depriv'd of their judgement, threw themselves into the Sea to get to land which was very neere, but they were almost all broken on the rocks. After I saw the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our shipwrack, I lifted mine eyes to heaven, and presenting the young Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor to the Divinity which inhabits there, beg'd for his preservation by the vertues and teares of his mother, and my prayer was heard assoone as ended. The winds which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes obey the will of him that sends them, having executed the command imposed on them, retired to their place of rest and gave some quiet to the Sea. This while the water had gotten into all under hatches, and as the waves broake on the rocks they arose up even to our feet, but straight retiring they seem'd to acknowledne certaine unknown bounds which they were not permitted to passe. I commanded our Mariners to make a little wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t of the best plancks of the ship to carry Almanzor and his Nurse on shore. 'Twas very hard for them to doe what I commanded, the Sea having swallowed all things necessary for that worke. Yet they set to it as well as they could, and in lesse then two houres had fitted somewhat, capable to hold five or sixe persons. They lanch'd it, and two of them getting on it with oares tried the hazard, and carried on shore what the Sea had left us. They return'd quickly, and assuring me there was no danger to be run, I caus'd the Nurse to goe on, and then came my selfe with the little Prince, and so were happily landed. Our Mariners return'd with their waft, but came not so back, for they fell unluckily on the point of a rock, and were compelled for their safety to betake them to their swimming. My care of preserving Almanzor making me forget all other, I tooke him in mine armes, and to discover some place of retreate, went from the Sea with his Nurse and my slaves. I had not gone two hundred paces, when I descried a troupe of men which seem'd to come right towards me. I stood not to think whether that meeting might be favourable to me, but instantly giving thanks to my invisible Conductor, I kept on my way, and staid not till the Abyssins commnaded me to cast mine eyes to the ground. That commandement had not so surpris'd me as it did, had I knowne where the tempest had throwne me, but being ignorant of the cause of that Ceremony, I at first made some difficulty to submit to it. At last the number of those which environ'd me, and for the Princes sake I became obedient. Wee laid us on the earth, the Nurse, my servants and my selfe, and so staid till by another order they made us arise. I cast mine eyes on him that was neerest to me, and knew him for the same Abrinzias King of Benin, to whom I had beene sent Embassadour a little before the Queenes marriage. I fell on my knees, to observe the custome of his Subjects who hold him for a god, as I have told you, and shewing him the young Almanzor: See (said I) a Prince who conducted by that eternall Power which you represent on earth, is come to cast himselfe into yourhands, to be warranted from the cruelty of his enemies. Doe him the same favour you did in times past to his father; and make it appeare by a gracious intertaining, that on just cause your Subjects call you the defender of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Innocency. After Abrinzias had heard me with all the debonarity I could expect from him, he alighted from his Elephant, and taking me apart, entreated me to tell him who I was, whence I came, and whose childe it was which I presented to him. I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied his demands; and gave him such an affright and terrour at the repetition o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After he had
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54727:172"/>
made this holy protestation, he tooke the young Almanzor, and holding him in his armes: Yes, mercifull heaven, (said he) I receive as from thy hands the prefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> thou sendest me by this stranger; and subscribing with joy to the decrees of thy will, I will be this Innocents father, and betwixt him and my Son divide all my love and care. With these words he delivered me againe the young Prince, and intimating to me how happy he thought him selfe in finding so faire an occasion to exercise his charity, entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to follow him. He commanded one of his Camels for baggage, to be given to the Princes Nurse, and would have her still before him. We rode till Sun-set, and then came to a royall house, which is Abrinzia's usuall aboade, when the necessities of his State, and the love of his people permit him to leave the City, and in retirednesse to taste the delights of a Private man. I will not relate to you with what care that good King caused the young Almanzor to be bred: but will onely say, he respected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered him as his owne Son, and the vertuous Andromeda his wife, finding in him those causes of satisfaction which she met not in the person she had brought into the world, would even have given him the first place in her love, if the feare of heaven had not obliged her to observe the order of Nature, and not to bestow that on a stranger, which was onely due to the childe of the family. Almanzor's youth was as noble and faire as the Prince of Benin's was insupportable. Perseus (so was he called) had a melancholy accompanied with a brutish fury, which made him not onely incapable of submitting himselfe to his Governours or to the King his father; but so awkeward and indisposed to all exercises both of minde and body, that it seem'd, heaven having so much exhausted its treasure at the birth of Almanzor, had reserved nothing for that of Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ra a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Serpent, which having laid waste the Territory of Guangara, by the death of more then a thousand men, made himselfe an entry into the kingdome of Benin. He came on even to the gates of the City Budis, and marching as a hardy and judicious Conquerour, came the soonest he could to the City of Benin, as if he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented battle to the King himselfe. He utterly left desolate all those Provinces through which he had pass'd by the justice of heaven. The people assembled and armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against this Monster as against a common enemy, but their resistance was vaine; for that puissant adversary overthrew whosoever presented himselfe before him. No arrowes so great or weighty or sharpe soever could pierce him, and there was no better way found by any for their security then to shut themselves up in townes. After he had made a generall havock through the Kingdome, he set him downe in the territory of Benin. The wood and fountaine of the Sun he chose for his usuall abode; and, as if he had beene satisfied with his Conquests and would now stop their progresse, he stirr'd not more away farre from a place the most holy &amp; most religiously kept in all the Estate of Benin. From time to time he came even to the Towne Gates, and kept the King in a manner besieged within his walls, and wholly interdicted the peoples commerce and exercise. In the meane time the devoute. Abrinzias, contemplating that Monster as a scourge which heaven would make use of for the chastisement of his offences, thought this persecution would not cease but by a publique penitence. He had therefore recourse to those remedies which were taught him by that eternall Law which the most barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous have graven in their hearts. He wept, he fasted, he punish'd himselfe for his people; he added publique processions and solemne sacrifices to his private devotions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the people from their Luxury and debauches, went himselfe every where preaching teares, repentance and amendment. Whilst all the Court was in prayers and mortification, a valiant and generous Knight had an intent to fight with that Monster. He was called Bellerophon, and had gotten so great a reputation through all Africa, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> 'twas held for impossible, that which he could not execute. At all points arm'd he rode out of Benin, mounted on an excellent horse, and resolv'd to dye or to deliver his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey from that terrible slavery. The people drawne by the hope of their safety, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that generous warrier, but at sight of the Monster, feare freezing their bloud
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54727:173"/>
made them abandon their deliverer, and shut them up againe within their walls. Belle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophon was left alone, and his courage encreasing by the generall affright, he went to search for his enemie even among the Palme trees, wherewith it seem'd he would crowne himselfe. The Serpent not being now so eager at his prey as he was at first, would scarce lift up his head when he saw Bellerophon; but by some hissings contented himselfe to make appeare how much he contemn'd his adversary. Bellerophon came on for all the turbulency and furious frightments of his horse, and making use of his agility in shooting, answer'd the hissings of the Monster with those of his arrowes. But none of his shafts could wound him; He was every where invulnerable. Yet Bellerophon gave not over shooting, but hitting him above the eye, made him reare up his red and blew crest, which made on his head a kinde of a crowne, and to unfold all those great circles in which he seem'd to have insconc'd himselfe. He suddenly darted himselfe on Bellerophon, and had infallibly inwrap'd him, but for the extraordinary leape, which (out of feare) the warrior's horse made. The Knight seeing his Steed unserviceable, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted, cast his horse off, approach'd the enraged Serpent, and by a good hap (worthy his courage) with an arrow which strooke out his right eye, we learnt the Serpent was not invulnerable. But alas! that knowledge was dearely sold, for Bellerophon could not avoid the coming to gripes with the Monster. 'Twas related to Abrinzias that the bold Knight defended himselfe to the death, and though the Serpent had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded his armes and legs, he made him feele the weight of his blowes; but his resistance was all in vaine, for he was torne in pieces (for all his Armes) and devour'd by the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. This strange accident fill'd all the towne of Benin with desolation and feare. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor was with Andromeda when the newes came of Bellerophon's death. He had ever dearely lov'd that Knight, being as his companion in all his exercises. You may imagine whether he were mov'd at his losse. Truly he was so much, that it drew teares from him. But his love not being satisfied with these demonstrations, made him resolve on others more worthy his valour and the memory of Bellerophon. He therefore prepar'd him to avenge his death; and his high Spirit carying him to great undertakings, he would by so faire an occasion give a beginning to the miracles of his life. The generous Prince would willingly have communicated his designe to me, but imagining I would not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, he conceal'd it from me; and one day secretly withdrawing himselfe (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to any man) he went to finde out that dreadfull Serpent even among the Palme trees, and to fight with him, took only his sword, his bow and his arrowes. You wil hardly give credit to what I must relate, though there is nothing more true. Almanzor went alone into the wood of the Sun, approacht the Serpent with an heroicall confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, look'd on his hugenesse and deformity without astonishment, and by his noise calling him to the combat, by some arrowes he let flye towards his den would give him time to defend himselfe. The Monster animating him by beating the earth with his tayle, rays'd his crown'd head, and throwing at once venome and fire from his eyes, made the Cedars and Palmes to tremble againe. Almanzor stood firme, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe consulted how he might best encounter that monstrous adversary. Straight he nock'd an arrow, and lifting his eyes to heaven, I doe what I can, (said he) doe thou the rest, and let thy powerfull hand conduct the shaft which mine lets goe at hazard. He was heard. That arrow was so well guided, that it pierced the Monsters tongue, and there stuck fast. The next was more fortunately addressed. It strooke out the other eye, and with the meanes of bringing himselfe on, tooke that away of his defence. Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor mark'd what he had done, and doubting no longer of his victory, shun'd the grapling of the blinded Serpent. After he had long time fought with the trees, and his rage tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on himselfe, had extreamely weakened him by his owne blowes, he lay extended on the earth, and discovered a part of his white and yellow panch. Almanzor perceiving so fit a marke for his arrowes, shot him through, and left not till he laid him dead. When he was secure of his victory, he went out of the wood, and after his thanks to heaven, and vow, to hang his bow and arrowes with the Serpents skin, he return'd to the City, and told all those he met, there was no more to be feared, for the Serpent was dead. Whilst the better hearted went to see whether Almanzor spake truth, he came to the Palace, and there found every body much troubled about him. He presented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54727:173"/>
to Abrinzias, and falling at his feet: Sir, (said he) I humbly beseech your Majesty to pardon the fault I have commited; I come from the fountaine of the Sun, and the Serpent is dead. Imagine Polexander how Abrinzias was affrighted, though he saw Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor unhurt. He enquir'd who had advis'd him to fight with the Serpent, and who went with him to that Enterprise. Bellerophon's death (replied he sighing) drew me to revenge it. I could not live, and suffer the murtherer of my friend to survive him. Heaven hath favoured me so much as to acquit the debt I owed him. Abrinzias lifted up his eyes with admiration and joy, and to satisfie his curiosity, asked Almanzor how all things had hapned. He related it to him, as I have to you; but it was with so much modesty, that Abrinzias foreseeing then what Almanzor hath done since: My Son, (said he) imbracing him, search out new Kingdomes and Provinces worthy thy valour. This little corner of Africa deserves not to containe thee. With that he brought him to the Queene, and recounting so heroicall an action, oblig'd her to shed at once both teares of joy and sorrow; the one for her love to Almanzor, and the other for that of her owne Son. The excesse of Abrinzia's contentment made him not forget what he owed to his people. He sent his Heraulds through the towne, not onely to publish the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents death which had so much annoy'd them, but to make knowne to all, the Author of their deliverance and the publique happinesse; and after that, went out of the towne, waited on by all the Court, and most of the people, and so came where the Serpent lay slaine. The multitude not forgetting their old use, appear'd very hardy where there was no danger; and running on the dead Monster, cut him in pieces; and by that meanes, made Almanzor but imperfectly performe the vow he had made. But whilst the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made themselves sport with their dead Enemy, and vented all their fury on his skin, Almanzor bewail'd the death of Bellerophon, and in a generous piety gathered up his bones and broken armes scattered through the wood, and giving both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his particular friends, follow'd them himself to a place fit to preserve the reliques &amp; memory of that valiant Knight. The good Abrinzias was much mov'd to see so many verall vertues breake forth of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But heaven, who would recompence in the person of Almanzor the injury it had done him in that of Perseus, gave him every day new causes to blesse the arrivall of my Prince, and to forget the imperfections of the legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, through the admirable qualities of the adopted. But while Almanzor liv'd the joy of the people of Benin, the admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Vasquez de Gama, Generall of the Portugall Fleet, returning from Cale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, was by a storme driven into the River of Benin. In lieu of leaving to the Inhabitants that peace he found there, he landed out of his ships men more cruell then the Serpent which Almanzor had slaine. That young Prince hearing of the Portugals i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>rode, ran to oppose them, and by his exploits then, made appeare yet farre more then by his first combat, that he was borne for the ruine and extirpation of Monsters. I, in that adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture followed him, but was so unfortunate as to be taken by the Portugals, and carried prisoner into Gama's ship. I offred him gold and pearles for my ransome, and even told him I was Abrinzia's brother, and omitted nothing of what might make him capable of a resolution to set me at liberty. But the losse of his best Souldiers, and the dishonor to be beaten back againe to shipping by Almanzor, working him to a revenge, made him inexorable. The night after his defeate he weigh'd Anchor, and unmov'd by my teares and supplications, carried me into Spaine, and presented me to the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for Abrinzia's brother. Those three yeares I passed in that servitude., hindred me from being a spectator of Almanzor's great adventures. But heaven infallibly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for some good; and if I deceive not my selfe, to the end my Prince living un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to himselfe as well as to his Enemies, might retard their ruine without taking paines for his owne. Know then, after he had repuls'd the Portugals, and seene their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54727:174"/>
ships farre from the coasts of Benin, he muster'd his men; but finding me wanting, he was so afflicted, and witnessed such resentments as I shall never recompence by any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or the losse of my life. A hundred times exclaim'd he on his fortune, cast his armes away, and running where the slaughter had beene greatest, searched all the dead, to see whether I were of their number. But not finding me, he ran to the Sea; and his griefe transporting him: Theeves and villaines, cried he to the Portugals, give me back Almaid; and if your avarice cannot be satisfied by an ordinary ransome, I engage my selfe to conquer for you all the golden countrey for the liberty of my second father. But in uneffectuall petitions I lose that time which I should imploy for Almaids redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therewithall he sent a servant of his to Abrinzias, to advertise him of my losse, and to beseech him humbly, he would be pleased to command the Royall vessell to be made ready and arm'd to pursue those who had carried me away prisoner. That ship was carefully kept in the River of Benin, and as a thing consecrated to their Deity, was not us'd but to saile some dayes in the yeare, to carry those offerings which the Crowne of Benin owed to the great Temple of Congo. Almanzor went to the Captaine of that ship, and perswading him, that the succouring of the miserable, and giving liberty to those which had lost it, was a pleasing Offering to heaven, obliged him to arme his vessell, and keepe it ready to weigh Anchor assoone as the Kings permission came to him. The very same day leave came, and though Abrinzias writ to Almanzor, not to hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in that voyage, yet he imbark'd himselfe, and followed the Portugals. His ship being not so good a sayler, nor so well governed as those he chased, could never fetch them up. But on the contrary, in the first tempest being forsaken by the Pilot, he was eight or ten dayes at the mercy of the Sea, and at last ran on a bank on a coast farre distant from that of Benin. Almanzor saved himselfe in a little boate that was in the ship, and armed with his usuall armour, landed on that unknowne shore. No sooner was he on land, but he saw himselfe environed with many armed men, who infallibly taking him for another, cast themselves at his feet, and shew'd by their clapping of hands, and their shouts, they were exceedingly delighted. The most apparent of the Troupe, standing a while as ravish'd with admiration or joy; Welcome, (said he) O most happily return'd is this worthy Prince, which was borne for the safety of Nations, for the destruction of Tyrants, and the protection of the afflicted. O my deare Country, dry thy teares, revive thy hopes, acknowledge thy happinesse, behold thy tutesar An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; and come meet this powerfull defender, who is going to pluck thy Princes out of Captivity, and breake the chaines of their servitude. Almanzor was much surpris'd with this mans acclamations, and to know the cause of it, would not take him out of that error. On the contrary, he entreated him to relate what had hapned; who were the enemies he was to fight with? and what was become of those should defend them? Great Prince, (replied the man) I should be too tedious if I recounted to you all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series that have betided us since your absence. Know that the untameable King of Tombut, the furious tyrant of Temian, and the hardy Prince of Agadez, renewing the wars they had other times begun out of meere ambition, and yet under pretext of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging our first Queene, came thundring on this Kingdome with a powerfull Army, and to make the people revolt, publish'd all about, that the King by the advice of the Queen now reigning, had caus'd his first wife to be poysoned, and poniarded his Son. My King (who without flattery hath all the qualities of a great Prince) did what he could to repell force by force, but seeing himselfe forsaken by most of his Subjects, he was constrain'd to shut himselfe up in a strong place he hath on the River of Senega, and to expect there the aide was coming to him from Melley and Guinea. That succour was vainely look'd for; for the Kings fault, which grew not out of mens memories, and his second marriage, which was contracted by a murther and a sacriledge, were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why no body would take Armes for our defence. The King seeing himselfe out of hope to be relieved, resolved to dye like a man of valour. He made a salley on his enemies; but after he had lost many of his people, and received divers great wounds, he was taken, and ignominiously led before the King of Tombut. Zelopa, so is our Queen called, advertis'd of that mischance, did not what another wife would have done. She had no recourse to teares and cryes, but got out of her Palace with a manlike heart, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54727:174"/>
taking the place of the King her husband, made a speech to the people and souldiers, and wonne them to a defence even till death. The Enemy in the meane time sent her a Herauld, and word, that if within eight dayes she resolv'd not to render her selfe to their discretion, they would cut off the Kings head. Those eight dayes expire to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Judge my Lord, if hitherto we have not had great cause of affliction, and seeing you return'd, whether we have not more reason to rejoyce. The man thus ending his discourse, besought Almanzor to take some course instantly for the safty of his father and mother. Almanzor somewhat troubled with the novelty of this adventure, knew not what to resolve; but his innate generosity dissipating all those cloudy, made him see how honourable this occasion might be to him, and the interest he had, not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beguile those who tooke him for what he was not. He resolv'd therefore to assist the imprisoned King, and the afflicted Lady, and intimating so much to the person who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd me: Let's goe then (said he) where the Kings enemies are, and see by what way we may attempt his delivery. The man (after he had kiss'd his hand) replied; I see already the King my Masters fortune begin to alter. His long prosperities are reviving, and the Enemies of his glory shall not triumph over it unpunished. When he had thus witnessed his joy, he directed Almanzor how he was to demeane himselfe, and without surther delay, led him with his companions to the place where Zelopa was besieged. On the way Almanzor let him know his error, told him he was the King of Benins Son, and taking the name of him whom he thought his brother, called himselfe Perseus. The man, not caring much by whom, so his King were redeem'd, made Almanzor to goe on day and night. Their journey was so fortunate, that they entred Senega undiscovered by their Enemies. Almanzor sent his Guide to Zelopa to intimate his arrivall, and he found her very sad, but very resolute, and capable to suffer greater disasters then those which encompassed her. With an extreame joy she heard the newes of Almanzors coming, and the good opinion given her, made her conceive an exceeding great hope of assistance from him. She sent the Captain of her Guard to meet him, and well knowing how to accommodate her proud nature to the necessity of her occasions, she went her selfe so farre as into the Presence to give Almanzor the more honour. She was very well followed, and very richly clad for one in mourning. She courteously welcom'd the Prince, and with so many kindnesses that had he not beene preoccupated by a secret aversion, which he could not be rid of, it had beene a hard matter for him not to be caught by her blandishments. But that just and powerfull Antipathy making him see a great deale of pride and lasciviousnesse in all the Queens words and actions, he staid not with her longer then was time to take advise, and resolve for his combat with one of the Enemy Kings. At breake of the next day, he sent one of Zelop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>'s Heraulds to defie the King of Tombut; and with the challenge, to present him the conditions of the combat. That King who had caused himselfe to be named Indomptable, because he had never beene conquer'd; was ravish'd at Almanzors proposition; and thinking himselfe already victorious, told the Herauld he should let his Mistris know, he tooke an exceeding content in hearing she resolv'd to make an end of the siege and warre by so quick a way. But (said he) tell her, she must not hope that after my victory I will take notice of her teares, nor hearken to her petitions or any her other subtleties. She must dye with her husband, and expiate by fire the murthers they have committed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. To the Prince of Benin, say too, I make profession of keeping my word, and if the chance of warre give him the advantage over me, I will not onely set Zabaim at liberty, but my brothers and my selfe (burying for ever all memory of things passed) will presently returne into our Countries. The Herauld came back to Zelopa and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor, and relating the successe of his negotiation, they thought presently of putting it in execution. At the time prefix'd, Zelopa's troupe came out of Senega, and ranging themselves in battle array before the Enemies army, both parties stood on their guard Presently were seene a troupe of Archers, who conducting Zabaim to the end of the field, bound him with his hands behinde his back to a post, and made the hangman sit downe at his feet, who with an Axe which he carried on his shoulder was to cut off his head. Almanzor incensed with that spectacle, came out of Senega, and in a little time after appear'd on the place for the combat. The King of Tombut straight followed.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54727:175"/>
You well know after what sort a very valiant man dispatcheth such a businesse; and therefore I will not trouble you with the particulars of that which passed in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The King of Tombut did as much as a man could doe who had term'd himselfe Indomptable. Yet his great courage in this combat met not that successe it had found in some preceding: for he was compelled to give place to the valour of a youth of six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, and to receive from his generosity that life which he could not preserve by his armes. He question'd heaven for his bad fortune, accus'd it for protecting of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and charg'd it with reserving its greatest ability for the defence of the most impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions. But this miscreant was deceiv'd in his apparances, and the blasphemies he vomited against the order of the eternall Justice, were but signes of the indignation he tooke at his disgrace, and not any proofes of love he bore to Equity. Almanzor very generously treated him, after he had overcome him, and bearing apart in his affliction as well as in his paine, intreated him not onely to make it appeare on this occasion, that he was worthy the title of Indomptable, but also to suspend all his resentments to give satisfaction to his word. I will doe it (answered the King) and in case my faith had not beene engaged, I would have submitted all my just choler to your courtesie. Truly Fame hath beene ingratefull and jealous for concealing so extraordinary a valour as yours; for mine owne part, I finde a consolation for my defeate in the glory of its Author: and I should thinke it most precious to me could I acquire so noble a friend. I will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse (replied Almanzor) a condition so advantageous to me, I rather beg your amity, and intreat you in giving of mine, not to thinke on this day, but to remember you have overcome me. I am too happy, replied the King of Tombut, and would beleeve I had not bought your friendship with a valuable price, if I had not laid downe for it all my reputation. After this contract of love, the two Princes embrac'd, and by that action gave occasion of different thoughts, not onely to the King who was so ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously bound, but also to the two Armies, and all those who from the wals of Senega had beene Spectators of the combat. Assoone as those two Princes had ended their complements, they cast their eyes on the unfortunate Zabaim; and, as if already they had but one will, went to set that captive King at liberty. Assoone as they came, they commanded thence the Guard and Executioner; and Almanzor looking on the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Zabaim with a great deale of pity, wept almost all the while he was unbinding him. He consider'd him often, and his good nature making him partaker of the Kings ill fortunes: Remember (said he) that Justice which reignes in heaven can aswell chastise Kings as other men. Your afflictions shall have done you good service, if they can make you call to accompt the state of your conscience, and winne you to a serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; hatred together of your former life. Pardon me, Sir, the liberty I take, and do not think, I would wrong your present condition because I have saved your life; or as your Enemies, triumph on your misery. I doe no lesse esteeme you tied to this shamefull post, then if you were seated in your throne; but that which gives me the boldnesse to deliver my thoughts to you, is a desire I have, you may henceforward live happy, and by a true change of life avert the vengeance of heaven which yet groanes over your head. Zabaim, to these words answered nothing, but holding his eyes fixed on the earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed by his silence the enormity of his faults. Almanzor having wholly unbound him, brought him to the three Kings, who presently restor'd his royall robe, Almanzor put on his Diadem with his owne hands, and the peace being presently proclaimed, the gates of Senega were set open. Those who had beene such deadly foes imbrac'd each other, and made appeare by so quick a change, that the Subject hath neither hatred nor love but when they are forced to those passions by those who command them. Zelopa came downe from the wall, (from whence she had beheld what was pass'd) and came to meet the King. The King of Tombut who could not forget his causes of hatred, intreated Almanzor not to engage him to see her, who thinking his request very just, not onely consented he should retire into his campe, but accompanying him to his tent, intreated his wounds might be search'd: He saw them dress'd, and being assured they were not dangerous, tooke his leave of the King, after he had by many vowes renewed the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his friendship. He return'd to Zabaim, (who was in great care for him) and reconducting the King to his Palace, through the applauses and acclamations of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54727:175"/>
people, besought him to have perpetually in minde the businesse of that day. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander not able to abide longer in that impatiency Almaid's relation gave him: What? (said he) intetrupting him, Is this Zabaim of whom you talke the same whose adventures the Queen hath bin pleas'd to make known to me? The very same (answered Almaid) and judge whether Almanzor did not gloriously avenge himself (unwittingly) on that ingratefull and unnaturall father, who would have murther'd him in his cradle. Almanzaira could not refraine from teares at those words, but pleas'd her selfe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling her griefes by her weeping and sighes. Almaid perceiving Polexanders astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; That which you have heard of Almanzor (said he) is well, but 'tis nothing in comparison of what you are to know: you shall see this out-cast Sonne give twenty times life to his Father for that one which he would have taken away; and not onely re-establish him in all his estates, but re-settle in the Throne that Fury who had driven him thence, and robb'd his mother of it. Polexander had yet more questions to aske, but he let them passe for not hindring the contentment he expected from the rest of Almanzors adventures. Almaid perceiv'd his intention and thus went on: For five or sixe dayes together Zabaim seem'd more sad and afflicted then hee was even in his imprisonment, and spoke of nothing but repentance, of change of life, of recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling those whom hee had unjustly banished, and banish those whom hee had more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly retained. Imagine what thoughts these demeanours might worke in Zelopa, and what revolutions she foresaw in her fortune, if she did not oppose the rebellion of her slave. She did it, (and so effectually) that Zabaim trampling under-foot his word, his honour, and his proper interest, threatned the King of Tombut and his allies; and made insolent protestations, to wash off with their blouds the staine they had cast on his reputation. Whilest he was acting his new extravagances, Zelopa was perpetrating new villanies; she look'd on Almanzor at once with the eyes of concupiscence and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: she lov'd him for his person and gracefulnesse, but she hated him because she knew 'twas his advise and admirable vertue which troubled the harmony of her designes, and pluck'd off the muffler she had wound over Zabaims eyes. Yet Love preserv'd his Empire, and Ambition reduc'd it to its former servitude, was compell'd (together with hatred and cruelty) to submit to their ancient Conquerour. Zelopa then reconciles her selfe (unwittingly) to her mortall enemy; she adores him whom shee would before time have strangled with her owne hands, and equally sinnes both against heaven and her owne intention. But Almanzor who under the name of Perseus had gotten the love of all Senega, fled from the monster he was not permitted to destroy, and threw himselfe among thornes to avoyd the walking on flowres which hid invulnerable Serpents. Whil'st Zelopa was agitated with this new Fury, there came divers Postes which made her change, or at least suspend her criminall affection. They brought Zabaim newes, that all Guinea had taken armes, that the Kingdome of Melly was ready to denounce warre, and the most part of the Commons of Senega leant to Rebellion: This Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement was slighted for some few dayes; but that thunder after it had rumbled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while broke out, and Zabaim saw himselfe reduced to the estate of being King of one onely Towne. Almanzor got into the field and sent Couriers to the King of Tombut to intreate him to keep his word: that King forgetting Zabaims follies, came to assist him for Almanzor's sake, and brought with him a mighty Army, whereby the Rebelis of Senega were quickly brought backe to subjection. Assoone as Zabaim had left his wicked Angell, that great courage of his manifested it selfe, with which hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the halfe of Africke. His wisdome accompanied his valour, and even made the King of Tombut to admire him; whithersoever he marched he became victorious, and Almanzor farre more affecting fame then spoyle or prey, gloriously out-went the steps of his Father; in one same day, he redeem'd the King of Tombut whom the Rebells had taken prisoner, and dis-ingag'd Zabaim, who having lost his horse and armes, was going to satiate the fury of his rebellious Subjects. A few dayes after this glorious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Zabaim was inforc'd to resolve on a battle; the revolted were joyn'd, and had composed an army able to amate such hearts as had not beene truely couragious. But Almanzor representing to Zabaim and the King of Tombut the fortune and honour of their former actions, made them contemne the great number of their Enemies. The
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54727:176"/>
battle was fought, and prov'd so bloudy, that from both sides there dyed on the place fourescore thousand men. That memorable day, Almanzor sav'd his fathers life five times, and twice the King of Tombuts; the better cause at last had the victory, and by an entire defeate of the rebellious party, corfirm'd that important verity (which sayes) The Power of Kings is a Power derived from above: and that the bonds which binde Subjects to their duties being made by the proper hand of heaven, cannot be broken without violating the divine Lawes as well as humane. This battle intombing all the Rebels of Senega, did the like to the Rebellion; all the Townes rendred themselves to their former obedience, and that commotion being of the nature of those tempests which happen in the fame Climat, was as short as it was violent: Zabaim seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more absolute in his Realmes then he was before the revolt, would a while enjoy the peace he had restored to his Subjects, to go all fresh and unroyled into Guinea, and by the ruine of all those Tyrants, who had divided his Empire, preserve what appertain'd to him by his right of Conquest. Hee brought with him to Senega (to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) the King of Tombut and Almanzor, but hee gave them new perplexities, in thinking to bring them to their repose: Zelopa was to them an object of horrour and hatred; and though they look'd on her very differingly, yet they found there the same defects and the same crimes. But she who was no lesie bewitch'd by the beauty of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor then Zabaim was by hers, could not suppresse her heat in reseeing him: she wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd him with all such kindnesses as were able to make Zabaim jealous, if his eyes had not been inchanted as well as his other senses; she call'd him her sonne and her defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and her disordinate passion depriving her of reason, she fell about his neck; What (said she) can I neither give nor refuse this brave Warriour, by whose valour I enjoy my Crowne, enjoy Zabaim, and enjoy my selfe? Almanzor not being able to indure those derestable pratings, wrested himselfe by force out of her armes; and to make her asham'd, Remember (said he in leaving her) I am not Zabaim: Thou art not indeed, said she with a languishing voyce, but thou art somewhat more. Zabaim heedlesly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed all that remain'd to ruine his wife utterly, and recounting Almanzor's glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, threw sulphure and oyle on the fire of that enraged woman: at the sole name of Almanzor, she was taken with tremblings and shiverings; she sigh'd while Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim prais'd him, she held her eyes fix'd on him, and from time to time speaking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably: O my onely deliverer! cry'd she, finish thy worke, and leave not thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry imperfect; thou hast saved my Lord the King, thou hast restor'd to us a part of our Empire; Goe, and by the ordinary miracles of thy good fortune, ruinate those Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors which are revolted from us. Those words as artificiall as the braine from whence they came, were expounded one way by Zabaim and another by Almanzor; hee grew almost desperate at Zelopa's folly, and to free him from it, intended to abandon Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga; but as he was at the point of parting, divers considerations and some secret power staid him whether he would or no, and upbraided him of cowardize to fly before a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; neverthelesse he was forc'd to take that resolution, and overcomming all those obstacles which oppos'd his departure, he avoyded the precipice whereunto Zelopa's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry had infallibly drawne him. One day meeting him in the great garden of Senega; In humane (said she) which deniest life to thine enemy which begs it of thee, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riest in the destruction of a wretch which implores thee; know that I am in possession of that Empire thou disputest with me, and Kings have not usually resisted my charms. Aske the people of Guinea; consult with those of Melly and Senega, they will tell thee, their Princes have been my slaves, and that the Crownes and Lives of Monarchs depend more servilly on the power of my charmes then on that of Fortune; yet thou flyest me, thou scorn'st me, and (may be) adding indiscretion to insensibility, thou accusest me to Zabaim. Ah cruell Perseus! neglect not thy destiny, make not thy selfe miserable in contemning thy good fortune, and drive not to despaire a creature that sues to thee for pity; I yet beseech thee Perseus, hearken to my supplications, let me adore thee, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the offering of my selfe which I make thee; the gods whom thou so much fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and so often namest, have they taught thee to neglect all vowes and sacrifices? looke they of what value the Present is which is offered, and are they not contented with the zeale and heart of their Adorers? Why then dost thou then despise mine?
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54727:176"/>
What! insensible man, thou dost not answer me, but deafe as well as blinde, participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in nature with those trees which environ thee: but what said I? No, thou too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently makest knowne to me thy cruell intention, I lose my words and time (thou sayest) and thy hatred increasing proportionably with my love, the more I persevere in beseeching thee, the more obstinate art thou in denying me; would to that Spirit which torments me that one day our Destiny might be altered: or at least that my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience might be turn'd into fury! I should then avenge me of thy cruelties, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thee to my contemned flames, I would have him for my Sacrifice whom I could not have for mine Idoll. Zelopa thus ending her speech dissolv'd into teares, and went from Almanzor as from an enemy, with whom we are yet loath to breake. The young Prince being not a little mov'd by these shamefull solicitations, call'd to him that high vertue which was so deeply rooted in his heart, and consulting with her on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, confess'd he should make him selfe guilty of Zelopa's crimes, if by his absence hee stopped not the course of them: he therefore without taking leave of Zabaim or the King of Tombut, (and heaven which alwayes tends meanes for the execution of good resolutions) was pleas'd he should finde in the mouth of the River of Senega, a ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King of Morocco; in it he imbark'd, and learn't from the Captaine, he was sent by the young Prince of Fez to invite the Princes and Knights of Africa to the Turney which he had undertaken for the honour of Alcidiana. Polexander surpris'd with that name, interrupted Almaid, and vexed either for not being at that meeting, or with the boldnesse of the Prince of Fez; Who (said hee) put that fancy into the Moores head? I cannot tell you that, (reply'd Almaid) for I never enquired after it, but I can relate to you all that passed at the Turney: I beseech you (said Polexander) doe so, and let me know what happy Knight 'twas who preserv'd that faire Queenes honour. 'Twas Almanzor (reply'd Almaid) without any intention to be the man, or without ever seeing or desire to see Alcidiana. He overcame not onely all the African Knights, and many dextrous Spaniards who came thither to defend the beauties of their Ladies, but he so roughly handled the proud Prince of Fez, that 'twas his owne fault if after hee had disarm'd him the tother had not beene brought in case to beg his life from Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor. The Turney being ended, all retyred; our Prince who had made a league of friendship with the Prince of Meda, imbark'd in his ship, and steer'd towards Senega: he related to Meda, that Zabaim was in Guinea, striving to regaine by armes what hee had lost by a revolt, and got that Prince to resolve on that voyage; they arriv'd where Zabaim was on the very point he was about to give battle. They did that day incredible things, and Almanzor (according to his happy fare) came to assist the King when hee was like to be slaine: Zabaim got the victory, but he was so wounded as hee was faine to be carried out of the Field. In all likelihood the joy for the victory and the good successe of businesse should have beene excellent balme to have cured that Prince's wounds; but it happen'd that his suffering himselfe to be transported with paine, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and impatiency, they contested with the Physicians and Chirurgions art and the vertue of their remedies: his wounds were invenomed by the troubles of his mind, and grew so worse and worse, that it behoov'd them to carry him farre from the noise of the Army to avoyde a greater mischance: he was brought to the Palace of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Kings of Guinea, which is built at the bottome of the Straights of Camboës, and for feare lest in his absence the Rebells might make head againe, he appointed Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor in his place, and gave him all the Command he had over his Troopes: Almanzor made so good use of his authority, and by the miracles of his valour so much terrified the enemy, that in lesse then six moneths all Guinea was reconquered, and the name of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim more beloved, or at least more feared, then it had been after his first Conquest. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor loaden with palmes and honour, left his Army with the King of Tombut and came to Zabaim; he was almost cured, but his melancholy and griefe were not yet suppressed. Long time he embraced Almanzor, and a hundred times call'd him his Son and Protector; but though in outward shew he witnessed an extreame joy, yet he could not bridle his affliction, nor dissemble the griefe that overcame him: Almanzor tooke notice of it, and being once in private with him, besought to make knowne whence proceeded that anxiety and discontent which he strove to conceale from him; I wish
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54727:177"/>
(answered Zabaim) you had never beene at Morocco; I foresee such misfortunes as I shall be extreame sensible of, and are already so much the more insupportable to mee since all my foresight can afford no remedy: with that he sighed, and the feare of what might betide so vively touched him, that he could not goe on with his discourse. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor who lov'd that Prince no lesse then him of Benin, fell at his feet, and intreated him to discover the cause of his sorrow: But Sir (said hee) doe not beleeve I make this Petition to satisfie my curiosity; No, 'tis to offer you all you can expect from a Sonne; leave not then your making use of my service; dispose of my armes and life, if either the one or the other can any wayes redresse your afflictions; and give mee not cause by your refusall, to beleeve that absence and time have lessened your affection. Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim after long consultation with himselfe, resolv'd to satisfie Almanzor; Know (said he, sighing) 'tis your consideration afflicts me and not mine owne; I feare the danger whereto I my selfe must expose you; not that I doubt your valour, or have lost the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of those brave acts you have lately performed; 'tis my love that cannot suffer you to hazard your life againe; hitherto I have given you over freely to your valour and the darts of my enemies; but doe you know why? 'Twas because my fortune was more deare to me then your preservation: but now, since all my Crownes, nay, not my life is nothing so deare to me compar'd with you, I wish you without cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; I hate warre, I detest all quarrells, and in a word, I feare all occasions wherein honour might ingage you. Almanzor containing himselfe in the modesty of a man who hath no great opinion of himselfe, Sir, (said he to the King) if the love you beare mee disquiet you, I beseech you let the same affection free you of that trouble: I desire to be belov'd of you, but 'tis fit (if you please) that your love be peacefull, that it be just; and that it leave all timidities, frailties and vexations, to the passions of that Sex which is compos'd of nothing but feare, weaknesse, and perturbation it selfe: Tell mee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what I have to doe, and what terrible enemy it is that awakeneth your feare for me. Zabaim beleeving he should wrong Almanzors courage to persevere in his doubt: Know (said he) that Alcidiana's beauty hath gotten you the hatred of the Prince of Fez: he beleeves you pretend to her favour, and since you parted from Morocco, his jealousie hath hurried him through all Africa to finde you; he hath beene at the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he hath run through all the Countries of Tombut, of Meda and Senega; at last, and within these two dayes, he is come hither, with a resolution rather to expect you here yet six moneths, then to lose the occasion of meeting with you; he is very valiant, but he is no lesse proud: The greatnesse of his birth, and the combates hee hath sought, have given him so insolent an opinion of himselfe, as he imagines he is the terrour of all other Princes; I vow to you, that my greatest griefe is not for seeing you engag'd in a combate which questionlesse will be very furious; but I sorrow for your being here, since your friends would have taken your place, and made knowne to your Rival, that there needs not a valour so great as yours to humble his pride. Almanzor concealing from Zabaim the advantage he had had over the Prince of Fez; I am sorry, (said hee) that amorous Prince is become so jealous of a man that intends not to crosse his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not that I am ignorant of the incomparable merit of a Princesse, whose Fame flies through all Lands; I admire her vertues, I finde her worthy the vowes of all hearts which are capable of love, but I am not a man of sufficient merit to pretend to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of serving her. This verity, Sir, is but for our particular satisfaction; if you love me conceale it, for you know well it toucheth my reputation to publish it; let the jealous Abdelmelec therefore doe what he pleaseth, I have neither excuse nor justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him: but repli'd Zabaim, that which most troubles me in this businesse is, that you must necessarily see him, for I cannot in civility chuse but lodge him in the palace, and entertaine him as a Prince my Ally. Almanzor would have rectifi'd some of these sleight difficulties, when Abdelmelec who may be had heard of his arrivall, came to Zabaim: the fire sparkled from his eyes, and witnessing by his gate as well as counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance how farre hee was distracted from himselfe; I understand (said he to the King) that he who boasts he gave me my life, is with you: the impatiency I am in, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine with my sword, that hely'd, would not suffer mee to stay any longer from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of it. Zabaim told him Almanzor was arriv'd, and strove by his speeches
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54727:177"/>
to bridle the mad man; But Abdelmelec letting himselfe loose to his naturall impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and presently knowing his vanquisher came up to him with an insupportable inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and told him (without deigning to looke on him) that hee could not hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so close but he had at last found him out; Zabaim would have answered willingly to those audacious words, but Almanzor approaching Abdelmelec with a temper that witnessed the power of his soule: I am sorry (said he) for putting you to so much pains; had I knowne your minde, you should sooner have had satisfaction. This answer infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly asswaging the Barbarians fury, he changed both his action and voice, and as if hee would have capitulated the businesse by an explanation, instead of coming to handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroaks: No man (said he to Almanzor) shall ever undertake to wrong me, but hee shall repent his undervaluing my courage or my friendship. I have alwayes esteem'd them both, (repli'd Almanzor) but you have not made so long a journey to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with words; I will not therefore goe about to excuse my former actions. Abdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melec seeing himselfe not where he thought, put on againe his haughty lookes, and the former tone of his voice, and eying Almanzor with an insupportable contempt; It seemes (said he) you would prevent the Challenge I come to make you: certainely in that you give me more cause to pity you, then to be offended; Yes Sir, you shall give me other satisfaction then by words, and ere foure and twenty houres be past, I will make you feele that I know how to confound the ridiculous dexterity of breaking a Lance. We shall see what you say, repli'd Almanzor, and I shall be glad to take forth lessons under so excellent a Master; in the meane time, if you please, let's leave this discourse, which cannot but be irksome to Zabaim, and forget our difference till we be in case to decide it. Zabaim who thought it fit not to interrupt them, began to speake when he perceiv'd Almanzor would change discourse; and addressing him to the Prince of Fez: You are very generous (said he) to beare so much love to a personage who glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's to be insensible, and by a title as proud as redoubtfull, calls her selfe the irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable enemy of mankinde. The faire Alcidiana (repli'd Abdelmelec) is just in her mislike with all men; of whom hath she ever heard spoken that hath not deserv'd her contempt or hatred? Certainly, though the publike report, which is alwayes the report of fooles, hath plac'd some even among the gods; yet it is most true, there is none that is worthy of Alcidiana. Such a one hath the repute of valiant, who may be daily accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himselfe for the contrary, and that 'tis but artificiall. Another seemes magnificent, whose conscience upbraides him with many secret basenesses. A third is profuse, and makes shew of extraordinary liberalities, yet a hidden avarice gnaws out his heart: in a word, Men are publike cheaters, and this age in particular brings forth almost no others; and this being true, I leave it to your consideration to thinke, whether Alcidiana be not exceedingly judicious in publishing her hatred to them, and for remaining in a place not to be infected by the arrivall of such monsters. But (said Almanzor to him) if wee are all so imperfect, if wee are all such monsters as Alcidiana cannot abide; can there bee found any man so idle as to thinke himselfe exempted from that generall imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that he alone enjoyes such parts as are not to be found againe in the whole race of men besides? Abdelmelec, who looked not on Almanzor, but asmew with one corner of his eye: 'Tis for your selfe (said he) to resolve the question you make us; I have long since answered to it for as much as concernes me, (repli'd Almanzor) but I would very faine know your opinion, and learne where that Phoenix is, which deserves to be burnt by so faire a Sun. Almanzor could not so well containe himselfe, but that by his action he made knowne that he jeer'd at Abdelmelec's vanity: That Prince, as quicke of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension as full of pride, perceiv'd his pretended Rivall's gybing, and the fire flying into his face, The resolution we have taken (said he) stayes my just anger, and retards the chastisement your indiscretion merits. Goe young man (added he, shaking his head) goe, make ready your armes, and renounce in time the insolence which dazles you; if, with the enjoying of Alcidiana's favour you will not likewise lose so many yeares you have yet to live. Almanzor was no way mov'd with all those indiscreet words, but keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him still in his merry humour; You wish me too much ill (said he to the Prince of Fez) to follow your counsell: therefore, be you not displeased if I give no heed to it, and deferre your imposing such shamefull necessities upon me, till you have overcome
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54727:178"/>
me. Zabaim not being able any longer to endure Abdelmelec's violent passion, broke off their conversation, and excusing himself on his troubles, gave civilly a Congey to the Moorish Prince: Night straight came on, and Almanzor retyr'd betimes, not to be the last in bed. At day-breake he arose, and consecrating his first actions to that Bounty from whence he had his being, strength and courage; prepar'd himselfe to satisfie the jealous Abdelmelec. The time of Combate being come, Zabaim who was ingaged to renounce all his inclinations, to take on him the indifferency of an Arbitrator, came into a place appointed for all Shewes and Exercises. Assoone as he was set, Almanzor appear'd on the one side, and Abdelmelec on the other. They divided the Winde and the Sunne equally betwixt them; and presently the Trumpets signifi'd to them they were at liberty to doe what they would. I will not lose time in relating to you how these Combatants were arm'd, what their Devises were, what their Horses, and how the rest of their equipage: I will onely let you know, Abdelmelec carried on his Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler the picture of Alcidiana, and was so unfortunate, that with the first blow, Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor cut it in two pieces. That stroake was not to be spoken on, but for the extreame griefe Abdelmelec conceiv'd at it, hee accus'd heaven for his ill fortune, and in lieu of complaining for his want of addresse, he accus'd the Sunne of choler and jealousie. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor who accompted for extravagances all the transports which proceeded of Love, laugh'd at his enemy; and to mad him indeed, told him if he could keep the Originall no betterahen he had done the Copy, he thought him one of the miserablest Lovers in the world. The Prince of Fez stung with his losse and the others words, repli'd not; but thrusting his Horse on Almanzor's, made knowne by his valour, that his pride and ambition were not absolutely unjust. The Combate lasted above two houres, without any perceivance to whom the Victory would incline; but a little after, Fortune declar'd her selfe for Almanzor; He pursued his Enemy so hard with blowes, that he fell'd him under his horses feet, and presently alighting from his owne, and offering his Sword to that dejected proud one; 'Tis now (said he) Abdelmelec, that thou must beg thy life of me; and since thou art not in case to instruct me, I will take thy place to tell thee, that thou soyl'st thy vertues with a vice, which is not so much as supportable in the person of those who are continually victorious. Courtesie and humility should be the particular vertues of Kings: Others which are not of so high a birth, may sometimes be proud, but Princes renounce the advantage they have over the rest of men, as often as they are apt to forget themselves. This long oration was not very pleasing to Abdelmelec, for Almanzors Sword was all that while at his throat: nor would he answer a word to it, but shewed by his demeanour, he desir'd rather to dye then to beg his life. Almanzor gave it him, and presenting his hand to help lift him up, Come (said he) let's goe get our selves dress'd, and never afflict your selfe with the successe of your Combate; for I swear to you, Alcidiana hath not brought me in love with her, and I have no intent to crosse your Suite: Abdelmelec hearing Almanzor's declaration, could well have wish'd he had never been jealous of him, but 'twas too late for those thoughts. He was then carried to the Palace and put into the Surgeons hands; Almanzor who had but two sleight hurts, got againe on horse backe, and follow'd with the Acclamations and Praises of all the Court, went to Zabaim, and related to him what had pass'd betwixt Abdelmelec &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The King would see his wounds, and have their first dressing in his presence. For Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec he was sore hurt, but his rage to be twice quell'd by one same man, troubling him more then his wounds, he besought Zabaim to be pleas'd he might retire to Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co: Zabaim told him the danger whereto he exposed himselfe; yet had he rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his life in getting further from Almanzor, then to preserve it by being ingag'd to see him againe. Zabaim did all he could to stay him, but seeing his exceeding resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be gone, would not hinder it, but conducting him to his Ship, left him to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Mahomet. Almanzor in the meane time thought on his cure, and in lesse then fifteene dayes was in case to leave his chamber. The second time he went abroad, as Zabaim and he walked on the Sea shore, they perceiv'd a ship beare right up to them: they had the patience to stay her entrance into the Gulph; and (assoon as she had furl'd her sayles) the curiosity of learning newes wonne them to send for the Captaine of the Ship; who receiving the commandment, sent backe him that brought it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54727:178"/>
he would let Zabaim understand that he had such things to shew him as would be very pleasing to him. The Messenger was no sooner return'd, but the Captain landed, and with him an ancient man clad like the Jewes of Africa, and a woman of more then three sore yeares old, which led in her hand a young mayden of sixteen or seaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares, so amiable, and so richly clad, that the two Princes invited by her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable beauty, stood long time gazing on her. Ah Almanzor: thou hadst not now been the Captaine to a company of theeves, if the power of thy soule had not slackned at sight of that faire Wanderer. Zabaim, after he had long look'd on her, made her come neere, and ask'd the Captaine whence he was, and by what adventure those three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he brought with him were falne into his hands. The Captaine (following the ill custome of those that come from farre) unwilling to let slip the least accident had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne in his voyage, was about to begin a very tedious relation: when Zabaim cutting him off bade him answer succinctly to these two questions. The Captaine, obeying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, told him he was of the Isle of Madera, and had a long time trafiqued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spaine: The last time I was at Lisbon (said he) I had such contrary windes, and the tempest was so furious that I was cast on the coasts of Fez; I staid there some time to trim my ship, and attending a favourable winde, the very day before I set saile, as I walked on the strand, those three persons you see there, came out from under the rocks which were by the Sea side, and shewing their feares by their teares, cast themselves at my feet; this old man imbracing my knees began thus, My Lord (said he) if you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there is in heaven a Divinity which recompenceth pious actions, and watcheth for the preservation of oppressed Innocents, have pity on three miserable creatures, and suffer not this harmlesse Soule (with that he shew'd me this young mayden) to be a prey to those villaines that pursue her. If their cruelty would have beene satiated by our deaths, we had glutted it: but their fury threatens us with a more horrible disaster. They would immolate the honour of this Virgin to the brutishnesse of their Prince, and have us consent to the ruine of that, for whose preservation we would give a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand lives. The good man's speech much mov'd me; I tooke him with his company in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my ship, and weigh'd anchor to returne to Madera; but the winde unwilling to have it so, hath cast me on this Coast; and the old man knowing it, gave thankes to heaven, and besought me to land him with his wife and daughter. I could not deny him so just a request, and therefore bring him with me, taking to witnesse the Justice which reignes in heaven, that I have carefully observ'd the Lawes of Hospitality, and have not fail'd of any duty which the prudent Law of nature wills us to render to one another. This Commander, (that might passe for a miracle amongst Sea-faring men) ask'd those whom he conducted, whether they had any cause to complaine of him: but receiving thankes and blessings from them in lieu of accusations, tooke leave of them and the Princes, and so retir'd into his vessell. Zabaim was ravish'd at the vertue of that Pilot, but he was farre more with the beauty of that visible Angell, who was come from a place so remote to put her selfe under his protection. For Almanzor, he stood as tied by the eyes on the face of the faire stranger, at last hee suddenly came out of his deep and dangerous contemplation; and having heard nothing of what had been said, 'Tis to be confess'd (said he to Zabaim) that she is perfectly faire: but let's know what she is, and whence she comes? For this quarter's houre (repli'd Zabaim) wee have talk'd of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else: No doubt, if you continue as you begin, you will out-goe all those that have been before you. Almanzor blush'd at Zabaim's jeasting, and though it reflected on the pleasure he had taken in beholding the faire stranger, yet he could not refraine from looking on her againe, and to wonder in himselfe at the sweetnesse of her eyes, and the power of her other a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rements. Zabaim interrupted this second contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and said to Almanzor (smiling) that he found it strange, so great a heart which had not yeelded to the absolute power of Alcidiana's marvells, could let it selfe be sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome by a beauty which was not comparable to her. I shall never have that dishonour, (replied Almanzor) for I am not of those imprudent men who leave their hearts in the disposition of their eyes. All faire things please me, but the delight I take in seeing them, carries me not to the desire of enjoying them: with that he broke off, and addressing him to her father whom he could never be weary of seeing: Old man
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54727:179"/>
(said he) tell me of what Country are you, and what sad fortune makes you thus wander through the world, with a personage so unfit to undergoe the discommodities of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell? The good man first set one knee a ground, and afterwards accompanying his voice with an abundance of tears, My Lord (said he) the story of my afflictions which hath its beginning almost with that of my life, askes too long time to recite it you: be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pleas'd that I conceale it; yet I will let you know, that as miserable as you see me, I am descended from a father, who was as much renouned for the brave actions of his life, as for the antiquity of his race. My Countrey neighbours to this, and the horrour of vice hath made me abandon my meanes and unfortunate Countrey both together; and to renounce the favours of a King, whom I was not permitted to contradict, and with whom I could not comply without offending. Zabaim strucken with those words as with a thunder-clap, look'd on the old man, and thought he had othertimes seene him, but with another countenance: yet would he not make it appeare that he knew him. Almanzor, for his part admir'd that young wonder, and for her sake participating in her parents fortunes, be sought Zabaim to have pity on that unfortunate company, and give them a place of retreat worthy his bounty. Zabaim perceiving well that Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor's compassion was mixed with love, would needs give him some triall of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, by the well entertaining of those strangers: Hee was not satisfied with lodging them in the Palace, but he gave them (of his owne choyce) white and blacke Slaves for their service, and commanded them to waite on the young strange Mayden with the same diligence and the same respects they did on the Queene. Whil'st these things were executed, Almanzor thought deeply on the beauty he had seen: his memory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented her to him with incomparable graces, and his judgement (which govern'd now no more with its former liberty) betraid it self, and approv'd of that Prince's errors and agitations. Zabaim who made no shew of knowing his disease, and to intimate he had spoken nought to him but merrily, discoursed with him about the conquering the rest of Guinea, and by the way of his victories to reconduct him even to his fathers Kingdom. Almanzor repli'd to that proposition, but in such a manner as Zabaim tooke notice, that the object of the faire Stranger solely possest all the Princes thoughts. The time for bed separating them, my deare Lord retir'd to his chamber, overjoyed that hee might muse at liberty; and got to bed, that he might not be diverted neither by the lights, nor the presence of his servants. Assoone as he was alone, he thought he breath'd more at his ease then before, and from that first joy insensibly passing to the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the unknowne, he of it fram'd a fancy more alluring and more perfect then the originall; and spent all the night in contemplating the worke of his imagination. At last he grew asham'd of his weaknesse, and Reason re-entring by little and little from whence she had been driven, represented to him the wrong he had already done himselfe, and the misfortunes he was running into: That light possessing so brave a mind, dispersed all darknesse. Almanzor broke his chaines, and gloriously freed himself from the hands of his Conqueror. He acknowledged his error, blush'd at his weaknesse, and filling his memory with those high designes which the charmes of the faire Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had banish'd thence: Is it thus (said he) that thou practisest those lessons which so many excellent men have taught thee? What is become of those profitable documents were read to thee for the guiding of thy life? Hast thou quite forgotten the Counsell which the great Sacrificator Arismestidez gave thee? Almanzor, said he to thee, thou wilt quickly grow to an age wherein thou wilt have no greater enemy to fight withall then thy selfe. The strength of nature, the goodnesse of your temperature, the heat of your bloud, the beauty of your minde, and the presence of delightsome objects, will combine together, to triumph over you, and to make you a slave to your owne infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Meet and oppose this dangerous conspiracy, arme your selfe betimes to resist these potent enemies; fortifie as much as you can possibly that absolute Empire which the superiour part of your soule should have over the rest. But the best advice I can give you, is such a one whereby you will conjecture I contradict my selfe: As often as I have spoke to you of the excellency of the vertues, and particularly, of those proper to men of your condition; I told you, they had honour for their recompence aswell as for their object; and how that honour was not to be acquir'd but in exposing our selves to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54727:179"/>
dangers; that in hazarding our selves in the most perillous enterprises, and in preferring a faire death before a shamefull flight: I now read you the contrary. You must flye Almanzor, yoe must flye, if you will be victorious. You must be extreamely fearefull, if you will come gloriously off this combat; in a word, love is not to be overcome but in avoyding all occasions of incounter. Almanzor stop'd after this speech, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to consider the parts of it was a long time silent. At last, vanquisher of the strangers beauty, and of the passion she had rais'd within him: Let us (said he aloud) follow these wise rudiments. Let us not give place to such enemies, which will leave conquering us assoone as we give over fighting with them: Let us rather fixe on the pleasures of the minde, then the sensualities of the body; and not deferre to breake our bonds, since they are not yet indissoluble. After he had taken that resolution, he bethought on the meanes to put it in execution, and found none better, then to take on him the leading of the Army which Zabaim would send into Guinea; and not see againe that inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting beauty which in so short a time had wrought so great an alteration in him. These high deliberations being confirmed, he slept, as if he would have Love know, he was free from his tyranny; and wakened not till Zabaim made a noyse by coming into his chamber. That King, who thought the Prince extreamely in love, either out of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or otherwise, left his former advisednesse, and began to chide him for it. He told him, he knew his vigilancy too much to accuse him of sloth, yet seeing him so long in bed, he could not but believe so great disquiets had interposed his nights rest. You have better divin'd (answer'd Almanzor) then (may be) you imagin'd. 'Tis true, I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a shrewd conflict this night, but my resistance hath beene such, that I am come off with the victory. That which I have now to say to you, is, that you lose not the faire occasion which the differences betwixt the Usurpers of Guinea offer you; and without ingaing your selfe in this warre, you will doe me the honour to consent that I serve you in this expedition as I have done in others. Zabaim disbeguil'd of that which he believ'd, and may be glad to have Almanzor farre from the faire Stranger, thank'd him for his advice and proffer; and having often embrac'd him, said, he would accompany him in that warre. Almanzor intimated, it was not fit for him to be absent from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nega in a time wherein his ancient enemies might easily revive the rebellion. But on the contrary, that he ought to raise a new Army to stay exotique factions, and in case of necessity to oppose those that would hinder his conquests. Zabaim liking the counsell well, and seeing all things succeed according to his desire, drew his Army out of his garrisons and made Almanzor Generall over it. The Prince being ready to depart, remembred the faire Stranger which he durst not see againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unwilling that ought which he had once lov'd should become indifferent to him, he intreated Zabaim to continue his good treating of the three strangers, and if they desired to returne home, to give them whatsoever should be needfull for their voyage. The King promis'd him to forget nothing of what he owed to his love, and to make it appeare, gave them more attendants. As often as Almanzor sent to heare of them, his Messenger brought him word that the Father and the Mother esteem'd themselves very happy to be falne into so noble hands; but that the Daughter wept in her good fortune as she had done in her ill, that her griefes rather grew then decreas'd, and that neither the company nor consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her Parents could any way asswage her sorrow. Almanzor who may be was not so well cured of his love as he thought himselfe, was mov'd with that Maydens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction; but loath to run the danger of losing himselfe in succouring her; he befought Zabaim by his bounty and visits to charme the griefe of that desolate faire one: with that he tooke leave of the King, and with his most speed got to the Army. He carried himselfe with no lesse courage, and government in that last War, then he had done in the former. He pursu'd the traytors even to the Frontiers of Benin, and having given them battle (as a man might say) in the sight of the courteous Abrinzias, made him a Spectator of a part of his brave actions. In summe, while that King was weeping and grieving for the losse of that deare Son, he understood from the publike voyce, that Almanzor had made himselfe Master of the most Easterne parts of Guinea, and as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to Zabaim, had ruin'd all the petty Usurpers of that great Province: He scarce durst give credit to so good and so strange newes, and was on the point to send men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly

to know the truth, when Hydaspes brother to the hardy Bellerophon, (of whose death I have told you) came to him from Almanzor, and presented to him foure of the six Usurpers of Guinea. Imagine how excessive Abrinzia's joy was, and how many teares these good tydings drew from the eyes of the vertuous Andromeda. But all that joy was nothing comparable with that those two Princes receiv'd when the saw Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor himself arrive at Court triumphant and victorious of a part of the Princes of Africa. The great fame he had gotten by his Combates, and the advantageous alteration which two yeares absence had wrought in his countenance and stature, made him so exquisite in the eyes of Abrinzias &amp; Andromeda, that they almost committed idolatry in taking him for somewhat more then man. The Feast for his returne lasted divers moneths, and was not disturb'd but by a horrible attempt of the Prince of Benin: That insolent and furious brute, jealous of Almanzor's reputation, and enrag'd at the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses he received from the King and Queen, plotted with the counsellors of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary villanies to murther him whom he thought certainly was his brother: The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was in finding the opportunity for the execution; Many wayes were propos'd by Perseus confederates, at last they fixed on one that might doe the feate, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Prince run no danger. 'Twas that that Monster (borne to afflict those who had given him life) lying with Almanzor (as he did often) should stab him whil'st hee slept, and after he had kill'd him, give himselfe some light wound to cover his villany; and make it beleev'd, that those who had murther'd Almanzor had an intent he should run the fame fate too. The time for execution resolv'd on, Perseus redoubled his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to Almanzor, and so behav'd himselfe towards him, as if he meant to yeeld up his birth right, and acknowledge him already for his King. Almanzor, who saw not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus defects, or rather that would not take notice o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The night being come wherein the most abominable act was to be committed that ever frighted nature, those two Princes went to bed together, and assoone as their slaves were gone, Perseus agitated with the rage he nourish'd in his brest, did such actions as might have well made him suspected, if Almanzor had beene capable of it. That innocen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Prince ask'd him the cause of his disquiet, but since he gave no answer, would not presse it further for feare of displeasing him. Straight after he fell asleep, and as if himselfe had conspired with that hangman against his owne life, deliver'd it to his mercy. Though that Monster was full of impatiency and fury, yet he staid till the poor Almanzor was very fast asleep: seizing then his ponyard which he had hid under him, and by the light of a candle, which was not farre from the bed, chusing the place where his stab might be most mortall, lifted up his arme to accomplish his damnable designe. Ah, wretch, cry'd Polexander, (interrupting Almaid) stay thy fury and thine arme. He neither held one nor other, (coldly repli'd Almaid) but just Heaven who had before preserv'd Almanzor in so dangerous occasions, would not have him meet his death in so sound and assured a repose. It fill'd the soule of Perseus with a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick terrour: it troubled his eyes, and making his hand to shake, so happily diverted the blow, that the ponyard in lieu of being stab'd into the body, was strucke into the arme of my deare master. The Angell who had the guard of so faire a life, made him feele the stab before he had it: A certaine trembling seiz'd on him and awak'd him, so that he saw himselfe ready to be strucken, but being but halfe awake, could not stay Perseus his hand. Assoone as he felt the stab, he threw himselfe on the Murderer: Sir (said he) with that generous mildnesse wherewith he was wont to qualifie his fiercest enemies, what cause have I given you to treat me thus? Have my enemies prevailed more on your inclination then my affection and service could ever obtaine from it? Come home to your selfe I beseech you; thinke to what others passions have carried you, and assure your selfe, I will forget the blow you have now given me, if you will promise to drowne in oblivion the causes why you cannot love me. The to be abhor'd Perseus, in lieu of being mov'd by those generous words, did his utmost to get free from Almanzors hands, and may be too, to perfect the murther he had begun. But our Prince, (wounded as he was) got him under, and that could not be done without waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his slaves, who ran in at the noyse. My masters (said Almanzor) come help me; the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54727:180"/>
Prince agitated by some strange malady hath lost all knowledge and understanding, and questionlesse mistaking me for his enemy, hath (with a ponyard stab'd me into the arme. All the slaves ran to him, with so deare an affection, that they had torne Perseus in a thousand pieces had they knowne what had pass'd: howsoever, they rudely enough drew him out of the bed, and one of them, who naturally hated that barbarous Prince, cri'd to his companions, 'twas best to binde him since he was distracted. Almanzor chid him very much for losing his respect, and commanded he should no more come neer to Perseus. Six others, who had no mind he should get away, kept him, whil'st two of their companions who were Surgeons stop'd Almanzor's wound. Assoone as he was drest, he labour'd much with Perseus to win him from his sury, but perceiving all his perswasions were lost, he turn'd him to his Slaves, and forbad them on paine of death from ever speaking of that adventure. Whereupon, Perseus with as much rudenesse as pride, call'd to be no further detain'd from his owne lodgings, for (said he) I will not be any longer amongst mine enemies. Almanzor presently commanded those that had him in guard to conduct him to his chamber, and intreated (in parting) that he would beleeve he should never have any more affectionate servant then himselfe. The next day he came abroad, and liv'd in such manner with Perseus, that Abrinzias and Androme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da knew not the base act of their Sonne in above six moneths after. Now a while after Almanzor was cured of that secret wound, Abrinzias contemplating him as the man by whose vertue his Sonne and Estate might be much advantaged, resolv'd to offer him part of his Crowne to oblige him to the preservation of all. One day therefore being retyr'd with Almanzor and his Queen, My Son (said he) tell us what is your int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Almanzor answering as he ought, and Abrinzias judging by his reply, that he surely thought him to be his Father: I will use you (said he) not as the younger brother of Perseus, but as his elder, his Master and Defender. Know therefore that after mature deliberation on the proposition I am to make you, and with Andromeda's advise, I am resolv'd to divide my Estate betwixt you and Perseus. Heaven can witnesse if I have not wish'd (onely for your sake) that my Kingdome were as great as all the Empire of Ethiopia, or that of the Ottomans: But when I consider that the greatnesse of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is not alwayes a testimony of the greatest affection, I feare not to offer you a part of the Kingdome of Benin, since by that donation my Self and Andromeda transact to you, and waive all that is in our power, and by consequence give you asmuch, as if we had set on your head all the Crownes of the world; looke on our hearts, not our Present, and remember that he is not the greatest Monarch who hath most land, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number of people under his subjection; but he that knowes best how to suppresse those disordinate desires which ambition breathes into him. Abrinzias stopping a little to take breath, Almanzor or would have answered and gotten out of the trouble where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the Kings proposition had throwne him; but Abrinzias staid him, and be sought he would heare a second which he had to make him. Know (said he) that Andromeda and my selfe are not satisfied with chusing you for our Successour, but we have thought on the finding you a wife, and by some alliance worthy your selfe, establish your Throne, extend the Limits of your Government, and purchase you a repose no lesse innocent then delightfull. We have cast our thoughts on all the Princesses both of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica and Asia, but after our long consideration we finde none to be compar'd with the Princesse of Congo. 'Tis true she is yet but young, but what can there be said which is spoken of her vertue, her wit, and her beauty? It may be, you may imagine I offer you a treasure which is not in my power; and that Princesse (as young as she is) being fought to by the greatest Princes of Africa, there is no likelihood she would bestow her selfe on a petty King of Benin. We confesse there were some deniall to be fear'd if Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor had no other quality then what we give him; but you must understand, that her Nation, (who within these three yeares have given you the title of Africa's Deliverer) and the Princes of her bloud, equally wish you for their Master. See what Andromeda and I have been meditating for the comfort of our age, and not to leave poore Perseus to the mercy of the greatest enemy he can ever have, to wit, to his owne discretion,

Almanzor taking his breath againe (at the end of the Kings Speech) as if he had got out of somewhat that troubled him, fell at Abrinzia's feet, and intimating his inward sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; Is it possible (said he) that some words or actions of mine, have made you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that you could not surmount my ingratitude, satisfie my ambition, nor stay me longer in your service, at a lesse rate then by setting your Crowne on my head? If it be so, I deserve to be look'd on by you, as one of those abominable children, by whom the wrath of heaven chastiseth the pride of such Families as are blinded with the height of their good fortune. But, not desirous to appeare better then I am, suffer me to let you know, that I feele not my selfe guilty of so black a crime, and the more I examine my conscience, the more it assures me, that I never aspir'd to your Crowne: whence is it then you make to me (pardon me if I say) so unjust propositions? For it seemes, you offer me your Crowne but to bridle and chaine in my fury, and so take away the cause of my attempting against your life. That which I owe you, the care you have taken for my breeding, and the love you have alway shown me, are such strong bonds, that they are capable to regulate a nature more ingratefull and ambitious then mine. If you please Sir to honour me with your love, cast that designe from your fancy, or permit me to punish my selfe for being the cause of it, and avenge you of a monster that could not glut his appetite, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Abrinzias and Andromeda hearing how Almanzor interpreted their thoughts, or rather admiring his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue; imbrac'd him one after another, and told him, that the knowledge they had of his good nature, and not the feare either of losing or ill treatment from him, had made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These words were follow'd by many others, but I omit them as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He forsooke the Court and all company, and spent whole dayes, either i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This strange kind of life made the King and Queene of Benin feare some new disaster; and their affection perswaded them that his pensivenesse presaged some dangerous sicknesse. Hydaspes, who almost never forsooke the Prince, was the first that tooke notice of his alteration; he did what he could to divert him, but perceiving ordinary remedies were not power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough to extirpate so extraordinary a distemper, he had recourse to more violent. Finding therefore one day Almanzor weeping; With what Justice (said he to him) dares a Prince so wise in couns<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What will not your enemies say, Almanzor, if your discontent comek to their eares? Will they not have cause to make the world beleeve, that you see with griefe the age of the King your Father, that you meditate some plot against Perseus, and in briefe, that you are tortur'd either by some crimes you have committed, or by those you have a desire to perpetrate? Almanzor was very sensible of those last words, and imagining that some other might have Hydaspes thoughts, intended to overcome his melancholy, and to seeke in the toyles of war that quiet which he could not meet withall among the delights of peace.

He conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in that irksome Melancholy of which I have spoken, and as if his ill Genius had in spight of himselfe thrust him on the precipice where he was to be ruin'd, he went every morning out of the Palace to passe the most part of the day on the point of a rocke, where he had for his prospect but an open desert of waters as vaste as his thoughts. Hydaspes, almost daily waited on him thither; and knowing his Masters malady was a disease which came further then from the in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of bloud or of other humours, strove to sweeten the bitternesses of that Prince, and to prepare him for those accidents wherewith he was threatned by that supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sicknesse. One day as they were together on the top of their rocke, and had their eyes fix'd on the Coasts of Guinea, they saw a far off a ship which with a favourable wind came with full sailes, sailing from the West, Eastward. They thought her at first to be a Portugall. Almanzor, whom I may call the best Master of the world, at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant thought on me, and that remembrance drawing him from his melancholy; It may possibly be Almaid, said he to Hydaspes, who after his long captivity hath found a meanes to returne to us. Let us goe downe and see whether my conjecture be true or no; with that he arose, and shewing a joy beyond appearance, Surely, said he to Hyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spes, this Vessell comes to us and brings great cause of comfort. Alas! how was that poore Prince deceiv'd, if not in all, at least in the principall part of his hopes! For my selfe, his expectation was not frustrated, for I was in the ship which he looked on with so much joy: but traytor and unfortunate that I am, I brought with me bolts and chains under whose weight the courage of that Prince was to lie fainting. I will no longer hold from you the successe of that adventure: I came and cast anchor where Almanzor was, and making my excesse of joy and actions of thankes, to which the happy successe of my voyage obliged me, to resound againe by many Cannon shot, I lanch'd a Shalop, and first, went downe into her, that none before me might kisse that Land which was as deare to me as my native soyle. No sooner had I set foot on shore, but Almanzor came to me, presently knew me, cast himselfe on my necke, and weeping for joy, My Father! (said he) and have I then recovered you againe after so long time of your losse? and hath that misericordious Goodnesse from whom I have so often petition'd you, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me even that for which I durst not supplicate? You may well beleeve without my telling you, that my joy was not lesse great then my Masters, and that so happy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop'd for a meeting extreamly surpris'd me: I cast me at his feet; I had heard in Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga of all his brave acts; I made appeare to him the share I tooke in his honour, and without discovering to him the secret he yet knew not, I did so extoll the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits hee had performed for Zabaim, that hee broke off my speech, and forced me to make knowne to him by what miracle I got from the Portugals hands. I related to him what had betided me in my prison, and the excessive goodnesse of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54727:182"/>
King of Portugall in giving me my liberty. But my Lord (said I) I have stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger adventures to acquaint you withall, and it behooves you, (if you please) to give eare to them, for you have therein a very great share: besides, it is requir'd from your generousnesse, not to leave a worke imperfect, which will acquire you no lesse honour, then those wonderfull acts, by which you have resetled on the head of Zabaim those Crownes which his crimes had worthily pluck'd thence. Almanzor shewing a great desire to know those adventures; My father (said he) we cannot have a more fit time then this: begin then, and assure your selfe we will give you a very respectfull audience. I began againe to speake, thinking to do cleane contrary to what I did, and addressing me to the Prince; At my returning (said I) from Portugall I put in at Cape-utred, chiefly to heare how matters went with Zabaim. All the people of that country had no other name in their mouthes but the name of Perseus Prince of Benin. His combats and his victories was all their talke: They call'd him the Father of the Countrey, the Defender of Zabaim; and they durst speake openly, That the Justice of Heaven had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it selfe in imploying so powerfull an arme for the protection of Zelopa's wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. At first, these newes made me much amazed, but after I had well thought on it, I imagined that the true Perseus could not worke so many wonders, and that infallibly you had borrowed the Name of your brother to make him the more famous by your victories. I went up as farre as to the great Port of Senega, to inquire further and cleare all doubts, and lodg'd my selfe with a rich Shepheard, who imploying his goods with a great deale of charity, is the father of all the poore, and the hoste of all strangers. Hee welcomed me with his accustomed courtesie, and though I was so exceedingly changed that it was impossible to know me; yet I beleev'd by his excessive kindnesses, that hee put me in another rank then the rest of those strangers that were in his house. I had a great deale of conversing with him, and by the description he made me of Perseus, I knew it was Almanzor. This first doubt taken away, I desired to be satisfied of others, and was so fully, that there hath scarce happened any thing either in the Wars or in Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baims Court, of which I had not a particular information. After I had been two dayes with that able and generous Pastour, seeing the time fit to prosecute my voyage, I went to take my leave of him; when an aged man (accompanied with a woman almost of his age, and a virgin whose incomparable beauty could not be hidden by the vaile which cover'd her) came, and cast himselfe at my hostes feet; and moistning with his teares the white locks which hung along his cheekes and downe on his shoulders: Charitable Servonitez (said he to him) deny not to three miserable wretches whom you see before you, the assistance you give to all that are afflicted, and give way (if you please) that they may retire into a place, where Innocence unjustly persecuted hath alwayes found her safety. We are no Criminalls though we fly the world and the day, and seeke not a Sanctuary, but to defend us from Injustice and violence. Mine hoste raising the old man and his company, you are welcome, said he, and assure your selves your preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation shall be as deare to me as that of mine owne Sonne. But if you thinke it fitting, tell me who are they that would injure you, because you may have such enemies, as the safety of my house (which hath never yet beene violated) will not warrant you from their outrage? The old man coming close to Servonitez, We would (said he in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eare) try to save this innocent Creature, (shewing him his daughter) from the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Zabaim, and the fury of Zelopa. How! my friends (cry'd Servonitez) you are all lost; and yet you are not, (said he presently) for lo a stranger (speaking of me) who will deliver you from the persecution of those two enemies. He is ready to hoise sail, and I see no other way of safety for you, but to abandon with him this unfortunate Land. But (repli'd the old man) what assurance have we not to meet, with him, that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which alike prosecutes us by Sea and Land? His goodnesse secures you, answered the old man. Goe therefore, and doubt not, but that Providence which visibly pluckes you out of the danger which you know of, will also deliver you from those which are yet conceal'd from you. The old man hereupon turning towards me, My Lord, said he, your countenance and Servonitez free me of all that feare my daughter throwes on me: I beseech you then to take us into your protection, and make knowne to us whither you are bound. Time (I repli'd) better then Servonitez shall tell you what I am, in the

meane while, quiet your thoughts and live at rest, without fearing from me any ill that may betide your selfe or your daughter. If you have an intent to rerire into some certaine place, let me know it, and I promise to conduct you thither. But if all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries be indifferent to you, I will bring you to the King of Benin's Court, which is the retreat of vertue, and the Sanctuary of all such as are persecuted by fortune. I had no sooner spoken those words, but the old man fell againe on his knees: Eternall Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (cry'd he) I can now say my prayers are heard. Thou miraculously pluck'st mee out of the hands of blinded Zabaim; thou bringest to nought the tragicall plots of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopa, and bringing me againe to the generous Perseus, seemest to promise these two innocent and weake creatures, that peace and safety which all things else deny them. Almanzor (interrupting me) ask'd, with a trembling voyce, where those poore people were? They are in my ship, said I, and as I would have gone on with my discourse: No, no, Father, said Almanzor, I know all I desire to know. Come let's goe see those Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and not give them cause to retract that good opinion they have of Perseus. With that he entred my Shallop, and Hydaspes and my selfe following him, he commanded the Mariners to row backe to the ship. Assoone as he came to her he went aboard, and presently met with the old man I told him of. They straight knew one another, and the Prince having imbrac'd him; My father (said he) you are in place where all honest people are in safety. Abrinzias will give you, what Zabaim hath deny'd you. I feare no more, fortune, nor Zabaim, repli'd the old man, your presence makes me contemne them both, and my company as weake and timerous as they are, shall no sooner know they are in your protection, but they will instantly defie all their enemies. On the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Almanzor changing his countenance and voyce, Almaid (said he) with a looke a little troubled, present this very day, this good old man and his company to Abrinzias, and do you your self take care for what they shall want. After that, he turn'd to the old man, and imbracing him againe, Excuse me (said he) if I leave you, I have some affaires which permit me not to be longer with you; and ending his farewell he took Hydaspes with him, as if he had been in great haste, entred into the shalop, and caus'd them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>et him on shore. He walk'd above a hundred paces without speaking a word; and Hydas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes hath told me, that the Prince sigh'd often in his walke, and stopping every foot, made knowne by his agitations that he was not at peace with himselfe. At last he turn'd to Hydaspes and commanded him to returne to my ship, and to conduct the strangers to his Summer lodgings. Hydaspes was much surpris'd at this command, but he was farre more, when arriving foure or five houres after, at the place which Almanzor appointed, he found it richly dight with all the goodly furniture of the Crowne. Divers slaves, black and white, presently came in, who well instructed in what they had to doe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd bathes for the old mans wife and daughter. Hydaspes, who had beene that faire maidens guide, had seen her heard her speake, and consequently admir'd her; return'd to his Master with a resolution to upbraid him for his neglecting so faire a creature, and to beget in him a desire to see her. Assoone as he found him, My Lord (said he) the strangers are where you appointed to lodge them; but,—in sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aking that word he smil'd, and went not on. Almanzor looking on him very seriously, What would you say with your But, repli'd he? My Lord (quoth Hydaspes) I will tell you, since I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to speake, you have perform'd but halfe the honours of your house, if your self vouchsafe not to visit your guests. In good earnest Hydaspes (said the Prince) tell me, which think'st thou is the fairest, the Mother or the Daughter? This question (repli'd Hydaspes) no more makes me wonder then I did at your neglecting them both. Thou think'st me then (said the Prince presently) either very rude or very insensible: you shall never suffer for the first defect, (answered Hydaspes) but for the other, pardon me if I say to you, that neither your selfe with all your Eloquence, nor your learned Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistidez with all his reasons &amp; subtleties shall never be able to justifie you. But, without faining Hydaspes, (continued the Prince) Is that young beauty, which questionlesse hath stung thee, so amiably alluring as thou striv'st by thy reproaches to perswade me? I would pardon you that question (repli'd Hydaspes seriously) if you had never seen this wonder, but having view'd her more then once, I must needs call you, the most unjust and most insensible of all men. Worke it so (if it be possible) that your imagination
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54727:183"/>
may represent her to you such as she was when she arriv'd in Guinea; adde to the extream sweetnes which dwelt on her face, the Majesty of Andromeda, &amp; you shall have a picture of what she is now. Ah! well (said Almanzor) since thou takest so great pleasure in her sight, returne where she is, and tell her in my Name all that which thy civility and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction shall advise thee. Assure her and her Parents too of the contentment I receive by their arrivall, and obtaine for me the permission of visiting them. Hydaspes ran present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Osmin's chamber (so was the old man called) and beginning Almanzor's comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with him, ended them with his daughter; but with so many offers of service, so many testimonies of affection, and so many faire words, that it seem'd Hydaspes spoke not in the name of his Master, but to have the more liberty to discover his owne thoughts. Axiamira (so was the faire strangers name) and Osmin answered as they ought to so many civilities, and calling Almanzor their Lord and Hope, assured Hyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spes they would alwayes conforme themselves to all things which should be pleasing to the Prince. I ratifie (said Axiamira) all that Osmin makes me say, since the knowledge I have of Almanzors noblenesse perswades me he hath no other desires but such as are regulated by vertue it selfe. Hydaspes, ravish'd by the wit aswell as the beauty of Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira, came backe to his Master, but he durst not tell him what he had done by reason of Abrinzias who was with him. Assoone as the King was gone, and had taken with him many troublesome ones that follow'd him; Almanzor entred into his privy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and putting forth his slaves, there was alone with me: Well Hydaspes (said he) hast thou seen Osmin? hast thou spoke with his daughter? may I goe see them? My Lord, answered Hydaspes, I begin to recant the opinion I had of you: your countenance, your action, your words assure me you are not so insensible as I thought you. Surely, you are more discreet then neglectfull, and if I have any insight in the agitations of an amorous soule, I perceive by yours, that you are not without passion. At that word Almanzor interrupting Hydaspes, Give over this talke (said he) if thou art not of combination with so many secret and powerfull Enemies as I have resisted since my Guinea voyage. Why, hast thou not taken notice, Hydaspes, of the violencies I have us'd to my selfe, of the paines I have indur'd, and the conflicts I undergoe daily, to gaine a victory which thy discourse hath depriv'd me of; and to preserve the quality of Insensible, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thou lately upbraidedst me? Yes, deare Hydaspes, I strive to be insensible, I doe my utmost to acquire a true Indifferency, but I undertake all these combats in vaine, and to no purpose all these resistings. I must (Hydaspes) I must give way, and no more stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly resist the power of my Destinie. These words teaching Hydaspes to read his Masters thoughts; he repented his high extolling of Axiamira to him, and wish'd hee could wipe off these praises he had given her. But that artifice seeming too grosse to him, he thought he must make use of another: He therefore told Almanzor, that indeed he had not seen any fairer then Osmin's daughter, but for all her charming beauties, shee was not a subject sufficient for him to fix on. What (said he) will be said by so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages, in whose breasts you ought to preserve the honour and fame you have gotten, if for I know not what beauty you renounce the alliance of so many Kings which sue to you? and forgetting your condition and hopes, suffer your selfe to be captivated by the allurements of a Wanderer, who (may be) strayes from Kingdome to Kingdome to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish her a fortune by the sale of her beautie? Almanzor, in lieu of growing in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at a discourse which had offended him, abode in a patience not imaginable, but his griefe for Hydaspes libertie being stronger then his constancie; he was forc'd to carry his handkerchiefe to his eyes lest the other should see his teares. Presently after hee look'd on him, and accusing himselfe for Hydaspes fault: 'Tis I (said he) who am guilty of those blasphemies which you have vomited against Axiamira's vertue. Yes Hydaspes, I will punish my selfe for the crime you have committed through your too much love to me. I know your thoughts contradict your words, and in the very instant that your mouth wronged innocent Axiamira, your heart derogating from your tongue, ask'd her pardon for it. See Hydaspes what 'tis to contend with a knowne truth: in lieu of being beleev'd, you become suspected, and by that unhappy cunning affirme even that which you had an intent to ruinate. Imagine, noble Sir, to what a necessity Hydaspes saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe brought, by the strange interpretation Almanzor gave his words. He stood a while
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54727:183"/>
without the power of answering him; but when he perceiv'd effectually that Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor grew afflicted as if he had been guiltie; he cast himselfe at his feet, and besought him to call to minde, who hee was, and what he ought to so many people who expected their preservation, their felicitie and example from him. These considerations were not prevalent to bring him to himself: He continually sigh'd, and looking on Hydaspe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, with eyes bath'd in teares: Criminall that I am! (said he) 'tis I, 'tis I that have compell'd thee so unworthily to wrong the most transcendent vertue of the world. Hydaspes, who one way or other would draw him out of that agonie, perceiving that the thought of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and of Abrinzias were too weake to move him: At least (said he) reflect on Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira; and since you love her, witnesse to her your affection by other proofes then by sorrowings and unprofitable lamentings. Admire if you please the efficacy of a passion which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after it hath been long time contested with, yet at last gets the victorie; and to avenge it selfe of so long a resistance, insolently makes use of its victorie. At the onely name of Axiamira, Almanzor came out of his perturbation, and remembring no more his first resolution, shew'd an extreame impatiencie for not seeing that beautie, which longing was no lesse extraordinary, then his constraints had beene thitherto to keep himselfe from seeing her. Presently he sent backe Hydaspes to advertise Osmin he was coming to see him: thither he went, and had scarce delivered his Message when he saw his Master. Osmin and his wife went to meet him, and casting themselvrs both at his feet, rendered him thankes for his incomparable favours. He tooke them up, and treating them with as much respect as he would have done Abrinzias and Andromeda, assured them that thence-forward they foure would but have one fortune. Axiamira was behinde her mother, Almanzor came and saluted her. She was nothing mov'd by seeing her selfe so kindly treated by so great a Prince, but continuing in her former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differencie, and neither making shew of pride nor basenesse, she gracefully receiv'd Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzors complements. The Prince strove to say somewhat to her, but he made known by his discourse that his minde was disordered. Yet I think Axiamira tooke no notice of it, for she being alwayes recollected to her selfe, had no attention to what outwardly happened. Yet did she at that time more then was accustomed to doe: Shee lifted her eyes a little to looke on Almanzor, and presently casting them down againe; You (said she) looke on a creature who for two yeares hath been exposed to all the outrages and violence of fortune. Hitherto her malice cannot be satiated. I know not whether your prowesse which hath quell'd so many enemies will be able to overcome her. I wish for your honour and my peace, you may have the victorie, for I shall be glad to adde this new and supreame obligation to those I owe you already. After she had thus spoke she was silent, and Almanzor then beginning, let her know he was not in case to vanquish, but came himselfe to implore her aid against afar more redoubtfull Enemie then fortune. Osmin, his wife and Hydaspes, drew neere to Almanzor and Axiamira, and intermedling with their conversation, tooke them both off from the worst straite, they ever met withall. Almanzor could have wish'd his interparlance endlesse, but his discretion being at that time more powerfull then his love, he retir'd in good time, and left (as I understood since) Osmin and his familie, exceedingly satisfied. Assoone as hee was in his chamber he thought on Axiamira's speech, and after he had intertained Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daspes with all that, which he found admirable aswell in the actions as words of that beautie: Assure thy selfe (said he) Axiamira is not Osmins daughter. Hydaspes, who had ever been of that opinion, confirm'd i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in him; and told him, that infallibly she was some personage of high extraction, who for some important considerations had beene intrusted to the wisdome of those two good people. From that imagination they passed to others; and Hydaspes continuing in the tearmes of complay sancie and approbation, left Almanzor in the libertie of extolling as much as he would Axiamira's perfections; and to extend and dilate himselfe into such praises, as any other but himselfe would have thought too excessive, or at least very tedious. The Prince gave him leave to retire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his love had exhausted his Eloquence. To bed he got him, not to sleepe, but to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate-at pleasure, and by that meditation to forme to himselfe new Idea's, and finde new wayes to expresse his passion. The next day, in all appearance, he was the same man he had been before times, but indeed 'twas another personage: no more that Almanzor
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54727:184"/>
whose soule knew no other passion then the desire of honour, who had his element in the most difficult enterprises, and who so highly proclaim'd, that it was more shamefull for men to make love, then for women to go to warfare. He was no more that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor who had wholly dedicated himselfe to the practise of the most austere vertues. He had transmigrated into another nature, and esteem'd not the greatnesse of courage, perillous adventures, and the acquisition of fame but as they were subjected to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of Love. When I came into his chamber, I found him in his amorous meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He had sent for me by Hydaspes, to the end to make knowne his passion to me, and give me thanks for the service I had done him. Imagine whether his discourse amaz'd me. It was yet lesse then it had done, if Hydaspes had not discover'd to me all that was pass'd since my returne. I strove to restraine by some considerations the overflowing of that passion: but Almanzor cutting me short; Do not (said he) imitate Hydaspes, and speake against your owne thoughts, through a desire to hinder a matter already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd on. Your Son (Almaid) must love; he must; heaven will absolutely have it so, and that love Axiamira. But (said he) how unfortunate am I, in that I must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my life to others then my selfe! I am overtyr'd with visits and businesse; and, for a little vanity which the power of Commanding gives me, I must deprive my selfe of my contentment, yeeld my selfe a slave to other mens passions, and for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of all misery, have all my labours and industry rewarded with perfidy and ingratitude. They are not suspitions and doubts which make me speake thus: No, they are truths, Almaid; and such truths as you have unwittingly told me. Ah! ingratefull Zabaim, King! incident to all crimes! must thou needs (after so many services which I will not remember) be the author of my just complaints, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a yet more just indignation? But (he went on, addressing him to me) to the end we may proportion the punishment with the fault, bring me hither Osmin. I will from his mouth understand the wrongs Zabaim hath done him. I very attentively gave eare to all these words, and knowing they proceeded from an extreame affection and hatred; I fear'd, lest the power of love might be able to violate that of nature, and winne Almanzor to breake with Zabaim. These feares made me oppose against the complaints of my deare Master all that I thought availeable to get him from that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion he had of Zabaim. I therefore besought him to do nothing hastily, nor upon the relation of parties interessed, dissolve an amity which seem'd to be immortall. I know (said he) what I owe to Zabaims favour. He knows too how I have serv'd him. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he hath sayl'd of his word, and endeavour'd to rob me of the treasure wherewith I intrusted him. Judge to what a resentment so great a contempt and so base a treason obligeth me. Yet I will not doe what love adviseth me. It shall never be reproach'd me, that I neither know how to make or preserve friendship: If Zabaim have injur'd me, his fault shall not make me commit another; but it shall teach me how to demeane my selfe with him, that so hereafter I may cut off all causes of sayling in our amity. Go then Almaid, fetch me Osmin, and let us see how farre Zabaim is guilty. Presently I went and brought Osmin to Almanzors chamber. The presence of that old man extreamely comforted the Prince, and made him seeme farre lesse unquiet then he was before. He spake to him with a very temperate spirit, and intreated him to relate all his fortunes: but before you begin (said he) you must satisfie me in one thing which troubles me, and make knowne how Zabaim hath treated you since my absence. I know you had rather lose your life then preserve it by an untruth. Therefore I intreat you not to forget the injuries Zabaim hath done you, no nor so much as to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend the resentment of them; to the end that without preoccupation you may make me a plaine and true recit all of what hath befalne you in Guinea. Begin then, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering that Zabaim is my friend, tell me the truth purely. Osmin, whom I have alwayes knowne most sincere, taking heaven to witnesse what he was to speake; Two dayes (said he to Almanzor) after your departure, Zabaim took the paines to come to my lodging, where he staid a while with Axiamira, but seeing her in a silence and sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse not to be surmounted, he left her; and taking me by the hand, Father (said he) let us leave this faire maiden to her selfe. I follow'd him; and when he was come to the Sea side, he made me a long Speech of the obligations in which he was ingag'd to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54727:184"/>
you, and repeated all the requests you had made him in behalfe of my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and my selfe. Hee added, that for your sake and particularly for mine, hee would alwayes respect mee as his owne Father, and that hence forward hee would put no difference betwixt his wife and my daughter. I rendred thankes for his proffers, and telling him they were too advantagious for a stranger like my selfe, and a poore maiden as mine was; I humbly besought him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract all his liberalities into one; which was, to give me the meanes by which I might returne into mine owne Countrey. Father (repli'd the King) I am ready to grant what you have desired, but I must not for the infinite love I beare you, become mine owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie; and in preferring your content before mine owne, leave an ill opinion of my selfe in those who looke not on the actions of Kings, but to finde fault with them: yet let us passe by the conceptions of the multitude which commonly are most unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and fasten on that of Almanzor; Will not he have cause to beleeve that I have abus'd you, when he shall understand that contrary to what we had agreed together, you have staid so short time with me? Stay therefore here yet a few dayes, and have patience till I can send him your resolution: You are too generous and too good, (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd) and if the love you beare were not founded on the worthiest cause in the world, I could not but still thinke on the excesse of your courtesies. But Sir, as I imagine, your Majestie needs not use so much circumspection in so inconsiderable a businesse: We are three poor Wanderers that have no name but by our miseries; and who cannot receive the least favour, but we must acknowledge it to be beyond our expectations. Suffer us then to accomplish the course of our calamities, and let not your goodnesse be so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it is, of those outrages, which Fortune is not yet wearie of making us undergoe. I made this long speech to Zabaim, to the end, that mov'd with compassion, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by my reasons, he might give way to our departure. I cannot tell you whence those impatiencies of parting (which I discovered) proceeded: but I confesse to you they were very extreame, and yet my wife's and Axiamira's were greater. For all that, my prayers, my solicitations and intreating Zabaim in your name, could not obtaine the leave I demanded. He oppos'd so many shewes of amitie, and so many reasons to my request, that at last to comply with him, I went against mine owne thoughts, and yeelded to stay yet with him. That conformitie of mine was so pleasing unto him, as imbracing me with the transport of a man very passionate, Father (said he) I will make you confesse that Almanzor is not the sole man deserves to be beloved, and raise you to that happinesse, that with the one part of your affection you beare to him, you shall lose all that other which you beare to your native soile. After all these artificiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he return'd to the Palace, and leading me by the hand, made his Courtiers take notice of my extraordinary favour. From that day, he demean'd himselfe towards me as if truly I had been his father; and added a many more slaves to those he had given us before your departure. The more my credit increased, the more I suspected him; and knowing well, it came not out of any respect to you, nor from any merit in me, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted and laid all the cause of it on the love Zabaim bore to Axiamira. Nor was it long conceal'd from me. The Kings frequent visiting us, the excessive presents which hee continually sent my wife, and the submissions wherewith he presented himselfe before Axiamira, were to me too certaine proofes of his follie, and too assured presages of our approaching ruine. At last, he resolv'd to put off the maske he had long worn, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining Axiamira lov'd you, he thought there was no better way to settle himselfe in her thought, then by driving thence the memorie of you. To that end, he spoke to her of you, but in such a way, as taxing was subtlely intermix'd with praise, contempt with estimation, and envie with acknowledgement. I will not (my Lord) relate the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of his discourse, for Axiamira would never tell it me; know onely, that after Zaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im had well prais'd you, he made an ample declaration of his extreame love. Then hee told my daughter, that if she would give him some assurance of her affection, he would promise her no lesse a recompence then the three Crownes which Zelopa wore on her head. Axiamira, incens'd at his detestable propositions, was ready to breake out; but the greatnesse of her heart, and that scrupulous vertue whereof she hath alwaies made profession, neither permitted her to make shew of her spirit, nor to answer Zabaim's
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54727:185"/>
words. She would avenge it on her self, and by teares, watchings, and other austerities, ruinate the innocent cause of that Princes offences. He (for all that) did not give over his enterprise for so comfort lesse a beginning. On the contrary, the difficultie of it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his desires, he resolv'd to carrie away that victorie either by force or cunning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> 'Twas then we began to see the infallibilitie of our destruction. When it was permitted us to be alone, and all three together could freely disclose the thoughts of our hearts; we broke forth into infinite sorrowes and lamentations. We invok'd heavens Justice to assist us against the impudicitie of so often and many wayes guiltie a Prince. Wee call'd for it's thunder: We besought you to be yet once more our deliverer: but seeing our selves for saken of gods and men, and growing desperate of your returne, we fell from plaints and teares into a resolution to die. Axiamira shewing her brave spirit in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hat extremitie; Father (said she) my constancie hath now beene long in contestation with fortune, I feare it may faint, and after so high a flight have an ignominious stou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; deliver it then from those new enemies which assaile her; and if your power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not so farre, I pretend not to engage you on impossibilities. Your example makes me but too well know by what way we must generously enfranchise our selves from a place where we cannot live with honour. Let us get hence, and make Zabaim know we were born free. But if all passages are stopt us, and we be no more permitted the use of our libertie, let us trie our courage. Death is alwayes ready to succour such who call on her as they ought. It shall be it, my deare Protectors, it shall be it, which in spight of all the tyrants chaines and guards shall put a period to our feares and slaverie. When we heard Axiamira speake so generously, my wife and my selfe stopped the teares which had so long time distill'd from our eyes, and prepar'd our selves by a mutuall constancie to a glorious death: Yet before our putting that last resolution in execution, I had a mind to attempt some new meanes to save Axiamira: I tri'd, but in vaine, to corrupt some of our slaves. I writ to you divers letters which I gave to divers persons whom I thought very trustie; I especially hop'd you would come and relieve us; but I know wel now that my letters never came to your hands, and that Zabaim had them from the traitor who promis'd me to deliver them to you. I wonder'd no more, why he was so jealous of me, nor why he plac'd neer my daughter so many blacke Eunuches, who, not content to prie into all our actions, would even heare out words too. At last he tooke away that little libertie was left us. Hee himselfe forbad us the going forth from our lodging; and told me one day in choler, that his love being too much contemn'd would turne into furie. To this lamentable estate were we brought, when Vice it selfe tooke armes for the defence of Vertue, and though it was not its intention, imploi'd all that could be of force and furie to make her victorious. Zelopa who for six moneths had been sicke (as they said) of love and despaire, understood by some of her confidents that Zabaim had forgotten her, and passionately in love with a young maiden which had been sold him by her owne father (note my Lord how wicked the vulgar are in their judgement) was ready to seat her in Zelopa's place. These newes getting her out of the bed wherein she languished, made her leave Senega. Into Guinea she came more furious then a Lionesse that pursues the hunters which have stolne her whelps. She call'd to her succour all those Devills which the publicke voyce gave her altogether for her gods and slaves. She sacrific'd to her furie three of her principall Officers, for not advertising her presently of our arrivall, or rather for not imploying fire and poyson a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the father and daughter. Zabaim hearing of his wife's frenzies, was terrified with her threatnings and cruelties, and as an offender escap'd out of prison, seeing himselfe ready to fall into the hands of them who are doubly irritated by his flight, he growes pale, loseth his resolution, repents him for breaking his fetters, and lookes on those that advis'd him to escape as on so many enemies. Axiamira, who lately was his sole delight, his happinesse, his life, and somewhat more then even Zelopa with all her Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Spirits, was become to him a subject of horrour and hatred: and, if I know not what remainder of dying vertue had not opposs'd it selfe against the outrage of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch'd soule, he had doubtlesse himselfe (to obtaine remission for his inconstancie) cut the throat of Axiamira before Zelopa's eyes. In the meane time, that Witch, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Furie broke loose from hell, came by great journey's to fill the Court with massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:54727:185"/>
and impoysonings. The blinded Zabaim hearing of her coming, resolv'd to goe meet her, and by that submission aswell as by his teares to pacifie the furie of his tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Before he parted he would yet once more see Axiamira, and by that view give a secret and new aliment to the fire he could not extinguish. Assoone as he saw the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: What Princesse, said Almanzor to Osmin, interrupting him? Pardon me that mistake my Lord (repli'd Osmin) I would have said the unfortunate Axiamira. Goe on (father) said Almanzor, and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e no more so. The poore Osmin blush'd, and all asham'd for disclosing a thing he would have kept secret, thus continued his discourse: Assoone as Zabaim saw Axiamira; You would not be Queene (said hee) and you are now going to be a miserable slave, who shall languish all the remainder of your life under the cruell yoke of an inhumane Mistris. Thy threats (replied Axiamira) sway me as little as thy promises: I have scorn'd the one, and I feare not the other. With the same courage that I trod under-foot thy Crownes, I can undergoe all kinds of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yet when I have a mind to free my selfe from thy tyrannie, and the slaverie wherewithall thou threatnest me, thy guards and thy irons shall be too weake to hold me. Zabaim mov'd with those words, and feeling his flame rekindling, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rositie as well as the attraicts of Axiamira, wept before her a long time, and cursing the rigour of his Destinie, shew'd he had no minde to have her ruin'd, and yet he could not save her. He presently flew thence, as if he had fear'd Zelopa knew of his visit, and left us in a firme resolution to die, rather then to fall into the hands of that inhumane Sorceresse. Axiamira would not have us linger any longer, and proposing to us death, as an expedient, or helpe the most facile and pleasant, besought us for the last course to renounce all desire of life, and not put our selves againe to the hazard, dangers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities of a flight, which could not be discovered, but it must be far more dismall to us then death. I need not (my Lord) tell you, it was not for our owne sakes that we could not resolve to die. Had we been alone, my wife and I, we had soone disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened our selves of an irksome old age: but when we came to consider that we should destroy in the birth, a miracle which nature had produc'd to be the ornament of her age, our constancie vanish'd, and death seem'd to us a monster, which we were obliged to avoid as long as we had any meanes left to escape. My wife and my selfe having therefore resolv'd to try for our safetie, we propos'd it to our daughter: she shew'd her selfe very repugnant to it, neverthelesse her obedience being farre stronger, she consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all we desir'd of her. Presently we provided our selves for that escape, and taking hold of the occasion which may be was offer'd us, we deceived our slaves in faining Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amira to be sicke. The night then after the departure of Zabaim, being come; we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd our selves, and getting through a lower window which look'd into the Palace gardens, we got into the wilde fields, and from thence into a desert which is frontire betweene Guinea and Senega. Though our flight was favour'd by the departure of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim, and a very precipitate breaking up of Court, yet was it discovered, and as we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the desert, we saw five or six black slaves which pursued us, their Scimitars ready drawne. Affrighted with the yellings and furie of those barbarous villaines, wee flung our selves into the next Caverne we saw, without feare of meeting any of those furious beasts which usually retire themselves into such like places. Our feare was our safety, for sliding into that hole with all the silence that accompanieth timiditie, we hid our selves among bushes which almost stopt up the mouth of it. Those who ran afterus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling their shouts and threatnings, cast themselves into the Cave, but having (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt by their yellings) awakened two lions which lay there asleep, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained (in lieu of taking us) to defend themselves. This unhop'd for succour made us turne up our eyes to heaven which we saw not, and beg that great Soule which animates it to restraine the furie of the lions, and not suffer them that had been our Defenders, to be our devourers. Our prayer was heard: Those lions after they had satiated their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on those wretches, forsooke their den, and lessening our feare by their departure gave us liberty to breathe and to know our selves. My wife and I searching for Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira gropingly found her, farre lesse affrighted then in Zabaim's Court, and received from her that heartning and comfort we would have given. She advis'd us to forsake that place whilst those we feared were gone. We did so, and after vve had vvandred
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54727:186"/>
above a moreth amongst the mountaines of Lions (without any food but what we got by our prayers from the Inhabitants of those mountaines, we passed the River of Saban to the towne which carries the same name. Many Merchants of Mansara who were come thither to trafique, received us into their companie, and taking pitie of my wife's age and mine, and of Axiamira's tender yeares, set us all three on their Camels, and conducted us happily to the Citie of Ponda. Finding my selfe so neere the ordinary abode of Zabaim, new feares followed my ordinary ones, and they were yet augmented by the report that ranne of that Prince his returne with his wife. I forsooke therefore the towne where I had beene so well receiv'd by night with my little company, and having none other Guide then the same who had so happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted us to that time, I came at last to the house of charitable Servonitez. His repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which is not much lesse great then Zabaims, but more worthy to be envy'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited me to him, and there made me meet yet with more then I was made to hope for. I need not (my Lord) recount to you the particularities; that Knight (said he pointing to me) hath not held till this time from relating them to you. Almanzor seeing Osmin give over; I know said he the end of your adventures, but the beginning of them (which I would faine heare) is yet behinde. But we will deferre that recitall to another time, and imploy the time we have in giving order for our particular affaires. For Zabaim we will forget him, till the time come wherein we may make him know (without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging his perfidy by another) that he hath more wrong'd himselfe then us, when to satisfie his sensuality he hath undervalued our requests and friendship. Speake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (father) to me freely, and tell me whether you intend to follow my fortune, and love me so well as to end your dayes with me, and give over into my hands the care of your family. This proposition was conceiv'd in such sort as Osmin noted in it a hidden necessity of abiding with Almanzor. But that necessity was so conformable to his thoughts, that he receiv'd it as the highest favour could come from the Prince. He told him likewise, that since he had left his countrey, and the advantages of fortune, because he would neither violate the divine Lawes in flattering his King in his vices, nor the humane in running into rebellion; he had not wandered by Sea and land but to live in a dominion where a man might applaud vertue and condemne vice without feare of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing persecuted. That double felicity (said he) doe I finde in all places where you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. You are no lesse good then powerfull; and the good you doe, is never the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense of a servile flattery, nor a criminall obsequiousnesse. Almanzor interrupting Osmin, Beware father, said he, lest in condemning flattery you become a flatterer. The onely thing I can assure you, is, that I will doe my best endeavour to hinder all good men from becoming miserable. With that he dismissed Osmin, and promis'd him that very day he would go and confirme these veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ies to his wife and daughter. Osmin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone, Almanzor tooke Hydaspes by the one hand, and my selfe by the other, and walking up and downe the chamber, now cast his eyes upon the one and then on the other. At last standing still: What, said he? You doe not doubt now but that Axiamira is somewhat else then what she goes for. Poore Osmin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ath unwittingly discover'd all, and possest me with a desire of knowing by what cruelty of fortune that Princesse hath beene pluck'd from the armes of her parents. Hydaspes spake first, and made a long enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of many Princes who by divers accidents were falne into the like misfortune as Axiamira. If I durst have spoken what I knew I could have confirm'd Hydaspes proofes by the very example of Almanzor; but thinking it not fit to let him know who he was, before I had confer'd with Abrinzias about it, I advis'd him neither to believe nor disbelieve what he thought of Axiamira. I have a businesse more important to make knowne to you, (said he) 'tis that I marke I know not what in this adventure which troubles me, and makes me feare lest you fall not into the crimes, but the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of Zabaim. I see your spirit stir'd with certaine agitations, with which it was not lately acquainted. You have disquiets in your most pleasing recreations. You sigh and laugh together. You make them hold their peace which speake to you, and you are silent when you are bound to answer. In that little time I have had the honour to be neere you, I have seene you put on all those different formes, and even during Osmins relation, you sometimes seem'd inflamed as if you had beene in the heate of a combat;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54727:186"/>
and then pale, as ready to swound. Scarce could you containe your selfe in one place, and I saw you every moment ready to interrupt Osmin, though you witnessed a great pleasure in hearing him. May be (my Lord) you know not what malady tis which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers it selfe by these strange symptomes. Tis love, (replied Almanzor sighing) but a love so pure and perfect, that I should be an enemy to vertue if I were asham'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it. After that declaration he held his peace, and I presently began to lay open to him how unworthy of him the subject of his love was. Father, (said he) after he had intreated me to be silent; if Axiamira's excellent qualities receiv'd no wrong by your remonstrances, I would indure you as farre as I have done Hydaspes; and would not thinke it strange that you should treat me as one blinded, unreasonable, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Zabaim, in briefe as an effeminate man who for a sensuall pleasure contemnes all honour, treads vertue under foote, and renounceth his part in all that is excellent in the world. But when I shall have given you freedome to throw all those injuries on me, what thinke you will come of it? Even nothing; but that you will have confirm'd me in my resolution, and gain'd to your selves a continuall repentance for opposing the innocence of my intentions. Be better advis'd my friends, and crosse me not, since you have not done it hitherto in seeing me in the most dangerous occurrents: but be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses how I demeane my selfe; pry into my least actions, and faile not to reprove me if you see me swerve into any thing unworthy. By this speech, Almanzor silencing us both, made us to fall from one extreame into another, and of his Censurers (which we would have beene) to become his Confidents. This conversation once ended, he went to the King; and understood from a Courier sent to him from Zabaim, that very shortly by a solemne Embassy he would not onely give him thanks for so many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries he owed to his valour, but offer him a great part of it. Almanzor almost insensible of those promises, us'd Zabaims Posts very civilly in the presence of Abrinzias, but in private he made knowne that his Master had offended him; and so he was sent back with a letter (which we were bound to approve, after we had long debated) and it was thus:</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Perseus</hi> to <hi>Zabaim</hi> King of Senega.</head>
                  <p>JUstice commands me to write to you as to the most unworthy of all men. But I know not what Law (which I cannot read under) forbids me the upbraiding your crimes, and the violating that amity I have promis'd you. Not because of your unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, and that I am not oblig'd to hate my selfe for my capacity of loving you. Some other then I would repeate and reproach you my deservings: but since in all my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I never propos'd any other end but honour, I also never expected any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. Enjoy happily (if the remorce of conscience will permit you to be happy) Senega, which I have preserv'd to you against the power of your enemies; and Guinea which I have finally reconquered for you. I repent not (for all that you have done me) the yeelding you so many proofes of my affection. But hence forward I shall know how to make a better election, and not hazard my life for such men, who loving nothing but their pleasures and brutish desires, glory in their breach of promise and legitimate affections. Go not about by your excuses and artificiall reasons to justifie your violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Though Axiamira's beauty were powerfull enough to captivate your love, the consideration of Perseus should have beene as prevalent to have hindred you from shewing it.</p>
                  <p>But, honoured knight, I have too much troubled you with affaires of State. I returne to those of Love, and let you know, that Almanzor had no sooner dispatch'd Zabaims Messenger, but he came to Axiamira's chamber. He found her in her ordinary neglect and melancholy. He came to her with a feare that is not to be believed, and utterly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the remembrance of all that he had premeditated to speake to her, he was brought against his will to call for Osmin to him, to recollect his wits by that diversion, and finde some cause of talke. When the old man was come he tooke him by the hand,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54727:187"/>
and addressing his Speech to him; Have you (said he) intimated to this faire Lady my resentment of Zabaim's insolencies? Axiamira staid not till her father had satisfied Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor's demand; but turning to the Prince, her eyes still cast downewards: My Lord (said she) if you commiserate our afflictions, doe not (if you please) renew them, by making us call to minde their Author. His name makes us tremble, and our memories which in spight of us retaine the image of him, never represent it, without making us suffer yet more tortures then that tyrant had prepared for us. You have most just cause Madam (repli'd Almanzor) to condemne that barbarous man into an eternall oblivion: yet give me leave to call to minde his impudencies; and that their excesse may vively remaine in my memorie, that he may not vannt to have wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged without punishment. No, no, my Lord (repli'd Axiamira) 'tis not fit you should trouble your selfe to inflict ought on him; he is sufficiently and rigorously chastised in living with Zelopa; 'tis the greatest torture his most animated enemies are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon him. I doe what I can (said my deare master) to have no other will then yours, but when I take into consideration the state of Zabaim, pardon me, if I say you are too good in not wishing him a greater punishment then Zelopa. I confesse 'tis high, nay, 'tis even insupportable; but he is not sensible of it, and his insensibilitie makes him meet his delights where you finde your afflictions. Axiamira was long silent, at last she began againe, and blushing as she had been asham'd of her owne thoughts; Osmin (said she to Almanzor) can tell you, Zabaim hath not all the insensibilitie you imagine; If he be not very insensible (repli'd Almanzor) he is at least blinde and very irrationall, to love the infamous Zelopa, and have no respect to a personage which shall not be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily enough stil'd, though she be called the wonder of her age, the astonishment of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, the desire of all soules, and the felicitie of all eyes. Yes Madam I repeat it (and be pleased I doe so) Zabaim is a monster which nature hath produced to make Africa more horrible then ever it was before, since he hath had ignorance and brutalitie enough to treat you with lesse respect then he doth a Sorceresse, a prostituted Strumpet: Love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so disavowes him, and asham'd that one so barbarous should make him Author of his crimes; throwes himselfe at your feet to justifie himselfe of Zabaim's insolencies; and protests to you (with his drowned eyes) he never inspired him with so foule and crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall cogitations. Axiamira a little lifting up her eyes, as if she would know who 'twas that spoke to her, witnessed with a very good grace that she was astonied, and retyring a little backward, I am (said she) so little used to heare so faire words, as I confesse I know not how to answer them. Hitherto I have received nought but injuries, both from men and the elements: and either of them have treated me as the scandall and infamie of my Sex. I have passed for a vagabond, for a slave, and may be for something worse. Those that have been more just would not condemne me before they knew mee, and when they had that knowledge, finding me not very guiltie, they called me the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Innocent. After that (my Lord) judge if it be not a strange noveltie to me to heare my selfe termed to be the wonder of my age, the astonishment of Africa, the desire of all soules, and felicitie of all eyes. Certainly I am so much amazed at it, that the confusion it causeth in my soule, is greater then it shewes in my face. Reserve those titles for some others, since they cannot be justly attributed to me; fit your words to my necessitous condition; call me vagabond, call me unfortunate, call me a slave, and I shall be able to understand and to answer you. Many shipwracks, many prisons, and many other indignities, have been as so many Masters which have taught me this dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full language. Axiamira said no more; but 'twas too much to draw out of Almanzor's heart, all he had remaining of reason and liberty. He confessed himselfe absolutely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and with a great deale of pleasure put on the chaines he had so long time refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. He thought on the excesse of his happinesse, and that consideration plucking him from himselfe, he remained so exceedingly transported, that of a thousand things hee spoke to Axiamira, whether it were to praise her, to give her thankes, or to shew his passion, there was not one of them but discovered the alteration of his judgement. Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira perceived it, and by a nimblenesse of wit, which is not comparable but with it selfe: I wonder not (said she) if you expresse your selfe so ill, since I make you speake a language which you never practised. The happinesse which attends you, the honour
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54727:187"/>
which invirons you, and the adoration you receive from so many Nations which affect or feare you, have a particular language; and it must be absolutely unknowne to any that would understand the tongue of the miserable and afflicted. Almanzor ravished with Axiamira's wit as much as by her beauty, sighed very deeply in lieu of answering her; but his discretion imposed a rigorous silence on the agitations of his passion, and obliged him to speake, and tell Axiamira, He had no need of an Interpreter, either to understand or to answer her; That in that little time he had the honour to see her, he had perfectly learned the language of the unfortunate and the slave: Axiamira (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving by these words, that doubtlesse Almanzor was about to disclose his passion to her) called Osmin who unperceivably was gotten a little off, and told him, if he came not to intertaine the Prince, he would run the hazard of being quickly wearied with so ill company. My deare Master soone understood the subtlety of Axiamira's wit and her wisdome, and that knowledge inflaming him more then he was: I perceive well (said he to himselfe) that my servitude will last as long as my life: in the meane time, to let her see, that he absolutely conformed himselfe to her will, he began againe, and addressing his words to Osmin; Father (said he) I think you too happy, in being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in your disasters by a personage not onely able to comfort you, but powerfull enough to take away all feeling of them. Osmin replied, with the gravity of a father speaking of his childe, and his wife interposing her selfe in the discourse, shewed, she could not so well act her part as her husband. Axiamira continued still her faining, but Almanzor who could no longer be deceiv'd by it; noted in all that maidens words, that she was infinitely above what shee would seeme to be. I should be infinitely tedious (generous Sir) if I did not cut off the most part of those private converses, to tell you in a word, how my deare master, forgetting all, to think of nought else but Axiamira, so imprudently demeaned himselfe in his love, that Abrinzias and Andromeda percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it. They lov'd him no lesse then they did Perseus, and thought themselves no lesse obliged to have an eye to the actions of the one, then of the other. They therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to withdraw Almanzor from an affection which seemed to them unworthy of him: yet would they not make use of unjust meanes to perfect what they intended. They had their whole life time thitherto condemned all craft, deceit, and violence; and their goodnesse had perswaded them, that to hinder one ill by another, was to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply mischiefes in lieu of suppressing them. Andromeda following such rare maximes, would need know Axiamira, before Abrinzias should make any shew to my deare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the discontent he tooke in his alteration. She therefore sent for the mother and the daughter, and without laying traps to insnare them, turn'd them on all sides; and left them not till she had put them to all the trialls her wisdome advised. She was very well satisfied from both, and from their first converse, found so much sweetnesse and vertue in Axiamira, that I shall not lie if I say she became almost as farre inamour'd of her as Almanzor. Afterwards, she could not live without her; she had her name still in her mouth, she even lov'd to praise her in Almanzor's presence; and when Abrinzias blamed her for that indiscretion; You (said she to him) know not Axiamira, and would it had pleased the Divinitie we adore, that this Mayden had been borne for our unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Perseus. Whilst Axiamira was thus exceedingly belov'd of Andromeda, Almanzor swom in pleasures beyond expression, and though Axiamira would neither permit him to see her in private, nor once to intertaine her with his passion, he was yet so content with his fortune, as he thought he had nothing more to wish for. Now, one day when Andromeda had shut her selfe up with Axiamira in a Temple of Virgins, destinated to the worship of a god which those of Benin call the Soule of the Sunne: Almanzor sent for Osmin, and being alone with him, intreated he would acquit himselfe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise he had so often made him, and make knowne who Axiamira was, and by whom she was delivered unto him. Osmin, in stead of replying, cast himselfe at Almanzor's feet, and kissing them whether the Prince would or no, there kneeled, as bound, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing but bedewing them with his teares. The Prince at last raising him up, Father (said he) if you thinke me unworthy to know, or incapable of concealing so great a secret, I release you of the promise you made me, and swear to you to smother for ever my curiosity though it be not condemnable. Osmin recovering his use of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54727:188"/>
speech, My Lord (said he to the Prince) my sighes and teares proceed from an other Sourse. I have (at least) as great a desire to disclose to you what I know of Axiamira, as you have to know it. But alas! I feare the event of a Prophesie of the great Abul Ismeron. He threatned me in Morocco, that I should lose Axiamira assoone as my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousnesse should make me erre in that secret I had promised her. Keep it then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably (repli'd Almanzor) but free your mind of that credit you give to Abul Isme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: sometimes he tells truth in his predictions, but 'tis by chance, and for one verity they containe, there is discovered in them a thousand lies, and as many impossibilities. When I was in Morocco at the Prince of Fez his Tourney; had not he published that no stranger Prince should carry away the honour of the day, but Abdelmelec should come off victorious if he continued in the termes of his Defiance? The event yet shew'd the contrary; That Prince was vanquish'd by another Prince, which is not altogether without name, and was overcome with the same weapons he himselfe had chosen in his Challenges. The Imposter Ismeron went further on; he durst maintaine in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King of Morocco, that I gave my self out for what I was not, and in spight of all apparances I was an obscure person, who neither knew my place of birth, nor the quality of my Parents. After these falsities, judge whether your Prophet deserves any credit should be given to his predictions. Osmin dis-beguil'd, or to speake more truly, abused, by that great example, laughed at Ismeron's menaces, and beleeves not fortune to be hardy enough to assaile him under the protection of Almanzor. He besought him therefore to hearken; and preparing him by a long preface to the beliefe of such wonders as hee was to tell him; thus began the relation. I am descended from the great Abuchar Izchias, which founded the Kingdome of Zanhara, and who labouring for nought else but to make his people happy and free, thought that the power of Kings was never more absolute then when it was submitted to the will of the Subject. Thence is it, that of all the Kings of Africk, those of Zanhara are the least powerfull and least renowned: but in recompence, they are the most assured and contented. He who raigns at this day, would needs dispence with, and give over the Lawes his predecessours had observed, and suffering himselfe to be corrupted by the contagion of his neighbours, thought, that to divide the Soveraignty with his Subjects, was to descend from his Throne, and mingle himselfe amongst the throng of the people, and enjoy nothing of Royaltie but the name and the ornaments. Do you know what is betided him on that frenzie? He hath lost the love of his people by it, with his peace and safety, and found himselfe without Subjects, when he thought he was absolutely King. I was long one of those in whom he had a particular affiance; but he met not in my disposition, either basenesse enough to flatter him in his faults, or so much ambition as to build my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes on the ruines of my brethren. I oft times remonstrated the wrong he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in changing the ancient Lawes of the State, and humbly besought him, he would be pleased I might retire, to the end I might preserve the fidelity I ought him, and not faile in that I ow'd my Countrey: He would never give me leave; but told me, 'twas to be an enemy to reason not to prove of his alterations. I yet staid a while with him, beseeching and pressing him alwayes to cast his eyes on the diminution he brought on his authority in going about to increase it. But perceiving he went on, from the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power which is not altogether ill, to a tyranny, which is evermore pernicious; and that after he had despoyl'd the husbands, and fathers of their goods, he attempted the pudicity of their wives and daughters; I left the Court, and within a while after, the Kingdome: My wife, who hath alwayes made profession of an eminent vertue, was the first that solicited me to leave my goods, to save mine honour; and the first who expos'd her selfe to the perils of a difficult journey. After I had engaged my selfe with all my Family in those deserts and famous mountaines which are placed as inviolable bounds between the Kingdom of Morocco and that of Zanhara, we arriv'd at that state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and populous City which may be called the Queen of Africa, where we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the King, with all the freenesse and bounty we could hope from him: and for mine owne particular, I was with him in that esteem, as had not the remembrance of the King my master, and the love I bore him, continually crossed my repose; I had met wherewithall to lose the memory of my countrey, and blesse the houre of my banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54727:188"/>
You have seene that Prince. His two Sons have felt the weight of your armes; and all that Court, amaz'd at your valour, have expos'd to you all that it had of most magnificent. This being so, I might justly be accused of the imperfection incident to those of my age, if I should make you a description of it. I must therefore go on, and tell you that after I had beene two or three months with Hely (so was the good King of Moroccoes name) I got so farre into him, that there passed nothing in the State, nor in his royall house, wherein he tooke not my advise.</p>
                  <p>The second year of my service with him began those bloudy tragedies which ambition and love exhibited to his two Sons, and I presently foresaw the unhappy Catastrophes. I presently gave that Prince such counsell as had sav'd him his Crowne and life, had he not lesse lov'd them both, then he did two the most ingratefull and vicious children of the world. Nephisus (so was the youngest called) being retir'd from the Court with a resolution to have by fire and sword, what was due to him by birthright, made himselfe Master of Guargetsem, which is seated on a point of the Mount Atlas, and thrusting farre into the Ocean shelters the mouth of the River of Sus from all the North winds. The Portugals who had not cherished the divisions of the Kings house but for their own gaine, offered Nephisus both men and Armes; and put into the Fortresse all things necessary to defend it against the whole force of Morocco. The good Prince Hely ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly put on by his Priests remonstrances, and the counsell which I thought my selfe bound to give him, departed from the City of Morocco, and with a potent Army fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the countrey of Sus, beleaguer'd Guargetsem. But when he thought on Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisus (whom he dearely lov'd) he let fall his armes; and shewing himselfe to be too good a father, would not have his Army oppose themselves against the fury <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>f that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Son. Presently he sent such as had beene beforetime most pleasing to him, to intreat him to acknowledge his fault, to breake off instantly with the enemies of his greatnesse and religion, and not to give over for a prey a Country which should be so much the more deare to him, because it was to be a part of his Dominions. But Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisus insensible of that excesse of goodnesse, attributed his fathers extreame love to him, to a weakenesse of spirit and want of courage; and like some beasts that grow more furious when they are claw'd and strok'd, he became very ragefull because he was no more powerfully set on. Every day he made sallies, and bragg'd among his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, that the Corps of the King his father should shortly serve him for a step to the throne. But see an example of that to be dreaded Justice, which never lets passe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished so prodigious crimes as those of Nephisus. At one of his Sallies the Governour of Taradant a bold and trusty Knight as ever was in Mauritania, met, bustled, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him, and tooke him prisoner. The good Hely no sooner heard these newes, but he came out of his tent, ran to meet his Son, and finding him in the midst of an armed troupe, embrac'd him, wept on him, called him his best beloved and his heire; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to pardon the Governour of Taradant for his daring to lay hands on him. Nephisus intimated his distraction and stomach by his silence; and (though a Prisoner) threatned those who hindred him from executing his pernicious resolutions. But the respect they bore to the father made them patiently indure the insolencies of the Son. I was one of those that stood stiffely for his detention, and by a just boldnesse withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hely from his fatall debonarity, made him know that he was father of his people, before he was so of his Son; and by consequence that he could not be indulgent to the crimes of the one, without becomming culpable of the miseries of the other. Hely, who was not lesse judicious then facile, confessed with a great deale of mildnesse that my remonstrances were just and my counsell wholesome: but said he, what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my Son? 'Tis better that I perish in the age I am, then you should be bound to deprive my Estate (by the death of Nephisus) of those felicities it attended from his government. The Kings principall Officers would have gladly pleased but not lost him; but foreseeing that Nephisus liberty would be the death of Hely, they were strongly resolved against his clemency, and told him, that if he would not doe his Subjects justice, his Chieftaines were resolv'd to forsake him. To this, he answered nothing, (unIesse it were they should remember he was a father) and his silence passing amongst us for a secret consent; Nephisus was remitted into his hands who had taken him.

Whilst he conducted him to Taradant, he assail'd Guargessem, and the Commander's captivity taking away the Souldiers hearts, the place was rendred within a moneth of it's beleaguring. The Portugals failing in their plot retir'd, and Hely presently entred the fortresse. At first he was insensible of his good fortune, but the continuall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to him the unnaturalnesse of his Son, and denoting the defects he fell into against his owne estate through his too much clemency; he grew sensible of his errour, and gave those men thankes who maugre his countermands had appli'd a remedy to it. We were both one evening discoursing of those occurrences, when on the sudden a surious winde mingled with lightning and thunder drew the good Hely to his chamber win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, either to divert his sad cogitations, or rather to intertaine them with so fearfull and dismall an object. Whilst he stood as it were buried in his musings, I descri'd a far off at Sea, two great fires, which sometimes approached, and then againe went off from one another. At the noyse I made in seeing them, the King came out of his meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perceiving the cause of my astonishment, stood very heedfull to see what would become of those fires. The winde which blew from the West Easterly, made them make a great deale of way in a small time, and brought them so neer us, that we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly saw they were two ships which may be had fir'd one another because they could not otherwise get a victory. Hely, who was of the most sensible and humane nature I ever yet knew, presently shar'd in the calamity of those that were confin'd to those bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vessels; and though he deem'd them Portugals, and by consequence his Enemies, yet he shew'd his desire to relieve them. He sent divers of his guard to take all the Fisher-boats that were by the shore, and commanded them to take in if it were possible all those that were not yet lost in that conflagration. They obey'd, but onely for fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sake; and indeed their paines was bootlesse, and their feare of losing themselves in striving to save strangers kept them from that hazard. One of these two burning ships being driven full against our rock split in peeces, and left to the mercy of the Sea those whom the fire had not yet consumed. The other met luckily with the mouth of the River of Sus, and all burnt as she was downe to the water drove (as we understood next day) on a shelfe up the River. Hely (grieved at so strange a sight) went to his bed, and commanded me to take care of those who were taking out of the Sea. I went downe to the shore, and seeing there the good Kings guard, blamed their disobedience, and compell'd them to return to their boats. It was exceeding darke, the Sea went high; and the feare so generall, that this second attempt was as vaine as the former. One of the boats being thrown against the point of a rock was overturn'd, some of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers drown'd, and the rest affrighted at the losse of their companions, got to land, and protested against ever turning Mariners againe. I would have return'd, but something (I know not what) staying me, I remained there almost alone. As the Tyde went out, the winde calm'd, and the waves growne smoother, brought even to my feet some pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of that double shipwrack. As I was earnestly righting that which came a shore, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst chests, fardels, and halfe burnt pieces of plancks and other timber, I saw a man who (forgetting the danger from which he was not yet got free) call'd with a loud voyce Iphidamanta, and seem'd he had no minde to save himselfe, but onely in regard he was loath to leave the person who own'd that name. I thought it good with my self but knew not wherefore, to answer at the name of Iphidamanta. I had scarce twice or thrice repeated it; but he who call'd, put himselfe to swim, and came to land fast by where I sate. Assoone as he was out of the water, I ran to him and offered on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the King of Morocco, all that he needed in his adverse fortune. Afterwards, to free him from the trouble wherein he saw him, I said, That I onely touched with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, had made answer as often as he call'd Iphidamanta. The man sighing at those words, stood a while silent, at last he ask'd me on what Province of Africa he was cast, and besought me to tell him my name: I satisfi'd his demands, and strove by my best reasons to comfort him, or at least to draw him out of his despaire. But he, insensible of all things but his losse, Reserve (said he) for some more lesse miserable then my selfe, the remedies your charity presents me. I must dye, said he, and must finde by my sword what I could not meet with neither in the fire nor the water. Ah! faire Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta, thou art lost, and even those indeavours wherevvith I strove to preserve to my
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54727:189"/>
selfe the happinesse of seeing thee, have reduc'd me to the misery of never seeing thee more. After he had thus lamented, he left me, and leapt into a little boat that was moar'd at the Sea side; but when he was got some twenty or thirty paces, the surges brought him back againe. Five or six times he strove to force her, and as often was cast backe a shore. At last he came out of his vessell, and finding me where I was left: If (said he) your pity be not fained, tell me where I may finde some Mariners. My ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke is not of so little importance, but the remaines of it is able to inrich many. I advis'd him to stay till day, ere he put himselfe to Sea, and promis'd to provide him as many men as he needed. Then I intreated him to retire in and passe the rest of the night with me; but I could not possibly get him from the place where he was, and his obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy cut off from me all meanes of comforting him. I therefore took my leave of him, and assoone as I was in my lodging, sent five or six of my slaves, to get Mariners to serve him. At day breake I returned to the Sea side, to learne what was become of him, for I thought not to meet him againe: yet I did; but in the most deplorable estate you can possibly imagine. He held in his hands a robe imbroider'd with gold and silver, which was in some places burnt and in others bloudy. When I came neere, he lifted it up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aire, and with a languishing voyce cry'd out, See just heaven what thou hast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Fortune to perpetrate! See all that remaines of that wonder for whom thou seem'dst to have reserv'd the best Crownes of Europe! Doest thou thus deceive the faith of men? and reject the prayers of the most innocent? Didst not thou incourage me to plucke Iphidamanta out of the hands of a Tyrant to whom she had beene inthrall'd? Didst thou not make me hope to see her one day seated on my Throne, only to ingage me to an unfortunate enterprise which hath hastned her fate, and buried in those waves which have swallow'd her, all that could ever make me happy? Thou wouldst have it so, just heaven; and thereby I know thou redemandest the life thou hast given me. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store it thee, and render it as a gift I am asham'd of. With that he cast away the robe, and tooke againe the ponyard wherewithall he had already strook himselfe; but I held his hand as he was about to double his blow, and making my selfe knowne: Credit not (said I) your despaire, follow more wholesome counsell; and at least preserve so much of your selfe as remaines. When he heard me speake he cast up his eyes, and knowing me, Osmin (repli'd he) I will dye, and not give Fortune the contentment of seeing me longer under her tyranny. But before I go hence, I will trust thee with my last Will. Intreat from me the King of Morocco, that he will please to send into Scotland, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise the King my father of the tragicall end whereto his deniall hath brought me; and if my last petition can move him, obtaine that he send some one to the Canaries to let the Queen there know of my death. Polexander was so vext to heare of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Prince his death, and withall, the contrary of what he had knowne from the old Narcissus, that he had not power enough o're himselfe to suppresse his first agitations, and remaine in that indifferency, with which he had heard the other incidents of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor's History: he interrupted unseasonably Almaid; and besought him, before he went further on, to let him know whether after the death of the Scottish Prince, there had been nothing heard of Iphidamanta. Almaid was far from imagining 'twas Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander spoke to him; nor made he any reflection on his troubles and agitations, but imputing them to that impatient and inconsiderate curiosity, which extraordinary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures and events raise in the most solid and retir'd mindes: I will (said he) presently satisfie your demand, and relate to you very wonderfull verities, at least if Osmin made not my dear Master beleeve so. Know, that Spimantus had no sooner done speaking, but suddenly plucking away his arme which Osmin held, he strook his ponyard deep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his brest, but so happily for him, that he was assoon dead as wounded. Osmin, very much griev'd for not being the stronger, mingled his tears with that unfortunate Prince his bloud; and after a long bewailing his sad disaster, commanded his slaves to cleanse the body and carry it to his lodging. In the meane time he went up to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse to give an account to Hely of what he had seen, and acquit himself of that the Prince of Scotland at his death incharg'd him: yet he could not performe it, for at his entring the King's chamber, he saw tovvard tvventy of those men half Shepheards, half Fishers, vvhich inhabite on the bankes of the River of Sus; and he heard the eldest of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54727:190"/>
the company in presenting a young maiden (clad like a Shepheardesse) to Hely, speake thus: The feare which I and my companions had, least some of your Souldiers or others, might by force take from us this excellent beauty, is the cause that made us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat her to quit the rich habillements she wore, and to conceale her selfe under the simplicity of those she hath now on. At breake of day we being imbark'd for fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saw very farre in the River somewhat which cast up a thick smoake. We made to it with our boates, and perceiv'd it had beene a great ship which by fire was burnt downe to the water. That cruell enemy seem'd not content with the mischiefe it had done, but search'd into the bottome of the ship for new subjects whereon to execute its fury. It flew every where, and consuming the bodies of those it had smothered, cast up such a stinking fume, as it was almost impossible for us to approach it. We were returning very sorrowfull for not being able to succour any body, when most pitifull shrikes and cries which seem'd to implore our ayde made us alter our resolution. We entred the smoake, and some twenty paces from the ship we perceiv'd some women, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing one another floated on five or six great bundles of corke which had beene lincked together. Pity made us cast away all feare. Through fire and sword we came to the women, and taking them into our boates, left the fire to make an end of that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage it had so farre advanced. Assoone as those poore creatures saw themselves out of that danger which they had as it were miraculously escaped, they testified by their teares and actions how much they were obliged to us. Wee asked them by what acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they had beene reduced to that extremity, but they could not answer because they did not understand us. Their language was no lesse unknowne to us then ours to them. Yet that hindred not, but we continued our assistance. Wee conducted them to our Cotes, where commending them to the care of our wives, we returned to the River, to try if we could save any thing out of the burning vessell.</p>
                  <p>Our paines was not unfruitfull, for fastning a cable to a piece of timber on which the staffe or handle of the ships rudder rested, we drew the rest of the vessell on the sands, and opening it by the keele, found therein much rich furniture which the fire had not yet touched. At our returne home we more heedfully considered (then we had done at first) the women you see, and were strooke as with lightning at the fight of this new Shepheardesse. Her robes which shone againe with gold and silver, and the Diamonds she wore on her head made us imagine her to be some personage of an elevated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and so we entertain'd her, and instantly resolv'd to come and present her to you. We could not make her understand our intention, nor she us her will. First of all I thought fit to disguise her for my former reason: and assoone as my wife had shewne her the garments she weares, she shew'd a great deale of contentment, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyring with her to put them on, gave her in exchange her rich robe and Diamonds. But we thought it not fit that we should make our benefit of them. Therefore (Sir) I have brought them with me not onely for that consideration, but to the end you may not doubt of my words. See, here they are both. With that he delivered to the King as 'twere a halfe Crowne of Diamonds, and unfoulded a robe which for the richnesse as wel as the fashion would merit a particular description but that other matters of more importance oblige me to put it off till another time. Hely tooke no heed neither to the Jewels or robes of the stranger, because his eyes were so fixed on her face, that he was incapable of all things else. In the meane time, the Prince of Scotlands adventure win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Osmin to believe this Shepheardesse was Iphidamanta, he came to her, and when he had long time regarded, I know not, said he, whether I be deceiv'd, but I have ill understood what the Prince of Scotland told me, or you are Iphidamanta. The Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesse blushing at Osmins speech, looked on him with a modesty full of majesty, and presently fell a weeping. Hely losing the object which had held him so long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, came out of his extasie; and seeing Osmin before him. Doth not (said he) this adventure much amaze you? Sir (replied Osmin) you would your selfe be farre more, if you knew it all. Thereupon Osmin related to him the death of the Scottish Prince, and the requests he made him, dying, and never believe me, said he, if this Shepheardesse be not the Princesse Iphidamanta. Hely touched with some inward motions not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to his age, made knowne to that faire Shepheardesse, how pleasing her coming was
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54727:190"/>
to him; and spoke to her with such respects and submissions as seem'd to undervalue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Majesty. Osmin thought at first, his civilities so full of affection, proceeded onely from the Prince's goodnesse, which was extended to all his Subjects, and many times made him forget what he was. But that very day, Hely made him lose that opinion, and let him know, though he had a great deale of goodnesse, he had far more love. He bought Iphidamanta's robes and jewels at six times more then they were worth, and by so excessive a liberality changed the fortune of a great many poore people. The Fisher-men inriched beyond their hopes returned to their Cottages, and the faire Shepheardesse abode in the fortresse with those women, but so sad and desolate, that shee moved them to pity who were the most insensible. Hely not induring so great sorrow in a person so deare to him, did all he could to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her, and besought her to make knowne to him the cause of her affliction, that he might work a remedy if he were powerfull enough to bring it to passe. That desolate faire one gave the Prince no answer but with her teares, and seem'd to feare something more then the shipwrack which she had escaped. Thus passed the first day of Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's arrivall: the night after made an end of undoing the good Hely, and the following dayes brought him to such an extremity, that being no longer able to hide his malady, made good that ancient verity, That Love is a fury in the soules of old men. He strove to retrive in the wrinkles of his face and feeblenesse of his body some remainder of beauty and strength: He consulted with his glasse to disprove if he could his fifty five yeers which upbraided him with his folly. It seem'd to him he was not altogether old, and that time had dealt with him far kinder then with others of his age. Not content with flattering himselfe thus, he sent for Osmin to have a Rivall in his selfe-love, and a confident in that he bore the illustrious Shepheardesse. But Osmin whose integrity could not be corrupted, gave eare to the Kings dotages with much griefe, and severely answer'd him; Are you well advis'd (said he) what you doe? Have you forgotten that Abdelmelec and Nephisus had not been criminall, but for suffering themselves to be transported by a passion which is so delightfull to you? And if I dare speake what I thinke, I hold them lesse guilty then you. Both the one and the other have violated the Lawes imposed on them by nature, and engag'd themselves in passions which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve of. This is true: but they have this excuse so generally receiv'd, that youth and wisdome are incompatible: and (without a wonder) it is impossible to be young and not be amorous. Can you (Sir) justifie your errours by the same reasons? Are you young? Should not you be wise? Hely suffered him not to proceed, but interrupting him, Osmin (said he) the greatest part of humane actions are onely condemned for not being well knowne. You disallow of my intention because you are ignorant of it, you will approve of it assoone as I have disclosed it to you: object not to me neither my age, nor the judgements which your counsell hath made me give against my sons. You know that Abdelmelec is not in exile for loving Alcidiana, and that Nephisus is not in prison for being ingaged to the service of the Princesse of Tunis: and for your upbraiding me with mine age; I am so, but not so old by much as were our holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Mahomet and Hely, when they married their last wives. Know Osmin, know, that since my children are so great enemies to my Government and age, I ought to seek my preservation and support in some illustrious alliance. Heaven more carefull of my good then my selfe, hath miraculously sent me the Princesse Iphidamanta, to the end, that getting Polexander for my ally, I may be secured against all mine enemies. Osmin perceiving such strange alterations in Hely's minde; I confesse (repli'd he) these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons would not be very considerable if they were true. But how should it be possible for that man to thinke how to defend himselfe from the ambushes of his children, who by a pernicious indulgency hath alwayes cherish'd their ill nature, and hath himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to stab the steele into his brest? No, no, Sir, you doe not seeke for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming your authority by Polexander's alliance, but the satiating your voluptuousnesse in the enjoying his sister. This is too much for Osmin (quickly repli'd Hely) yet I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his boldnesse, but on condition he give a more favourable interpretation to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and (to take away his ill thoughts of me) that he shall himselfe be Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta's Guardian. Osmin perceiving his sharpnesse was unprofitable, resolv'd to be, no
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54727:191"/>
more so rigid to so little purpose: He took on him the charge of Iphidamanta, and sent for his wife, to the end the Princesse might be in unsuspected company. Assoone as she was come, Iphidamanta left her habite of Shepheardesse, but put not off her sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Some dayes after Hely returned towards Morocco, and before he went out of the Province of Sus, sent privately to the Governour of Taradant to set Nephisus at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. That Prince whom the prison had a little cool'd, presented himselfe to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for some fifteen dayes gave him so many causes of satisfaction, that the King forc'd by his nature, and blinded with his passion, discover'd to him the intent he had to give him a mother that by a just title should merit the surname of beautifull. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration wrought a great effect in the spirit of Nephisus, but it broke not out till some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time after. In the meane while Hely was no sooner entred Morocco with the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence of a victorious King, but he renounc'd all his glory to transferre it on Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta, and to make knowne to all his Subjects, that 'twas she who was truly victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and onely deserv'd the triumph. He received her, as such, in the most stately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment of the great Palace of Morocco, and gave to serve her all the officers, and white and blacke Eunuches, which were wont to waite on their Queens. Nephisus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enjoy'd his curiosity of seeing the Princesse; return'd, with an extreame desire of often visiting her, but Hely taking notice of it, became so jealous of him, and so furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that he was at the point of ruining Nephisus: yet his naturall debonairity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, he commanded Osmin to deny all men whatsoever the entrance into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidamanta's Palace; and himselfe forbad Nephisus. This prohibition caus'd fearfull disorders: in the meane time, Hely, in love with Iphidamenta even to folly, visited her punctually foure times a day, and though he could not o'recome her silence, nor stint her sadnesse, yet he promised himselfe the fruition of her. For her sake he viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Lawes of his Religion; he re-established the Idolatry which Mahomet had so rigorously forbidden, and sent as far as Italy for a Painter excellent enough to draw for him Iphidamanta's picture. One day, leading that Princesse into a marble Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net which is in the midst of the garden of flowers, he cast himselfe at her feet, and never blushing for Osmin's wife, being a witnesse of his extravagancy, It (said he) extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubles me that I am not able to offer to your incomparable vertue, but things so base and vile as are my Kingdomes and my life: But cast not your eyes (if you please) on the smalnesse of the offering, consider the heart and the humility of the offerer; and assure your selfe, that if he had in his hands all the Crownes of the world, he would lay them at your feet with the same zeale as he doth those of Fez and Morocco. Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta hearkned to this Speech as she was wont to heare some others, that is, without making shew of any aversion or content. These coldnesses yet added new flames to the Prince his former fire: the more he was neglected, the more amorous he grew, and the lesse progresse he made in his suite, the more happy successe he promised himselfe. Whilst he was in these meditations, the Painter (he had sent for) arriv'd out of Italy. Presently he would have him draw Iphidamanta's picture, to the end he might have the liberty of seeing her at all times, and in all places. But for all his extream desire to have it done, he was yet a long time before he could consent the Painter should see her: he call'd for him, and ask'd if he could not draw a face by the description should be made of it? The Painter answered as he ought to that demand; and to flatter Hely's malady, assur'd him, if he could but onely once cast his eyes on the face he would have portraied, he promised to perfect the rest by vertue of his imagination. Hely was a long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing with two so contrary necessities: at last, Love carried it from Jealousie. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to set his Painter on worke; but he had judgement and respect enough to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take nothing without Iphidamanta's leave. He therefore came and desired a permission to take her picture, but being absolutely denied it, he had recourse to the credit of Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's wife, who promis'd to obtaine what he desired, provided he left to her the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Iphidamanta's spirit. This promise restor'd to him all his lost joy, and kept him from further pressing the Princesse. Assoone as he was gone, Osmin himselfe used ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of reasons to win the Princesse to satisfie Hely. He advertised her, that her life and honour being in a manner in that Prince his power, 'twas not fit to discontent him for an indifferent matter. The Princesse perswaded by this, granted what Hely desired
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54727:191"/>
of her; but know said she to Osmin, it is to you I give my picture, and not to Hely, and remember (if you please) that this is the sole favour you must expect from my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousnesse. Osmin promised, never to importune her with ought that should be displeasing to her, and so went to Hely with these good newes. The King took the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was presented him, and after the observing a thousand ceremonies, (which, we must be in love, not to count ridiculous) he got Iphidamanta's picture. Assoone as he was possessed of that treasure, he forgot the care of his affaires, and neglected his owne preservation, to have his thoughts and eyes eternally fixed on that Copy, when he was not permitted to see the Originall. That continuall contemplation so increased his love, that it was impossible for him to deferre the accomplishing of it. Hee made knowne therefore, that without delay, he would declare Iphidamanta Queen of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco. Osmin confessed to my deare Master, 'twas not his fault that Hely had not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but knowing that Iphidamanta would resolve to die rather then to marry him, he tri'd if he could unblinde him: yet knowing, he was one that would be deceived, he laid before him, that the Princesse being as a Prisoner in his power, was not like, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably to entertaine his suite: that she could not beleeve his love was either true or just, since he treated her not as a free-woman, which is sought to by the wayes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but as a slave and vagabond whom no man feareth to outrage or ruine. Do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sir, (said he) remit Iphidamanta at liberty, send her with a great equipage to the King her brother, and chuse the principall of your Estate to accompany her, withall to demand her in marriage. Your counsell is very good (repli'd Hely) but my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not permit me to make use of it: make me any proposition, the most difficult, I will refuse none, provided, Iphidamanta stirre not hence. I am ready to send Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to Polexander, I will submit me to such references as the Canarian Princes have not even dar'd to promise themselves from the least of the African Kings. I will doe more, I will release to him all pretentions which the Kings of Morocco have to the Islands he hath conquer'd; and if he be not contented, let him chuse of my three crowns which he likes best, and I will give it him, so he grant me Iphidamanta. But that I should deprive my selfe of the felicity of seeing her, under an uncertaine hope of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; that I should put my selfe in jeopardy of losing a treasure already in my hands, and to exercise I know not what superfluous correspondency, that I should renounce es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall possessions and happinesse, tis that, which must never be expected from me: I will die before I be separated from Iphidamanta. But not to lose the time in fruitlesse contestations, this is my resolution: Arzilland as you know is ready to imbarke, for the conducting into Scotland the body of Spimantus, and to present it to his father. In his returne, I would have him goe to Polexander, and under pretext of visiting him from me, sift that Princes minde, speake wittily of the losse of his sister, and if he perceive in the King any disposition to heare him, he may let him know what is become of her, and what my intention is. Hely by this speech making knowne his minde to Osmin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded what his was. Osmin, seeing there was no remedy, and he could not help it, approv'd of the Kings resolution, and besought him in the meane while to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so towards her, that she might not have cause to beleeve her selfe a slave, nor to presse him for her departure. Hely, promising Osmin both, sent for Arzilland, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him full instructions, commanded he should set saile that very day. Arzilland no lesse expeditive then affectionate, obeyed his Master; but the revolutions which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his departure, gave him farre other thoughts then those he had at his setting forth. He was not got into Scotland, when Nephisus rekindling the fire of division which hee had a while kept as extinguish'd, made the King his father know, that he was able to dissemble though not to amend. He handled that good King more outrageously then he would a miserable slave; he accus'd him of ignorance, of folly, and even threatned to pluck out with his heart, that infamous passion which made him the laughter of his people. Hely as insensible of these injuries, made his excuses to Nephisus, besought him to heare his justifications, and almost asking him pardon for the others insolencies, gave him the boldnesse to continue them. That miscreant seeing his impiety to have so good successe; left Hely, got on horsebacke, and accompanied with his confederates, rode through all the streets of Morocco to raise the people. When he perceived that his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54727:192"/>
were powerfull over their mindes, but not sufficiently to make them revolt; he left the town and went to Abdelmelec who with a strong army had already violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seized on the Province of Hea. Hely thinking himselfe not safe enough in Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and not resolving on warre for feare of losing his Mistresse, had no sooner newes that the two Princes came by long journeys to besiege him, but he departed from Morocco with Iphidamanta, Osmin, his wife, and their domesticks, and in all haste came to the Fortresse of Guargetsem. There, as if he had been in the highest peace that could be, or had abjured all things but his love, he even forbad Osmin from speaking to him, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manner, about businesse; nor to trouble his repose with the fortune of an Estate which he abandon'd to the ambition of Sonnes. Osmin, affrighted with this command, was neither sufficiently coward nor traytor to obey him. He secretly sent for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Taradant, and besought him by the excellency of his vertue, and by his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour so often approv'd, to have pity on the Kings weaknesse and his countreys desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That Governour promis'd Osmin all that a man of honour should in such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but whilst he was in preparation, the two detestable Princes made themselves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the best townes, and found every where so little resistance, that they were at the gates of Guargetsem before the Governour of Taradant had time to assemble his friends or his troups. Hely, who passed his time altogether in idolatrizing Iphidamanta, and in promising her such Crowns as he had lost: was much astonished when the roaring of Cannons and the clamours of Souldiers told him aloud, what his most affectionate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants durst not whisper to him. Presently he ran to Iphidamanta, and casting himselfe at her feet: Would to heaven faire Princesse (said he) that I might by my death free you from the danger wherewithall you are threatned by my cruell and unnaturall Sonnes! You should see me run to it with joy, and voluntarily yeeld up what remaines of my life, for the ransome of your honour and liberty. But their abominable ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be no more glutted by my death, then it is by my Crownes. 'Tis your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they aime at, and the accursed Nephisus, will not thinke himselfe fully clear'd of those execrable vowes he hath made, if at once he commit not two of the greatest mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers can be imagined; I meane, if after his attempting on my life, he doe not the like on your honour. Iphidamanta, according to her custome, dissolv'd in tears whilst He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spoke to her; but at last urg'd by a just indigdation: It behov'd you then to have had more care of my liberty (repli'd she) when it was in your power: So would you not have been reduc'd, to give me now such vaine testimonies of your feare and weaknesse; but take no care for me, I know better then you how to prevent the villanies of your Sonnes. Hely stood wholly confounded with love and joy at those judicious words, and leaving Iphidamanta with Osmin's Lady, went to see whereto his enemies had brought him. Osmin followed, and charging him, but with silken words, (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for me to use the Court tearmes) with the irreparable faults his passion had made him commit, would have perswaded him to thinke on his safety whilst it was not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely desperate. Hely, stopping at that speech, There's an end of the matter (said he) I must die: Abdelmelec and Nephisus have too constant and assured an impiety to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise me the least good that can be. That very day they combin'd to make war with me, they resolv'd my death. Should I give into their hands all regall authority, and on the faith of a solemne Treaty open the gates of this fortresse: assure your selfe they would not be satisfied. They will have me end my miserable life by the most infamous tortures can be invented by their mercilesse impiety. But that which I more feare, is, they will expose Iphidamanta to such horrours, as the sole imagination of them kills me. I will therefore prevent all these disasters by a death which shall not be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Iphidamanta nor my selfe. With that he walked on, and ascended up a bulwarke from whence he might descry all his enemies camp. He knew the ill estate of the place he was in, and judg'd rightly by the advanced works and demolitions the Cannon made, that he had but a short time to live. He stood there above two houres, as if he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected some Cannon shot to finish all his disquiets by a faire death. But heaven which is alwayes indulgent to humane frailty, preserv'd that sacred head, and would not by a tragieall end, give his unnaturall children cause to glory in their wickednesse: nor yet would it absolutely preserve that drowsie and rest-loving Prince for feare he should ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54727:192"/>
lose himselfe in his remisnesse and too much insensibility. Osmin perceiving Helies intention, withdrew him against his will from the bulwarke, and trusting in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Taradants promise, assur'd him he should shortly have succour from whence he expected it not. Hely laughed at it, and as if he had knowne his approaching mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, staid at the foote of a towre which his enemies battered. A great part of it fell in that instant, and in such a manner, that without the particular providence of heaven, Hely and Osmin had beene orewhelm'd with the ruine.</p>
                  <p>Osmin was not hurt at all; but Hely scap'd not so cheape. He was struck downe and wounded in his head and many other parts of his body. Some of the garrison Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thinking he had beene slaine, drew him from under the rubbish and ruines of the towre, and carried him to his chamber. Assoone as the trusty Eunuch Atlas saw his Master in so ill plight, he ran to Iphidamanta, and melting into teares, Come (said he) and see to what point of mishap your beauty hath brought the best Prince of the world. Follow me Iphidamanta and try, at least by one teare, and one word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to witnesse to my Lord the King that you are sensible of his wounds. Iphidamanta was astonished at Atlas sad relation, and her naturall goodnesse making her forget all other consideration, she went with Osmins Lady to the Prince his chamber. Assoone as she came neere his bed, and that she saw him all bloudy, O heaven! (she cried) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittest thou thine owne lively image to be thus disfigured? Hely knowing her, stretch'd out his hand, and raysing himselfe a little; faire Princesse, (said he) since my life plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you not, let me know at least that my death is welcome unto you. Impute not to heaven nor to the inhumanity of my children the tragicall end of dayes. They have both, rather with pity then rigour, treated me as they have done, and death it selfe shews how pitifull she is, since it hath prevented the despaire and contempt whereinto your losse would infallibly have carried me. Give them thanks rather for being so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to your wishes, and for delivering you at last from that bondage which hath cost you so many teares. Farewell then faire Princesse, weepe no more, if you desire not to afflict me at mine end. Rather by a pleasant countenance signifie to me, that you take my death as a favour. I will even hasten it, if you desire it. But whilst I seeke for comfort in my misery, I forget the care I should take for your preservation. Goe, and make ready for your departure. Get you quickly out of a place which will soone be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with your greatest enemies. Intreat Osmin (as I doe with my heart) that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake you not; in the meane while I will beseech Heaven with all the zeale I can, that you may be as faithfully beloved, and (if I dare say so) as religiously ador'd by him that must enjoy you, as you have alwayes beene by the most unfortunate Hely. Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta had not fail'd answering him, but that she was hindred by fearefull cries, noise of armour, and the affright given her by a great many Souldiers who with their Symeters in their hands confusedly entred the Court of the fortresse. Hely seeing her so much amazed, and hearing withall the shouts of the victorious Souldiers, Flie (cried he, dying as he was) flie faire Princesse, and stay not till you are in the pawes of the Lion that will devoure you. And thou Osmin (said he) if thou hast ever lov'd me, and if the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection I have borne thee deserves any acknowledgement, save the best part of my self, and suffer not base feare to make me dye more cruelly then can all the barbarousnesse of my two Sons. Osmin hearing himselfe so exceedingly conjur'd not to abandon the Princesse in that extremitie, withdrew her from the Kings chamber, and running to his lodgings for some of his slaves, and what he had of most value, descended by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate staire to the foote of the rock, and with his little company entred into a Barke which the Governours of Guargetsem alwaies used to keepe there, for any urgent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie. All things favoured their flight. The tumult and confusion which alwaies accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth the taking of places, the calme which could not be fairer, &amp; the night approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conspir'd together for those innocents safetie, and drew them from the sight and furie of Nephisus. Osmin put his hand to the oare, and in the night time got to certaine high rocks (farre enough from Guarguetsem) which might have serv'd them for a safe retreate. He was not long there, for a Merchant of Madera being driven on the same place, tooke him into his ship with his companie, and promis'd to waft him into the Isle of Teneriffe, or any other of the Canaries. Osmin having thus recounted to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54727:193"/>
Prince Almanzor Iphidamanta's adventures; You have understood my Lord (said he) that the Madera Merchant could not performe what he promis'd us, for when we had beene a while under saile, a tempest arose and cast us on the coast of Guinea. I must confesse (said Almanzor then to Osmin) you have related to me strange adventures; yet is not my curiosity absolutely satisfied. You have not told me how Iphidamanta was stolne from the place of her abode, who that Tyrant was out of whose hands Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus vaunted he had redeem'd her, nor by whàt accident the two vessels were fired. My Lord (replid Osmin) I have had the same desire, as you, and cannot yet get any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction. Onely I will tell you, that the Princesse seeing her selfe voyd of all protection but mine, threw her at both our feets, and besought me and my wife to take her for our daughter, to conceale the truth of her birth, and in stead of the name of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phidamant a which was not hers, to call her Axiamira. There now remaines nothing for me, but to petition you, for that Princesse sake, to let her perceive nothing of what you know, and to actuate all that honour and love shall advise you to give a glorious issue to her long wandrings. Father (said Almanzor imbracing Osmin) I will strive to performe what you injoyne me, and if it be not that you should have a good opinion of me; be assur'd, you shall never repent your confidence of my discretion. After these promises he dismissed him; and remaining alone to give himselfe wholly over to his owne contentment, and to be overcome by those transports which the excesse of his good fortune brought on him: he tasted (the remainder of that day) more sweets, and resented more ravishing joyes by the strength of his imagination, then he will ever meet withall againe, either by the knowledge of his parents, the conquest of all the Empires of the world, or the very possession of Axiamira. He himselfe hath confessed to me that which I tell you, and having laid before me all the faire chymeraes which in that happy time had passed through his fancy: Almaid, (said he to me) what felicity can there be compar'd to mine, if by the number of my exploits, and by the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of my faith I be able to oblige Iphidamanta to the not disdaining my humblest servitude? O how capable doe I finde my selfe of the most honourable and difficult en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises! How doth the elevated birth of that Princesse raise my thoughts beyond or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary conceptions! How am I asham'd that I have done no more since I knew the world! How powerfull a spurre to honour is the desire of making me worthy Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta's esteeme! And what emulation and disquiet do Polexanders famous acts (which are still before mine eyes) bring upon me! I will follow his steps, Almaid. I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take something great enough, to the end I may without impudency make knowne mine affection to Iphidamanta, and at least give an honourable pretext to my boldnesse. I should trouble you brave Knight did I repeate all the brave words so faire a passion put into the mouth of Almanzor. Assoone as Andromeda was come from the place of her retirement, that Prince went to visit Axiamira, and inventing new humilities to come worthily neere her; I wonder much (said he) that the Deity with whom you have so privately communed these foure dayes, could be wonne or resolve to let you goe out of his temple. 'Tis true, (replied Axiamira) my returne is a just cause of wonder. The sanctity of the place whence I come, the authority of the Deity which inhabits it, and the example of so many religious soules which burne with love, should for ever have made me renounce the company of the world. But alas! my weakenesse hath been stronger then all those powers, and I have found my selfe so incapable of so high a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that I should thinke I had more ambition then zeale, if I durst onely pretend to it. You are a very unjust Interpreter, (said Almanzor) pardon me Madam if I speake to you with so little respect. You give my words a cleane contrary sense to my intention. You accuse your selfe for not being devout enough; and I accus'd the god with whom you were so long, for not being sensible enough. Truely I cannot conceive how that Deity who hath perceptions and penetrations farre beyond those of men, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence sees in you those beauties which are conceal'd from us; such perfections, as we cannot discover, and such brightnesse as our too weak and dull eyes cannot perceive, hath not reserv'd to himselfe a wonder which of all those that are visible comes neerest to it selfe. Give me leave (replied the Princesse) to aske, whether you thinke well on what you say; and whether you be not more unjust then I to jeast so, either with the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54727:193"/>
gods or with a miserable maiden. Almanzor blush'd as fire at Axiamira's reply, and was about committing new impieties to justifie the former, when Andromeda inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his designe, and made him change his discourse for others lesse serious, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all more pleasant. A few dayes after were seen some ships on the coast of Benin, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the newes to Abrinzias; Almanzor who would fai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne doe somewhat of worth in the sight of Axiamira, ask'd the Kings leave to goe and see what they were. He had his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest granted, and was so happy in his voyage, that he burnt two of the ships which he knew were Pirates, and in spight of all the resistance of many determinate Souldiers, brought two more away with him into the River of Benin. But what a jealousie did this bold attempt throw on Fortune, and how unhappy was that Prince for doing more then men should doe? The very night after this audacious Enterprise, the Pirates lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and not content with robbing the Countrey, dar'd even set on the royall Palace. Almanzor who well expected this revenge, sallied on the Rovers, and followed with all the bravest men about him, drove them backe into their ships. At his departure he left the Court much troubled, and at his returne he found it in a generall desolation. Osmin and his Lady, tearing their haire, and scratching their faces, cast themselves at his feet when he entred the Palace; and told him, the Pirates had stolne away Axiamira. At those words, Almanzor strucken as with a thunder-bolt, was like to have fallen downe dead, so quick was his resentment of that lamentable accident. O that I were but able to represent to you the excesse of his sorrow, and relate his pitifull words by which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a part of it! I should inforce you to bewaile him; and your generousnesse win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you to beare a part in his sufferings, would make you as much afflicted as he was at that fatall instant. After he had grieved even beyond what passion permits, he took Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min by the arme, and commanding Hydaspes and my selfe to come neere: I will (said he) have you two to be witnesses of the promise I make this good old man, to the end, that if I happen to faile in it, he may use you against me, and call you to avenge the wrong he shall receive by my faithlesnesse: after hee had spoke thus to us, hee turn'd him towards Osmin, and lifting his eyes to the Moone which was then at full: I sweare (said he) by this Starre which is no lesse venerable to me then the Sunne; not to see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the King or Queen, not to set foot in my native Countrey, and never to give rest to my minde, not truce to my afflictions, nor intermission to my journeying, till I have restor'd to you that treasure I have made you lose. I hope, sooner or later, to discover the forcible takers away of Iphidamanta; and then woe shall betide him who hath had any hand in this attempt. The power of the whole earth shall not protect them against my indignation. What e're they be, they shall fail under my vengefull arme, and if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander himselfe had enterpris'd it, he should have felt, that a just sorrow can give to the most weake, a strength sufficient to conquer the most invincible. After this speech, he tooke me by the hand, and intreating me to yeeld him that proofe of my affection: Almaid (said he) stay you here, and intimate to the King the resolution I have taken. I recommend not to him either Osmin or his Lady, because he is none of those Princes whose languishing vertues require to be often solicited to keep them in agitation. He had no sooner ended, but he hastned with Hydaspes and his other servants to the place where the night before he had left his ships. In the best of them he imbark'd, and as if his eyes had been blindfolded as well as the god that led him to those high resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he cast him selfe into danger without taking notice of it, and with one sole ship would have gone and assail'd the Pirates fleet. Hydaspes, as valiant (or to say truer) as rash as he is, could not but be afraid of his Master's desperatenesse, and loath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to his losse, There is (said he) neither courage nor honour in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> enterprise so out of all appearance. The best successe you can expect in it, is to die infamously by the hand of some one of those theeves, or to end your life in their slaves fetters. Almanzor laugh'd at Hydaspes remonstrance, and letting him know the greatnesse of his courage for bad him to lend an eare to it; Take notice (said he) that the greatest part of our adventures are so many miracles; and most commonly those have best successe which are most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst humane reason and providence. I confesse to measure things by the rules of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wisdome, it were not onely rashnesse but likewise rage, with a handfull of men to offer to fight with an army. But you see not that which the eternall Providence keeps
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54727:194"/>
hidden under that temerity; and if I be not deceiv'd, it will betide, that of all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards we have run, this will be the lesse dangerous. This speech shut Hydaspes mouth, and made him expect some favourable prodigy from that Divinity in whom Almanzor seem'd to put all his confidence; surely he was not deceiv'd. A few dayes after he put to sea, a tempest which in all likelihood should have been his destruction, was the cause of his safety. For the Pirates fleet being separated by the storme, he met with the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall's ship farre distant from all the rest; and knowing her, set on her with such a fury, that he forc'd her to lay him aboard to avoid the sinking by his artillery. It was then, there began a fight as bloudy and obstinate as ever was seen on the Ocean. Both parts gave over all fiery offences, and those which are not dangerous but when they are cast from afarre off. Every one took his Simeter, or Battleaxe, and the desire of vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being equall on both sides, made them alike forget the care of their preservation. That day Almanzor surmounted himselfe, and did such wonderfull acts of valour, as I intend not to perswade you to credit, since I can very hardly beleeve them my selfe. After he had made him a bloudy way in the Pirates vessell, he forc'd upright to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and plucking from him Hydaspes whom he had laid at his feet: 'Tis (said he) against me thou ought'st turne thy armes, since 'twas I onely who made my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons resolve to assaile thee. The Generall sparkling fire from his eyes, repli'd; And thou, but not thou alone shalt from my hand receive the just chastisement for thy rashnesse. These bold words were seconded by effects no lesse haughty. Almanzor first strooke his enemy, and charg'd him with so much vigour and quicknesse, that he scarce gave him leasure to put by, or avenge himselfe. Yet did he what a valiant man could, and gave not ground till his Symiter was broken, and weakened by the losse of almost all his bloud he could not possibly stand longer. He was no sooner fallen, but Almanzor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering his Symeter to his throat, Thou shalt dye (said he) unlesse thou restore me the Princesse thou hast stolne. The Rover making shew that that speech was more deadly to him then all his words: Do not (said he to Almanzor) abuse thy victory, but know that scoffing and jeering never well became the mouth of a Conquerour. I confesse, the desire of getting that Princesse of whom thou speakest, hath brought me from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco to Benin, but that designe hath not prosper'd; and I acknowledge now that wicked projects, sooner or later, have but unfortunate events. I feele, I feele the blow wherewith I was long since threatned. My crimes have exhausted all the patience of heaven, and by a just retribution, I meet with a violent death, that so I may be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily chastis'd for so many murthers which my command hath committed, though my hand hath not beene able to execute them. The Pirates Speech so sensibly touched Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor, that changing in an instant from an irreconcilable enemy, to a pitifull Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter: Hope better (said he) from the bounty of heaven, and since it hath brought you to repent you of your former life, doubt not but it hath in store a better for you. You shall live for its glory and the example of others of your condition. But let not your repentance be imperfect. Be sorrowfull for offending without cause the Prince of Benin. I sweare (repli'd the Pirate) by that just avenging Deity whose hand i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> now heavy upon me, that I know not, where the Princesse Iphidamanta is: and I die with more griefe to lose her for ever, then to lose the light of day. With those words hee gave up the ghost, and left Almanzor so extreamely afflicted, that his victory went neere to have beene very dismall to him. For the Pirates seeing their Generall dead, (in lieu of losing courage as men of warre usually doe in like occasions) shewed themselves more hardy and furious then before. They rushed all at once on Almanzor, and if the necessity of defending himselfe had not drawne him from his dangerous compassion, he had run the hazard of accompanying the vanquish'd Rover. He then turn'd head on the Pirates, he drove them back, he pierc'd them, he dispers'd them, and by his terrible blows inforc'd them to have recourse to that goodnesse which a little before they had despised. Almanzor receiv'd them to mercy, and stopping his Souldiers fury, My Companions (said he to them) 'tis enough that we have brought our enemies to aske their lives. Let us use them so as they may be bound to esteeme us as milde to those which yeeld, as we are redoubtfull to such as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54727:194"/>
resist us. The Pirates ravish'd at Almanzorse xceeding generosity, as much as they had bin terrified by his in comparable valour, threw their weapons &amp; turbants at his feet, and as if they had now a time to accord their desires with their thoughts; Fill (cried they all to gether) the place which Nephisus hath left empty by his death! The name of Nephisus strook Almanzor to the heart, and won him to grant the Rovers what they desired, only to cleer such doubts as they had cast into his minde. Seeing therefore so great an union where a little before there was so great contrariety; and so profound a peace where so much war had bin kindled; First of all (said he to them) I desire to know whence your Generall was, &amp; what is become of the Princesse he stole from the Court of Benin. One of the Pirates speaking for all, I know (said he) better then my companions, the reason of your demands, and I can better then they satisfie you in them both. Know (said he further, sighing) that the unfortunate Nephisus whom you see dead at your feet, is the same Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisus who for the beginning of his miseries, felt in the Prince his brothers Turney, that your pastimes &amp; diversions are dreadfull. 'Tis the same Nephisus who following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of his naturall ambition, and the passions of the King his father's enemies, violated the most sanctified Lawes, and wrong'd a goodnesse which had never parallel. 'Tis that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisus who failing in his faith to the Princesse of Tunis, and of his duty to the good He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, would have ravish'd Iphidamanta from him, and besieg'd him in a Fortresse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he was retir'd with her. In summe, 'tis the same Nephisus, who thinking himselfe by his taking that place not onely master of his fathers life, but possessor of his Crowne and of Iphidamanta; saw himselfe compell'd to abandon his defeated army, to fly out of his fathers territories, and (that he might have a refuge) to implore the assistance and protection of those, who now demand yours. I beleeve (my Lord) these generall things will be sufficient to satisfie part of your curiosity; for the rest, this is all the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation we can now give you. When Nephisus left the Pirates Island for the stealing or forcing away of Iphidamanta, he chose for companions of his fortune, two of his most resolute Captaines; the one was called Thalemut, and the other Achain. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd him to throw themselves into Abrinzias Palace in two places which they knew, and to take thence Iphidamanra whilst with his troupe he amused another where that Kings gard was. They executed what they had promis'd; but Nephisus being constrained to retire to his ships sooner then they had agreed upon together, neither met with Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemut nor Achain. A tempest presently arose, and our vessels were so dispers'd, that this unfortunate Prince never heard since what was become of those two Captaines. If you please I may have leave to tell you my opinion; I thinke that Thalemut and Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are certainly retir'd into their Island, and carried the Princesse along with them. Quoth Almanzor, that which you have told me, fills me with astonishment, and gives me a great deale of satisfaction. But I should have all I desire, if you would instruct me what course I should steere to get to that fatall Island. The Pirates who were about him, spoke all at once, and offered not onely to conduct him thither, but also to cause Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damanta to be restor'd to him, if so be she were in the hands of any of their Captains. Almanzor imbrac'd them all one after another, to thanke them for a promise that was so pleasing to him; and in recompence, told them he would (if they thought them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy) fill Nephisus place, and give them a Generall as affectionate as he, if he did not give them one as valiant. The Pirates taking him at his word, forgot their pass'd losses by the gaine they had in him, and betooke them to the course which their former combate had put them farre from. Almanzor, commanding his Mariners to follow him, abode in the Pirates vessell, and was compell'd to suspend his melancholy, and accommodate himselfe to their brutish manner of life. Fortune seconded his designes, and to give them a more happy beginning, presented him a faire occasion to gaine the love of the Pirates: for the day after he was imbark'd with them, he met with foure saile of their companions, fighting with twelve Gallions or Spanish ships. He not onely dis-ingag'd them, but tooke two Gallions loaden with gold from the new World, and by that Prize which he gave wholly to the Pirates, so absolutely wonne them; that the last, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the election of the first, proclaim'd him their Head, and bound themselves to make all the rest consent to it. With this resolution they kept on their voyage, and as they met their companions, made knowne to them Nephisus death; and extolling the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54727:195"/>
valour and liberality of Almanzor, dispos'd them to receive him for their Generall. In a little time Almanzor understood the humours of his new Subjects: he knew how to handle them with such dexterity, and propose to them such enterprises conformable to their wishes, that they bless'd the day of his victory, and promis'd to themselves under so valiant a Commander, to become Kings of the Ocean. A few dayes after they arriv'd at their Island, and in the haven met with Achain, who after his escaping many great dangers both by land and sea, was at last got home to his accustomed Sanctuary. The Pirates who were with Almanzor made shew to him of their true affection by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency of understanding from Achain, what he had done with the Princesse Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta. Eight or ten of the most remarkeable went aboard him, and so dilated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the praise of my deare Master, that if the death of Nephisus, and the taking of the Spanish Gallions had not serv'd them for more irreproachable witnesses, the severe Achain had punished them as traitors to their Generall, and abandoners of their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. But being wonne (as well as the rest) by Almanzor's noblenesse and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull deeds of armes, he came to him, and making to him (with all the necessary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) an oath of fidelity: The obedience (said he) I owe thee now, obligeth me to declare to thee the successe of the voyage which our late Generall made us undertake. And to tell it thee in few words, thou maist know, Thalemut and my selfe assaulted the King of Benin's palace, and forc'd it in the spight of al resistance: he that was our guide in that businesse, was deceiv'd when we were to be brought by him to Iphidamanta's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and having made us breake open foure or five without finding her, stole from us for feare of Thalemut who had threatned to strangle him. We gave not over the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting what we had begun, for Thalemut searching on one part and I on the other, we at last found what we sought for. Thalemut had much adoe to make himselfe master of the chamber where the Princesse was; the doore being defended by five or six vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant men, with so much obstinacy, that he could not get entrance till he had killed them all. Thalemut who never much studied civility, tooke Iphidamanta rudely enough, and never mov'd with her teares or intreaties, carried her out of the palace, and whilst I made good the place to stop those that pursu'd him, he brought her to his ship. I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently retreated, and set saile after him, but the tempest which befell at day-breake se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd us, so that since then we met not. Be then assured, that if Thalemut be not ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracked he will be quickly here. But I advise thee, to receive the command which I and my fellowes offer thee; for never hope to get Iphidamanta out of Thalemut's hands, if it be not by the quality of our Generall. For as such, thou mayest absolutely dispose of us, and all we have, and not being so, thou canst not avoid that hard necessity whereto all those are reduced, whom the chance of warre throwes into our hands. Here Achain was silent, after he had made knowne to Almanzor that he must resolve either to take on him the Generall-ship of the Pirates, or for ever lose the hope of regaining Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manta. He therefore got into the midst of them, and when he saw they were all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive; Yes my friends (said he aloud) I here fully declare my selfe, and will satisfie the common desire of so many valiant men as you are. After this Declaration, he drew his sword, and holding it aloft to be seene of all the assembly, he thus continued his speech: I accept (more willingly then I would a Crowne) the title of your Generall, and solemnely sweare by this sword, which hath atchiev'd me some name in the world, that hence forward it shall not be imployed but for your defence and benefit. I desire but one thing, and 'tis that you promise me to live as adventurers which seeke their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and advantages of warre with the hazard of their lives: That you shall make a just warre with your enemies: That you shall not assault such as cannot defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: That you shall not use as slaves, such prisoners of war as would ransome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And above all, that you renounce that brutish delight of forcing and stealing away virgins, to which Nephisus sensuality had engag'd you against your owne intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Assoone as Almanzor had made an end, there was a deafe noise among all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, and the muttering of voyces having long continued, (to witnesse the repugnancy the Pirates had to those Lawes) it ended in a deep silence. Almanzor, who would faine winne so much from them, that nothing infamous might be intermixed with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious story of his life, thought, that to bring them to it, something extraordinary must
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54727:195"/>
be promised them. He therefore began againe, and by his countenance shewing the constancy of his minde; Promise me boldly (said he) such things as cannot but be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous unto you; for my part, I oblige my selfe to lay before you as a prey all the riches of Europe and Africa, to make you considerable with the greatest Princes; and to make you dispute fame and potency with the most flourishing Kingdomes. These promises calm'd all the stormes which troubled the Pirates mindes. They cried out all, they would observe Almanzors lawes, and confirming their promises by an infinite number of extravagant actions, proclaim'd that Prince (the third time) chiefe and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of all the Pirates. Presently they plac'd him on a Buckler, and eight or ten lifting him up into the ayre, shew'd him to all the Assembly, and so carried him to the Fortresse. The acclamations, the bonfires, and other liberties were the publique wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Rovers satisfaction. But Almanzor was insensible of all these honours done him, and fearing all dangers and sholes in the sea, absolutely despair'd of Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemuts returne. Neverthelesse within a few dayes after he came in, and knowing well Almanzors valour, he not onely consented to their Election, but well weeting how impatiently he was expected by the Generall he went to him with his prize. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coasted him after his wonted fashion, and presently falling to matters more essentiall: I cannot (said he) yeeld thee a greater proofe of my allowance of their choise then by offering thee this prisoner. Imagine the transport of my deare Master, in seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so neere that Princesse for whose sake he had expos'd himselfe to so many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: but his affliction was farre greater, when Thalemut had taken off the vaile where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she was covered, and made knowne to the Prince so much transported with joy that he had no cause at all for it. In effect it was not Iphidamanta, but (as Almanzor understood from her owne mouth) an Egyptian whom Perseus had gotten from some Ethiopian Merchants. Certainly he was like to have died with griefe for seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so farre from his hopes; and but for the power which Hydaspes had over his thoughts to divert his tragicall resolution. Iphidamanta had in lesse then one month stuck a ponyard in the brests of two of the most famousest Princes of Africa. I could now relate to you all the brave actions done by Almanzor since he was Generall of the Pirates, tell you of the laudable alterations hee hath brought in their Common-wealth, and the important Services he hath done the ingratefull Zabaim since the Pirates changed his name from Almanzor to Bajazet. Polexander breaking out at the name of Bajazet; Ah Almaid (said he) how cruell hast thou beene in concealing from me so long, that, whose knowledge would have been so acceptable to me? Why then, your Almanzor is that generous Bajazet, who by his incomparable vertues and g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>atnesse of his courage having of a Society of theeves created a lawfull Common-wealth, governes with so much Justice and magnificence, that his quality deserves the envy of all the Princes in the world. After thus much, he turned to Almanzaira, &amp; continuing his Speech: Madam, (said he) what great cause have you to rejoyce in the midst of your ill fortune, if Bajazet prove to be your Almanzor? Almanzaira looking on him with a pleasing countenance; I confesse, (replied she) without this comfort which betides me at that time when my miseries seem'd to me at the worst and desperate, Zelopa's cruelty had beene long since satiated. Knight (said Almaid to Polexander) you knowing Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet as your discourse informes me, I have nought else to relate further, but what I have done since his command forc'd me to leave him: I went to Abrinzias and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda assoone as he was gone and declaring his resolution, I staggered that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full constancy wherewithall they were wont to receive the stroakes of fortune: They both complain'd of Almanzors vehemency of courage rather then of himselfe, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently resigning themselves to the will of heaven, which with so much ardour they lov'd, and with so much respect ador'd: Almanzor (said they to me) hath given credit to a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and an age, which most commonly are very ill Counsellours. But we hope the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnesse of heaven will have compassion on that Prince; and having already drawne him out of so many dangers, it will not abandon him in those whereunto he hath so inconsiderately cast himselfe. When those good Princes had said thus: I told them my thoughts; and the next day (taking my leave of them) I besought them in Almanzors name, to continue to Osmin and his Lady the good entertainement they
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54727:196"/>
had begun to give them. The same day I imbark'd me in that vessell which brought me out of Portugall; and after a long voyage by Sea to hearken after my deare Master, I was so fortunate as to finde him in his Island, where he liv'd in continuall melancholy for his losse of Iphidamanta, and was preparing with his fleet to search and inquire a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ter her in all the parts of Africa. After I had beene a while with him, I resolv'd to returne to Senega to hearken after Zabaim, and redeeme the Queene from her long captivity. That voyage I perform'd so fortunately, that I arriv'd at Melly, in a time when Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaira's Guardian could no longer keepe her. The Queene hath recounted to you how I got her out of the hands of her enemies; and how, by a feigned death preventing her true one, I brought her into the Island where you found her. Thus ended Almaid the pleasant recitall of those Princes adventures, and left Polexander in such meditations, as wholly taking him up, would neither permit him to thanke the Relator, nor yet make shew of his admiration.</p>

The calme therefore giving place to a more favourable season, the vertuous Queene's ship was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from North Southerly with a great speed, and the third day entred a Gulfe, made by two overtures, through which the river of Senega emptieth it selfe into the Sea. Almanzaira troubled with hope and feare, every moment changed countenance, and shewing the love she bore her husband, by her trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings and disquiets, oftentimes question'd Almaid of such things as he could not reply to: and sometimes holding her eyes fix'd on Polexander, My deare deliverer (said she) I begin to doubr of those things which your presence hath made me hitherto hold for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; and feare lest I come too late to restore the unfortunate Almanzaira to her deare Zabaim. Put out of your thoughts Madam (repli'd Polexander) such thoughts as proceed from nothing, but the long custome of your hoping for nothing. Zabaim lives yet, or to say better, Zabaim is no more; and in lieu of him you shall finde that faire and generous Palmira, who neither feared the severity of the King your father, nor the rigour of your Countreys Lawes, nor death it selfe, to merit the honour of entring the prison whereinto you were shut. Almanzaira sighing to remember her former felicities; That pleasant time (said she to Polexander) is for ever slid away: it will no more returne then my youth; nor doe I wish for it, but onely that I might once againe enjoy the sight of my deare Lord, and not be altogether unpleasing unto him. Whilst they thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd themselves, their ship floated up the river of Senega with the tide, and flew (as I may say) so swiftly, that in lesse then foure and twenty houres, it came within sight of that stately City which hath given name to all the Province of Senega. Night was far come on when Almanzaira, Polexander, Almaid, and their people went a shore. They fail'd not to make an end of their voyage; and that which made them most desire it, was a great light, which flying high in the aire above the walls of Senega, made the City seeme as it had been all on fire. When they came to the gates, they found them open, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when they were come in, that there was as much people stirring in the streetes, as it had been mid-day. Some stood in one place as amated with griefe, others walked along in a slow pace, as expressing the excesse of their sadnesse; and all by their sighes and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations said, there had some mournefull and dismall chance betided in their City. Almanzaira having cross'd many streets, and finding her selfe weary (yet lesse of her way then of her feare) set her downe on the staire of a Pyramis which was in the midst of a crosse-way, and besought Polexander to send some one so farre as into the Palace Court to learne the newes. Almaid would needs goe himselfe, and according to his manner (that is very wisely and promptly) did what the Queen desir'd, and returned to her. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54727:197"/>
(said he) I doe not thinke you can credit what I have to tell you; for mine owne, I confesse, I do not: yet have I not this newes from two or three, but from above a hundred Citizens, and even the Courtiers confirm'd it to me. Almanzaira trembling, intreated him to put her out of her paine, and tell her what those incredible things were. Since 'tis your pleasure (repli'd Almaid) I will satisfie your Majesties command. Know then that the King seeing Zelopa dead, carried her body into one of the garden Pavillions, and there abode many dayes, not to be gotten away, either by the remonstrances of his chief Officers, or the stench of that carion. The high Prelates and Priests of Mahomet, the Muhazzimins which vaunt the commanding of Spirits, and the Interpreters of the Law of Eshari, being advertised of this prodigy, assembled in their Temples, there made their publike prayers, and then came to the Palace to try by their exorcismes to vanquish the power of the Devills. In came they to the King, and the noysomnesse proceeding from Zelopa's corps assoone drove them out againe. The Calif, Sensul, Maharif, who pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for a Saint in his Religion, spight of all the stench, entred the chamber, and found the King glew'd on the mouth of that miserable carion. Transported with a just fury, and a more ardent zeale, he tooke Zelopa by one arme with an intent to plucke her off the bed where she lay. Zabaim rose up in choler, and rudely thrust off the Calif; who persevering in his charity, told the King the horrible estate of his soule, and drew againe Zelopa's corps with an intent to throw it out at window. The King oppos'd him the second time with fearfull threatnings, but the holy man would not give over; yet having not strength enough to resist Zabaim, he fell, and in falling pluck'd with him a Ring that was upon one of the Sorceresse fingers. Attend to, Madam, (if you please) a thing which is not credible: Assoone as the Ring was from any touch of the body, the King made a wonderfull outcry, and fell into so long a swoune, that they had time to carry him into his chamber; and to cause that carion to be dragg'd to the common Laystall of the town. All the rest of that day, they held him for dead, so was he watch'd all the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all the Priests abiding in prayers about him, deplor'd his mishap, and implor'd the assistance of heaven and Mahomet. At breake of day Zabaim recover'd, and casting himselfe out of his bed as one furious, began to run about the chamber, tore all he had on, and cry'd he was all on fire. The Muhazzimins made their conjurations, staid him, and taming his fury by vertue of their charmes, declar'd aloud, that the Spirit which tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Prince, was of the first Order. In the meane while the Gentlemen of the Kings chamber, got him againe into his bed, and by direction from the Priests, took off a little golden boxe which hung about his necke. In taking of which away, all the force of characters and command the Spirits had over Zabaim, ended. He knew and wondred at himselfe, remembred all he had done since your banishment, lamented yours and your sonnes death, and melting into teares at the remembrance of his faults; Zelopa, miserable Zelopa, cry'd he, into what fearfull offences hast thou hurried my unhappy Spirit? His Priests comforted him as well as they could; but he growing desperate, cry'd out, 'Tis resolved on; there is no pardon for me: for that pity which you say is infinite, should be more unjust, if by an eternall chastisement it did not avenge the innocent bloud I have shed. His Priests hearing that blasphemy, forbad him to speake, by the power which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet had given them; and moystning his hands with their tears: Sonne (said they with a great deale of affection) acknowledge by your despaire the malice of that enemy to whom you have given your selfe over. After he had cast you downe the precipice, he would keep you from rising againe. The blasphemies you utter, are his artifices he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to hold you for ever under his tyranny. He hath not left you but outwardly: he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernes yet within, and heaven suffers it, to chastise you for your long obduratenesse. The Priests have not since that time given over to exhort him thus, and otherwise. I have heard, that in shew Zabaim beleeves them and followes their admonitions; but in effect, every one holds, that he persevers in his despaire, and if he be not carefully look'd after, will quickly follow his wives and childrens destiny. Almanzaira, sighing to heare these strange accidents; Have not you (said she) learnt what the cause is of these peoples going up and downe? That's it I have yet to tell you Madam, repli'd Almaid. Zabaim, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to give you your last rites, and to witnesse publikely his resentment for so great a losse, hath given command to all the inhabitants of this City, to kindle fires, to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54727:197"/>
in all the Temples, and to pray for the rest of your soule, whilst himselfe and all his Court shall be shut up in the principall Mosquy for the same effect. I ask'd, why this solemnity was done by night, and I was answered, Zabaim had sworne never to see the day more, nor the Sunne; and that indeed the windows of his chamber were alwayes shut, and that he would not indure any other light (since he came to his senses) then that of candles and torches. Almanzaira sigh'd againe at this pitifull relation, and arising even quell'd with sorrow: Let us goe (said she) to Polexander, and free the King of this anguish. The Prince confirm'd her in the resolution, and got her to walke apace to have the better meanes to enter the Temple before Zabaim came. She got in among the croud, and Polexander with the rest followed her, and rank'd themselves in a place where they might be conceal'd. 'Tis true the Mosquy was so full of lights, that but for the blackes wherewithal it was hung from the high vaults to the feet of the pillars they had infallibly been knowne. Assoone as the King came they began their prayers, and Almanzaira, all alive, seeing her funeralls perform'd, and notwithstanding Mahomets forbidding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such honours as are reserv'd for men onely, wept as much for joy as griefe, and even ravish'd to see how deare her memory was to Zabaim. When the prayers were ended, Zabaim arose from his place (as pale and wan as he had been ready to give up the ghost) and made a signe that he would speake. Presently there was a great silence, and the Prince beginning his speech with teares, continued with these words: I should rather let you know by the effusion of my bloud then my teares how guilty I am. All that former ages have seen of cruelty, of barbarisme, of inhumanity, cannot parallel but the least part of my actions. I have violated all manner of Lawes: I have by execrable courses blotted out the Character which heaven had imprinted on my brow, and the Majesty of Kings which hath been hitherto the love and safety of all Nations, is become, by being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to me, the terrour of Innocents, and abomination of all men. 'Twas I, my friends, 'twas I, who thrust the sword into the bosome of the incomparable Almanzaira. I am the unnaturall father who consented to the death of him to whom I gave life. Yes, I have depriv'd you of your legitimate Prince: I pluck'd him out of his Nurses armes, and to glut the ambition of a wicked woman, have not trembled to abandon that Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the outrages of fortune. Had I alone contributed to his birth, as I have to his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, I would esteeme you happy in being delivered from the race of such a monster as I. But alas! Almanzaira gave him you, and you beleeve as well as my selfe, she being the perfect rendezvous of all royall vertues, could produce nothing but what was worthy to governe. Lament therefore and bewaile that great losse: make the Author of your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes feele your just anger. Remember how dearly Almanzaira lov'd you, and suffer not her executioner to be any longer your master. At that word Zabaim was constrained to stop, because his weaknesse being neither answerable to the vehemency of his action, nor the excesse of his griefe, he stood suddenly without voyce or motion. This accident causing a great trouble among the people, every one arose to help the Prince, and the noise increasing with the opinion they had of his death, Almanzaira left her place, and thrusting her selfe in amongst the prease, without any other consideration then to get neere the King, made so good shift, that she came close to the Kings throne when he came out of his faintnesse. Every body seeing him recover'd, tooke their places againe, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira hiding her selfe behinde some of the Guard, would attend till her Lord descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to cast her self at his feet. He in the meane time all dying and wet with teares: What my friends (said he) have you no resentment? Will you let me live since Almanzaira is dead? She is not (cry'd out the Queene) breaking forth from behinde those which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred her from being seen: she is not; for heaven would not suffer her to be so soon depriv'd of her Lord. Zabaim affrighted to heare that voyce, and to see a woman come creeping on her knees towards him, arose from his chaire, and presently fell backe againe, and there lay long without stirring. In the meane while, those who were neerest the King, look'd on Almanzaira, and knew her, though she seem'd to them much chang'd, and ask'd one another, if what they saw, were not some new inchantment of Zelopa. Whilst Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim came out of his insensibility, and that all the world press'd and cry'd out to see the Queene; Almaid declar'd himselfe, and intreated them to make way for him. At this new cause of astonishment, the multitude redoubled their acclamations, throng'd together,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:54727:198"/>
and seeing Almaid could not passe, lifted him up, and from hand to hand carried him to the King. Art thou descended from heaven (deare Almaid) said Zabaim, to confirme the good newes I heare, and dare not beleeve? He staid not for an answer, but certainly cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diting that she before him could be none other then Almanzaira; he fell on his knees, and taking her by the hands, Doe I then (said he) see you againe deare Almanzaira, and have your enemies been lesse cruell to you then I? But do you not return to upbraid me of my inhumanity, and aske Justice for it from all the World? My Lord (repli'd the Queen) forget (if you please) the griefes I have throwne on you, and let me see that my returne and life is not displeasing to you. All the assistants lifted their hands to heaven, throng'd about the King and Queen, to congratulate so miraculous a re-union; and understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it was an effect of Almaid's fidelity, they call'd him aloud the Redeemer of Senega. This worthy Favorite, to satisfie the King his master, and the rest of the company, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in few words all that we have knowne before. At which recitall their admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on increased, and the multitude which takes pleasure in framing to themselves causes of astonishment, added miracles and prodigies to Almanzaira's adventures; to the end, to give new nourishment to their greedinesse of deceiving themselves. In the meane time, the Priests changed their prayers and requests into giving thankes. They praised Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for this happy and unexpected successe, and sent backe Zabaim with as much comfort and joy, as he had of despaire and sorrow when he came into the Temple. Almanzaira for all her being re-established in her former fortune, and environ'd with such glory as any other but her selfe had been lost in it, forgot not Polexander. She besought the King he might be look'd after, to render him what she ought, as the person whom the eternall Providence had made use of, to denounce the end of her miseries. Polexander straight presented himselfe, and doing reverence to the King, without making knowne who he was, follow'd him to the Palace with Almaid, and many others of the chiefe in Court. The people, on their parts renew'd with their fires the joy they had so long smother'd, and running (as their manner is) from one extreame into another, spent the rest of that night in sports, in feastings, in musicke and other jocundnesse. Zabaim spent it more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously; for assoone as he had bid good night to all the Court, he shut himselfe in his privy chamber with Almanzaira, Polexander and Almaid; and accusing himselfe in their presence, of all those crimes his love had made him commit; ask'd the Queen pardon a thousand times, and mov'd her so much by his submissions, as she thought (so good she was) there was no body guilty but her selfe. But to divert Zabaim from his sad thoughts, My Lord (said she) the same Goodnesse which hath preserv'd your Almanzaira from the power of all the Devills, hath not onely had care of the true Almanzor's life, but hath many times sent him you as a tutelar Angell to defend you against your ill-affected Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Rebellion; and to re-conquer those Countries which divers tyrants had usurped from you. 'Twas he who appear'd in your Court under the name of Perseus, and who by a youthfull folly, renounc'd (but in appearance only) the amity he promis'd us. Is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, cry'd Zabaim, that Perseus is my sonne, and that even he whom I would have smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in his cradle, hath had so generous a spirit as to re-establish me thrice in my throne, and twenty times to save my life? Truly Almanzaira I beleeve it, when I consider the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of your affection; and since the effects take much after their causes, Almanzaira is such, as there can come nought from her but what is extraordinary. But where is he, our deare Almanzor? when shall I imbrace him, and settle on his head all those Crowns which through a just indignation he refuseth? The Queen to increase his astonishment, answered thus: Know, Sir, that love hath made a Pirate of your sonne, and hath made you know him for such under the name of Baiazet, which he now carries. O! my son cry'd Zabaim againe, how heroicall is thy vertue! how great thy courage! and how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extraordinary things are to be reserv'd for thy wonderfull fate! Yes Almanzaira, I have knowne him under the name of Baiazet, and but for the assistance he gave me to quench a Rebellion worse then the former; you had seene Zabaim amongst the number of those unfortunate Kings with whom there is left no remainder of royalty, but the griefe of being despoyled of it. But let us not suffer (my deare Almanzaira) that the heire, or to say better, the conquerour of so many Kingdomes continue any longer the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to a company of theeves. Almaid presented himself to carry the Prince news what he
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54727:198"/>
was, and what had lately hap'ned. Zabaim besought him to undertake the voyage, and to restore againe the person he had so happily stolne from him. Polexander offered to accompany him if need were; and, I dare believe without vaine-glory, (said he) that Almanzor loves me so well as he will not deny me such things as I shall intreat from him. In this manner ended the first converse (now) betwixt Zabaim and Almanzaira, and so presently withdrew, giving congey to Polexander and the faithfull Almaid. The publique rejoycings (the while) being sufficiently made shew of, by all manner of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, left all the City of Senega in so sound a tranquillity, that two or three dayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing were not onely festivall dayes, but wholly consecrated to rest. Zabaim having satisfied his conscience, and made an eternall peace with Axiamira, began to purge his Kingdomes of all those pernicious spirits which Zelopa had made use on for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment of her unjust authority. All the Peeres of the Kingdome came to the Palace to congratulate the returne of their good Queene, and renew'd even to Zabaim the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances of their inviolable fidelity. Almanzaira, now free, went through all the Temples to give thanks to heaven, and to be seene of the people, which earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired it, was carried (after the manner of that country) through all the streets of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nega. When she had satisfied the Subject, she would give content to her selfe, and thinking there was an infinite obligation due to Polexander besought Zabaim to make him proffers great enough in acknowledgement of what he had done for her sake, and to keepe him in his service. The King, who had no other will then that of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wife, presented such things to Polexander as were capable to tempt the most moderate of the world But Polexander, astonish'd, and amaz'd to see himselfe so well treated: I (said he) have never serv'd you Zabaim; and you know, the Queene is so good, that she makes no distinction betweene the wishes and the effects, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is perswaded I have serv'd her because I had a will to it. Yet believe not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I doe not accept your Present, that I will avoid all occasions of ingaging my selfe. No, Sir, I owe you all I refuse, and the possessing so great a fortune as you present me, would nothing adde to my affection of doing you service. Whensoever you shall have occasion, I will expose my life and those of my friends; and be ready to go whither you will call me on so emergent a consideration. But now, (when the love of your subjects, and the feare of your neighbours gives you time to taste in peace the fruits of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and that the Queenes returne invites you to sit downe without any new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking) be pleas'd I may retire home, and after that voyage, carry the Prince Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor newes of his good fortune. Almanzaira was present when Polexander spake thus to Zabaim. She did what in her lay to stay him, but being just as she was, she gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to his depart; and would not (to please her selfe) that Polexander should receive any the least discontent. He had sent his trusty Alcippus to the Port to looke for Diceus and advertise him of his coming. Assoone as he heard from them, he tooke his leave of the King and Queene, and bidding farewell to all his friends, and particularly to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, departed from Senega to the Sea side. He had not been two howres aboard his ship when an unknowne man entred her, and intreated he might speake with him in private. Polexander led him into his Cabin, and shutting the doore, Speake freely, (said he) you are in a place where none but I can heare you. The stranger forgetting nothing of what civility instructs a Gentleman to practise; Knight (said he) Almaid having made profession of a generosity which cannot passe by the least wrongs, would thinke he had absolutely renounc'd it, if he tooke no resentment of the injury you have done him. He therefore hath sent me to intreat you before you go hence, that he may see you with your sword in your hand: and to the end you may not doubt of what I have spoken; see here a paper which he commanded I should deliver you. Polexander be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving the Messenger tooke him for some other; Sir, (said he) you are mistaken. I have nothing to decide with Almaid. I am his humblest servant, and ready to give him all kinde of satisfaction if I have chanc'd (through any imprudency) to offend him. Almaid verily thought (replied the Gentleman) you would make me that answer; and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to me he should not be extravagant or thought giddy braind enough, to demand ought of you, if it concern'd none but himselfe: but since it toucheth the honour of a Prince (whose adorer he is) he resolves to avenge it on his enemies. Be pleased therefore
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:54727:199"/>
to read this paper, and satisfie Almaid by the way of armes, since I assure you that your excuses will not content him. Polexander smiled at the counsell he gave, and taking the paper, found this.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Almaid</hi> a Prince to the Christian Knight.</head>
                  <p>WIth an extreame griefe I am obliged to be your Enemy. I have knowne so much valour and vertue both in your words and actions, and your person hath so many charmes, that it is almost impossible to be an honest man, and at discord with you. But when I call to minde that you have offended Polexander, and by I know not what secret Envy, indeavour'd to rob him of his victory o'rethe false Almanzor; all your rare endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments slip out of my memory, and I finde my self capable of nought but revenge. You may say I have a long time conceal'd my resentment. It is true: but the consideration of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira whom I preferre before all others, forbad me to make it knowne till this time. Now when I may without troubling her quiet satisfie my passion, I intreat you to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, and to beleeve all he shall say who brings you this Note.</p>
                  <p>Polexander having receiv'd this Challenge, wondred at the fantasticalnesse of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and Almaid's humour. But it came presently into his minde that Almaid might have learnt his name of Alcippus, or some other, and this was but an invented match to bring him backe to Court. Well (said he to himselfe) be it what it may be, I will not reveale my selfe; nor will I commit an unsteady action to satisfie Almaid. After he had taken this resolution, he spoke thus to him that brought the Challenge. You may tell your friend, that for the present it is not in my power to give your friend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment he desires; I will send him my excuses and answer his Letter. With that hee opened the dore, and calling Diceus, commanded for paper and inck, and all sitting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought, he wrote this Answer.</p>

I beleeve he is courageous, but I shall never be so observant as to give him an honour he hath not deserved. Truly he is too much oblig'd to you for your love to him; and if any occasion present it selfe wherein you may need his service, I shall have a farre lesse esteeme of him then I have now, if he doe not as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expose his life for you, as you would have done yours for him. In the meane time, take it not amisse that I come not where you expect me, and truely you shall be unjust, if you be not contented with my Declaration.</p>
                  <p>Polexander, having seal'd his Letter, would have put it into the African's hands, but he often refus'd it, and would not have taken it at all, if Polexander had not assur'd him he would not depart thence till he had newes from Almaid. Upon that promise the stranger went away, and within an houre after return'd to Polexander, and told him, how Almaid more offended by his Letter, would see him with his sword in his hand, and follow him to the worlds end rather then faile of his satisfaction. Let's goe then said Polexander, and make Almaid know we are not so hardly to be perswaded as he. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he call'd for Alcippus and Diceus, and enjoyning them that his ship might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to set saile presently upon his returne; descended into a shalop with the African, and so went on shore. Assoone as he was there, he follow'd his guide, and after he had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked a mile, met with Almaid in a little valley, who expected him with a great deale of impatiency. He ran to him with open armes, and imbracing him almost whether hee would or no; How now (said he) my deare Almaid, will you for a Polexander whom you know not but by anothers report, lose a person who perfectly honours you, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54727:199"/>
whom you thinke not absolutely unworthy of your friendship. Almaid putting on a more serious countenance, I know (repli'd he) Polexander better then you imagine; and that Prince's reputation is so great, that envie it selfe strives to increase it as often as she goes about to diminish it. Polexander should be very happy (answered the Prince) if all the world had so good an opinion of him as you, and his fortune were equall to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. Pardon me Almaid if I tell you, I know Polexander very well, and he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lesse then what you would have him go for. How! (replied Almaid) 'tis too much, I must quit all respect and vindicate the honour of so great a Prince from the outrages of envy. With that he drew his Symetar, and compelled Polexander to do the like. What (said he, in warding) would you have me bely my conscience? Almaid, you are too teasty a friend. Thinke what you are doing, and ingage me not to commit either a folly in flattering my selfe, or an injustice in defending me against so deare an enemy. Almaid for all that, still pressed on and would needs oblige him whether he would or no to esteeme himselfe above all other men. But whilst with too much fervency he prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Prince who recoyl'd, he tooke not good heed to his footing, but sliding on the grasse, fell so rudely that his Symetar flew out of his hand. Polexander straight stept to him, and helping to raise him: Confesse (said he) that your affection is much blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to make you know it, fortune hath reduced you to such an estate as you cannot contradict it. I will dye a thousand times if it be possible (replied Almaid) rather then lessen the esteeme I ought to have of Polexanders incomparable vertue. But (said our Heroe) the law of Armes is, that the vanquish'd should conforme himselfe to the will of the vanquisher. 'Tis true, (replied Almaid) but I account not my selfe overcome, though I be at your mercy. Fortune, by your owne confession hath given you the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over me; and I hold you too generous, to imploy any other arme then your owne in the subduing your enemy. Live then invincible, (said the Prince in restoring his Symetar) and since it pleaseth you, continue in an errour which is so extreamely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to Polexander. Almaid, mov'd with so high a generosity, confess'd he ow'd him his honour and his life, and asked pardon for the extravagancy whereinto a most just affection had drawne him. But if it be true, (said he) as I will not doubt it, that my folly hath nothing lessened your love, I beseech you to affect Polexander, since he should be the love of all eminent men, and to let me know to whom I am so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted. It should be no hard thing (replied the Prince) to satisfie you in those your two requests. I have a particular ingagement not to hate him whom you would have me love: and as for my fortune, beleeve me, I have more desire to tell it you then you to know it. But (that it may not be done unseasonably) I beseech you be pleased I may returne where I have left my servants, and that your friend may goe with me, who shall bring you in writing what I am not permitted to deliver you by word of mouth. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid yeelding to so just a request, said many things to Polexander, to perfwade him, that next to Polexander, he was the man whom he most esteemud in the world. Our Heroe often imbrac'd him, and having much adoe to hide his resentment: and I (said he) Almaid promise to love you above all the men I know, and even more then your Polexander. With that he tooke his leave of him, and taking his friend along, came to his ship; where assoone as he was in his Cabin he call'd for paper and Inke, and writ to Almaid the letter following.</p>
                  <p>I Should be unworthy the affection you beare me, if I freed you not of your trouble, and did not rid you of that errour which the too advantageous opinion of Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath cast you in. Assure your selfe, my deare Almaid, he is farre beneath what you value him. You have suffered your selfe to be perswaded by fame, and yet you know she is a foole, who following the inconstancy of her humours, raiseth meane things, overthrowes high ones, takes away the honour from those that deserve it, and prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes it to them who have not courage enough to make use with advantage of that blind ones injustice. But I must speake more plainly to you, and to testifie that I am not jealous of Polexanders reputation, I tell you, I am the same Polexander. It may be you will thinke me very cunning in concealing my selfe so long, and very ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54727:200"/>
in departing from you without rendring thanks for the obligation I owe and shall doe all my life to your credulity. But that only is guilty of my faults. 'Twas that which made me conceale my name from you whilst I could not my selfe, and would force me to hide it yet, if my cruell destiny did not seeme to presage to me, that I shall never see you more.</p>
                  <p>After the Prince had sealed this letter he gave it to the African, and unwilling he should go away ill satisfied, bestow'd on him a Diamond of a great value, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement to remember his liberality. The African amaz'd and ravish'd with so good a fortune; witnessed by his submissions and talke, his covetous inclination, and so tooke leave of his benefactor to depart to Almaid. Polexander presently set saile, with an intent to search yet for Alcidiana's Island, or at least to meet with some of her Pilots. But the end of his misfortunes was not yet come. He had suffered but illustrious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and it was resolv'd in heaven he should feele the most shamefullest. The season, which was not yet very proper to saile in the Atlantick Sea, threw him under the Line, and had almost cast him away on a desert Island directly against Guinea. Yet he found a haven betweene the sholes of that Isle, and perceiv'd on the point of a rock (which on all sides was beaten by the Sea) some body, who, I know not by what white thing which he turn'd in the ayre, seem'd to implore his succour. He sent Diceus, who taking him into his Shallop, with a great deale of compassion assur'd him he had met with friends, and brought him to the Ship. Assoone as he came aboord he swounded through weakenesse, and so lay a long time. By divers remedies they brought him againe, and assoone as he had recollected his spirits; O insatiable hunger of riches, (cried he) to what misery art thou able to bring us! By those words Polexander knew he was a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilian, and conjectured him to be one of those whom the ambitious Isabella sent under the conduct of Columbus to rob the treasures of the new world. Though his curiosity urg'd him to question the Spaniard, he forbore, and had the charity to call for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him to eate, to shift his cloathes, and to disburthen him of two great chaines of rootes and black barks he had about his neck. After he had beene fitted with all things needfull Polexander intimated a desire to know his fortune, and ingaged him to begin it thus: I am a Spaniard, my fathers name Alphonso de Padilla, and mine Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zias. We were of the first among the inhabitants of old Castile, and so much the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, that being rich we were unknowne. A desire to equalize such, who having no higher a birth then we, had a farre greater fortune; made us resolve to imploy the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our friends, in obtaining from our Queene the permission of discovering that part of the world which lay beyond the Islands of Jamaiqua and Cuba. Wee got that unfortunate grant; and imbarking our selves, had so good a voyage, that we discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Continent of the West Indies. But it cost the lives of the greatest part of our company, for the Inhabitants of the countrey where we landed, were a bloudy and furious people which made continuall warre with their neighbours, and laid waste all the provinces they passed thorough. Their countrey is not lesse dismall then themselves. Theayre, the soyle, the trees, the herbes, the waters and the very fishes kill such stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as know not their malignity. My father there lost his sight, by sleeping in the shade of some pestilentious trees, and I was taken by the Caribs (so are those savages called) and reserv'd to be sacrific'd to their gods, which are no lesse cruell then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. My poore blinde father, afflicted for my losse, retir'd into an Island neerest hand, and imployed his utmost both of meanes and industry, to recover me from the hands of those savages. Yet was I detain'd there above two yeares, and though I have brought nothing from that long servitude but those black rootes you saw about my neck, I should neverthelesse esteeme my selfe more rich and happy then Columbus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, if the mischance of my being shipwrack'd, had not hindred me from rendring to the best father of the world, that which I owe to his love and his care for my delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. I had wherewithall to restore that sight which he lost by the venemous shade, and wherewith to perswade him by the example of his owne mishaps, that there is no condition so miserable as theirs who are not content with their fathers fortune. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander lik'd the Spaniards wit, and glad to passe some time with him; Your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54727:200"/>
(said he) have beene very profitable to you, since they have given you so perfect a knowledge of humane vanities, and owe to them a secret which is hidden from all men else. 'Tis true, (replied the Castilian) I am bound so much to my miseries: and if I can ever returne home with that deare father which is all the felicity of my life; I would thinke my selfe a thousand times richer in finding the secret of contemning gold, then if I had found that, of possessing all there is in the new world. He had scarce ended his Speech, when they heard strange shoutes from the Island, and noyses like those which men make when they are at blowes. Polexander drawne by the clamour, and spurr'd on by his owne noblenesse, landed; and hastning right to the noyse, met with twenty or thirty men, which divided in two troupes equally shew'd their courage. When he was about to part them, an old man full of majesty and sorrow presented himselfe, and intimating that his life was lesse deare to him then the lives of the Combatants: If it be possible (said he to him) keepe these men from killing one another. I am the sad cause of their quarrell. Some of them would have my life, the others are resolv'd to dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then consent to the fury of their companions. Polexander not desirous to informe himselfe any further of the cause of that combate, thrust among them, with Alcippus, Diceus and his other domestîcks, yet could not doe it so well, but eight or ten fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could part them; of which number, two were of those that stood in defence of the venerable old man, and the rest were of his enemies. The five or six which remain'd of the worser side, laid downe their armes, cast themselves at his feet whom they would lately have murdred, and expressing to him an extraordinary griefe for their attempt: Command (said they to him) O thou our visible Deity, that we be aswell chastis'd as our companions, since we are as guilty. Have no pity on us! and though your goodnesse hath alwayes gloried in pardoning the most enormous offences, at last let such miscreants as we feele that you can punish them. The aged man in stead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing those wretches counsell, cast himselfe on their necks, weeping, and assuring them he already thought no more of their fault, To pronounce you guilty (said he) is to accuse my selfe. I commanded you to obey the ingratefull Perseus, and not to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse your loyalty towards me but in being faithfull to him. Polexander at that name of Perseus, remembred what Almaid had related; and conjecturing, the old man might be Abrinzias, Shall I beleeve (said he) that the unnaturall Perseus would attempt against the life of his father, as he did against that of Almanzor? Ah! (replied the old man) whoever you be, that know too well the misfortunes of our family; do not oblige me to tell you I am the unfortunate father of a child so ill borne. But if you desire I should confesse it; be pleased likewise that I make an end of accusing my selfe, and relate to you all the miseries have betided me, since Almanzor left me to follow a person which he cannot meet with whilst he is out of Benin. Polexander surpris'd at this discourse, would have demanded many things at once from the venerable Abrinzias; but some just considerations sotting his inquisitivenesse, he intreated that Prince to leave the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Island, and refresh himselfe in his ship. Abrinzias consented; but before he went aboard, he reconcil'd the vanquish'd with the vanquishers; and intreated both parts to abolish for ever the memory of an act, black enough to make their nation execrable to all others. Every one promising to observe his prohibition, Abrinzias and Polexander left the desert Island; and our Heroe giving him the honours of his ship, welcom'd the good King with all the Ceremonies a Subject could yeeld his Soveraigne. Abrinzias being well refresh'd, and desirous to pay his Host for so kinde an entertainement: I cannot chuse (said he) but make to you a generall confession of my faults, and though I doubt you know a part of them, I will neverthelesse tell you all, since I am sure that those who spoake to you of me have stroven to conceale such things as might blemish my reputation. I will therefore begin by the greatest of my crimes, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgency, fond love, and voluntary blindnesse. They have hindered me from knowing the defects of miserable Perseus, or at least from correcting them. I alwayes looked on him with dazeld eyes, and tooke him for such as my irregular affection made me imagine him. His insolency seem'd to me greatnesse of courage, and contempt of meane things; his impiety, strength of wit; his pride, majesty; in briefe, his vices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me vertues, and I was so witlesse, that in stead of reproving I flattered him in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54727:201"/>
his most wicked customes. The eternall Justice let me alone a long time in my errors, suffered me not to know the malice of that serpent I fostered in my bosome, but by the mortall stings it gave me. I hop'd, the example and conversation of great Almanzor would have quell'd the pernicious inclinations of Perseus, but he grew to hate what he could not imitate, and confirming himselfe in all vice, in despite of vertue, had an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (alas! must I speake it?) to murther Almanzor. Polexander interrupting, to oblige him, Leave (said he) that action out of the number of such things as have betided, and do not imbrue your memory with the recitall of that assassinate: I know all that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and how Almanzor would not you should ever know of it. 'Tis true (pitifull stranger) replied Abrinzias, and I had beene all my life time without the hearing of such a prodigy, if a second reviving the former, had not brought it to my knowledge. Two months after Almanzors departure, the miserable Perseus by the search and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity of his accursed spyes, discovered Iphidamanta in the most retired part of the Temple, where with the consent of Andromeda and my selfe she had withdrawne and shut her selfe up. How (my Lord) said Polexander, did not the Pirates take her away the same night when they forc'd your palace? Abrinzias beginning againe with a tone farre different from his former speaking: I have (said he) unawares told too much, but h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ven hath suffered it for some cause I know not, and therefore I will not feare to disclose to you a secret which is hid from all save Andromeda, Iphidamanta and my selfe. Some few dayes before the Pirates came to disturbe the profound tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my Country, Iphidamanta whom we may call the accomplish'd and perfect image of vertue, made my wife perceive that she had receiv'd some sensible displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Andromeda tooke her apart, and conjuring her by the extraordinary affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction she bore, not to conceale the cause of her griefe. Madam, (said she) were not your goodnesse infinite, and did it not seeme to invite me to the boldnesse I take of troubling you with the accidents of my sad fortune; I should (me thinks) have had power enough o're my selfe to undergoe them without making them knowne. But since you have alwayes permitted me to complaine, and that even on persons which are most deare to you, I will not feare to intreat your protection against the pursuites of Almanzor. Osmin and his Lady who till now have given me so great proofes of their amity, and who many a time have hazarded their lives for the safeguard of mine honour, have beene won by Almanzors allurements, and they give him such freedome as begins to be insupportable to me. You will (may be) wonder Madam, that (being reduc'd to the unfortunate estate I am in, and who may rather be taken for some bold deceiver, then for a Princesse) I should finde fault with the actions of the Prince your Son. But I erre in having so ill an opinion of so eminent a vertue as yours. No Madam you will not mislike my disapproving of your Sons inticing discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, nor that I tell you his respects and civilities make me suspect him. Lady, (replied Andromeda) I have already long since discover'd Almanzors affection, but his discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and your vertue being equally knowne to me, I thought there was no need of advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the taking heed either to him or your selfe. I humbly kisse your Majesties hands, (replied Iphidamanta) and am too much oblig'd for your noble beliefe of me. I will strive Madam to give you cause to continue it, and not to deferre so good an intent, I beseech you humbly by these knees I embrace (with that she fell downe at her feet) to free me hence, to take me from the sight of men, and to shut me up in some place where their humorous affection, how extravagant soever, dare not trouble my repose. But how happy, Madam, should I thinke my selfe, if by some invention which would carry probability, I might be feign'd to be lost, and by that meanes absolute get me from the knowledge of Almanzor. Andromeda, ravish'd at Iphidamanta's resolution, promis'd to second her, and getting her leave to communicate the businesse to me, dismissed her with a promise to travell without intermission for the accomplishment of her just desires. My wife and my selfe were eight or ten dayes deliberating what way we should take to bring it to passe without giving Almanzor cause to complaine of us: and indeed we were not smally troubled; when the eternall providence (which never loseth an occasion of favouring them which serve it as they ought) would make use even of the villany of a company of theeves to place the innocency of Iphidamanta in surety.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54727:201"/>
Whilst therefore Almanzor was in fight with the Pirates, Andromeda dispos'd all things for the faigning Iphidamanta's carrying away and the businesse succeeded so wel, that in the same instant when the theeves assaulted the Palace Iphidamanta was taken from the eyes of Osmin and his wife, and secretly conveyed by Andromeda alone, into the Temple of their god of Purity. Almanzor in the meane time return'd after he had knock'd back our enemies into their vessels, and met with Osmin and his wife, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advisedly enough told him of Iphidamanta's losse. The Prince who lov'd her beyond thought, return'd to the Sea, cast himselfe into a ship, and inconsiderately made after the supposed ravishers of that Princesse. Since that time I have not heard of him; but feare lest his love and valour have cost him his life. Never trouble your self, (quoth Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander) for Almanzor lives; and now enjoyeth all the Crownes which Zelopa's am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition hath so often striven to deprive him of. But, Sir, (said he) goe on if you please in what you have begun, and I will relate afterwards, (if you thinke fit) the strange revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions have betided in Senega. Abrinzias began againe; and hastening to know Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baims alteration: Perseus (said he) being no more restrain'd by his feare of Almanzor, overflow'd with so prodigious an excesse, that he drew me out of the errour I had long liv'd in, and made me see, when I would have bridled his fury, it was not then able to be suppressed. Admonitions profited as little as threatnings, and severity mov'd him no more then mildnesse. Andromeda who never till then thought him guilty, was strooke halfe dead when she heard of it, and being generous suspended her motherly love, to let that authority worke which heaven hath given to parents over their children. I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise became of the same just opinion though with a great deale of griefe. But we must confesse to both our shames we were not able to persever, but after a few slight cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections abandon'd Perseus to his former brutishnesse. Nay we did farre worse, for ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining, by imploying his minde in the communication of businesse, he might be drawne from his debauches, we proclaim'd him King of Zanphara, the patrimony of Andromeda. Wee quickly repented us for giving him that authority. He made no other use of it then to sinne more licenciously, and to make his faults more great and eminent. He return'd to Benin with the most desperate and abominable spirits that ever Africa produc'd; and imploying his dayes and nights in dishonouring the best fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, grew to such a height of abomination, that he broke the sacred grates, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the sanctity of our Temples. He forc'd at midday all the gards and defenders of the Virgins consecrated to Purity, upon the assurance some had promis'd him of his finding Iphidamanta; and he was already gotten into their Cloyster with his Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when I came in with a greater power, and hindred the violences of that detestable route. I caus'd some fifty of the principall to be taken, and to avenge our violated Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and give the more terrour to such miscreants, commanded them to be cast the next day into the den of Lions. Perseus fled with an intent (as the event shew'd) to revenge his Confederates deaths by those of his father and mother. He got an Army of vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, of theeves, and in a word, of the most imbrued and greatest murtherers amongst the Arabians. The inundation of these Monsters was in all likelihood to have ruined my Estate; but heavens Justice, and my Subjects resolution, in part, exterminated that publique infliction. Yet was it not without the effusion of much bloud. All the chiefe of my Kingdome dyed in the field, and had it not beene for my guard who rescued me out of the midst of mine enemies, I had beene involv'd in the same ruine. Perseus, (though much weak'ned) gave not over pursuing me, but knowing I was gotten into the City of Benin, resolv'd to besiege me there. Andromeda thinking to allay his fury, went out of the towne with her principall Ladies, and meeting her Son in the head of his troupes: Whither goest thou? (said she) What Perseus, art thou become such an enemy to thine owne greatnesse, that thou wilt exterminate by fire and sword those who glory in being borne to serve thee? What wilt thou get by the destruction of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin? Certainely a misery so great and so visible, as I wonder at that blindnesse which makes thee not see it. In stead of reigning over free borne men, thou shalt be no more then a companion of rascals which follow thee, and when thou hast no more for them to prey upon, thou thy selfe shalt be the quarry of their insatiable avarice. Come home to thy selfe Perseus! let the horrour of thy offence disswade thee from continuing in it.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54727:202"/>
Hearken to Nature, hearken to bloud. Respect thy fathers age, and intend not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, unlesse thou wilt trample under thy horses feet this weake and languishing body, to whom thou owest both thy birth and thy Crowne. Perseus as furious as he was, yet was detained by those words: but the Arabians passing the bounds of their wonted bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality and ordinary barbarisme, hurried him away farre from Andromeda, and enforc'd him to keepe on his journey. His Mother seeing her selfe so ill respected, with much difficulty returned to the City, and relating to me in what ill case our affaires stood, found no kinde of comfort but in bewailing the absence of Almanzor. In the meane time a great number of those Arabian theeves which wander up and downe Africa, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Benin was besieg'd, ran thither for pillage. I, who foresaw the lamentable successe of that warre, shipp'd Andromeda, Iphidamanta, the Nunnes, and other chiefe Ladies of Benin, to the number of towards eight hundred, and sent them downe the River to a fortresse, which for its being built on a rock encompassed by the Sea, hath by our Predecessors beene called the Palace of Safety. Within a few dayes after the towne was taken (through the trechery of some Arabians who dwelt in it) and I reduc'd to a condition more miserable then death it selfe. I presented my selfe to my ingratefull Perseus assoone as he entred the towne, and opening my breast, Sheathe here, (said I to him) sheathe here, barbarian, the murtherous steele which reekes yet with thy brothers bloud. I deserve that punishment, since I am the author of thy life; and I beg it from thee as a favour, rather then to see thee cut the throats of so many innocents, for whose preservation thou art bound to expose, nay to lose thine owne life. The inraged Perseus was about to grant my request, but as he lifted his arme, a white Slave which Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor had given me, stept before me, and with his Symeter strooke Perseus such a blow on the head, that he fell from his horse; and presently addressing his speech to that wretches Souldiers: Come ye infamous and cruell rabble, (cried he) come and imbrew in my bloud your hands accustomed to so many murthers. Imitate your accursed Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and permit not vertue to be one sole minute in safety before you. The unnaturall Perseus is not content to have drench'd his ponyard in the breast of Almanzor, but he would have the King his father try the same steele, and that his rage should be glutted on him, since it could not be satiated on his brother. But heaven cannot suffer these hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible murders. It makes use of the most weake instruments to instruct us, that it can at pleasure confound the malice of the most strong, and is continually the avenger of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate parents. This Slaves speech had beene powerfull enough to have mitigated Lions and Tigers, had they beene capable of understanding; but it wrought nothing on mine enemies. They fell on that trusty and generous Slave, ran him through and through, and after they had hack'd him in peeces, tooke up Perseus who was sorely wounded, and to make my thraldome more ignominious, loaded me with irons, and so brought me back to the palace. There was I strictly guarded till Perseus was healed. Some few dayes after by his command, I was taken out of prison, and brought to the Isle we came from. 'Tis three months since I arriv'd, and was already resolv'd to end my miserable life there, without laying the fault on any other then my self, or bewailing any of my losses but that of my deare Andromeda. This morning, walking by the Sea side, I saw those men land whom you have parted. They had order to kill me, but there was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one part who came to execute that barbarous command. Of thirty (which they were) fifteene of them intended (as they told me) not onely to save my life, but to take me out of that desolate Island, and carry me either into Congo or Guinea. Assoone as they came on shoare, they hastned to me, and made knowne Perseus command. But when they were all come to the place where you found them, those who had agreed to save my life, put themselves before me, and made knowne their resolution to their Companions. That made them enemies, and brought on the Combat which you have ended. In these few words (brave Knight) you have the recitall of my long afflictions: I can accuse none but my selfe for them. Perseus their author, is lesse guilty then I. My negligences, my flatteries, and my blinde affection have beene the fosterers of that young mans most vicious inclinations, and bred him up in the practise of all wickednesse. Finish then, O heaven, finish my punishment! adde new torments to those I have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered! I will accept them with thanks, provided they satisfie thy Justice, and that they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54727:202"/>
be great enough to expiate the offences I have committed either by my selfe or the to be deplored Perseus. Abrinzias could not make an end without teares: for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his great courage, and the intire resignation he made appeare, yet was he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; not with the thought of his miseries, but the griefe for deserving them. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander to wipe off his teares, gave his word not to forsake him, till he had brought Perseus to an accompt, and made him quit the throne he had so brutishly usurped. These promises might have comforted some other unfortunate Prince, but they could worke nothing with Abrinzias. He continually call'd to minde the ill breeding of his Son, and repenting his more care taken for his fortune then vertue, lifted every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his eyes to heaven, and begg'd from thence afflictions proportionable to the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his offences. Polexander, thinking it was impossible to stop this torrent, let it run over with all its violence; and when he saw a remarkeable diminution, My Lord, (said he to Abrinzias) you are not the sole father which resents the impiety and fury of his children. The King of Morocco for being too indulgent like you, hath as you, lost his Crownes and liberty. The undutifull Nephisus hath no lesse attempted against him then Perseus against you; but by some mysteries which are not knowne but above, that Prince in striving to satisfie his lascivious desires, is falne under the avenging sword of your deare Almanzor. Doubt not then, but Perseus leading the same life will meet the like end, if heaven touch not his heart and draw him from this obduratenesse. Let's hence presently (if you will be advis'd by me) and suffer not your subjects, and (may be) your Queene to be any longer expos'd to the fury of that unnaturall Son. Abrinzias thought he resisted the will of heaven in not consenting to Polexander, and therefore besought him to do what he thought fittest. Polexander, who had businesse otherwhere, presently commanded his Mariners to steere for Benin, and in the meane while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with Abrinzias, but farre more with himselfe, to finde meanes for the speedy terminating the warre betwixt the father and the son, and redeeme his Sister from those barbarous parts. Two dayes was he in these consultations, and the third he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scried the rock on which was seated the Palace of Safety. When he was neere enough to distinguish of objects, he perceiv'd the rock to be inviron'd with a great many little boates. He shew'd it Abrinzias, and told him that Perseus for certaine had besieg'd the place. With that he went throughout his ship, and commanded his Gunners to shoote betwixt winde and water, and not make an unprofitable shoote. Next he gave order amongst his Souldiers, and giving them advantagious and thick plancks, with holes in the middle for their shot to play through, told them for their incouragement, they were to fight but with poore Arabians and other vagabonds, which had neither skill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, nor courage to assaile any resolute Souldiers. After he had fitted all, he return'd to Abrinzias, and unperceivably getting him into his Cabin, there left him when they were ready to fall on. The Enemy no sooner descryed his great vessell but they thought themselves lost. Their confusion was great, but nothing in comparison with that the Cannon made when it began to thunder amongst them. The more vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant made a little resistance, but the one halfe part of them being slaine, and the rest mightily terrified, they abandoned their boates and the Siege, and retir'd towards Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin. Perseus hastning along with the run-awayes, strove to get to the City; yet could not make so much haste but the rumour of it was quicker, which had publisht in Benin, how Almanzor was return'd with a mighty Army to reestablish Abrinzias in his throne, to free the Queene his mother, and to punish Perseus his rebellion. These newes being easily beleev'd, because they were exceedingly long'd for, put generous resolutions into the inhabitants of Benin. They all instantly tooke armes, and making the word Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to resound againe, hack'd in pieces those whom Perseus had left them in Garrison, and shut their gates against him when he would have entred Benin. Polexander in the meane time with winde and tide at will came up the River even to the towne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken for Almanzor, was invited to enter, by the shouts and acclamations of all the people. Abrinzias presently coming out of his Cabin, was acknowledg'd &amp; receiv'd by his Subjects with all the demonstrations of love &amp; joy, which the returne of so good a King could cause in his people. In the most convenient place he landed and followed by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander and all his, ascended (without effusion of bloud) the throne which Perseus had
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54727:203"/>
besmear'd with so many massacres. Polexander leaving him there, got together some thousand or twelve hundred men of the towne, and joyning them to his owne Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, (few, but invincible) went and charg'd Perseus before he was recover'd from his astonishment. He defeated the remainder of his Arabians, and as he pursued those that fled, Perseus was brought to him all bloudy and distracted. Those by whom he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken had disarm'd him, and minding more his rebellion then his birth, dragg'd him along as an offender ready to be sacrific'd to the publique vengeance. Polexander made them give over their violences, and desir'd to consider and looke on the Prince, to see whether he might so come to know whence proceeded the irregularity of his minde. Soone he perceiv'd that Perseus had nought in him of those famous ambitious ones, which have introduc'd into the world (amongst others) this pernicious Maxime, that all lawes whatsoever are to be violated for a Kingdome. On the contrary, he found in him a great deale of weakenesse and stupidity. His looke or countenance was rather that of a thiefe which feares the hangman, then of one valiantly ambitious who can indure no Superiour. Polexander, who would have setled him, and had an intent to subdue his barbarous disposition; bid him be of good courage, and expect from the King his fathers goodnesse, that pardon which he had obtain'd from him as often as he had desir'd it. When by this speech he had a little recollected his spirits, he brought him to the Palace, and thinking it not fit to present him to Abrinzias, left him in his lodging in the keeping of Alcippus and Diceus. That done, he went to the King and coming up to him with the mirthsomenesse of a man that brings good newes, You have no more enemies, said he, nor will the Arabians any more vaunt the devastation of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Abrinzias at those words waxing pale, But what is become (said he) of the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Perseus? He is out of danger (replied Polexander) and could you but worke so much on your selfe as not to see him yet these fifteene dayes, I am perswaded you would finde a great alteration in him. I can do more then that (replied the King) for a farre lesse happinesse then what you propose to me. Leave then (said Polexander) the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of a businesse so nice as this is to me. Send you (if you please) to the Queene the while, and advertise her of your returne, and let me goe my selfe to conduct her from a place, where she cannot have beene so long without a great deale of inconveniency. Abrinzias after many thanks and excuses, gave way to Polexanders request, and went along himselfe with the Prince, to the place where he was to imbarke for the Fort of Safety. Our Heroe tooke none with him save his owne servants, but Gartias the Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and arriv'd the same day at the Fortresse. When they within had notice that he came from Abrinzias, he had freedome of entrance; and being brought before Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda, he accosted her with that grace and sweetnesse, which instantly made him ever to command o're those minds that were the most untractable. Madam, (said he) I bring your Majesty such newes as questionlesse will be most welcome to you. The King is in the City of Benin, and in that little time since he returned, hath not onely inforc'd his enemies to raise their siege from before this place, but defeated them in the open field, and may now say, there is no King of Benin but himselfe. Andromeda receiv'd this newes as she ought, but the remembrance of her Son repelling that joy which had seis'd her: What (said she) poore Perseus is then falne with those traitors that ruin'd him? Heaven loves you too well (replied Polexander) to afflict your Majesty with so dismall an accident. Perseus is safe, and if it be true that maladies are ordinarily cured by their contraries, your Majesty may hope that your Son will finde his recovery in his adverse fortune, since his prosperity hath beene the cause of his ruine. Whilst Polexander was talking thus, Iphidamanta (in spight of her selfe) kept her eyes fix'd on him; and thinking she knew him, blushed and grew pale almost altogether. For himselfe, he knew her at first, and had much adoe to containe himselfe, and make his affection give place to his respect. Iphidamanta who passionately lov'd her brother, came neerer An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromeda, and scarce being able to speake, Madam (said she) you would never pardon me the fault I should commit, if I conceal'd my joy any longer, and did not tell you that Abrinzias Embassadour is my brother. At which newes Andromeda's overjoyed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was no lesse then Iphidamanta's. She saluted Polexander as a King, and retir'd with her Ladies, to give the brother and sister leave to witnesse to one another the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54727:203"/>
they receiv'd in that happy meeting. Assoone as their first transports and mutuall imbracings were ended, Andromeda came againe to Polexander, and presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Iphidamanta to him, I restore to you (said she) this amiable one halfe of my selfe, but give me to tell you, 'tis with a great deale of griefe. This Princesse vertues, and her attractive wit, are the happinesse of all that know them; and I confesse to you, though my afflictions have beene extraordinary, yet through her company I have not almost beene sensible of them. Both my sister and my selfe (replied Polexander) are infinitely obliged to that extreame goodnesse wherewithall you hindred the sequell of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. I say ours, Madam, because those of my sister being farre more mine then mine owne, you have made me happy in not permitting her to be disastrous. Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meda replied to these complements. Iphidamanta thereto added, with a great deale of wit; and Polexander who was as well the example of courtesie as valour, made the Queene confesse, she had never knowne two so perfect and so like. Her content yet was cross'd by her longing to see Abrinzias; and the tide no sooner began to make the River navigable, but she went aboord Polexanders ship with Iphidamanta and all her Ladies; and by the favour of a fresh gale; came the next day to the King her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. That good King, after he had long held her in his embraces; My deare wife, (said he) for your seeing me againe after so cruell an exile, for your Enemies defeate, for your owne Liberty, for being unpersecuted againe by Perseus, and (if it so happen) for the finishing the rest of our dayes in peace, you must attribute it, and give thanks for it to this invincible Knight. You should say King (said Andromeda.) I see well, you are ignorant of the Author of your happinesse, and therefore you seeme to be yet in doubt of the truth of such things as he hath done. But your doubts and astonishments will end when you know this is Polexander, the Conquerour of so many Nations, whom heaven, good and mercifull, hath as it were miraculously sent to save at once the father, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the son and their kingdome. Abrinzias, ravish'd at so rare an adventure, in stead of congratulating with Polexander, addressed himselfe to the Princesse his Sister, and spoake to her all that a wise and gratefull Prince could expresse on so extraordinary an occasion. The time for rest separating these Princes and Princesses, Polexander with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to his lodging and went to Perseus, who during his absence had beene kept rather like a sick Prince then a captive Enemy. He related to him all that had pass'd, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before him the excessive goodnesse of Abrinzias and Andromeda, assured him of a generall pardon from them, and to restore him to their loves, assoone as he should make knowne he desired it. That black and brutish soule was no way mov'd with these hopes. On the contrary, he became the more proud and savage, and shewing his stupidity by his reply, answer'd Polexander, that he was not so guilty, but that he should be better used then hee was; and that the King and Queene did so little affect him, as they would bee glad of his death to establish Almanzor in the throne. You little know (said Polexander) either of their inclinations; and that's your misery: for your perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Counsellours had never wonne you to those facts you have committed, if you had not beene absolutely ignorant who they were against whom they perswaded you to turne you Armes. Now, since you finde to your displeasure how detestable their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were, I intreat you to hearken to better, and to fit you for it, I will cure you of that jealousie which your selfe confessed to me hath beene the cause of all your unrulinesse: Know, that Almanzor is not your brother, and the King your father never intended for his sake to deprive you of what is yours by birthright. Almanzor is borne King of many kingdomes, Guinea, Melly, Senega, and many other Territories watered by the River Niger, already acknowledge him for their Lord. Leave then your envy and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and acknowledging the offences your flatterers have made you perpetrate, goe and cast your selfe at the King and Queenes feet, and beseech them (now you ought no more to wrong them) to continue the testimonies of their love and clemency. Perseus by this was not wholly converted, but at last he made shew he was likely to be so. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, who was not wont to conquer by halves, redoubled his perswasions, added consideration to consideration, and so lively imprinted in Perseus thought the feare of losing both Crowne and life, if he did not reconcile himselfe to his father, that he promis'd him to submit to all he would command him. Our Heroe to continue and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54727:204"/>
confirme him in that minde, lay with him, and handled him with that dexterity, as I might say he tamed him; and by the vertue of his eloquence made a man of a furious beast. The next day he would needs see whether Perseus were constant in his good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and finding him absolutely setled, went to carry Abrinzias and Andromeda the best newes they could ever receive. There needed no choise words to perswade them. Those who love well, are easily wonne to believe such things as are advantageous to what is beloved. Polexander seeing in them an intire disposition to resettle him in their favours, went to fetch him, and instructing him by the way of what, he had to do, brought him to Abrinzias and Andromeda. Presently he fell at their feet, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely by his teares, made appeare by their excesse that they were not counterfeit. The King and Queene being as unable to speake as he, fell on his neck, and wept so long, that Polexander was compelled to stop that overflowing of naturall love. Abrinzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as recollected himselfe, and addressing him to our Heroe, There remain'd (said he) onely this miracle for you to doe, to take you wholly from the condition of men. Yes Polexander, you are something more; and I shall not thinke I blaspheme, should I say that heaven seem'd to have given you a nature more approaching its owne then is that of mankinde. And to remarke and consider things well, who would beleeve, without beleeving you a Semi-god, that in so little time you have beene able to cure a spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with so many distemperances, as they were judg'd incurable, so inveterate were they? With that he fell againe on his Son, and bedewing him againe with his teares, Arise my Son, said he, and let us together give this Prince the thanks he meriteth from our acknowledgement. 'Tis he truly that should be called thy father. I have given thee so ill a birth, as I confesse thou hast cause to hate me; and Polexander having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd thee as he hath done, hath given thee one so transcendent, that he binds thee to serve him more then thine owne father. Andromeda interrupting the King her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, made appeare by her discourse that a mother speakes from the intrails, and that their affections are more quick and tender then those of the father. This private recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation being ended, Abrinzias desired the joy for it might be publique. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded therefore all his Subjects to give thanks to heaven, for so many happinesses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falne him in so small time, and for the better example, he himself went on foote from his Palace to the great Temple of Benin. Perseus was betwixt him and Polexander, and drew on him the benedictions even of those who not long before with just cause had ardently besought heaven for the punishment of his offences. Andromeda and Cydaria came after the three Princes, and were followed by all the Court and people. These actions of piety being ended, they proceeded to their rejoycings. The City and Court of Benin were two Theaters, where many dayes together was presented, all that a hearty joy was able to be made invented by men endowed with the greatest happinesse. Their joyes were increased by the newes Abrinzias receiv'd from Zabaim; and but for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander and Cydaria's departure they had farre longer continued. Osmin and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy imbark'd with their deere daughter, and though they promis'd to themselves farre lesse then they should have expected from Polexanders noblenesse, yet they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that after so many troubles and agitations their old age would at last finde a safe harbour. Our Heroe in that voyage found, that fortune is not lesse inconstant in her hatred then in her love. He sail'd along all the coast of Guinea with as favourable a gale as he could wish, and assoone as he needed it, the winde which was Easterly changed and became South. Whilst he went off from the Continent to get to the Isles of Cape Verd, he entertain'd himselfe sometimes with Cydaria, sometimes with Osmin, and then with the Castilian Gartias. But these diversions were not prevalent enough to master his longings. Alcippus who knew his melancholy, besought him to remember the promises which so many eminent and extraordinary men had made him; and to beleeve that at last Alcidiana's Isle would be no longer Inaccessible to him. I will no more flatter my selfe with these vaine hopes, replied Polexander. All thy false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets (my friend) have in their predictions consulted with no other heavens or Stars then our two desires. In this only they have beene good Divines; they have foreseene, that to please me, they must necessarily deceive me. They have done't; and simple as I am, I have contributed as much as they to that delusion. Thou seest too Alcippus what
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54727:204"/>
is come of it. I am brought to that passe as not to dare even to attempt such things as seeme not to me absolutely impossible. Sir, said Osmin, whilst you give way to such a timerous and distrustfull passion as love is, you shall be perpetually assaulted with new troubles and new feares. I have seene Almanzor in his fits. I have mark'd how he tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented himselfe even then when he had cause to thinke him very happy; and by that great example, I have knowne, that Lovers are a particular kinde of men which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to deceive themselves eternally. Adde to it (said Polexander) and to passe their whole lives in effective paines and imaginary pleasures. This discourse had continued longer, but Osmins Lady came to them much troubled, and said in an affrighted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that Cydaria was extreamely sick. Polexander ran to the Princesse Cabin, and found her not much better then Osmins wife related. She had neither pulse nor heate, and her eyes halfe turn'd in her head witness'd how much nature was oppressed. She was almost five or sixe howres in these imperfect convulsions, and but for Dicens remedies she had not (may be) gotten out of them. He imployd all his skill for her comfort, but all he did could not take away the disease. When she had recover'd her senses, and overcome the malignity of such vapours as infected the heart, she fell into a violent fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. After three dayes Diceus judged by the redoublings, it would be very dangerous and long; and besought the King his Master (to avoid the danger wherein the Princesse his Sister was) to land on the first Isle he should discover. Polexander oppos'd not so good an advise. He was too good a brother, not to lay by all his own occasions for the preservation of his Sister. He made his will knowne to the Pilot, and the next day he cast anchor in a roade of an Isle which some Geographers put amongst the Hesperides. Presently he sent some of his Officers ashoare, with all was needfull to lodge, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe landing, set up his pavilions in a very commodious place. That done, he went for Cydaria, and causing her to be very gently brought on shore, carried her into the Tent he had provided for her. For seven or eight dayes he stirr'd not farre from the sick La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But seeing her fever begin to yeeld to Diceus experience, he walk'd into the Island with Alcippus, Osmin and Gartias. One part of it he discover'd, and finding no other Inhabitants there but wilde beasts; (to passe away the time) he began to make warre with them. Almost every day he came to a wood which was not above three short miles from his tents, and under pretext of hunting, got away apart to meditate more at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now one day straying too farre in the wood, he was faine to passe there all the night. After he had long ruminated on his misfortunes, he lay downe and slept at the foot of a tree, but startlingly awaking, he thought that he heard some one bewailing, to which lending an eare, he heard these words: Weary thy selfe at last with so much unprofitable sorrow, and leave all sighes and teares to those which are unhappy, but not desperate like thy selfe. If thou couldest one day finde some remedy for the malady whereof thou so much languishest, I would advise thee to endure longer, and enterprise nothing against thy life. But since the gods and men are incapable of comforting thee; breake through this hard straite, and at last give over the being an uselesse Spectator of thy Princesse miseries. What sayest thou cowardly and disloyall Enemy to thy duty? Wouldst thou (to free thy selfe from the paines thou indurest) abandon a personage which should be more deare to thee then thy selfe? Live then, since thou canst not dye without being perfidious: but live as an offender should, who onely knowing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, is also alone both his owne Judge and hangman, and boldly executes on himselfe the punishment to which he is by his owne conscience condemned. The man had no sooner ended his lamenting, but he arose and made thence so fast, that Polexander could not stay him. He therefore ran after, and often call'd to get him tarry. But all his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and calling was as bootelesse as his footing. At last, wearied with so long and vaine a walke, he lay downe againe under a tree till 'twas day. O how to his content did he imploy that time! He thought continually on faire Alcidiana. He blest his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, since they proceeded from so noble a cause. He wish'd he might yet endure more; and pondering every foote the sentence of death she had pronounc'd against him: By what action, illustrious enough, (said he) faire Alcidiana, can I merit the punishment wherewithall your goodnesse rather then your Justice will recompence my most humble servitude? Why am I not permitted to finde a way to attaine to that supreame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:54727:205"/>
happinesse? But, miserable vagabond that I am, I may well wish, and make knowne my longings, but I shall never obtaine the favour of dying before her faire eyes! By this time 'twas day, yet was it not able to bring Polexander out of his meditations. Alcippus after his searching for him all night, by chance found him and disturbed his cogitations. Presently he arose and returned to his tents, where he found a great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment in his Sister; and to divert her, recounted the adventure he had met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Cydaria tooke pleasure in it, and wish'd him to send five or sixe men into that wood to discover the aboade of that unfortunate man which had such brave thoughts. Polexander having spent almost all the day with her, withdrew, and accompanied with Alcippus and Gartias, return'd to the wood with an intent to lye there once more rather then not satisfie his curiosity. He came to the same place (at least he thought so) where he had heard him he sought after, and passing through many pathes, at last met with an alley so covered that in the greatest heate of day, there was coolenesse enough not to be incommodated under so burning a climate. When he came to the end of it he saw the Sea, and perceived two women which with a slow pace were walking on the sands. He would have gone to them, but assoone as he was discover'd, one of them began to cry out as loud as she could, and drawing her Companion after her, made her run whether she would or no. Polexander seeing it, stopp'd short. Presently there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at the end of the alley a man, who going right to the women, and understanding from them the cause of their flight, straight left them, and came towards our Heroe with his sword drawne, who put himselfe in a posture to receive him. But assoone as he was neere enough to be knowne, he gave a great shout, and running to him with open armes, shew'd an extraordinary contentment in meeting him. The other instantly cast downe his sword, and imbracing our Heroe with a gentilenesse and meekenesse shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his admirable temper: Doe you (said he) yet know an unfortunate man, who had beene more so then he is, but for your exceeding pity? Polexander imbracing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, By what chance (said he) doe I meet you in a place so farre distant from that where I thought you? When I left you (replied the other) my intent was to get to this Island, where I found the party I sought: but to the end you may know my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints have beene alwayes just, come and see how extraordinary their cause is. With that he tooke up his sword, and led Polexander to the place where the two women were retired. When he came neere them, he addressed his speech to the youngest, and before Polexander saluted her: Madam, (said he) here is that Prince, without whose help I had never had the happinesse of seeing you againe. This is he of whom I have so often spoken to you, and whose misfortunes are able in their repetition to put off a while the feeling of your owne. At those words the Lady lifted up her eyes, and Polexander noted, that though they were very faire, yet she was blinde. He made no shew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking it, but admir'd her wit and judgement by the Speech she made him: At least he who was her Interpreter, spake in her name so excellently to our Heroe, that he was ravish'd at it; and witness'd it aloud by the answer he made her, and intreated his friend to interpret. This intertainement having lasted above a quarter of an howre, the faire blinde Lady stood a while silent, and thinking it time to retire, tooke leave of the two friends, and left them in an equall admiration of her vertue, and almost a like sorrow for her misfortune. Polexanders griefe was on the point of breaking out, but seeing the plenty of teares which fell from his friends eyes, he suppressed his owne compassion, that he might not increase the others sorrow, and be inhumane, by being desirous to appeare sensible. You should (said he) accustome your selfe to your misery, and thinke for your consolation that it is farre lesse then you imagine it, since you have recovered the best part of what you thought was all lost. I should be ingratefull (replied Zelmatida) both towards the gods and Izatida too if I did not confesse, I am infinitely bounden to them, and that they have extended their excessive bounty in that which concernes my owne person. Nor is it mine owne mishap I bewaile. 'Tis Izatida's misery that drawes these teares from mine eyes, and forbids me the sensibility of that contentment which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me by the happinesse of seeing her againe. No, no, Izatida, I shall never be happy whilst thou art not so; and the pleasure of being neere thee will never have power enough over me, to divert those sorrowes which thy blindnesse hath cast upon me. How
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54727:205"/>
doe I abhorre thee, thou accursed aboade, which hast for ever clouded with darknesse the onely light of my soule! Those last words touching Polexander in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, O heaven, cried he, where is my minde, and what is become of my memory? With that he left Zelmatida, and running to Gartias, was a while talking with him: which done, he return'd to Zelmatida, and shewing by his countenance, he brought him good newes: I have call'd to minde one thing (said he) which may (if the heavens will so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour you) make a great alteration in your fortune. But not to give you any hopes, which proving false, may make you more afflicted then you are; goe to Izatida, and intreate her she will make triall of a remedy which comes from that very place where she lost her sight. How Polexander! (replied Zelmatida) that cannot bee a remedy coming from so venimous a place, 'tis rather some new poyson, which doubtlesse will cause me to lose the remainder of Izatida. I do not condemne your feare, (said Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) but I will accuse you for not contributing all that you can for your owne comfort, if you doe not hazard on my word, a remedy, which can do Izatida no other wrong then to leave her as she is. Zelmatida, loath to contradict Polexander, for feare of fayling Izatida, and hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ing himselfe, went to the Princesse, and besought her by the greatnesse of her courage and excesse of her patience, to try a remedy which Polexander had propos'd to him for infallible. You both deserve (said she) that I should give you that vaine contentment. Yes Zelmatida, you shall have your request. Give your reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to my Governesse, and I promise you, this night we will make experiment of it. Zelmatida hereupon return'd to Polexander, and he had scarce told him that Izatida had yeelded to his petition, but Gartias came to them with a violl of very cleare water. He had beene at Polexanders ship to make the receipt, and omitted nothing of what he had seene practis'd by the Savages of the new world. He instructed the Prince how he should apply that water, and so gave it him; who presently went to Izatida's lodging, and suffer'd himselfe to be so flatter'd by his owne desires, that forgetting quite what he had spoken against that remedy, he durst assure Izatida, that it would infallibly restore her sight. She smil'd at his credulity, and to send him away satisfied, you shall see to morrow (said she) the operation of your medicine. Zelmatida straight gave the old Mexican the violl, and conjur'd her with an extreame affection that she would not faile to put some of that water on Izatida's eyes so soone as she should be laid. The gods grant (said the Mexican) that your medicine have as much vertue as I will have care in applying it. Thereupon the Princesse bad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> him good night, and prepar'd her self though she hoped for nothing from it, to suffer the incommodity which accompanies all kinde of medicines. Zelmatida the meane while came back to Polexander, and earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, to tell him from whom he had his receipt, and what assurance he had of its vertue. Our Heroe who knew by his owne experience, how dangerous and cruell it is to give false hopes to those which are (as it were) accustomed to hope for nothing: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will satisfie your curiosity, (said he) let us see what effect the water hath. If it have good successe, Gartias shall give you all the light of it you can desire; if not, you may well passe by the knowing the particularities of a thing which hath but wrong'd you. But Polexander (replied Zelmatida) if this remedy should have the vertue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing the sight, if it could cure Izatida, how happy should I be, and how great my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to your assistance? Truly I will presently ingage my selfe, to raise to you in Cusco a Temple even more stately then that of the Sun, and to make your name as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable amongst our Nation, as the names of those whom they adore. Yes Polexander, you shall be a Deity to me, and in all places where Fortune leads me, I will leave eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall remembrances of your blessed act and my acknowledgement. Our Heroe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Zelmatida, What (said he) are you not afraid that the jealous Deity which heares you should punish your impiety? and to be avenged on your Idolatry, suspend not the vertue of that remedy whereof it is the Author? Zelmatida affrighted with these menaces, intreated Polexander to appease the anger of that Deity, and obtaine the remission of his offence, since he had committed it out of ignorance. This confession (replied Polexander) will be of more efficacy then my prayers. Before that Power which is not lesse pitifull then jealous, he may be term'd innocent who repents for his misdeed. Go on in it, and resigning your selfe to the will of that Soveraigne Being
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54727:206"/>
which is solely to be adored, be assured your fortunes and my remedy will have a happy successe. Zelmatida, converted by this Speech, solemnely renounc'd his zeale to all his imaginary Divinities, and made a vow, if Izatida recover'd her sight, for ever to adore that Deity which Polexander had learnt him. This while it grew to be night, and that parted the two Princes. Zelmatida went to Izatida's Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e, and was all night waiting about the doore, not daring (so respectfull he was) to inquire of that which he expected with so much impatiency. Polexander who long'd as much as he, passed all the night very restlesse, and returned the next day to heare newes of his Receipt. He found Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida softly walking and attending the howre of the Princesse waking. They conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued their walke together, and their discourse having brought them into a geeat alley which was right against Izatida's lodge, there they made some turnes. At the fourth, they saw the Princesse come forth. She held the old Mexican by the band, and leant on the head of little Galtazis. At which sight Zelmatida became cold and wanne, and scarce being able to stand, Alas! Polexander, said he, your remedy hath beene no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the rest, and that Deity whom I have offended, will not have thanks from a tongue so prophane as mine. Izatida is as she was yesterday. You imagine all that you say, (replied Polexander) let's goe neere and see whether your feares and griefes are just or no. Zelmatida would have walk'd, but his legs so trembled under him that he was forc'd to leane against a tree, and do Polexander what he could to resettle him, yet his fainting still increased. By little and little he lost all sense, and so swounded and fell downe on the grasse. Alcippus and Diceus ran to Polexanders call, and went for water to recover Zelmatida. Galtazis perceiving the stirre, imagin'd straight what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was. Something (said he to the Princesse) is misbefalne Zelmatida. All his friends are troubled, and run (questionlesse) for some remedy. I infinitely bewaile that poore Prince, said Izatida. The agitations which his heate of spirit brings on him, are the onely enemies which he yet could never vanquish. But let us not suffer him longer in paine since we canfree him from it. With that she kept on her way, and came to the Prince before Diceus had recover'd him from his swound. Polexander who was on his knees to hold up the others head, arose when he saw the Princesse within some twenty paces of him, and going to meet her, noted so much neatnesse and grace in her dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, that he conjectur'd what was betided. She had on a robe and bodies of those faire Mexican stuffes which by the shadowings of feathers mingled with silver and gold threads resembled to the life all kinde of flowers. [This garment after the fashion of Mexico came but to the halfe of her leg, which had nothing on but buskins imbroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with pearles and rubies.] Her sleeves were of a kinde of silver tiffany cut in bands, and joyn'd together with Diamond buttons. Her breast was cover'd with a very thin and white cobweb Lawne, on which her haire waved black and full. Her head dressing not so rich as delicate, was of ropes of pearle and plumes, which making a kinde of crowne on the top of her head, fell backward and on the sides with so much gracefulnesse, that it seem'd to make Art dispute with Nature for those advantages she had bestow'd on that Princesse. Polexander could not looke on her without admiration, and did to her the same civilities he would have done if he had certainely knowne she was not blinde. But being not able to make himselfe understood, he spake to her by signes, and invited her to goe neerer the Prince. Garruca who was come to aide his Master, perceiving the Princesse so adorn'd: My Lord (cried he in Zelmatida's eare) open your eyes, and see the wondrous remedy which heaven hath sent you. O what happy moments do you lose! Izatida bade Garruca be silent, and inly touch'd with the Princes affliction, Must (said she very softly) this Prince be for ever in woe and misery, and must that which he most wisheth for, no lesse torment him then what he most feares? With that she intreated Garruca to let her know how this fit befell his Master, and he having heard it from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, Madam, (said he) assoone as my Master saw you betweene Mexiqua and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazis, he thought Polexanders receipt had taken no effect, and that beliefe brought him into the case you now see him. Izatida answered not Garruca, but turning away her head strove to hide those teares which just pity drew from her eyes. In the meane time Diceus with much pains got Zelmatida's spirits from their deep dulnesse, and gave them part of their usuall function. The Prince opening his mouth sooner then his eyes, let
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54727:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them know by a confused talking what disorder'd things (during his fainting) had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves to his sick imagination. 'Tis then resolv'd (said he) that your faire eyes shall be for ever shut up in darkenesse, and that my soule which had no other day but what it receiv'd thence, must vainely hope to see the period of that night where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is inveloped. O thou Prophet of my misfortunes, how true are thy predictions! and what monstrous Imposters were they, who assured me that I should one day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that treasure which Quasmez hath lost! Thou seest not at all, Izatida, and perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that I am, I take pleasure in light. Garruca hindring the prosecution of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; My Lord, (said he) come out of those imaginations wherein your misfortune retaines you; come to your selfe, and looke on the Princesse who assures you of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. Those words wrought so great an effect on Zelmatida's spirit, that he arose, and perceiving Izatida, cast himselfe at her feet, to render thanks for her care of him. The Princesse raysing him, At last (said she) your prayers have beene heard, and Polexanders remedy hath restor'd you that sight which you have so long wish'd for. I see Zelmatida, and to witnesse how deare all is to me that concernes you, I have dressed my selfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly to bring you that good newes. Doe you then see Madam? (said Zelmatida) O that happinesse is too great to be believ'd. With that he grew pale, and his excesse of joy causing new troubles in his spirit, depriv'd him instantly of his sight, strength and knowledge, and so he fell againe into his former fainting. But since the resentments occasioned by griefe, grapple more strongly with our soules then those of joy; Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida was lesse while in this swoune then in the former. He came absolutely to himselfe; and looking on Polexander, with eyes which were not onely witnesses but Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his contentment: Yes, (said he) you shall have those Temples I promis'd you, and shall be adored as a Deity in all places where the Yuca's reigne over the minds of men. That Soveraigne Being, whose Justice you have made me feare, would be avenged of my ingratitude, if (having made me happy by your meanes) I should not looke on you as the Dispenser of its favours, and a supernaturall Instrument by which it worketh miracles. He gave not Polexander time to answer him, but return'd to Izatida, and spake to her words so neere approaching impiety, that she thought heaven would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them by a second blindnesse, yea even by some worse chastisement. But that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall providence which knowes all humane frailty, and hath suffer'd them, for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of its love and pity (which holds there the place of Justice) towards us mortals, would not punish such faults, as were more worthy compassion then anger. Yet would it by new disquiets which it cast into Zelmatida's thoughts, hinder the continuation of his errors, and temperate the excesse of his contentment. Scarce therefore had the Prince time to taste the joy he receiv'd in Izatida's recovery, but Quasmez afflictions &amp; Xaira's captivity coming to his remembrance he fell into his former displeasures. He felt in himselfe, that he had not, either his violent griefe, or that urging despaire which Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida's blindnesse threw on him; yet he suffered very much, and the remembrance of Quasmez and his daughter tooke from him the most delectable sense of his felicity. Izatida tooke notice of this alteration, Polexander was too cleere sighted not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and the aged Mexiqua standing opposite to him, not onely had heard him sigh, but thought she had understood him pronounce the name of Quasmez. Presently she came to Izatida, and intimating she would discover some important secret to her. Give me audience (said she) and quickly preparing your selves to believe a verity which at first will seeme to you incredible, drive farre from you all heavinesse and griefes wherewithall an ancient error hath so many yeares crossed the happinesse of your dayes. And thou O Prince which art arriv'd to that fatall point, where thou shalt see the intire recompence of thy long fidelity, (with that she turn'd to Zelmatida) put an end to those conflicts which the love of Izatida, and thy hearty well-wishing to Quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mez renew in thy minde. I here make knowne, that you shall all three have your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; and that the same day wherein Izatida was to recover her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ight, Quasmez was to have his daughter againe, and Zelmatida equally satisfie both the one and the other. Do not thinke I invent fine fictions to divert your sorrowes. If Montezuma were here, he would confirme what I tell you; and if you, Izatida, call to minde the last words of cruell
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54727:207"/>
Hismelita, you will not doubt of the verity of mine. Is it not true, that a while after you were imprisoned in the lake of Mexico, she came to tell you, and calling you the fatall torch that should set all her Empire on fire: Goe (said she) thou stranger, goe, and lose thy life by other hands then mine, since the Power I worship will not have me imbrew them in thy bloud? This Speech savouring nought of a mother, how inhumane soever, makes it appeare plainely, that Hismelita never consider'd you otherwise then as an enemy on whom her gods would not permit her to be avenged. But I am too slow in contenting your longings, and publishing your happinesse. Know then that Izatida is the same Xaira, who being stolne away in her cradle by Montezuma's servants, was delivered to my custody assoone as she was brought to Mexico. Zelmatida heard this narration with such a trouble and such an over-joy, that after she had done, he thought he had dreamt of the wonders he had heard. He tried to speake, to intreate Mexiqua that shee would relate it him over againe, but hee could not frame a word; and a while stood so extreamely tortur'd with his happinesse that Polexander pittied him. For Izatida she shew'd her joy, (but with a great deale of moderation) for not being Montezuma's daughter, and lifting her eyes to heaven, her eyes that were not yet well accustomed to revive the light; O incomprehensible Wisdome (said she) which by admirable secrecies, and counsels of love and sweetnesse disposest soveraignely of all thy creatures fortunes; give thy selfe thanks for the benefits I have received thence; for I am as unable to doe it, as I was unworthy to receive them. These are effects of thy eternall power, which in one day hath redeem'd me out of all my blindnesses. I know now to whom I owe my life; and by that knowledge, see those feares dissipated which Hismelita's maledictions threw on me. I did ever believe (quoth Zelmatida, interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting her) that weake Montezuma and cruell Hismelita had contributed nothing to your birth. She is too faire to come from them—As he was going on Izatida stopp'd him, and her goodnesse not induring any should speake ill, no not of her very enemies, Confesse (said she) that Montezuma hath been very mercifull, and Hismelita had much power over her selfe, since they suffered not themselves to be transported by the just causes they had to hate me; but rather chose to hazard their Crowne then deprive me of my life. 'Twas brutishnesse and superstition (replied Zelmatida) which restrain'd Hismelita's fury, or rather, 'tis the hand of all powerfull heaven, the Protector of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence which hath disarm'd that of our enemies. The threatnings they had from the mouth of their Prophets, were too terrible for Hismelita not to be affrighted at them, or not defist from her cruell resolution. I am obliged (said Izatida) to publish every where, that I doe not onely owe her my life, but the quality of Princesse, since she might (if she had listed) have given me no other breeding then the worst of her Slaves. Zelmatida perceiv'd well that he was not to goe further with that discourse. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore replied not out of respect and complaisancy, but turn'd to Polexander to invite him to take part in his joy. Our Heroe forgot his owne disasters, to be sensible of his friends contentment. Garruca had told him the cause in interpreting to him Mexiqua's nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and wonne him to receive this great and good chance as a presage that he should not be alwaies unfortunate. Zelmatida discoursing a while with him, began againe to intertaine Izatida, and finding himselfe stung and put on by so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e new desire which he durst not discover to the Princesse; to give her some notice of it, Doe not (said he) suffer a Prince and Princesse (to whom I owe almost as much as to your selfe) languish any longer. The good Quasmez is my father aswell as yours, and if the Queene your mother had not looked on me as her Son, the great Guina Capa would never have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged me for his. Your desires are just, (replied the Princesse) and mine which should have prevented them intreate their accomplishment. Restore to Quasmez that Xaira which hath cost you so much trouble, and hasten as much as you can to discharge your selfe of a burthen which should now begin to be troublesome unto you. Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida had not beene without an answer on so faire an occasion, but that the Princesse (the second time) impos'd him silence. Polexander, unwilling to leave these lovers any longer in their great solitarinesse, invited them to walke to his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Her arrivall gave so great comfort to the sick Lady, that after three or foure dayes of her company she found her selfe perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. They were yet ten or twelve dayes together, and not onely tasted such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible sweetnesse in their communication, but made the two Princes partake so much of it, that Polexander might have term'd himselfe happy, if he could have beene so, and beene out of hope of reseeing Alcidiana. Zelmatida (in the meane time) thought of his returne, and how extraordinary soever his joy was, he never gave him self so much absolutely over to it, but that he hast'ned his workemen to put his ship in case, to make once againe a voyage to the new world. But before he parted, he would needs try (by Polexanders meanes) an affaire, which he thought of himselfe he was not able to resolve on. To that end, he besought our Heroe, to fit his Sister so (by an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) as she might sound into Izatida's minde, and (if it could be possible) get her a little to unfold her selfe. Polexander promis'd him to doe his utmost for his contentment; and indeed put it on so earnestly and with so much affection, that Cydaria yeelded to what he desired. One day therefore being with Izatida, she made her by little a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> little fall into Zelmatida's discourse, and passing from the greatnesse of her birth to that of her happinesse, told her that she wanted but two things to make her perfectly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. The one was, to be with her father and mother after so long an exile, and the other, to end her life in the company of Zelmatida. For the first, (replied Izatida) 'tis so necessary to my happinesse, that in fayling of that, I sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ll never be so. For the other, I confesse, that without ingratitude, I can finde nothing which should trouble me in the company of a personage, who for these five yeares hath done nothing, nor thought of nothing but for me. But when I call to minde, that to satisfie him, I must prepare my selfe to lose my parents, assoone as I have found them, I cannot be of your opinion. Izatida thus ended, when the two Princes came in where they were. At sight of them, she repented her of what she had said, for feare lest if Zelmatida should come to the knowledge of it, he might finde new cause of affliction. She was therefore desirous to prevent that mischiefe, and Polexander giving a faire occasion of explicating her thoughts: I take to witnesse (said she to Zelmatida) that Deity which with his presence fils all the parts of nature, that I wish your contentment with the same fervency of affection wherewithall I desire to see those who gave me life. Next to them two, you shall have the first place in my heart. I will beare you the same respect, and hold you in the like esteeme as Nature injoynes me for them: and promise you in presence of this Prince and Princesse, that I will beseech them (assoone as it shall be fitting) never to dispose of me, unlesse that disposition be first pleasing to you. Zelmatida transported with joy at such obliging promises, fell at Iza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida's feet, and I (said he) here sweare by the same Deity you invok'd, never to wish any thing more then to see you perfectly contented. Polexander and Cydaria, much pleased that their negotiation had so good an issue, congratulated with the one and the other the union of their affections. And would needs before they parted, celebrate the feast of these spirituall Nuptials. For two dayes together there was nothing else done: but on the third, a new sorrow succeeded their joy. They were to part. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander and Zelmatida, though they were to take leave, never to see one another againe, found in their discretions, and in the strength of their soules, so much constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as was necessary for so cruell a separation. But the two Princesses being of a more milde nature, and lesse capable of a high resolution, had all the paines that could be to winne themselves to it. A hundred times they bad farewell, and as often weeping,

Our Heroe presently call'd to minde the lamentable end of so generous a Prince. And to acquit him of that which he owed his memory, landed, with a resolution to visit his tombe. He made his intention knowne to Cydaria, and invited her to that action of piety. But the Princesse who knew but one Almanzor, was so startled to heare of his death, that her griefe betraying her discretion, she grew pale, and withall intreated Polexander to relate, by what accident that Prince dyed so farre from his owne Country. His extreame generosity lost him, (replied our Heroe) and himselfe turning against himselfe that great courage which hath made him so famous, chose rather to lose his life, then to live and not see the faire subject of his passions. Cydaria strove extreamely with her selfe to resist the effects of this sad newes. Yet could she not hold that command over her first agitations which she was wont to do on other occasions; and shewing she was subject as others to the weakenesse of humane condition. How doe I (said she) grieve for Andromeda, and pity Abrinzias? At that word Polexander perceiving his Sisters errour; Do not bewaile those Princes, (said he) that Almanzor of whom I speake is indeed the Son of Zabaim, but not of Almanzaira. He whom you thinke on, is living, and if appearances deceive me not, at this time reignes over almost all those provinces which we have coasted along by since we came from Benin. Cydaria, angry with her selfe, for appearing so weake on an occasion wherein she would have shewed her selfe strongest, condemn'd her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She was loath Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander should perceive these last emotions; she therefore went ashore with him, and accompanying him to Almanzors tombe, intimated an extreame desire of hearing the particularities of his History.

He had scarce ended his discourse when he entred the wood of weeping trees, in the midst whereof was the stately tombe of the African Prince, and giving to Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daria's curiosity that which he would not have done to his owne, began to consider the rich monuments of his Rivals love. He went neere to two blacke marble columnes which stood at the entry into the Tombe, and staid to reade that which was written on a great table of brasse, which two Doves flying from the tops of those pillers, seem'd to carry away with them. He straight knew it to be Almanzors Epitaph, which the trusty
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54727:210"/>
Almandarin had caus'd to be graven on the brasse: and because it was in a language which Cydaria understood not, he translated it thus:

The heavens have done well (said Polexander) onely to shew thee to the world, since they had no intent to lose those prerogatives which they have above it. With that he opened the golden grate which shut up the Tombe, and entring with his Sister, stood a good while fix'd, contemplating the marble which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Almanzors body. He curiously ey'd the Statues, mark'd the Emblemes and Mottoes, and saw every where, signes of a great courage, of an incomparable love, and a desperate melancholy which had nothing in it of base or brutishnesse. Amongst all these things he saw some Arabick characters; and calling Cydaria to interpret them to her: Hearken (said he) to Almanzors brave thoughts when he had lost all hope of seeing Alcidiana. He hath caus'd it to be ingraven on this Tombe. Judge whether it be not fit to be observed.

               <p>Whilst our Heroe was making amourous Comments on Almanzors testament; Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daria went to see a little Altar which was in the chiefe front of the Tombe. Upon it were foure statues of marble. Some lay along, and others sate. Two represented the Pleasures as well by their youth, their mirthsomenesse, (somewhat alaid with a kinde of sadnesse) and their Crownes of roses, as by the Instruments of Musick which lay at their feet. And the two other, by the many Crownes on their armes, and the Diamonds, Pearles, and other Jewels which they carelesly let fall from their hands, plainely enough intimated, they were Magnificence and Majesty. They, all foure, held a great heart of Albaster, and speaking by a Roll of brasse hanging downe from the same hands which held the heart, thus seem'd to expresse their thoughts:

               <p>Polexander and Cydaria unwilling to stay longer among so many causes of sadnesse, retir'd into the most obscure part of the Sepulcher; and not thinking it an offence to implore heaven for a miserable soule, besought it with teares, to convert its justice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mercy, and save him, who like a mad-sick man had taken poyson in thinking to take a wholesome potion. Their prayers once ended; they came out of the Tombe, where they found Osmin and Alcippus, who by their action made knowne how much they were astonish'd. Osmin spake first, who shewing his admiration, proceeded from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else then Almanzors Sepulcher: This Isle (said he to Polexander) may rather be call'd the Isle of Tombes, then the Isle of Fer. I cannot conceive through what urgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy so many unfortunate people should be compell'd hither to graspe with death. About fifty paces hence, you may see if you please to walke thither, foure Monuments, under which are interr'd so many Spaniards, which are called by the Inscriptions, the foure Lovers of the Princesse Benzaida. A little further we have seene a Sepulchre, as meane, as this is stately. The outside, which is painted black, and powdred all over with flames and teares, made well guess'd what horrour there might be within. In the midst is an Inscription, which neither Alcippus nor my selfe can understand. Cydaria besought her brother to goe see this novelty, and getting his consent, march'd foremost to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie her longing. Polexander, after he had seene the foure Spaniards Tombes, went to the last; and presently spied the Characters which neither Osmin nor Alcippus could decipher. He thought it not strange, for 'twas Slavonique, ill enough done, to puzzle more understanding men then they in the knowledge of languages. He turn'd to Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daria, after he had twice or thrice read it over; and assuring her she was to heare some very strange thing: Do you see (said he) the letters drawne on that linnen which two Cupids crowned with myrtle and Cypresse, hold in so mournefull a posture, and looke on with so much griefe that the teares fall from their eyes? they tell us, that Sepulcher is the Monument of two Sisters. The other Inscription which is incompass'd with trophies of love, troden under foote by death, and cruelty, and sowne with golden flames and silver teares, is the Epitaph of those two Princesses. This is the Explication word for word:
<q>TO THE ETERNALL MEMORY OF <hi>HISTERIA</hi> AND <hi>MELICERTA'S</hi> MISFORTUNES. AND TO THE PERPETUALL SHAME OF THE INSENSIBLE <hi>SOLIMAN.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>ONe same instant brought us into the light, and one and the same Destiny giving us equall inclinations, made us alike misfortunate. Death hath not sever'd those, who by birth and fate were knit in so strong a ligament. They are buried in one grave, and have done that by Election which Nature had done by Chance. Thy curiosity (Reader)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54727:211"/>
is not (may be) satisfied with these generall notions. See wherewithall to content it. Yet, if causes exacting teares, comply not with thy humour, turne thine eyes away from these following lines, and give way no more to a desire that shall be so mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thee. But for all this, thou wilt weep, and no admonitions can coole thy charity: Well then, reade on; and marke seriously with what rigour and command, both the senses and passions do tyrannize o're all rationall soules. The greatnesse of our births, raysing us above all the Princesses of the world, seem'd to have establish'd us in a feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which could not be travers'd by the injuries of earth or heaven. But, O the vanity of humane condition! what all the strength of the Universe could not execute, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse alone hath done it; and Fortune, to surprise us, made use of that which we neither ought to feare or foresee. A Slave hath triumph'd over our liberties; and he whose life was at our disposall hath seene us at his feet, shamefully begging the continuance of our owne. 'Tis true, the mercilesse Solyman hath seene us implore his clemency and with teares beseech him he would afford us the honour of living his slaves. Neither birth, beauty nor love, no nor vertue it selfe, could obtaine any thing from that rock. He saw the constant Hysteria dye, and was no more capable of pity then he was of love. Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa surviv'd her Sister, but 'twas onely to outlive all her hopes. She hath beene infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to intombe her selfe alive within this Sepulcher, to finde in death that compassion, which she could not meet withall in ingratefull Solyman. 'Tis enough (Passenger) we should be as mercilesse as he, if we kept thee longer in the affliction of reading this. Go then in peace, and if it be possible, obtaine from heaven, that our second life may be more happy then our former.</p>
               <p>After Polexander had read this Epitaph, seeing his sister so much mov'd at it, was willing to withdraw her from those mournfull places, though he depriv'd himselfe of the contentment he receiv'd among the Monuments of so many desperate lovers: But Alcippus entering on a sudden with an affrighted countenance, ingag'd Polexander to inquire of him the cause of his astonishment: 'tis so strange said he, that the more I call to minde, the more I doubt of it; mine eyes and eares which assure me of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perswade me; and I should beleeve I dream't, if the thing were not yet before me. And whence come you (said Polexander) that in so short a time you have seene that which is so prodigious? This Island (replied Alcippus) is not onely dreadfull, for the tombes we see in it, but farre more for the frightfull apparitions: Without doubt (said Polexander to his sister) Alcippus hath seen the soule of some one of those poore lovers which are interr'd in these Monuments. Alcippus perceiving by Polexanders words as well as by his countenance, that he jeasted with him: You may thinke what you please (said he) of my fear and beliefe; but I am either still asleep, or I saw but just now with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Sepulchre, (shewing that of the two sisters) a spirit, which walkes up and down, and talkes. How, (said Polexander) for heavens sake Alcippus, relate that strange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, and in what shape that spirit appear'd to you: Your Majesty (replied Alcippus) askes me that questions only to laugh at my fearfulnesse; notwithstanding I will make appeare by my obedience, that all your Commands are sacred to me, and so tell you, That there is something I know not what of very strange, but of very true in my vision. Whilst you were busie in decyphering the Characters, which are painted on the wall, I had a great minde to make a turne about the building, to see whether there were any overture by which it was to be entred: I look'd so narrowly, that at last I found a little dore, which (as it were) opening of it selfe, to punish my curiosity, (at least I thinke so) shewed me such things, as I have much adoe to beleeve, though I saw them: The inner part of this building is lightned with some few lampes, whose gloomy light seems as afraid to drive thence the darknesse; by the light of those little fires I went in, and though feare somewhat hindered me from well remarking what was about me; yet I saw a great Hearse covered with cloth of gold, and rail'd in with ballisters of silver: I gaz'd on these rich ornaments very heedfully, when I saw come behinde that Hearse, a pale shadow, disfigured, and covered with a long black vestment: this Ghost drew neer me so slowly, as it seem'd not to walke, and when it was come neere the raile, Who e're thou be (it said with a weake voyce) which darest disturb the peace of the dead, and profane the sanctity of Monuments; art thou not sent by cruell Solyman to see whether
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54727:212"/>
his insensibility be not felt of us after our deaths, and his tyranny extended to our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres? If so, returne to that inhumane wretch, and tell him, that though we left to live, we gave not over to love. That Histeria preserves yet that fire which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd her to ashes, and Melicerta as an amarous and lamenting shadow, wanders about her sisters tombe; and in sullen darknesse expects when the fire, which by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle burnes her, shall make an end of consuming her. I must truely confesse to you (said Alcippus) I was stricken with such a terrour, hearing this Ghost speake, that I was not possibly able either to answer it, nor get from the place where my affright had (as it were) fix'd me: this Ghost, seeing I stirr'd not, gave me a blow on the breast, and so terrified me, that my tongue which had (by my first scaring) been lockt up, got at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty by this second. If (said I then trembling) it be true, that Spirits, disrob'd of their bodies loade, know the most conceal'd intentions, and even penetrate into the thoughts of the living; you then see, O infortunate soule, that my designes are innocent, and if I am guilty, 'tis but of a little curiosity. Get then (repli'd the Shade) out of a place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated for none but offenders; and if thy heart belie not thy tongue, publish out of these Islands, that the two Grand-children of the great Bajazet in one same tombe, doe a long and a cruell penance for their love to the insensible Solyman. With all my heart I obeyed the Spirit's command, and wishing it a happy end of all its violent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances, got out of the Sepulchre with such an affrightment, as I am scarce yet come to my selfe. Polexander was the more astonished at Alcippus relation because it intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed with that which was contained in the Epitaph he last read. In this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he resolv'd to try the adventure of the tombe, to see whether that amorous Ghost would appeare as well to him as to Alcippus: yet would he not have his resolution be taken for any thing serious; therefore addressing himselfe to his sister, Let's (said he) see all the rarities of this Isle, and doe you show Alcippus that you are more courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then he: It shall be (said she) if you please upon some other occasion, that I will dispute courages with Alcippus; in this I yeeld him the victory, though his affright tels me he is not hard to be conquer'd. Well then (said Polexander smiling) I will trie alone whether I am more valiant then you both; with that he left Cydaria and went to the little dore by which Alcippus got into the tombe: He opened it and being come so far as the raile of pillars, first heard a many sighes, then a little while after, a voyce, which in all likelihood came from within the Hearse; Solyman (said it) hard-hearted Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom neither the beauty of Hysteria, nor affection of Melicerta, was able to move; and who more hard and impassible then the rockes of these cliffes, hast with a dry eye beheld the shedding both of the teares and bloud of these two miserable sisters; Wilt not thou at last put on a humane nature? Shall that beauty and grace of thine (which hath inflamed even within the Grand Signior's Seraglio) be for ever of those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated sweetnesses which the Sculpters art gives life to, in brasse and marble? No, no, thou shalt not triumph unpunished o're so many liberties which thy allurements have subdued; Heaven's Justice reserves for thee some great chastisement; our teares shall be avenged, and thou shalt feele what 'tis to love without a reciprocall affection. And if my hopes deceive me not, I will not make an end of dying, till I have the happinesse of feeding mine eyes on that inhumane heart, which like a Tyger, hungry after others hearts, never takes them but to devoure them. But ô thou comeliest and fairest of men, and the most worthy to be beloved, pardon a troubled soule, those reproaches and threatnings she makes thee contrary to her owne heart! She begs for it forgivenesse from thee, and beseecheth that all-powerfull Spirit, which presideth over all worldly events, that to save thee from those miseries she wisheth thee, it would reserve them all, to increase (if it be possible) the number of those which shee hath already suffered. There the voice ended; It was followed with a great many sighes, which seem'd to come from all corners of that sad abiding. Polexander had not so much power on him selfe to suppresse his first agitations, but that he felt a kind of chillnesse, which running about all his body, made his flesh to tremble; yet so, that it neither troubled his minde nor judgement. He thought a while on what he had heard, and made a little noise, that he might as well satisfie his eyes as his eares: presently he saw come out from behinde the tombe, an apparition like to that Alcippus had describ'd to him; he was extreamely
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54727:212"/>
pleas'd at that sight, and not doubting but it was a Spirit, resolv'd to aske it newes of what was to come; and to know whether he should give over the hope of seeing Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana againe: when therefore he saw the Ghost neere enough to him, Be not offended (said he) faire soule, (who even in the grave retainest thy love and fidelity) if I disturb the peace and silence of this sad abode: unfortunate lover that I am, I seeke every where for some one, that may instruct me by what way I may return towards the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and worthy cause of my flames and afflictions. If pity have any place in thee (amorous Spirit) be favourable to a man full of love! Help a wretch which wanders sea and land without regaining the blisse he hath lost; and tell him, whether Time reserves nought for him, but death for the end of all his miseries.

This speech amaz'd Polexander more then the former had done, or the thought he had of that miserable mayden: and looking on her, as on something more strange then a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasme: Who will ever beleeve (said he) that your love to an ingratefull man, hath been able to worke in you so prodigious a perseverance, as to make your selfe an enemy to light, life, and your selfe, only to preserve your heart for an unmercifull man who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes it? Goe not on in these revilings (repli'd the mayden) I love the cruell Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man too well to suffer him to be censured; his rigours are pleasing to me, his insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility augments my passion; I am all fire, because he is all ice: But let us breake off a discourse which neither merits thy paines nor mine. Since thou art in love, get farre away from these aboades which are so mortall to Lovers, and trouble no longer the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy peace of two poore Sisters, who have met with none from the time of their birth. I wish (Madam) replied Polexander, it were fitting to obey you. I should then be farre from interrupting by my presence, the repose you finde in your selfe-persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I know by a long and rigorous experience, that consolations are new griefes to afflicted soules; and the greatest enemies the misfortunate meet withall, are, those indiscreet Counsellours, who would perswade them, they should leave to be sicke as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as they should cease to refuse the remedies. But when I call to minde what my birth and profession bindes me to, I finde my selfe compell'd to continue troublesome, and to intreat you, by that ingratefull man you too-much love, to let me know if there be no meanes left to you to be avenged of his ingratitude. I have vowed (said the desolate Lady) never to discover my griefe, but on a condition, to which I thinke it not just to ingage you. How strange soever that condition be (repli'd Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I subscribe to it, provided I may execute it, and not be faithlesse and disloyall. Your generousnes (quoth the Lady) revives those hopes which were with me buried in this tombe. I imagine you may bring some ease to my afflictions, and I may finde their end, if I left to you the guidance of my fortune. I therefore accept your offer; and even now, make you the Judge betwixt Solyman and my selfe, and condemne me voluntarily to finish my miserable life, farre from those faire eyes, which sometime inlightned my Soule, if my pretentions and prosecution appeare not as equitable as they may seeme strange unto you. After the Lady had ended this Speech, she opened the place inclosed by the ballisters, and taking Polexander by the hand: Let us (said she) goe hence into another place not farre off: we shall there finde a place more fit to entertaine our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; she walked whilst she spoke thus, and Polexander who led her, saw come from out the sides of the tombe, two maydens, clad like the former, which slowly and soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed her, and seem'd by their action, they were not loath to abandon so sad an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. Assoone as Polexander was out of that obscurity which shaded the beauties of the desolate Lady, he found them so extraordinary, as he began, in good earnest, to hate the ingratefull person that had despis'd them: He took too from thence a new occasion to entertaine the Lady, and intimating to her his admiration; That barbarian (said hee) who could look on so much attraction, and yet preserve his infamous liberty, was surely borne among those horrible rockes, which an eternall winter covers with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

corner of Scythia. Turkes are naturally cruell and unpitifull, but they are not insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the furious tyrants, who in their unjust anger spare nor age nor sex, yet have hearts capable of love, and to please their slaves, can sometime lose the title of master and conquerour. If any allurement (repli'd the afflicted Lady) could have mov'd the heart of insensible Solyman, it must have beene more powerfull then my sister's or my beauty: neither have we pretended thereby, to gaine to us that great heart, who as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate as he is, can neither be accused of savagenes nor barbarisme. He is no Turk but by the injustice of his fortune, nature hath made him born from a Prince who was no lesse polite then courageous; and both France and Greece which have equally contributed, to his birth, publish, who shall most, that if Solyman had not the great Polexander for his brother, he should be held the first of men. Madam (said the Prince) you amaze me, to have so much love and goodnesse for one so ingratefull, as should have exhausted all: But who should that Solyman be, halfe Greeke and halfe French? Was it not the sonne of the unfortunate Periander, whom the cruell Usurper of Constantinople, even feared in his fetters? You know (repli'd the Princesse) the amiable author of our long afflictions. 'Tis that Prince happy in his misfortunes, who changing his name of Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus for that of Solyman, exchanged his prison for the favour of the redoubtfull Baiazet; and is found susceptible of all kind of alteration, excepting that which may be advantagious to my sister or my selfe. Polexander had more particularly inform'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of his brother's adventures, had he not seene Cydaria, who all affrighted with the seeing him conversing with that faire apparition, drew backe still as he came towards her: He beckned to her to stay, but her minde preoccupated by a false beliefe, would not let her know the truth. Polexander, willing to divert the Princesse whom hee led Here (said he) you see the sister of the insensible Solyman: but one of my servants per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading her that you were a Ghost, she is so affrighted with it, that she even dares not be so hardy as to come neere you. At the words of Solyman's sister, the desolate faire one ran to imbrace Cydaria, and to see in her face some resemblance of him she so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately loved. But Cydaria imagining the Phantasme came to catch hold of her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to run away; and if Polexander by his calling had not staid her, and the afflicted Princesse not stood still, there had bin cause enough of laughter among so much of joy. The Prince went first to his sister, and in few words bringing her out of her errour, won her to meet the Princesse whom she had taken for a Ghost, and to let her know that she was Solymans Sister, by something else then neglect. Cydaria, although she were not absolutely recollected, obey'd her brother; and when she was come within a few paces of the sad Lady, turn'd up the vaile which cover'd her face. No sooner did the afflicted Lady looke on her, but she gave a great shrieke; O heaven! (cried she) this is not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymans Sister I see, but Solyman himselfe. This imagination was so powerfull over her, as comming up neerer to Cydaria, and speaking to her as she had beene Solyman: Amiable but insensible Solyman, (said she) com'st thou under this strange habit to see whether my affection be true or fained? But, O how well this question shews that I know thee not yet? Thou wouldst have some sense, if not of love, at least of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if thou wert curious enough to know whether thou wert beloved. No, thou com'st not hither with that innocent intention. Thou wouldst feed thine eyes with the tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call end of the youngest as well as with that of the eldest. Thou art afraid that she either wants strength or courage; and charitable enemy as thou art, thou comest to offer thy sword and thine arme, to take away from her all pretext of longer preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that lifewhich is so odious unto thee. Cydaria, who knew nothing of the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Ladies love, was not in a little perplexity how to answer her. But Polexander replied, and assur'd the Princesse, that Cydaria was indeed Solymans Sister, and were so like that they had already beene often taken the one for the other. Cydaria, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what her brother had spoken, came and kissed the sad Princesse, and out of pity letting fall some teares: Forget (said she) that Solyman, who through his ingratitude hath shew'd himselfe so unworthy of your memory, and who doubtlesly hath taken on him the nature of a Turke as well as his habit. I make no more question of it (said the desolate-loving Lady) but thinke you are not Solyman. That cruell man hath never had pity enough to be so sensible as you seeme; nor to mitigate (by his suffering with me
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54727:213"/>
even by one sole word) those fearefull afflictions whereto his love and rigour have so often expos'd me. With that she tooke Cydaria by the hand and brought her (with Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander) into a house, about a hundred paces from the tombe, there she led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a chamber hung with black, and after a little silence: I must of necessity (said she) relate to you all those accidents wherewith Love and Fortune have traversed the live of the father and his daughters; to the end I may have this miserable consolation in my misfortunes, to hinder the memory of them from perishing with me. You shall heare so wonderfull occurrences that if you have not in your self felt the strange and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous events to which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Love, but that love arm'd with darts as in piercing the heart, troubles the spirits, &amp; drives them to their utmost extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies, begun the miseries of our family: the valiant and generous Antenor our father, seem'd to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He was in the flowre of his age fear'd of the Turks, ador'd of the Sclavoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and recommendable by diverse victories, when he went into Servia, to sweare a strict League betweene the inhabitants of that Province and the Sclavonians. But whilst he imployed his best wits to deliver his Subjects from the Ottoman slavery, hee took not heed, that a greater Tyrant more cunning and cruell then all the Turkes together, was provi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ng a servitude farre more dismall for him. The Despote of Servia had a daughter perfectly faire. The admirable lustre of her complexion even made that of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's pale againe. She had a fire on her cheeks, whence it seem'd her eyes borrowed their light wherewithall they dazled all others. In a word, 'twas a beauty worthy to be extreamely belov'd. And so she was by my deare Antenor. He serv'd, solicited, and at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eclar'd to her the greatnesse of his affection, and added so much respect and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty to the violence of his Suit, that he got her willing to permit it. At the same time the Beglerbeg of Buda gave command to the Sangiac of Senderovia to besiege Novo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade. He came before it with thirty thousand men; but my generous father desir'd to defend the Siege, that he might shew his faire Astalia, he did not unjustly aspire to the honour of possessing her. The Sangiac was defeated before he was well intrench'd, and forc'd to returne to Senderovia for new forces. The Despote delivered (as by miracle) from so great a danger, prevented the demand his Defender would have made him, and to binde himselfe in a stricter Alliance then that of the interests of States, offered him the incomparable Astalia. He fell at his feet to thanke him for that offer, and besought him not to deferre the accomplishment. The Despote referr'd it to himselfe, and the amorous Antenor presently sent a dispatch to Chersach Prince of Montevera his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to consent to so faire and advantagious an Alliance. Chersach agreed, and desired the solemnity of the mariage might be at Montevera. Astalia with a stately traine was brought into Sclavonia, and as a Queene receiv'd in the Palace of Chersach. The day being come wherein my deare Lord hop'd to reape the fruits of his travels and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance: the irrationall and brutish Chersach fondly taken with the beauty of his daughter in Law, tooke her away from amidst all the great Ladies of Sclavonia which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mpanied her, and notwithstanding all their prayers, and teares, and resistance of his Son, forc'd her from him, and tooke her for his wife. Antenor was like to lose all the resect which Nature had impos'd on him to observe towards his father; and giving himselfe over to his griefe, would have converted the nuptials into a funerall, and the mariage bed to a tragicall Scaffold. But being diverted by his friends, and hem'd in the hall where all the Nobility of the Province were assembled: he turn'd now towards ne, and then to another, and speaking sometimes to the Lords, and otherwhile to the Ladies; See, (said he, your selves) and judge if the unnaturall Chersach after the act he hath done, deserves that I looke on him as my father? 'Tis true, I owe him my life, but 'tis as true, that this day he hath rob'd me of it: and the ill his last voluptuousnesse hath done me, is infinitly beyond the good his first love hath givven me. Cruell father! turne thine eyes on me, aswell as on the faire Astalia. Thinke with thy selfe that I am not lesse sensible then thou; and that the heate of mine age joyn'd with that of my love, is but too powerfull to force from me the little reason I have left, and that I can well
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54727:214"/>
forget the name of a childe, since thy incontinence alone makes thee throw off the quality of a father. The murther is no lesse when a father assasinates his Son, then when a son kils his father. If thou gavest me my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I have paid thee with use. Exact no more from me, but permit that I enjoy in the fruition of my wife, that life which I owe to chance rather then to thy selfe. But what doe I, faire and deare Princesse? I lament in vaine, and in the meane time you are brought to your prayers, teares and cryes, and it may be to something more worthy compassion. Your Tyrant sollicites you, presseth, forceth you, and not able of himselfe to vanquish your just repulses, imploies against you the same hands he useth to strangle his Enemies: And makes, of his hangmen, the Spectators aswell as the Instruments of your martyrdome and my dishonour. He would have said more, when an extraordinary noise, farre above that he made in complaining on his father, flew into the hall, and put them all into a feare and disorder. After the noise, many people came in, and all denouncing by their gesturrs and teares, that accident which their mouthes durst not utter, oblig'd Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with his sword drawne to flye out of the hall. His friends followed, and brought him back againe whether he would or no, and then sent to know what had happened. One of my poore fathers Pages came in all bloudy, and addressing himselfe to his Lord, told him (with teares) the Princesse was dead. Before she resolved to lay violent hands on her selfe, she spake and did, all, she thought fit to stop the violence of your father: (say Chersach, cried Antenor, and make an end of killing me.) But (went on the Page) when she saw her selfe in the hands of foure servants to Chersachs lust, and that her women were enforc'd to undresse her. Well, my Lord (said she) I yeeld and give way to your excessive love. I shall not altogether lose my lover, since in his losse I winne the affection of him who was the Author of the others coming into the world.

If thou lov'st me, let them instantly be gone; and give me all the liberty which my birth, and the honour of being thy wife requireth, in thine owne house. Chersach deceiv'd by these words, sent away his Panders; and himselfe withdrawing from Astalia, told her, she was where she had absolute command, and that his desire to make her as happy as she deserv'd, had engaged him to take her from his sonne, since he was neither prudent nor powerfull enough to make good use of so great a fortune. Astalia seeing her selfe at liberty, ran into a Balconi which look'd over a precipice: and before Chersach or any of us which were left with torches in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, could withhold her; Deare Antenor (cried she) 'tis to keepe my faith to thee that I dye. With that she flung her selfe downe the precipice. Her body was broken against the rocks, and the bloud wherewithall I am besprinkled, came from the torne face of that generous Princesse. Assoone as I saw her fall, I ran out of Chersachs cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and descending to the bottome of the downefall by the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ches of the Castle, I saw her dye repeating thy name. I was bringing you her body, when Chersachs guard met me, tooke it away and carried it back to the Castle. My afflicted father, hearing of Astalia's death, would have spoken a thousand things at once, but the extremity of his griefe would not give him leave to utter onely one. His eyes became two Comets, and his bloud-heated countenance, too true forerunners of despaire and death, made all the Assembly feare more tragicall accidents then those which had already betided. The venerable Moceniqua reading in my fathers face all that he was about to execute: Hearken (said he) to a friend that shall never be so unjust as to approve of thy fathers violencies, nor to condemne the resentments of the Son. Thy complaints are lawfull, and Chersachs act cannot be too much censured. If the severity of Lawes were not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spended as often as the faults of a Soveraigne come in question, I should be the first would have recourse to their assistance, to the end, so extraordinary a rape and no lesse a murther should not remaine unpunished. But when our Lawes and Magistrates trample under feete the respect due to the living Images of the Deity, and would with all their rigour make a great example of a great Offender, they must either cut off his liberty of justifying himselfe, or see themselves reduc'd to a necessity of absolving him.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54727:214"/>
To judge according to your opinion, Chersach is extreamely guilty; but to weigh that which hath beene perpetrated in the same balance where we so exactly weigh the lives and deaths of men, we shall finde Chersach to be very unfortunate, but not very guilty. Whosoever shall be chosen to accuse him will exaggerate his violence, and maintaine with a great deale of likelihood, that he is a Ravisher and a murtherer. But what will not he reply who shall take on him his defence? Chersach, will he say, confesseth he was capable of as much love as his Son, and that Astalia's beauty had no lesse power over his white hayres then o're the flaxen locks of Antenor. His bloud which age had cooled became all on fire at the sight of that admirable Princesse; and those hot boyling de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires which the Son borrowed from the heate of youth, the father feeles out of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his affection. In a word, he would have her for his wife whom Antenor had chosen for himselfe. After the example of many fathers who have voluntarily depriv'd themselves of such whom they passionately lov'd, to satisfie the desires of their Sons: Is it a wonder at this day to see a Son put off his strongest passion to content that of his Father? But I come to thy selfe Antenor; and enquire, whether thou have not often run in hazard of thy life to save thy father; and whether thou hast not often prayed to heaven, that thou mightest by the shortning of thine owne dayes prolong those of Chersach? I know, even though thou wilt not now acknowledge it, that thy piety hath often put those words in thy mouth. Why then, at this time, belying that same good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wouldst thou not wish thy father happy, since thou onely couldst make him so? I would willingly, thou wilt say, have given my life for my father. What, is wife more deare to thee then thy life? Thou will answer, she was, and far more. Thou art de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd inconsiderate Lover. Thou couldst have lived without the fruition of Astalia, but without life thou couldst not enjoy Astalia. Why giv'st thou not then willingly to thy father, a thing which was of lesse value then that life which thou wouldst have given him? Know at once, to shut up thy lips for ever, that neither interest, pleasure, life, nor honour it selfe, have ever beene put in the number of such cases for which the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Lawes dispense with childrens obedience to their fathers. Cruell reasons! (cried Antenor) Injustices well colour'd! I yeeld to you whether I will or no; and leave Chersach's crime unpunish'd, to the end that it may never by another be blotted out of the memory of man. Live monster, live to thy perpetuall misery, and by a long and cruell decrepit age do penance for thy abominable impudicity. After these impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, my unfortunate Lord went out of Montevera, and within a few dayes after not onely forsooke his owne Countrey, but chang'd Religion and Sides: and attain'd to the greatest honours of the Ottoman Empire, under the name of Achomat. Bajazet grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary of Isaac Bassa's government, and taking from him (with his life) that mighty authority which made him terrible to his owne Master, cast his eyes on Achomats ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and withall call'd to minde his many Services. His valour which had won him so many victories, and his fidelity which had held him so constantly link'd to that Monarchs interests, call'd him to that Office. Of Beglerbeg he became a Basha, and from a Basha to that height of honour as to marry the fairest and best belovedst daughter of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. That Princesse was the daughter of the Sultane Queene, and aswell for her beauty as for her wit, deserv'd to be call'd from her birth the Easterne Sun. Bajazet who lov'd her far more then his Sons, gave her an Arabian name which signifieth in your language Immortall Rose. This faire Princesse was conducted to the house of the Basha her husband with that pompe and great traine by which the Ottoman Princes (who without contradiction are the prime Monarchs of the world) are wont to make their slaves admire their power and richnesse. If some occurrences more worthy to be knowne then my mothers nuptiall ceremonies did not binde me to conceale them, I should make you wonder at the infinite number of Jewels, and houshold furniture where withall Bajazet the great would all at once witnesse the love he bore his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the pleasure he tooke in enriching his deare Achomat. That Rose which indeed deserv'd to be immortall, found an Adorer in lieu of a husband; and indeed by the charmes of her beauty and sweetnesse of her disposition, she made her affectionate A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomat forget the mishap in his first love, and his being forbidden to Idolatrize. He imagin'd to himselfe that there was something beside heaven to be worshipped law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully;
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54727:215"/>
and looking on the Sultan his wife, as on one of those faire draughts of that first and eternall beauty, held Mahomet's commands but for vaine dreames and impious institutions: he sent for a Greeke which was an excellent Painter, and as if his eyes were not fully enough satisfied in having for their object but the living beauty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse my mother, caus'd divers Copies to be taken of it, and could not even in the Divan, nor in the most important deliberation refraine from looking on it. This love being so ardent, could produce nothing but flames andincendments; My sister and I were the only fruits, and if I dare say so, the twin daughters of that reciprocall and violent affection: We were borne with such an inclination to love, that though it be a shame to confesse it, yet I must acknowledge that love was as naturall and essentiall to us as our lives and senses. Wee were but eight yeares old when the vertuous and incomparable Axiamira came to Constantinople, to obtaine on the day of Achmets Circumcision the liberty of her invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Periander; she had what she requested, as you know better then I; but what said I? No, she had nothing lesse then what she desired, she was us'd after the same manner as the Sultans are wont to treate their slaves, and Bajazet kept his word with her, in that cruell interpretation wherewithall he knowes how to free himselfe from his scruples of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The very day wherein Axiamira for ever lost the Prince her husband, shee was rob'd of Iphidamantus who was but two yeares elder then I; Baiazet caus'd him to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of her ship, and even against his custome, in lieu of shutting him up in his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio amongst the other Azamoglans, gave him to my father, with expresse command to breed him like a slave, and so make him lose with his memory of Christianisme, that of his birth. Achomat in part obeyed Baiazet, but being himselfe a Christian, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it amongst his confidents, he bred up his faire slave by a Greeke Renegado, in shew, but indeed a Christian, and a Priest: Iphidamantus lost his first name for that of Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and was so tutor'd, as he went for what he was not; that young Prince his beauty &amp; comeliness, which cannot be worthily enough expressed, if it be not compar'd with yours (said Melicerta addressing her to Cydaria) wonne the Sultanesse my mother to breed him among that great number of faire maidens which her father had given her, and to cloathe him usually as they were: we saw him every day, and that seeing drew us insensibly into a snare we saw not. Histeria, so was my deare sister call'd, was the first that felt what shee knew not, and unable to divine the cause of certaine unknowne desires which began to trouble her, was compell'd to discover her passion to me: I know not said she (innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me) what 'tis the faire slave hath in his eyes, but as often as hee lookes on mee hee wounds mee; I feele I know not what sting at my heart which tickles me in hurting me; I turne mine eyes from him when I feele the smart, but in spight of me, I am forced to looke on him againe; and I perceive that my griefe which is very sore when I looke on him, is farre worse when I see him not. Sister (said I) though I am the last that speake, I am not the last that suffered; I have long since examined my selfe of the reason of that change I noted in me, and how I should feele my selfe sicke, and yet not discover the cause nor the quality of my malady: but your discourse hath freed me of my ignorance, I know now that my sicknesse comes from the eyes of the faire slave; the delight I take in seeing him, is followed with so sensible a griefe, that whether I see him or see him not, I finde my selfe divided betwixt a delicious torment and a disquieted contentment. See the first discourse that a growing and almost unknowne passion made two Maidens of thirteene hold together; Age, which is a great master in love, chiefly when it is secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by those which of old have beene instructed in it, quickly taught us, both by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our parents, and the conversation of those faire slaves which waited on us, not onely what we should call our sicknesse, but how strange the effects of it were: Solyman in the meane time, not onely seem'd ignorant of it, but shew'd himselfe so extreamely insensible, that he was neither mov'd with our lookes, our blandishments, no nor with our speeches; amongst many other proofes of his insensibility, I remember one, which as young as we both were, made us see that our affection prepar'd strange afflictions for us. The Sultanesse our mother being retir'd from Constantinople (during a voyage of Achomat's into Egypt) to a Seraglio which the Emperour had given her on the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell which runs into the blacke sea; we in that pleasant solitude, passed our time in all the sports and merriments our Governesses thought fit for our exercise: The Sultanesse
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54727:215"/>
our mother, was usually a Spectatresse of our pastimes, and noting that my sister and I pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them over with a negligence and pensivenesse not befitting our age, was afraid left it might presage some great fit of sicknesse. Had she been a little more informed, she would have knowne our disquiets were not the presages but the effects of that ill which she fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Notwithstanding, we conceal'd it not onely from her, but even from those that were our greatest confidents, and did our utmost endeavours to communicare or at least to discover it to the impassible Solyman. His respect to the Sultanesse having one day (whether he would or no) forc'd him to stay betwixt my sister and my selfe; that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse who tooke much pleasure in hearing the first proofes of our wit, commanded us to speake to him, and he had the like to answer us: Our discourse at first was of meer frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of humour, and principally of the neglect of men; to which Solyman answered, with so much discretion and vivacity, that the Princesse confess'd aloud, she could not heare any thing more witty; but being diverted by a Poste from her deare Achomat, she left my sister and my selfe in that liberty we had so oftentimes wish'd for. As Solyman was about to follow her, we staid him, (against his will) and my deare Hysteria spoke thus; You have good cause to quit us if you beleeve we spoke as we thought: our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising of men might make you doe the same to us: but doe not beleeve Solyman, that we are so wicked as to offend that All, whereof you are a wonderfull part; our injuries were but a sport, and we cunningly made use of that artifice to conceale from our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the too true affection we bear to the fairest of men. With that poor Histeria blush'd, and her languishing eyes stood fix'd on Solyman, to let him comprehend that hee alone merited that glorious title. Solyman blush'd too, either for his owne shamefac'dnesse or Histeria's; and unwilling to answer a speech that troubled him, did what he could to get from us; yet his discretion not suffering him to goethence by violence, he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe obliged to stay yet a little longer with us. I then began, and casting down mine own eyes, as to not see my selfe, Why flyest thou us Solyman, said I? Are wee so unworthy thy company, or is thy mislike of us so great as thou canst not indure our sight nor heare us speake to thee? Thou may be valuest thy selfe by the miseries of thy fortune, and quite forgetting the greatnesse of thy birth, wilt observe that low submission which thy Tutors have prescribed thee, and slaves should owe to their masters. Is it not out of feare of making thy condition worse then it is, in trying to make it better? If such a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity seale up thy lips, and casts thine eyes downewards, thou art as weake a valuer of our thoughts as thou art of thy selfe: we could looke on thee, as on a Prince which should one day sit on a Throne, and not as a slave, who hath lost for ever all hope of his liberty. But our affections are too purely sublim'd to fixe themselves on such grosse and base considerations; we love thee because heaven would have it so, because thy graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse forceth, and thy vertue obligeth us: Wee intreate thee now, to divide that love betwixt us, and to be pleased (that by kinde and mutuall exchanges) thou wilt give us a part of thy servitude, and accept as much of our liberty. Histeria hearing I expressed her thoughts so well, Deare Solyman (said she interrupting me) accept (I beseech thee) my sisters proposition; command with us, and we will be slaves with thee. Solyman would have been overjoyed to have heard us speake on, (though it pleas'd him not) because at least our continuall talke had freed him from the trouble of answering us; but wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd our selves silence, of purpose to heare what he would say: sometime he was consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with himselfe, at last seeing he was forc'd to an answer, Faire Princesses (said he) you have shut my mouth even by that which you have made use of your selves, for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of breaking the silence is commanded me; you say I am thought on and regarded by you as a Prince, which should once governe, and that consideration tels me, I am but a wretch, who with the title of Prince have lost all the priviledges of Principality: though your proffers came from a true feeling you have of my miseries, and that you should be so good as to contribute somewhat to the consideration of my birth, yet beleeve not I beseech you that I can by such a charme beguile the knowledge I have of my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. You may faigne, being as you are, to be slaves, without making triall of any of the rigours of servitude, but if the strength of imagination deprive me not of that of judgement, 'tis impossible for me in conceiting my selfe to be among the sweets of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that I should forget the bitternesse of slavery. Give over then faire Princesses, give
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54727:216"/>
over the presenting me with imaginary good, since it doth but put me in minde of those true ones I want! Would to heaven (reply'd Histeria a little angry) that you were sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as much as you strive to perswade us! You would then take into your thought, two personages who are more slaves then you, and would hearken to their intreaties in lieu of deluding them with your vaine and subtle evasions. The Sultanesse then coming, broke our discourse, and as much vex'd us, as she pleas'd the disdainfull Solyman: Assoon as he was got from us, he made a solemne vow not to be so caught againe; and indeed, from that day till Achomat's returne, 'twas impossible for us to speake with him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. In the meanetime our love increased with our eares; wee not onely forgot all things for Solyman, but forgetting our selves, were so foolish as to be jealous of one another: we broke off our wonted communications, we conceal'd our intentions, and each of us working our projects apart, we went so farre, as that our Governesses tooke notice of our ill correspondency. Nature, who had made but one of us two, could not long indure this disunion; she knit again that which was not altogether broken, and after she had let us know our idle extravagance, made us conceive so great a sorrow for it, as we were many dayes continually asking one another forgivenesse. After this reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall fault had obliged us to a mutuall repentance, we discovered all our thoughts to one another, and being rejoyn'd not to be separated againe, we promised each other to be together both Rivalls and Confidents: some few dayes after this reconciliation, the Emperour resolv'd to perfect and bring to some good issue an enterprise wherein his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours and himselfe had fail'd. He would all at once, conquer Egypt, set on the heires of the Estate, and rebellions of Scanderbeg, and his principall designe was to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge him of the Venetians and the Knights of Rhodes: He therefore rais'd four mighty Armies, and sent the greatest into Egypt, under the command of Basha Herzecogli (that was the title whereby my father was knowne:) He tooke Solyman to that warre, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving our eyes of that onely and deare object, made us make so many earnest prayers against the prosperity of his armes, that many times since thinking on our amorous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, I beleev'd it to have been the cause of the unhappy successe of Achomat's expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He encountred the Sultan of Egypt, and after a fight of two intire dayes (wherein above two hundred thousand lay dead on the place) hee fell from his horse, was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and carried in triumph to grand Cairo. Solyman in that occurrence did such deeds of armes, that it was not to beleev'd at a lesse rate then by loving him so much as we did: He was not then above seventeene yeares old, but his great heart giving him a strength beyond his age, he had redeemed Achomat, and put the Egyptians to the losse of that victory they had gotten, if the Asians cowardise and the Europians disorder, had not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned that victory which was assured them. Solyman not knowing what else was to be done upon the routing of his party, strove to die; but his enemies having more care of his preservation then himselfe, staid him, and made him the partner of his second fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's fetters. Imagine (if you please) when these newes came to Constantinople, how they were receiv'd, the Emperour witnessed more griefe for Achomats imprisonment, then for the losse of all his forces: He presently sent a Messenger to the Sultan of Egypt to pay the Princes ransome, and the other prisoners, with menaces, that if he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, he would goe in person to make a second Nile of the Egyptians bloud. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidarus, a great Officer to that Souldan, not thinking it best to drawall the Turks on his Masters hands, for the keeping away of two or three of them, sent backe Achomat and Solyman with all the civilities the state of businesse so standing could permit; and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated to the Emperour by the bold Thenor, that they ought to make a League toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and joyne their armes to make warre on the Christians, their common Enemies. The Emperour who had sworne the Souldan's ruine, contemn'd the advise of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. But why doe I fall to perplex you with businesse of State, as if our fond love were not sufficient enough to trouble you? Know then that during Achomat and Solyman's imprisonment, Histeria plotted such designes as were more proportionable to the thoughts of some great Captaine, then of a young Mayden. Shee told me a hundred times she would disguise her selfe, and under the habit of a Janizary, goe stab the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, for keeping in prison whom she held more deare then all the world: my timorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse staid her valour, and laid before her, that after shee had made many shamefull and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54727:216"/>
unprofitable endeavour, she would get nothing by her losse, but the death of her father and lover: but the newes of their liberties making her lay by these fancies, the hope of soone seeing them, especially the faire slave, gave her others cleane contrary. Whereas a little before she was all furious, and seem'd able enough of her selfe to conquer all the <note n="*" place="margin">An order of valiant Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the last Empire of Egypt</note> Mamalukes, at the sight of Solyman, she put on a spirit of meeknesse, of submission and servitude, and meditated long before, how she should entertaine that insensible man. Sometimes she would talk to him of his valour, then of his imprisonment, and againe extolling the dangers he had escap'd in striving to redeeme Achomat; Be not lesse generous (said she, in his absence) to the daughter then thou hast beene to the father! Let that brave heart which hath made thee hazard all for Achomats safety, oblige thee not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that of Histeria. Whilst she made these preparatives on her side, I forgot not, on the other, what I was to doe; I resolv'd to imploy, if not of the same things my sister had prepar'd, at least some others which in my judgement should have as good an effect; I advis'd with the best skill'd in the roule of the Eye, the sweetnesse and true time of the Voice and Action, and in briefe (if I dare say so) in the imbellishing of beauty it selfe; and all this, to joyne the forces of the body to that of the minde, to give a generall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault at Solyman's returne, to that strong and well defended place. He arriv'd sooner then we expected, and fill'd Constantinople with so great an admiration of his valour, that he had by this time enjoyed the supremest honours of the Port, had he not contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them. After the Emperour had kept him and Achomat divers dayes in the Seraglio, we were permitted to see him, but not to speake the brave Orations we had studied to move him; he scarce gave us time to congratulate his freedome; he had no thoughts nor desire but for warre; he solicited Achomat for nothing but to returne into Egypt; and he was seen to have such a deep sadnesse in his countenance, as often as he was told of the brave acts he had done there, that they well imagin'd his disgrace of being taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, was more sensible to him, then his honour of killing so many enemies. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, on the other side that would not sit downe with the affront he had receiv'd in the person of his Lieutenant, put a terrible Army into the Field, divided the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty between Achomat and Haly Basha, and gave the command of the Janizaries to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman: this second voyage was more glorious and favourable then the first. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan of Egypt was reduc'd shamefully to aske peace of his Enemy, and constrained by So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman's incredible valour, to abandon many places he had taken. But ô how fatall was the honour of your insensible brother to my poore sister and me! And what powerfull baites did his palmes adde to the charmes and allurements of his person! We look'd on him no more as on the faire slave, but as on a victorious Prince, who by his valour and fortune might aspire even to the Empire of the Othomans. My sister, who all her life time bore an extraordinary love to all extraordinary vertues; and who had a courage no lesse high then her father and her lover, was perpetually fix'd in contemplating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of the latter: and for his valour's sake excusing his insensibility, Thou dost well, (said she, sometimes) thou dost well generous Solyman, not to hearken to such requests as would stop the current of thy great actions: Pursue them with the same boldnesse thou hast begun, and leave us alone in our solitude, to waste our miserable dayes in griefes, vexations, and unprofitable desires. I was alone with Histeria, when she thus talk'd to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Solyman; I interrupted her, and beginning to be angry at our bootlesse perseverance, Truely (said I) we justly merit the sorrowes we undergoe, since we are so great Enemies to our selves, as so much to applaude our tyrant. What wonderfull thing hath this ingratefull man done who scornes us, that we should with so much joy entertaine his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines, and blesse the hand which cuts the thread of our life? Beleeve me my deare sister, Solyman laughes at our easinesse and infallibly holds, that onely because we so submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively solicite him, we deserve to be sleighted. Why (reply'd Histeria) speak you so bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, since you finde in your selfe that your heart and thoughts disavow it? Doe not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your selfe Melicerta, but freely make knowne your resentment. Is your reason able to make good the revolt it adviseth? Are you sure it will not forsake you when you must come to the decision? Consult with your selfe, and examine whether you have courage enough to resolve in good earnest to scorne him that neglects you: No, no, you cannot breake the fetters you weare; all your endeavours to compasse it, doe nothing but mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54727:217"/>
your sufferings; you resolve on many things, but you cannot nor will not put them in execution: make no doubt of it Melicerta, you shall all your life time love Solyman, with his indifferences, his coolnesse and his insensibility; For mine owne part I must cease to live when I would give over loving him. Nature and inclination which have brought on my affection, have made me love him without condition or reservation: Neither dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine nor ingratitude can release me from that necessity. Love Solyman sayes my Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; But if he be insensible, if he be unrespective, if he be even an enemy to my passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have I reply'd oftentimes? For all that (it hath answered) love him still; and know that thy amity shall be the more perfect, because its existence depends on nothing but it selfe, and hath lesse commerce with things without it. Alas! Histeria (said I) deare Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steria, I am enforc'd to my great griefe to confesse, my thoughts are conformable to yours, and that I vainly strive to res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the most unjust passion wherewithall our soules could ever be persecuted. I love the ingratefull Solyman, and I would dare say that I love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my will, if at the same time when I thinke so, my will did not disavow it, I should never make an end, if I pass'd not in silence the most part of those discourses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and produc'd by our younger errours. But I leave them, and let's see the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Solyman enter Constantinople as much cover'd with Palmes and Laurets as wee were full of flames and impatiency. The Emperour willing to gratifie his great servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, made him a Basha, and inriching him beyond his hopes, gave him one of his fairest Palaces, and this way tooke him out of the power of Achomat. The liberty hee had recover'd, and the great meanes he had acquir'd by so honourable wayes, had beene the greatest part of our joy, if that Prince's good fortune had not been the ruine of our own. I will not tell you to what an extreame torment wee were brought by his absence; his prosperities were to us new causes of sorrow, and when we came to thinke they hastened our destruction, we day and night cursed them, and at one same time wish'd Solyman, Emperour of the Turkes, and that he might still be a slave. These different wishes rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themselves by their mutuall extravagancy, we knew not at last what to eschew or what to desire. The very evening, that ingratefull man arriv'd, onely advis'd by our phrensie, we resolv'd to let him see in writing, what we had no hope to let him know from ou mouthes. Presently, we severally writ to him, but neither of us being pleased with our letters, we threw them into the fire, and were of opinion wee should better expresse our thoughts if we did inclose them in one same paper. Histeria therefore began to write for us both, I did so too; and after many alterations we approv'd of the letter I will now rehearse to you, and sent it to our enemy: It was thus, if my memory faile me not.</p>

We have made a progresse from the Love of Inclination, to that of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; and that, which at first had no reason at all, hath now such strong ones, as you must absolutely deprive us of judgement, if you goe about to make us alter our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions.

Soliman receiv'd this Letter by the addresse of an old Jewish woman, who hoped for a great setling of her fortune if our loves had a happy successe. He advised long whether he should answer us. At last he resolv'd to it; not to entertaine us in our errors, but to make us lose with the hope of their good successe, the intention of continning in them.

                  <p>THis Letter, so respectfull in appearance, but so proud in effect, did but encrease our afflictions.

But we lost all hope, when Solyman departed from Constantinople, on that great designe which the Emperour had on the territories of the Venetian Commonwealth. The navall Army being gone out of the Channell, came to Nigroponte, and a little after to Romagnia. I will not relate the particulars of that war. Far more strange events call on me, and passing by all fights by Land and Sea, would have me come with the insensible Soliman to the siege of Lepanto. I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence with you for this present for not crediting all the truths I have to tell you, for they are so extraordinary, as they are beyond the beliefe of the most credulous. Soly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was no sooner gone from Constantinople, but my Sister and my selfe were almost our of our wits. We were no more restrain'd either by the consideration of our birth, or the interest of our honour, or by the feare of death. We resolv'd to follow our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. I confesse, had I beene alone I should never have put on that resolution; but I was swayed by the violence of Histeria's love. We stole out of the Sultannesse our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> Seraglio, and disguising our selves so, as it was very hard for any to know us, wee mingled our selves amongst those troupes were imbark'd for the Venetia war. We came to Lepanto a few dayes after it was besieged. The first thing we did after our landing was to goe to Soliman's quarter, and to endeavour by all meanes to be entertain'd in his Service. Our designe did not absolutely succeed well. Yet we had leave to lodge in his quarter, and to see him at severall houres in the day. Histeria who had not told me her last resolution, strove to bring it to passe without engaging me in it. After a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sally, wherein the Souldiers of Lepanto did all that despaire could advise men of courage to: Solyman sav'd a part of the Emperiall Army, and unawares gave the rash Histeria her life. The night following that fight, my poore Sister seeing all things op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her Designe, and that Soliman himselfe tooke paines to preserve that life she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to lose; resolv'd to speake to him. Finding therefore a convenient time to discover her selfe, she aborded him with an extraordinary constancy, and without faultering in her Speech; I doe not (said she) give thee thanks for saving my life, since those good
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54727:218"/>
deeds which are not voluntary, obliege not those to whom they were done. No, I will do what I never resolv'd. I will thanke thee for a good which thou never intendest to do me; and if thou do not repent thee of it, 'twill be too much for me to be eternally indebted to thee. Thou seest (Soliman) here before thee the most unhappy Histeria, who unable any longer to endure thy deniall or thine absence, hath in her strange reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution fear'd nothing but to finde thee yet insensible. Thou wondrest at this declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and seem'st to doubt whether my words be true. But being never yet capable of love, thou art no more neither of conceiving to what extremities Love is wont to carry such as affect truly. Do not doubt of my being the same I tell thee. My Sister, whose alike passion hath made her undertake the same voyage, and other testimonies lesse suspected, will cleere thee when thou list, of those doubts wherein thou art very willing to abide. Soliman amaz'd and affrighted at so strange an adventure, was a great while ere he could speake to my Sister. At last he inforc'd himselfe; and raysing up that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consolate Princesse: Would to heaven (said he) my death had accompanied my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. We should then both have enjoyed that peace and quiet which fortune alike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies us. O how hatefull hence forward shall that life be to me which hath hitherto been so troublesome, since 'tis by it that I see my selfe guilty of such crimes as cannot be too rigorously punished! I deprive all at once, my generous Master of all content, honour, and may be of life; to whom alone I owe my life, honour and fortune. What shall I say to you Madam? What will become of the Basha your father if he knowes of this vagary? Nay, what will become of your selfe? In what corner of the world will your Sister escape the fury of a justly enraged father? What can I doe that may avail you? Tell me, (I beseech you) for you have brought me into such a maze, that I even scarce know whether I am my selfe or no? Onely love me (replied the poore Histeria) with a voice able to mollifie a rock; or if it be too much for thee, yet at least give leave that thou be beloved; and that being granted, we shall have found remedies against all those ills which thou fearest. Soliman had no reply to that proposition; but stuck in a silence which proceeded more from his modesty and confusednesse then his naturall insensibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Histeria perceiving she wrought nothing on him, rais'd her voyce a little, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many teares to every word, At least (said she) impassible Soliman, if thou be not capable of love, be capable of hatred, and continue not so unmercifull as to suffer me to live. Soliman extreamely perplexed with my Sisters speech, call'd for five or six Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs whom he trusted with his most important affaires, and committing Histeria into their custody; Have (said he) a speciall care of this Souldier, and be accomptable to me for him on your life. He will bring you to his lodging, where his brother is. Goe, and bring them both to one of the Tents next mine owne. This command was executed as it was enjoyn'd; and we were shut up where Soliman had appointed, and serv'd by his Eunuchs with so much care, that we thought his noble entertainement had beene an infallible presage of the end of our miseries. In that error we liv'd eight or ten dayes; but when Histeria saw that Soliman neither came nor sent to visit us, she resolv'd to dye; and told me, her constancy was at the last gaspe; and she could no longer endure Solimans insensibilities. I was of the same opinion, but had not the same courage. I wish'd with all my heart to be out of the world, but all the wayes to it seem'd hydeous and fearefull to me. I see my deere Auditors you grow weary of my laments, and the relation of our miseries begins to be irkesome. I am now ending it, by a bloudy Catastrophe. Know, at the generall assault which the Turks gave to Lepanto, Histeria finding a way to deceive her keepers, fought above two houres in the first rank of the Janizaries, and even in sight of our father and her Beloved. She then receiv'd many mortall wounds, and the assault being ended, entreated two of her Companions to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her off into Solimans Tent. That insensible man came in almost as soone as she, and knowing her, was so inly touched at that tragicall spectacle, as he commanded all his followers to withdraw. When he was alone with her, he would have said something, but she impos'd him silence, and though she spake with a great deale of paine; Of so many requests (said she) which I have made to thee since I was borne at least grant me one: I will aske no unjust thing of thee. 'Tis, that after my death thou wilt be a little more humane then thou hast beene whilst I liv'd. Thy prayers are heard Soliman, see, this is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54727:218"/>
the last time the unfortunate Histeria will importune thee: she hath obtain'd from her selfe a great deale more then she desir'd from thee; But she laments not the losing her life to please thee, for 'tis the least losse thou hast made her suffer. O happy, among so many miseries, if she can by her death purchase her sisters felicity. Thou weep'st Solyman, since when began thy stony heart to change nature? Hath my bloud had the vertue to mollifie it? If it be so, ô how precious are my wounds to me, since in bringing my death they end my miseries, and melting that congeal'd ice within thee, promise some peace to my deare Melicerta! What more could she adde to these words? truly nothing: but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them she died, and seem'd to die joyfully because she thought it would be the price of my redemption. Alas! my deare sister, thou died'st with that generous thought, and I unfortunate and coward that I am, dare live with that knowledge! give Melicerta, give somewhat else then vaine teares and Iamentations to her that hath bestowed her bloud and life on thee. I yeeld to it my deare Histeria, and am fully resolv'd to follow thee, for I feele in my selfe I know not what strange motion which assures me my death is at hand: and that the insensible Solyman shall not much longer triumph o're my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable perseverance. But return we, my dear Auditors, to that unpitifull man: Histe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria's death, almost made him desperate, not that he had lost her, but that hee had beene the cause of it, and by consequence of the most sensible sorrow his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor Achomat had ever resented. He was about to have slaine his Eunuchs: yet weighing that their diligence how exact soever, could not be sufficient enough to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the resolutions of a furious Lover; hee enjoyn'd them for penance to take better care and charge of me then they had of my sister; he sent me a little after the body of that unfortunate Princesse, and a Jew Physician, intreating me (by him) to imbalme it: I gave her those sad duties that very night, and help'd to inclose her in a cedar Coffin co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with plates of silver, which Solyman sent me, with a great many excuses in that he could not himselfe give me that respect he was oblig'd to, by my birth, his duty, and our common affliction. I knew too well for my quiet, he had not changed nature; and that the teares he had shed at my sisters death, were rather teares of ceremony then pity. The next day he sent me a new Messenger, and told me by him, that to what place so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I would retire, I should finde a Tartane ready in the haven to carry me thither with the body of Histeria. He who brought this message, said, he had command not to leave me, and he would not onely performe it, but being Captaine of the Vessell, would either hasten or retard his voyage as I pleas'd. I have no more to doe here said I, but to take leave of Solyman; That will be a hard thing for you to doe (he repli'd) since he is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied about the batteries, and 'tis thought the Venetians will this day come to a Treaty about the reddition of Lepanto. What he said prov'd true; Solyman, who hath ever been the good Fate of his Masters (ô happy Histeria and Melicerta if he had been so of his slaves!) tooke the Towne by composition, and accompanied Bajazet into it at his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entry. The day of triumph being pass'd, Solyman without any mans knowing or so much as suspecting the cause (with a few of his followers) left the Camp, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all the honours, riches, and supreme greatnesse, which the Emperours favour and his important services might justly make him hope for, stole away in the darke of night from all the Turkish Fleet. The flight of a man of so great a consideration, was soone noys'd abroad after it hapned, but divers dayes pass'd in the Camp before it was beleeved. The Emperour, my father and many others fill'd with the love and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Prince, lamented his losse, as the greatest could a long while betide the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Empire. Assoone as the newes was brought me, I imbark'd, with Histeria's body, and intreated my Pilot to land me in some part of France or Italy: I thought I should finde Solyman there, for since he was a Christian there was no safer retreat for him. I was almost sixe months in quest of him, but all my care and diligence was fruitlesse; sometimes I enquir'd for Solyman, sometimes for Iphidamantus, and seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>was all in vaine, I thought then to aske for Polexander's brother. That Name which is knowne through all Europe was my guide to bring me to Solyman. I was told that Polexander was lately become Lord of the Canaries, and being crowned King of them with the consent of all the Islanders, I should infallibly finde his brother with him. I therefore pass'd the Straits, and came to the Isle of Teneriffe; there I understood that Polexander
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54727:219"/>
was lost at Sea, and saw the Inhabitants of three or foure other Islands, so passionately amorous of his vertue, that though he were dead as they beleev'd, yet they held him for their King, and obey'd his name and memory as religiously, as they would himselfe. I enquir'd in all the Islands of the Prince Iphidamantus, and every where heard that they had not seen him: at last wearied with leading so miserable and to be bewailed a life, and the carrying about the body of my deare sister, I landed in this Isle, where finding Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor's Tombe with many others, I thought it a place destin'd for the buriall of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Lovers. Here then I got that Tombe to be built which we came from, and therein laying Histeria's body, resolv'd, with it, to end my dayes, and to divide all my teares and lamentations betwixt my too loving sister and my insensible Lover. Scarce had the desolate Lady ended the sad recitall of her adventures, but Polexander (not thinking of any thing but to blame Iphidamantus for his ingratitude) cry'd out, Our misfortunes have their source from thine insensibility, ô brother, unworthy to be named, and the afflictions which Cydaria and my selfe have undergone, proceed from nought else but the just anger of heaven, who mov'd with the bloud and teares of two so rare Princesses, avengeth on our heads thine iniquity! How (said Melicerta interrupting him) is Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus your brother too? We may be asham'd to owne him (reply'd Polexander) yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I thought till now (said Melicerta) that Iphidamantus had no other brother then Polexander: no more hath he not (Madam) answered Cydaria, and he whom you see, is the same Polexander, whose fame hath related to you such wonderfull things. Melicerta understanding that verity, turn'd to our Heroë, and looking fix'dly on him, It is very hard (said shee) for you to conceale your selfe long; there is something, I know not what in your countenance which is not seen but in extraordinary men. Assoone as I saw you, me thought you brought mee the remedy which Heaven hath reserv'd for the cure of all my mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and that my long misfortunes should by your assistance finde that end, which Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus hath alwayes deny'd me. I am neither so much belov'd by heaven, nor power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enough (said he) to doe you any profitable service; but I againe ingage my selfe, to avenge you on Iphidamantus ingratitude, and oblige him to give you all the satisfaction which your just resentment ought to expect from his; I would gladly assure you of his love, but you know (Madam) that love doth so absolutely depend on our will, that even Tyrants who can doe all, by the feare and terrour they imprint in our mindes, have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been able to impose it on us. It may be, Iphidamantus hath cast off his Turkish seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie (in which he hath been bred) with his Turbant; and his Spirit casting by those austere wayes of life wherewithall his education hath as it were diverted the course of his nature, will betake it selfe to the path she first delineated. I hope for nothing from Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus (repli'd Melicerta) I know too well his aversion from me, and though his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibilitie may be overcome, I am most certaine 'twill never be by my affection: And when I talke of remedies, of help, of the end of my misfortunes, I meane onely such as are met with in the grave; and which by a mercifull effect of Heaven's goodnesse, happen, when they are least expected. I confesse it to you Polexander, I am so inured to teares, to griefes, and torments, that I could hardly live among contentments; and have so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impress'd a beliefe of my never being happy but in death, that Iphidamantus himselfe would have much adoe to make me alter mine opinion. Yet I would faine see him though I cannot tell you why; my blinded and uncertaine affection flies from what it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth, and seekes for that which it vvould not meet vvithall: It is guided by some other, who stronger then it selfe, swayes, and makes it follovv the varietie of his motions. In a vvord, I feele vvhat I cannot expresse, Heaven intends some great matter, but it gives me onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hope better (Madam, repli'd Polexander) and be assured, that your long being accustomed to sad and dismall imaginations, produceth all those mishaps you fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure to your selfe. You shall be happy, because Heaven is just; and assure your self, that your happinesse (as I may say) steales from your thoughts and beliefe, to the end that

coming on you at unavvares, it may make you taste those delights, vvhich are extreamly diminish'd, vvhen they have been alvvayes hoped for, and too long time expected. Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daria, vvho vvas silent, had her eyes fixed on Melicerta's face, and noting there such svveetnesse and attraction as she could hardly resist, began (in her selfe) to be moved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iphidamantus; and after she had accus'd him of stupidity and blindnesse, rather then of coldnesse, vvish'd, she might be his Judge, to condemne him to such tortures as vvere proportionable to his offences. Their long converse being thus ended, Melicerta vvas inforc'd to take a later resolution; Polexander and his sister vvooed her to it, and she seeing her selfe pressed to it by her ovvne thoughts, at last consented to leave her sisters Tombe, and once againe to try fortune, and contest vvith Iphidamantus insensibility. Our Heroë assur'd her, the voyage she vvas to take vvould be more hapy then her former, and so by degrees drevv her from her lodging for an undelay'd imbarking. They vvent all three in company to the haven, vvhere going aboard, Polexander presently comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Pilot to make for the Isle of Teneriffe, vvhich he did; and after five houres, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Polexander there, restor'd to the Inhabitants all that joy they had forgone since the sad newes of that Princes losse. They forgot nothing whereby Subjects are wont to witnesse their loves, and besought him, they might now at leasure taste the comforts of his presence: He granted their requests, and whilst he was with them, spent his time in such necessary reformations, and profitable institutions, that those Islanders had cause to blesse so just a raigne, and to multiply their Sacrifices and Prayers for the continuation of it. Polexander tooke his leave of them with teares in his eyes, so much was hee mov'd with their affection; and with the same successe visited the grand Canary and the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: at last he arriv'd in the new Isle of Alcidiana. The good order he had left at his departure continued still, the Vice-roy had neither abused his Authority nor his Masters absence; and though he thought him dead, he oppos'd all kinde of alterations. Our Heroë welcom'd Melicerta and Cydaria into a Palace which had beene finish'd since his depart, and which by the managing of the intelligent and trusty Bias, was adorn'd with all those rich ornaments which make weake mindes admire the quality of Kings. The newes of that Prince his returne flew straight into Spaine, and stai'd in the haven the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall Army which the ambitious Ferdinand had provided for the reconquering the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. France which had a share in Polexanders adventures, since he was of the bloud of her Kings, welcom'd the newes of his returne with a great deale of joy; and Lewes the Twelfth was advis'd by the great Cardinall of Amboise to send him an Embassadour to congratulate his good fortune, and offer him his alliance and power. The Princes of Africa, friends and foes, testified either their loves or feare by their many Embasses. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst others, those of Zahara sent Deputies, to intreat him to accept of their Crowne: They had lately freed themselves from a tyrannie, which was insupportable, and when they were about the election of a new King, they were so divided, and so exasperated that to uphold those whom they had chosen, they would have hazarded a battle. But the newes of Polexander's returne, presently made the weapons fall out of the hands of both parties; and they began all to cry, Heaven save the King of the fortunate Islands! And straight strangling both those they had chosen to command them, sent with all humility to intreat Polexander to crosse the sea, and come receive that new Crowne which his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable merits had in his absence acquired him. The principall of that Deputation was a Priest of Mahomet's Law, no lesse a Politician then a great Theologist: He was to speake in the name of the Province; and indeed when hee came before Polexander, he made knowne by his demeanour as well as by his words, that hee well merited the first place in a Councell of State. These were the motives he used to dispose our Heroë to the accepting the Crowne of Zahara: If it were a fundamentall Law in Elective States, that none should ascend the Throne, but such a one as was called to it by unanimous suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages, and the universall consent of all private men, I dare maintaine (Sir) before your Majesty, that such a manner of choosing Kings would be a meanes of never chusing any. The multitude which is but seldome in accord with it selfe, hath no great mind to be so, in a matter whereto they have not much lesse repugnancy then love, and we must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54727:220"/>
goe against the option of the most, when the question is of chusing a Master to a whole Nation. You are the first, Sir, and I shall not speake a falsity, should I say the sole person who by your incomparable qualities have put an exception to this generall rule, which is no lesse glorious to your Majesty, then beneficiall to your new Subjects. They have had but one minde, but one same voice, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> I dare say it, but one and the same soule assoone as I propos'd to them the electing you for their King: Their ancient enmities and hatreds which seem'd to be irreconcileable, have ceas'd, even in the beginning of battle, so much did they feare lest their disunion might retard their common felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. 'Tis your vertue great King which hath wrought this miracle in the mindes of a people, who, not to flatter them, seem'd not capable of so much wisdome: the Zahari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans come to you as to their deliverer; have pity on the many miseries they have indured: and since Heaven hath given you to the world, to distribute without favour, those trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures it hath left in your hands, dispose of them every where equally, and conforming your selfe to that will which gave you them, reserve not for one Nation alone, that which is destinated for the generall good of the whole world. Polexander finding his speech so rationall and so urging, was troubled what answer to make, and neither oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, nor discontent a Nation which had testified so much love to him: His brave spirit, which like his courage had surmounted alwayes the most difficult obstacles, presently furnish'd him with this judicious reply.</p>
                  <p>The Obligation which bindes me to you for your coming so farre off to offer me the Crowne of Zahara, is no common tie, but your judging me worthy is infinitely greater. I will not by a confession which should be true and yet seem to you artificiall, shew you I am not the man you deeme me; but, since you will have it so, leave you in your errours, and accepting with joy a Present you so frankly give me, I will strive to live in such a manner, that my government shall give no cause for you to repent of your election.</p>
                  <p>The Embassadours of Zahara obtaining this favourable Audience, and seeing their negotiation succeed so well, dispatch'd one of their company to carry home the good newes: in the meane time they were entertain'd with an incomparable magnificence, and after eight or ten dayes refreshing, some of them tooke their leaves of Polexander, and the rest abode with him as well to instruct him in the Affaires of the Kingdome, as to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten his journey. That famous Priest of whom we have before spoken, was one of those which stai'd. As one day, Polexander entertained him in the presence of Cidaria and Melicerta, he fell to talk of the Africans Warres; the Priest who was perfectly instructed in them, Sir (said he) it is not long since your Kingdome was threatned by the Armes of Morocco: Ambitious Abdelmelec had an intent to place the bounds of his command be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River of Abernia, and to get to himselfe by his power, such Nations as he was not able to acquire by his vertue: our AIarums and his Enterprises vanish'd both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Of an Invader, which he would have been, he hath beene inforc'd to stand on his owne defence, and at this very present, is besieged in Morocco with his father, and by two such Captaines as are not wont to vanquish by halfes. Pray (said Polexander) tell me what those Captaines be, and what designe hath engag'd them in this Siege. Sir (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd the Priest) 'tis not past three moneths, since that generous and invincible Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Pirates, call'd Bajazet, was inform'd, that Hely the father of Abdelmelec hath gotten into his custody a slave, or as others assure us, a Princesse which he before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time passionately loved: but whether it be that this valiant Pirate be enamour'd of that beauty, or out of a true effect of his noble and great courage, that he will deliver her from that dangerous slavery; so it is, he hath drawne his most forces out of his Island, and assisted by a puissant succour from the Kings his allies, hath even cast anchor in the very River of Tensif; and after many skirmishes, wherein Bajazet's valour hath disheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the most daring Africans; Abdelmelec and Hely have beene compell'd to shut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up in Morocco. The Rovers have there besieged them, and but for that miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous arrivall of a Knight which will not at all be knowne what he is, the Siege had been ended above a moneth since by the sacke of the City. On the other side there is arriv'd
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:54727:220"/>
to Bajazet a great aide from Constantinople: This may seeme very strange to you, but 'twill be farre more when you know the cause of it. The Basha Herzecogli, son-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law to the Grand Signior, hath gotten leave of him, to come with a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall Army, to avenge himselfe of another Basha called Solyman, who hath stolne from him two twinne daughters, and who to keep them to himselfe, hath left the grand Signior's service. &amp; put him into the protection of the King of Morocco. This Basha Herzecogli, which is esteem'd the valiant'st man in the Ottoman Empire, animated with the griefe of the losse of his daughters, and with a desire of revenge, so presseth on Morocco, that if it be not already taken, 'tis infallibly on the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so. This Priest very likely would have added more newes to this, but he noted so great a trouble in the countenances of Melicerta and Cydaria, that he thought it not fit to proceed. Polexander who well knew the cause of the Princesses agitation, arose to leave them at their liberty, and tooke with him all such as might hinder their freedome. He was no sooner gone out, but said Melicerta (to Cydaria) all pale and trembling, My deare Sister is there in the world a more unfortunate creature then I? I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the tombe wherein I had buried my selfe alive, as the most dolefull place could be chosen, and I see that by the incomprehensible cruelty of my destiny, this Palace wherein I began to taste some comfort, is in an instant turn'd into a hell where all my paines and torments are renewed and augmented. What have I heard? What must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of me? Soliman is shut up in Morocco, and my father, alas! most ignorant of the truth, besiegeth him, and seeks to be avenged of a crime whereof to my infinite griefe Iphidamantus is too innocent. Cydaria was not lesse perplex'd then Melicerta, but her discretion being farre more scrupulous, she held her peace, or if she spoake, 'twas to her selfe. What (said she) doth Almanzor then with so much fervency prosecute the liberty of a Slave? Be perswaded who list that he doth it out of meere noblenesse, Cydaria will never be so simple, nor so much overreacht as to beleeve it. Finish Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzor, finish boldly what thou hast begun. Burne and consume thy selfe for an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Slave, since all kinds of objects are able to please thy ficklenesse. That Axia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mira whom thou sometime lovedst, will never disturbe thy designes, no more then she will ever heare spoaken againe of thine affection. Polexander, as Cydaria thus ended her upbraidings, came in alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e. He went right to Melicerta, and knowing what need she had of comfort; Madam (said he) if I should condemne your being thus perplex'd, I should be ignorant of that which is most just and most powerfull in nature. Your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frights and feares are extreame, that is, they are effects proportionable to their causes. Yet despaire not. This is without doubt the Crisis, the alteration of your disease: And if so be Morocco can yet hold out a few dayes, I hope to put a happy end to such adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as seeme to promise themselves but a tragicall period: We must lose no time. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve your selfe therefore to go to Morocco with Cydaria, and be pleas'd to let me be both your Guide and Counsellor. Melicerta thought it no hard proposition, but Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daria directly oppos'd it, and in her conceal'd anger, gave the fairest reasons that could be to disswade the voyage. Polexander knew well his Sisters sicknesse, but would not let her perceive it, for feare of adding to her affliction; he contented himselfe with answering to her reasons, and so plainely to remove all the difficulties she had framed, that at last overcome by her selfe as well as by the perswasions of others, she yeelded to the Journey, on condition yet that she should not be seene of any. Melicerta en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Polexander the same, and obtaining it, went to prepare for their departing. Our Heroe who extreamely long'd to be free from others businesse, that he might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his owne, imbark'd the next day, and taking with him the Embassadours of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hara gave charge to his Pilot to make to the mouth of the River Abernia. At Sunset he came thither, and making his arrivall knowne the next morning by breake of day, all the two sides of the River were covered with horse and foote. Never did a captivated Nation welcome their Deliverer with so many demonstrations of love and joy, as the Inhabitants of Zahara did Polexander. Men, women and children made the ayre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound againe with their shouts, and ran into the water as farre as they could, to come the soonest neerer the King. When he was ready to shew himselfe, he went into a Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:54727:221"/>
and taking none with him but Osmin and the Embassadors, landed amongst all the people. The infinite multitude following him from the River, cast themselves flat on the earth, and renewing their shoutes and applauses seem'd they were at the height of their happinesse. In the meane time, Polexander causing a little Theater to be raised of turfes whereon he and Osmin onely mounting, he commanded the people to stand up. Assoone as they had inviron'd the place where he stood, and had impos'd them silence; Polexander advanc'd, and spoke thus: I come (my friends) to give you thankes for the benefit you have done me, and to offer you for it, mine arme, my counsell, and my life. I accept of you on such conditions as shall please you best, and sweare to you by that Power which we adore, that nothing shall unlinke me from you. But in as much as fortune compells me whether I will or no, to wander from one Countrey to another, and will not permit me neither to stay long with you, I have chosen a Lieutenant to governe you in my absence: His vertue is so well knowne to you, and his bloud which hath beene alwayes held holy, and venerable amongst you, should make him so deare to you, that infallibly you will approve of my choice; and I doubt not but you would have chosen him for your King, had you not thought him in his grave. 'Tis Osmin, (my friends) 'tis that legitimate heire of the great Abuchar Ischias, the Founder of your Monarchy; 'tis that Prince I say, who preferring your safety before his owne, and your ease and solace before the favours of the Tyrant that would have ruin'd you, voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly banish'd himselfe from his home, that he might not be a confederate in those mischiefs which he could not hinder. After he had thus spoken, hee tooke Osmin by the hand, and shewing him to the people, Can you (said he, my friends) behold this face which hath been alwayes so pleasing unto you, and not witnesse your joy for his returning? Lose, lose, those considerations which detaine you, let your contentment ring againe; and if you are sorry for not having any thing worthy your acknowledging the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable vertue of this Prince; cease your just sorrow, and know that Polexander accepted not the Crowne of Zahara, but to have the honour of replacing it on his head who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ought to weare it. The peoples affections after this Speech were much divided, and their mindes so contrary, that some who had beene witnesses of Osmin's brave deeds, wish'd him the Crowne; others, which had a blinde love to Polexander could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with themselves to revoke their election. After divers conferences and much facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, at last one same motion thrust them on all to cry, Let Osmin raigne, but let Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander raigne too, the one as Father, and the other as Sonne. Our Heroë approving the peoples wishes, tooke the royall Turbant which the Zaharians had presented him, and put it on Osmin's head. Osmin who till then had been (as 'twere) out of himselfe, (not so much for the good fortune was betided him beyond his hope, as at the generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse wherewithall Polexander had procur'd it) came out of his astonishment, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to his new dignity cast himselfe at Polexander's feet. You shall raigne (said he) over a people which by a rare happinesse meet all their wishes and felicity in their affection; they love you, and 'tis Justice, not to slight their amity: doe not make them alter their former resolutions, since they are so advantagious for them; and be pleased, that joyning my prayers with theirs, I lay at your feet a Badge which is too il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious to be worne on my head. With that he tooke off the Turbant which Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander had plac'd there, and would indeed have laid it at his feet, had he not hindered and inforc'd him, by his perswasions and intreaties, to receive an honour which his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues had so justly merited. Osmin, overcome by the Princes reasons, and acclamations of the people, at last consented to be King, and was so acknowledged through all the Assembly: The Priests and Knights presently conducted him to the great Temple of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernia, and crown'd him according to the ancient customes of the Countrey. Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had no sooner seen the new King establish'd, but he sent notice of it to Cidaria, who presently leaving the ship came ashore with Melicerta and Osmin's Lady, and overjoy'd at the hapy fortune of a Prince which had been to her so long time in lieu of a father, made every place resound with her just and excessive contentment: She cast her selfe on Osmin's necke before all that encompassed them, and left him not, but to give Polexander thankes for those favours wherewithall he had both prevented her Petition, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:54727:221"/>
all those paines and travells whereunto the care of her preservation had expos'd that good old Prince and his Lady. Two dayes she stai'd with them, to make them sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the more the pleasures of Regalitie; and had she not been (as well as Polexander) earnestly solicited to make haste to the Siege of Morocco, she had kept them farre lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger company. The day of their depart arriving, there was of necessity, that, to be giving to love and custome, which they exact even from those which condemne it; their fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels were accompanied with sighes and teares, and though Polexander and Cidaria pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised the vertuous Osmin and his generous Lady, to be soone backe againe, yet they shewed as much griefe for their departure, as if they had beene certaine never to see them more. Polexander, Cidaria, and Melicerta, went aboard, and after five dayes happy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, descri'd the Pirates Fleet, which lay at anchor in the mouth of the River of Tensiff.</p>

Presently Alcippus tooke a shallop, and observing those ceremonies us'd at sea, in token of Peace and friendship, rowed to the neerest ship to them. She was commanded by a Rover called Cady Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, to whom Polexander had before-time given his life; assoone as Alcippus saw him he knew the man, and intimating his joy for meeting him, Hamet (said he) the King my Master intreates thee to send him newes of thy Generall. The Pirate overjoyed with seeing a man he extreamely lov'd; Deare Christian (replied he) I am infinitely griev'd that the strictnesse of our Discipline makes me faile in what we owe thee: but if thou lovest me as much as I beleeve, let thy affection sway something as well as the necessity of my charge, and come up hither, that I may imbrace thee and fully informe thee of all which Polexander would know. Alcippus, desirous to satisfie his friend and his Master, tooke hold of the ropen ladder which the Pirate had throwne out, and went straight up to him. The embraces and civilities once done, the Turke led the Christian into his Cabin, and putting every other out; The King thy Master (said he) may be is ignorant of the cause which hath ingaged us in the Siege of Morocco. He is not altogether so (repli'd Alcippus) for being at the Canaries, he understood, how Bajazet falne in love with a slave of the King of Morocco had proclaimed warre against that King to get her out of his hands. This is not altogether false, (said Hamet) but thou must know, that this pretended slave of Hely, is that faire and vertuous Princesse which my Generall lost in the Kingdome of Benin: these three moneths almost hath he bin with all his forces before Morocco, and hath made a solemne vow to put the Towne to fire and sword, if that Princesse be not quickly restored to him. I will not relate to thee the brave incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have beene since the beginning of the Siege; Let it suffice I tell thee there is to be one this day, which is to decide the Warre. Not long since there came to the King of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco a Knight, which calls himselfe the Unknowne: 'Tis the most expert, the most courteous, and the most valiant Gentleman, next Polexander, of all those that honour the Crosse. This Knight, and Abdelmelec the Prince, desirous to spare the lives of a great many Innocents, have resolv'd to end the Siege, by a Combate, of two against two. Bajazet and Achomat have accepted their challenge three dayes since, and the conditions of the Duell being agreed on of both sides, we shall this day see for whom fortune hath reserv'd the victory. Assoone as Alcippus had heard of businesse so important, he tooke leave of Hamet, and sail'd on with an extream quicknesse to advertise the King his Master of it: He found him with Melicerta and Cydaria, and by his recitall of Bajazet's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, equally astonish'd them all three: Melicerta made openly appeare the feare she had
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54727:222"/>
of her father; Cidaria conceal'd that which she had for her Lover, as inconstant as shee thought him; and Polexander thinking not on feare but how to prevent the mischiefe, 'Tis not fit (said he) nor must it be, that foure such valiant men should hazard their ruine for a thing meerly imaginary. Straight he commanded to set saile, and entring the River with winde and tide, made himselfe knowne to all such as were above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board in Bajazets ships, to avoid his being stayed. When he saw himselfe in a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious place for landing, he cast anchor, and whilst they were carrying ashore his armes and horses, he with-drew the two Princesses, and intreated them in that occasion to shew they were exempted from their Sexes weaknesse, They promis'd him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master themselves, and though their feare had a little troubled part of their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet had they enough left to surmount all those sad imaginations, which throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the necke of one another, came to assault their generous resolutions. Polexander left them, and taking none with him but Alcippus and Diceus, landed where his horses and armes were: He there arm'd himselfe, and getting to horse rid on an easie gallop, to the Liues which had been drawne out betweene the Camp and the Towne to inclose the place wherein Bajazet, Achomat, Abdelmelec, and the unknowne Knight were to decide the fortune of Morocco. He intreated those who kept the entrance to let him passe, and to winne them the rather, told who he was; the Pirates did him all honour, and relating their command, humbly besought him not to doe Bajazet so much wrong, as to hinder his Combate. Our Heroë unwilling to offer violence to the Guard, or to make knowne his intention, plac'd himselfe before them, and thought ere they were well heated in the fight, some occasion might present it self to stop the proceeding: it hapned according to his forecast, for he saw two Knights come from the gates of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, who arm'd at all points, and riding as fast as they could, made all judge, they had aminde to be of the match. Polexander shewed them to the Pirates, and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting how Bajazet and Achomat ran a hazard if they were not seconded; Friends (said he) 'tis no longer time to deliberate: the order you receiv'd is alter'd by the arrivall of these two Knights; doe not betray your Generall by an indiscreet obedience, but at least permit him to have a third, since there are two more come in to his Enemies. The Rovers perswaded by these few words, open'd the Lists to our Heroë, who fearing he might come too late flew in like lightning among the sixe Knights: He who came to meet him, accosted him in a very warlike manner, and intreating the King fairely to take him to taske. These Knights (said he) are resolv'd to send me backe shamefully to Morocco; judge whether I should not be extreamly sensible of that affront! It lies in your power to free me from it; let me therefore brave Knight be so much obliged to you, and let your friends see, that you came not hither no more then I to be an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable spectator of their Combate. My intent (repli'd Polexander) is to separate, and not to set them on. I am the most deceiv'dst man of the world (said the Moore) or you are not a person likely to breake off such a match. I should be glad (answered Polexander) the opinion you have of me might be preserv'd without the obliging me to alter my resolution. 'Tis impossible (said the Moore.) Since you then enforce me (added our Heroë) I will satisfie you, but on condition, that he of us two which hath the better of his companion, shall goe part the rest. The foure Princes began to laugh at Polexander's proposition, as thinking it to come from a man who had a great opinion of his owne courage; and being sever'd, assoone as they had sent away Polexander's and Moore's Squires, rid to take the distance behov'd them for a fit careere. Abdelme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec's third man, by the furious incounter of our Heroë, receiving a shock as if it had been a blow of thunder, was borne man and horse to the ground. The Prince of Morocco broke his lance on Bajazet's shield, but with more slight then vigour; the illustrious Rover made him otherwise feele his strength, for having pierced his armour, he left a truncheon of his lance in his arme; and had made him flie over his horses crouper, but that he caught hold of the mane. Achomat came against the unknowne night with all the impetuosity which accompanieth hatred and the desire of revenge, and broke his lance to his gantlet. For the strange Knight, he was not a little shaken by his enemies violent incounter, but being restrain'd by some powerfull consideration, in passing by Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, he bore up the point of his lance, and made so faire a careere as it could not be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54727:223"/>
compar'd but with Polexanders. Achomat, incens'd at the courtesie he had receiv'd, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with his Symeter drawn against the unknowne Knight, ayming at his face; Do not think (said he) ingratefull &amp; perfidious Solyman, by thy respects to asswage my just anger. My good deeds, my care, my love should have fill'd thee with these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; not thy remorse of conscience. But go on disloyall man, go on as thou hast begun; &amp; for fear thy crimes should be imperfect, add (if thou canst) murther to thy ingratitude, to thy rape and treason. The unknowne Knight, in lieu of being offended at his words, 'Tis true my Lord (said he to his Enemy) Solyman is ingratefull, a Ravisher and a Traytor; but he is not sufficiently impudent to maintaine his offences, nor coward enough to feare their punishment. Take from him then that unhappy life, which is the cause of all your afflictions; and hath produc'd all the miseries of your family. What stops you Sir? What hinders your anger so justly provoked? Why is your revenge so slow? Sheathe your sword (my Lord) in the trayterous heart of Solyman; give no eare to your Goodnesse if it speake for him; but call to minde that he hath stuck his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard in the bosomes of Histeria and Melicerta. Whilst the stranger Knight spoake thus, Polexander made his Enemy feele the weight of his arme, and to acknowledge there was no proportion betwixt his courage and his strength. In an instant he put him beside his postures, and a little after (unable for fight) brought him to the extremity of asking his life. Polexander gladly gave it him, and went presently to the unknowne Knight, whom he found continuing his accusations, and intreated Achomat to take his life: Strike, (said he) strike Sir, and suspend that greatnesse of courage which suffers you to assault none but such as defend themselves. You are not here in the quality of a Combatant, but of a Judge, and a Master. Consider then what Justice would have you doe with an offender, and the authority of a Master with a fugitive slave. Polexander interrupting the unknowne Knight, Solyman (said he) either be silent, or speake so as you may cleere Achomat from that error whereinto you have brought him. Make knowne to him by what unfortunate chance he lost Histeria and Melicerta. But I shall do better to speake for you. With that he turn'd to Achomat thus: Generous Basha (said he) Solyman is guilty, but 'tis not of too much love, as you beleeve; 'tis of neglect and insensibility. If he be the Author of the disasters befalne in your family, 'tis as the Sun is the cause of darknesse. I will say he hath ruin'd the Princesses your daughters, in refusing what they requested from him, and if I may say so, in hiding from them that light, without which their young hearts were perswaded there was none at all. But not to hold you any longer in expectation of the cleering a doubt, which must either appease or at least alter the face of your displeasure; I will in few words declare what your daughters affections were, and what the insensibility of the Prince your Slave. Know, that those Princesses, Twins in their affection as well as in their birth, turn'd at once their eyes on Solyman; and though he alwayes insolently neglected them, yet was he so happy as to be desperately belov'd. Some other lesse skill'd in the power of that passion then I am, would justifie Solyman, in telling you, that his duty and respect forbad him to cast his eyes on the daughters of his Master. But I intend not to bring you such excuses. If Solyman were so indiscreet as to make use of them, I should be the first would condemne them either as absolutely false or more criminall then his owne insensibility. In a word, this young Prince hath beene ignorant of what is knowne to beasts and plants; and all Nature which cries out that we must love, and inspires that passion when first our life is breath'd into us, hath found a monster in your Slave, who in the very height of his bloud, in the fire of his youth, and in the midst of all the allurements and beauties of your daughters, hath belied his birth, and made appeare to the shame of his Sexe, that a man might be borne incapable of all love. Histeria and Melicerta could not indure this prodigy. The one died of it with griefe at the siege of Lepanto, and the other is buried alive in a tombe, that she may never more see that unjust heaven which knowes so great a crime and doth not punish it. Achomat, who had diligently hearkened to all that Polexander had said, was a while without answering, as if he was asking himselfe, whether all that which the Prince would perswade him could be true. At last thinking well that this accident was not impossible, he addressed his speech to our Heroe, and interrupting it
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54727:223"/>
with sighes: You have (said hee) judiciously forseene that your narration would change the face of my afflictions; I perceive Solyman is not so guilty as I thought him; but withall I know that I am not lesse miserable then I imagined. Whilst these two Princes were talking thus, the unknowne Knight tooke off his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, and displaying his admirable countenance which could not bee seen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wonder: You (said hee, coming neerer to Polexander) are not deceived; 'Tis true my Lord, I am that monster, who by my ingratitude and insensibility have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the most holy and sweet lawes of nature; and who in stead of acknowledging A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomat's favours and goodnesse, have by my excessive contempt hastened the tragicall end of the Princesses his daughters. But by what chance have you come to the knowledge of things so private, and for what cause doth Achomat deferre his revenge? The Basha's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation seeing it selfe strip'd of all that which had so long time nurs'd it, yeelded at last to Iphidamantus Innocence; and reason taking her place which passion had usurp'd, made Achomats weapons to fall out of his hands. With teares in his eyes he turn'd to Polexander, and witnessing to him his sorrow and noblenesse, Since (said he) at last I know Solyman to be guiltlesse, and that 'tis the cruell destiny of my race which alone hath produc'd my misfortune and shame; tell me, I intreat you Sir, where I shall finde my daughters bodies, that by rendering them to their desolate mother, I may give her that deplorable consolation which she can expect from so sad and lamentable a restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Since your equitable love (repli'd Polexander) makes you alike wish for your two daughters, dry from henceforth the halfe of your teares, or let the one part testifie your griefe, and the other be an evidence of your joy. Histeria is dead, but her sister liveth, and were it not for the obstinacy wherewithall she opposeth all that may conduce to her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse and avenge her of Iphidamantus insensibility; she would have, as well as I, the content of seeing her deare father, and that lover who as barbarous as he is, is no lesse wished for. At those words Iphidamantus shew'd well, he had not so hard a heart as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander upbraided him withall, but made knowne by his sighes and teares, he knew how to love; and casting himselfe at Polexanders feet, sadly besought him to discover where Melicerta was, and what he was to performe for the freeing her from her miseries. Is it (repli'd our Heroë) an intent to be a spectator of the ills thou hast made her undergoe, that thy curiosity breeds that desire in thee? or to say better, by a humanity too inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane to sticke thy ponyard in that Innocents breast to free her from her further languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Ah (my Lord) said Iphidamantus, be more indulgent to an offender that repents him! And since I had the honour as well as you to have the generous Periander for my father, doe him not that wrong to beleeve he was the Author of producing a creature monstrous in all his qualities: I confesse I have been long incapable of that desire they call Love, and I have laugh'd at Achomat, Bajazet, at the King of Morocco, and at your self, as often as your passion hath made you act something not conformable with my opinion. But if I have been impassible, and (to use your owne words) disdainfull, and without pity; yet have I never beene cruell nor unjust: I have endeavour'd many and many a time to suppresse Melicerta and her sister's madnesse; I offered them all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies reason furnished me withall; I have not taken pleasure in their sorrowes, but if I had thought my death could have made them happy, they had long since beene so: I will not yet by these justifications lessen the enormity of my offences; whatsoever I have done, I have deserv'd death, since the misfortune of two the fairest Princesses of the East had their Originall from me; and I would finish before you what Achomat hath begun, if my desire of restoring Melicerta to him did not imperiously command me to live. Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met (interrupting the two brothers discourse) If (said he to Polexander) I could be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, the sight of you which I have so long wish'd for, would be the end of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. The name of Polexander which hath stirr'd in me so much emulation, and that high vertue, which I have propos'd for the Idea of my actions, would fill my soule with such delights as would not be found neither in the favour of Princes, nor the reputation and fame of a great Command, nor the possession of riches. But I am too miserable to taste of any felicity, and therefore 'twas necessary my daughters losse should betide, that the pleasingnesse of meeting with you, might be as it were poysoned by so great a sorrow. I accept your civilities (repli'd Polexander) since they are so many witnesses proclaiming
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54727:224"/>
your generous soule hath preserv'd her purity in the corruption of a Court, where the greatest fortunes are not usually rais'd, but by villanies farre greater. But what doe I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour nor alliance of the Turkish Emperour have not been able to pervert that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable heart which nothing hath been able to conquer but love; and I know well these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, which some indiscreet man would construe to be ambition or lightnesse, are signes of his moderation and constancy. But since love hath sway'd the father to things so incredible, could he without injustice condemne that, which the same passion had made his daughters undertake? You are just Achomat; doe not then punish that in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which you approve in your selfe; and thinke, two young Ladies being but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ignorance and infirmity, were not able to resist the most sweet and contagious of all maladies: since he could not doe it, who by his valour as well as by his wisdome had infallibly ruin'd the Ottoman's, if the misfortune of Christendome had not arm'd them for their preservation. Attribute therefore to Fortune, or if you will, to Nature the disasters of your house, and bury in eternall oblivion the errours of two young Ladies who could not almost avoid them, since they had the amorous Antenor for their father. Would to heaven, (repli'd Achomat) that Histeria and Melicerta were in case to receive that pardon you intreate for them; you should get it, though nature and bloud would not force me to that indulgence: but death makes your intreaties and my love effectlesse, and (may be) you would have me beleeve Melicerta alive, to accustome me to a misery before I know the greatnesse of it. I have (said Polexander) related to you matters as they are; Melicerta lives, and since my brother is become rationall, I doubt not his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming her from the hands of that Tyrant who to tire her constancy, puts her daily to new tortures. At those words the fire flew into Iphidamantus face, and his action full of impatiency witness'd sufficiently hee was no more an enemy to love; I shall beleeve (said he to Polexander) you are of intelligence with that insensibility wherewith you upbraid me, if you doe not without delay let me know where Melicerta is: For the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that keeps her his captive, either he is invisible, or I am most certaine that Princesse shall be reveng'd for his wronging her. That Tyrant (repli'd Poleaander) is to be seen, but he is almost invincible: He goes alwayes arm'd, and lives in a place so strong, and so well furnished with resolute Souldiers, that of those which have hitherto assault<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The successe (said Iphidamantus) will make it appeare whether I am happier then the rest; but hap what hap may, be confident I will not repent me of my enterprise: The onely griefe that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Why deferre you Sir? (said he, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing him to his brother) Why conceale you Melicerta from me? Are you become jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous assoone as you saw me sensible? And have you not presented me with my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but then when you thought me incapable of knowing it? No brother (repli'd our Heroë) I am neither jealous nor cunning, but will give you even more then you could hope: Yet shall I but vainly intimate how you may be happy if Achomat consent not to your felicity. My Lord (said Iphidamantus) let not the thought of that hinder you, I thinke not of inriching my selfe, my intent is onely to pay my debt: Let Achomat doe what he pleaseth with me; I owe him all that I owe not to Periander; when he shall use me as his slave, he shall doe nothing unjustly: leave therefore in his hands my good and ill fortune, and let him dispose of either as he pleaseth: whatsoever hee shall deliberate, I can never be unhappy if I but once suppresse Melicerta's miseries. Achomat was about to speake, and may be to testifie to Iphidamantus, that he held him not in the quality of a slave, when Bajazet, who had left Abdelmelec in as ill a case as Polexander had the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54727:224"/>
Moorish Knight, came to know the cause of so long an interparley, and who the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Knight was: but he no sooner look'd on him, then he alighted, and with open arms (astonished and overjoyed) went to imbrace him with all the kindnesse his accustomed noblenesse could cause any to expect from him. A hundred times he kiss'd him, and had not given him over, but that the faire Prince said Polexander was jealous of his imbraces. Straight he left him to salute Polexander, and because he had heard from Hydaspes and Almaid, what that Prince had done for Zabaim and Almanzaira, he c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander not induring him in that posture, nor to heare him speake so, tooke him in his armes, and willing to make knowne he had heard all his life; Is it possible (said he) that you reserve yet some cause of hatred against Zabaim, and that the love of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Almanzaira hath not been more powerfull over your resentments, then the ill nature of the King your father? Had you seen him as I did, ready to expiate by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of his bloud, those faults which Zelopa had made him perpetrate, you would be more sensible then you are of his repentance, and not deny him the comfort he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth in your returne. But what doe you here? Are you not satisfi'd with the death of Nephisus, and (may be) with that of Abdelmelec? Would you have their unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate father to be ranged in the number of those sacrifices which Axiamira demands from your amorous anger, and that it shall be deadly for all Princes to have had any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for that happy infortunate one? Bajazet deeming by this discourse that Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander knew all his designes, would againe have falne at his feet to have ask'd pardon for the love he bore the Princesse his sister, but Polexander, who look'd on him as on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then a King, retain'd him in his armes, and after often calling him brother, If (said he) your discretion had not so long time contested with your quiet, and not given to Iphidamantus and my selfe, thoughts unworthy to be related to you, we had both contributed all we could, and may be more reclaim'd the untractable humour of that Princesse, which sometimes under the name of Axiamira, then under that of Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus, or againe, of Ennoramita, set on fire all the Kingdomes of Africa. Is not she the cause of this warre too? have you not mistaken her brother for her? Bajazet waxing pale at that question; There is no doubt of it (said he) my misfortune is as great as ever, and I know too well for my peace, that Almaid being deceiv'd next the King of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco, tooke Iphidamantus for Axiamira. This discourse had infallibly continued, but the Sentinels seeing a great Troupe of horse sallying out of Morocco gates, advertis'd the Princes they were to be set on. Achomat instantly commanded foure Squadrons of foot to advance, which had stood to their armes since the beginning of the combate; and placing himselfe in the front of a Troup of Cavalry, rid to force the enemy backe againe into the Towne. The three Princes got on horsebacke to assist him, though he had no need of them, and were Spectators of that incomparable valour which had rais'd him to the supreame greatnesse of all the Ottoman Court. Assoou as feare and night had shut up the last Enemy within the walls of Morocco; Polexander and the three other Princes return'd to the place of their Combate, and scorning to intermingle ought of base or cruell with their victory, commanded fires and torches to be lighted, to see in what case Abdelmelec and the Moorish Knight were. Our Heroë found the last sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his misfortune, and cursing the stars which seem'd to affect the dishonour and ruine of the Princes of Grenada: by the same charming humanity he comforted him, wherewithall he was wont to suffer himself to be overcome by such as he had vanquish'd; and without any importunate soliciting, either to tell him his condition, or name, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded some Arabians to take him up, and carry him into Morocco. In the meane while, Bajazet, who found Abdelmelec dead, lamented, that the chance of Warre was not able to make him a vanquisher without depriving so valiant a Prince of his life. Iphidamantus came just as he was bewailing, and seeing his friend all over wounded and drown'd in his blood, was almost at the losse of his judgement and life: at last, reason recollected him, and then his sorrow breaking forth; Unfortunate Prince (said he) how fatall have thy fathers errours been to thee! And what a dangerous Enemy hast thou had of thy great courage! Thou art dead Abdelmelec, and I live and avenge not thy

death! But the same law which seemes to engage, imperiously forbids me to undertake it. My duty is oppos'd by my duty, my friendship by my friendship, and my faith by my faith. I am Polexanders, I am Achomats; I owe my selfe to Bajazet, I cannot be thine. Thou knowest it now deare Abdelmelec, and thy soule which reads my heart, sees well whether I be so perfidious as to faile of my word: I have sworn to thee an amitie not to be terminated but by the one of us; thy misfortune hath disingaged my word, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Achomat and the two other Princes were extreamly sorrowfull for the losse of their Enemie, and would not have been so indisconsolate, but onely for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off Iphidamantus discontent. Bajazet, by the advise of the rest, sent the body of Abdelmelec to the King his father, and intimated by Hydaspes, they had been both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and their errours being equally lamentable, the griefe of the one should not be lesse then that of the other. Hydaspes performed his Commission; but whilst the too amorous, and inraged Hely bewailed the losse of his pretended Ennoramita, more then the death of his son; and ruminated in his long watchings all the tragicall events where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the beautie of one same person had laid waste his Estate: the foure Printes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd into the Campe, and without giving themselves any rest after so much travell, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated on the execution of some new designes. Polexander, that thought on nothing but how to see Alcidiana againe, would not cause Bajazet and Iphidamantus to languish any longer, nor put off till any other time the contentments he was able to give them: But how extreame soever his owne longing was, that of the two other Princes was no lesse. Iphidamantus came and cast himselfe at his feet, and embracing his knees, My Lord (said hee) if without impudence I may dare take the boldnesse of calling you brother, and if any one action of my life, hath made mee worthy that honour, I intreate you even by that, or rather by Alcidiana, not to leave mee any longer in my offence and infamy. Let mee not be guilty even after my repentance, nor let Melicerta continue her reproaching my ingratitude, when I have given over my being ingratefull. Get leave of Achomat (repli'd Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) to goe and free that Princesse; and assure your selfe, you shall no sooner have that granted, but you shall obtaine all the rest too. Achomat over-heard what our Heroe spake to his brother, and desirous to witnesse to them both, that hee remitted all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments to their merits and his affection: Goe, (said he to Iphidamantus) goe, my deare Solyman, gather up (if it be possible) the remainder of my shipwrack, and assure your selfe, that what you can save of it, you preserve that for your selfe. After this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which not onely included the leave Iphidamantus requested, but withall a cleere assurance of enjoying her whom he was to deliver; he tooke Achomat's hands, and moystning them with his teares, My Lord (said hee) is it possible that you will forget those offences which my mishap hath made me commit against your goodnesse; and that in lieu of treating me as malefactors which are not quit for their being peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, you will daigne to adde your bounty to your mercy, and give me with my life, that which can make it most pleasing unto me? Achomat, having imbrac'd the Prince, Your birth and vertues (said he) are such, that all I can offer you is below what they should make you expect: But were they lesse glorious and eminent, the name of Polexander is to me so venerable, that it alone can oblige me to me more then I doe. Deferre not then Melicerta's deliverance, but give a happy end to those adventures whose beginnings have been so mournfull: No sooner had Achomat ended his speech, but Iphidamantus turn'd to Polexander, and casting himselfe downe againe, besought the Prince to have pity on him. Brother (said our Heroë) you shall have your desire, but I must first return to my ship, and by a Prisoner which I have there in hold, learne what meanes you are to use, for getting the upper hand of that Tyrant which persecuteth faire Melicerta. Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus (to whom his lingring was a new torture) besought our Heroë, not to have so much care for his preservation, but to let him runne the hazards of an enterprise, which must needs be most honourable unto him. No, no, (said Polexander) 'tis fit to keep you now you are growne rationall; give not so absolute trust to a passion which you have not yet had time to know well, and assure your selfe, you shall very quickly be a happy
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:54727:225"/>
man, if you will leave to me the disposall of your fortune: Iphidamantus being with this speech silenc'd, cast downe his eyes sighing, and yet he knew him selfe bound to doubt no more of his happinesse, since the King his brother had resolv'd it. Bajazet look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him with teares in his eyes, O (said he) too happy Iphidamantus, thou hast but scarce wished, and art presently put in possession of what thou desirest: Glory, that thy fortune is particular, and not like other mens, and that Heaven in inspiring thee with life, bound it selfe by an irrevocable oath, to heap on, and accomplish it with all that was of most delight and value. But I, borne in misfortune, and who from my life's first dayes have not beene able to avoid an assured death but by a cruell exile, what can I expect in growing elder, but an increase and growth of my miseries? All prosperities shun me, they are to me but dreames and illusions, and vanish assoone as I am perswaded they are in my full possession. Axiamira, faire Axiamira, that wert propos'd to me by my hopes as the prize for all my dangers and paines in this Siege, thou disappearest in the very instant when I should have seene thee; and Iphidamantus after his long abusing the credulous Hely, tels me that I abuse my selfe. In what corner of the world have mine enemies hid thee? To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what part of the Universe should I turne my hopes and sayles, or how shall I get predominance o're the malignity of those Stars that will not have me fortunate? Polexander staid Bajazets complaints and told him, Fortune was not of those base Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who either become reconcil'd to execute more surely their revenge, or have no heart but for hatred or to love by halfes. She hath not (said he) given you the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your parents, she hath not (as it were) miraculously pluck'd from the throne the person that hindred your rising to it; in a word, she hath not so much further'd your happinesse to leave it imperfect. Call to minde, she hath restor'd to you those things which you had lost, one after another, and by consequence makes ready to render you that Axiamira which onely seemes wanting to fill up all your list of felicities. With that our Heroe intreated that Prince and Achomat too, to permit him to make a turne to his ship for the giving order to such things as concern'd their common satisfaction. The Princes unwilling to offer any troublesome ceremonies, let him goe as he came; and went to entertaine time with Iphidamantus who seem'd to accuse his brother to be (in good earnest) jealous of his contentment. In the meane while our Heroe got to his ship, and finding himselfe divided betwixt the love he bore to Cydaria, and that which he owed Melicerta, he stood some time before them, ere he could resolve to which of the two he should first make knowne the good newes he had learnt. At last he govern'd himselfe by necessity, and began with her that had most need of comfort. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your selfe (said he to Melicerta) for the most incredible and the least to be hoped for adventure you are able to imagine. I am afraid to discover it, so strange doe I finde it; and so greatly doe I feare lest your spirits dissipated at the recitall of so great an accident be not strong enough to support it. Put your selves then to the most tryall you can; and as you have rendred many testimonies of that constancy we ought to have in afflictions; see likewise, and aske of your selves, if you have so much power over the agitations of your minde, that you can receive an extreame joy without running the hazard of your life. The greatest of joyes that can trouble me (replied Melicerta) is the happinesse of seeing once more the insensible Iphidamantus, and then, those which gave me life. Is it possible (replied Polexander) that your joy can extend no farther, and that you conceive nothing whereby it may be augmented? No, (said Melicerta) See the bounds of all my hopes, and by consequence, my joyes cannot be larger extended. What (replied our Heroe) say you had made Iphidamantus sensible, that he were pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately in love with you, if he were all on fire out of his longing desire to see you, if he would expose himselfe to the extreamest dangers, and give his life for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of yours; would not your joy be infinitely more then that you promise your selfe by his meere sight? The impossibilities you propose (replied Melicerta) being no more able to deceive me, cannot neither make me conceive those prodigious joyes which have heretofore (as some faine) beene the deaths of some mothers and lovers. I feare lest you may be an addition to those examples (said Polexander) and therefore I beseech you againe, by some necessary preparation, to dispose your minde, which
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54727:226"/>
now is familiar with nought but sadnesse and affliction, to welcome a joy which as a remedy too violent, may kill in lieu of curing her. Melicerta not being able to refraine from smiling at Polexanders serious discourse; Feare not (said she) to tell me those good and dangerous newes. I am not in case to dye for joy, and that which you are about to tell me, must be very extraordinary, if it can either diminish or charme my afflictions. Our Heroe, imagining the sad Lady had time enough given to heare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger the change of her fortune: told her, he had found her father and her love, in such a case as had beene deadly either for the one or the other, and may bee for them both, if obligation and respect had not bound Iphidamantus hands. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he related in what manner he made himselfe knowne to them, and had drawn the one out of his insensibility, and the other from his errour; notwithstanding all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerta's extreame strivings, not to be transported with her excesse of joy, yet could she not be Mistresse over her first perturbations. Her spirit forsooke her doe what she could, and made her feele an universall disquiet in all the parts of her body: her tongue was tied up, or at most but fumbling in her mouth, O heaven! said she divers times, that is not possible, and so fell downe in a swoune on her bed; Cydaria and her women ran to her to stay her fainting; but there was no remedy, it must have his course, and Melicerta was not excepted from that rigorous Law, by which Love as well as Nature would never have up passe without danger from one extreame to another. At last she came againe, but so weakened with that fit, that she look'd as she had been long sicke, Polexander laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, her former constancy, and that strength of spirit with which she had dar'd not onely to defie death, but also happinesse, besought her to beleeve him more then she had done, and by degrees to prepare her selfe for the reception of Achomat and Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. After that, he left her onely with her women, and that she might be at more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, tooke Cydaria into his chamber, and being shut up with her; Sister (said he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently) if I did not approve of that judicious severity in which you have lived to this day, and if I liked not those thoughts which made you feare the service and love of Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor, farre more then the ill usage and hatred of your enemies; I should have forgotten what the vertue of your Sex ought to be, and how scrupulously a beautie more divine then ordinary, should, (to preserve her from calumny) not onely be rigorous to such as converse with her, but even cruell to her selfe. I commend you therefore for cutting off all hopes wherewith the quality of Almanzor, and your adverse fortune might flatter his young desires; and chose rather to put his life in hazard, then to lay at stake your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But as in what you have done, you have showne your selfe a worthy inheritrix of Perianders magnanimitie as well as of Axiamira's wisdome; you should now much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the vertues of them both, if being no longer in your ill fortune, but on the contrary, able to grant or refuse any thing with that independency which is annexed to the quality of Princes; you doe not conforme your selfe to the laudable intentions of Almanzor. Cydaria, prepossessed by a false opinion, stopped her brother, and having humbly besought him not to goe further on with his discourse: I know my Lord (said she) that since the losse of Periander and Axiamira, Heaven enjoynes me, to look on you as on one that represents them; and to beleeve my intentions are not just, if they be not wholly subjected to yours: this being so, it is forbidden me to have any aversion or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but as you shall think for my good, that I am obliged to love or no; and how good soever my election might be, it cannot be lawfull without your approbation. Doubt not then (if you please) but (being ruled by these thoughts) I have a blinde obedience for all that you shall prescribe me, but knowing you perfectly just, and truely debonaire, I will take the boldnesse to make my humble remonstrance to you, and say, That if I come once to be in the power of Zabaim's sonne, I runne the hazard of becoming a second Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaira. Polexander, perceiving that Cydaria's discretion permitted her not to make knowne her truest thoughts; Sister (said he) being so well assured of my love as you are, give me leave to complaine a little of your modesty, and to accuse you for not using me as a brother, but as a stranger. I feare hence forward to speake freely to you, yet I will, since my affection commands me to lay by a while my complying, to tell you without chiding, that what you seeme to feare most, is what you feare least: your foresight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not farre enough to make you feare Almanzor's future inconstancy: 'tis the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54727:226"/>
that affrights you, or to speake more truly, which holds as it were in suspence the resentment which you ought to have of those services which that great Prince hath done you. I remember very well the time and place, when and where your little anger began; an opinion which an ambiguous speech wrought in you of Almanzors sicklenesse begun this spleene: it hath beene fed by such new thoughts as your griefe and jealousie could contribute; and you have beleev'd, that he deserv'd to lose your affection which had neglected it for that of an unfortunate she-slave. Cydaria blushed at the truth of this discourse, and could well have wish'd for strong reasons to repell it; but Polexander giving her no leasure for such injustice; I will (said he) take you out of the errour you are in, and shew you how dangerous it is to give credit to their talke, who relate to us such things as have not been well examined. Know then that Bajazet, understanding by his Spies that you were falne into the King of Morocco's hands, instead of returning to Senega, where he was earnestly wished for, in lieu of satisfying the intreaties and love of Zabaim and Almanzaira, in lieu of going to receive the Crownes of so many Kingdoms assured to him, he left the Pirates Isle, and with all his forces came and besieg'd Morocco. The Combate he was in to day, in making him victorious, hath made him lose all the happinesse he expected by his victory: I let him know that his servants had taken Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus for you; Iphidamantus confirmed him in the same truth, and presently cast him backe into the same griefe he felt when your fained being stolne away, made him go seek for you in the Pirates Island. To speake truth, you must be altogether insensible if you be not moved with the love and perseverance of that Prince, and you have not any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at all, if for false suspitions, you leave Almanzor in such vexations as the beliefe of your losse casts him into. Though Cydaria was overcome by this remonstrance, yet she would but halfe shew it; and putting on the countenance of a personage that would not grow obstinate against a veritie: Time (said she) and occasions which have not your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousnesse for Almanzor, will teach me what I must thinke of him. As she ended these word, she heard a great noise, and thought it came from Melicerta's cabin, whither she ran and found her falne into a fainting, whence no remedie of theirs could draw her; at last our Heroë gave her of an Essence which Diceus had made him, and she presently recovered her sight and speech. Assoone as she saw the Prince and Cydaria, she made knowne to them by her languishing lookes, and strange sighes, that she was not strong enough alone, to overcome the disorder of her agitations, and that she need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Achomat and Iphidamantus to over-rule their rebellion. If the miseries I indure (said she to Polexander) move you to pity, be a meanes to bring hither my father and Solyman, and though I feare them both alike, winne them to see me in that mournfull case I am brought to; that their presence may at least<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> speedily make an end of killing me, if it have not power enough to preserve my life: with this she grew pale and shut her eyes, but Cydaria kept her from fainting againe, and with her words, as well as by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander's cordiall, strengthned her a little, and made her able for the seeing of Achomat and Iphidamantus. Our Heroë went to them, and related to what extremitie Melicerta was brought: those Princes were so overjoyed to see themselves so pleasingly deceiv'd, that they were within a little of running the Princesses fortune. Ah Polexander! (said Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat) with how much interest do you pay me the care I have taken in the breeding of Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus: he for his part imbraced his brother, and with a good grace upbraiding him for his malice to him; O how rigorously (said he) have you punished me for my contempt of love! y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t can you not execute too cruell a revenge, for my offences are beyond all others. But what doe I? I complaine on you, and yet am indebted to you for my life, since I am for Melicerta's safetie: let us goe quickly and free her from the rest of her miseries: with that he turned to Achomat, and continuing his speech; Doe not (said he) let that sweet Lady die, nor suffer Solymans inhumanitie to be infectious enough to corrupt your good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. To all this Achomat made no answer, but sent to Bajazets tent, and understanding none knew where he was, got to horse with Polexander and his brother, and rid in all haste to the haven: our Heroë got him into his shallop, with himselfe and his brother, and commanding his mariners to make all haste, they were in a trice at the ship. Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat went first aboard, and the two brothers followed him; their coming could not be so private but that it caus'd some noise in the ship: Melicerta heard it, and doubting
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54727:227"/>
not whence it sprung, was so violently mov'd with it, that her spirits dispersing againe, she fell into another trance; at that very instant the three Princes entred her cabin, and found her for dead on her bed: Achomat being not with held by any respect, cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on his daughters face, and moistning it with his teares, Melicerta (said he pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) my deare daughter, know thy father and increase not my griefes in renewing, when he thought them ended: Iphidamantus was at the beds foot as immoveable as a statue, and having his eyes fixed on Melicerta: Alas Madam (said he) will you have me beleeve that I am ever deadly to you? My insensibilitie hath oftentimes gone neere to bring you to your grave, and must my love now give a period to your dayes? Thus said Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus, but out of consideration he spoke it so softly that no body heard him. Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Melicerta came to her selfe, and seeing her selfe in the armes of a man, thought it had been Iphidamantus, and that beliete made her ashamed; she was about to thrust him away, but lifting her eyes up more fixtly, she knew 'twas her father, and so fell backe halfe dead with confusion and joy. My dear daughter, said Achomat, canst thou not indure the end of thy miseries? Must both good and ill make thee alike wretched? Open thine eyes, know thy father, and be not more cruell to thy selfe then either love or fortune: both of them at last accord what thou desirest, and if my consent be necessary for thy contentment, doubt not but it will be conformable with theirs. Melicerta heard one part of this speech, and forcing her selfe to answer it, My Lord (said she very softly to her father) if you will promise me your favour and forget my follie, I have yet courage enough to orecome my weaknesse, and preserve to you the unfortunate Melicerta. I have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all (repli'd Achomat kissing her) and protest thou canst desire nothing from my love which it will not grant thee. If the enjoying of Solyman can contribute ought to thy life's happinesse, I give him thee by that soveraigne Law which permits me to dispose of him. Melicerta blushed at those last words, and not daring to answer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented her selfe with casting her eyes on Iphidamantus. Achomat got him come neere, and speaking to him with the mildnesse of a father; If you yet (said he) remember, that I bred you as mine owne sonne, shew me I intreate you in the saving of Melicerta, that you have some resentment of my care: kill not him that hath preserv'd your life; and since Melicerta's love is worth more then the most glorious Crownes, make appeare to us now, that your minde is too generous to give an eare to ambition, when it whispers to you against dutie and justice. Melicerta never moved her eyes, but keeping them fix'd on Iphidamantus, expected his an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>wer to know what should become of her. Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus imagining there needed something else then words, to answer Achomat's win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning propositions, cast himselfe at his feet, and looking on Melicerta, When (said he) I thinke on what I owe to the goodnesse of the father, and the love of the daughter, and besides revolve in my mind the prodigies of my forepassed life, I acknowledge my self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the favours which both have afforded me: but since you measure by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my ingratitude, that of your benefits; and that you propose to me rewards in lieu of the punishments I have deserved, I cannot but stand amazed at my happinesse, and tell you, that as I have lived the most ingratefull of men, I must needs die so too, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie (whereto you have reduced me) of acknowledging your incomparable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Melicerta had an extreame desire to speake, but her discretion shut her lips, and her fathers presence permitted her not to take the freedome which her love advised her. Cydaria who judiciously had avoided her being present at these passages, entred Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa's cabin with an action and habit conformable to the present state of her fortune; and having gracefully done her complements, came to the faire Turke to congratulate with her. Achomat knowing her by Iphidamantus, did to her all the civilities she could expect from a man perplexed as he was, and led her to his daughters beds-head. Then did Cydaria make knowne her excellent ingenuitie, for taking Melicerta for the subject of her discourse; 'Tis a great while since (said she to Achomat) that the Princesse your daughter hath wished for this day, amongst all the torment which that absolute power presiding over us with so much tyrannie hath made her undergoe, she felt none so cruell as to be absent from you. A hundred times in my hearing hath she wished her selfe able to give her whole life for one instant of your sight; and sometimes, when the excesse of sorrowes had reduced her to an extremity: O death (hath she cryed) how sweet
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54727:227"/>
shouldst thou be unto me, so that thou wouldst not take me hence, before I had regain'd the favour of my honour'd Achomat. Cydaria spoke those words in a tone so fit to move compassion, that the Basha could not refraine from teares: but whilst he gave this tribute to nature, Iphidamantus rendred farre greater to love; he was come up to Melicerta, and standing in the posture of an offender, which strives to get pardon for his faults: Faire Princesse (said he in kissing her hand) scorne not this fugitive slave who prosecuted by the remorse of conscience, offers himselfe voluntarily to all that your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger shall denounce against him. 'Tis not the insensible Solyman you see at your feet, that monster hath long agoe been out of the number of things existing: 'tis the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and sensible Solyman, he yet intreates you to be lesse good then the Basha your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to forget such crimes as would make Mercy it selfe worthy to be punish'd had she sealed them a pardon. Melicerta in lieu of answering to this, incessantly sighed; she tooke Iphidamantus hand, put it to her mouth, and with kisses, or (to speake things as love hath inspired mee) with characters of fire, imprinted on it, the pardon which Iphidamantus beleev'd he had not merited. She contented her selfe with that mute elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not onely to assure her lover of the extremity of her affection, but to have him beleeve that all the miseries she had indured, were deare and pleasing to her, since they had produc'd such a height of felicity. Achomat interrupted the mysterious interparley of those lovers, and to refresh the spirits of all in Melicerta't cabin; I wonder now no more (said he to Cydaria and Iphidamantus, which stood one before the other) at those errours which have been occasioned by your two faces: The King of Morocco is not so blinde as we beleeve him, and for my owne part I confesse, that were I from you but one quarter of an houre, I should not know which were Solyman. Melicerta desirous to give to Cydaria all that she owed to her affection: This dayes miraculous accidents (said she) command you to give thankes to the King of Morocco's mistakes; you had been as well as I in your discontents, had that Prince been more cleere sighted, or Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet's spies not lesse deceiv'd then that amorous old man. But fitly (said she, changing her voyce) now I talke of Bajazer, what important reason of State hinders him from coming to taste those sweets for whose fruition be indures so many ills and exposeth himselfe to so many dangers? Achomat repli'd, had not our care of you daughter put by all others, we had either been yet in quest of that Prince, or he here with us. When Polexander came and intimated how extreame ill you were, we sent to Bajazetstents, to let him know the cause of your sudden departure, but our Messenger found him not, nor could any of his guard or slaves tell to what quarter of the Camp he was gone. The haste we made to see you, may be our excuse, if not towards this faire Princesse, (he spoke it, turning to Cydaria) yet at least to others, why we forsooke that Prince in his discontent. As Achomat ended his speech there arose a mighty noise in the midst of the Pirates fleet. The trumpets and other instruments of brasse, which serve to warne the Souldiers what to doe, disturb'd the silence of the night, and the calmnesse of the elements. They cryed, Arme, arme, on all sides, and the mariners whose toile is all in confusion, blended their clamours and cryes with the Souldiers uproare. Polexander not knowing what the cause of this Alarme should be, sent Diceus to inform him, who was no sooner out of the Kings ship but the noise was husht; yet loath to returne with nothing, he got to the place where the Pirates fleet was yet in battalia: he staid the first he met, to know what had happened, some told him the arrivall of the King of Senega, whom they thought friend to the King of Morocco, had engag'd the whole navy to put themselves in order to fight with him; Others told him, but uncertainly, of Bajazets losse, and gave him a great desire of cleering so important a newes: as he was in that trouble, he met with the Rover Hamet, who knowing him in the darke, Hoe, Diceus (said he) if thou lovest Bajazet, bring me quickly to the King thy master: Diceus told him he was in his ship; and for himselfe, he was come by his Masters command to know the cause of the Alarme. 'Tis a strange one (said Hamet sighing) but thou mayest know that Bajazet is dead, if Polexander save not his life. Diceus imagining Hamet to be too much afflicted to speake, got him into his shallop, and so carried him aboard the Kings ship. Assoone as he was in Melicerta's cabin, where Cydaria was with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces her brothers and Achomat, he cast himselfe at the feet of our Heroë, and witnessing
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54727:228"/>
his feare by his faultring speech, Sir (said he) you have gone neere within these two houres to lose Bajazet, and if your company get not the suppressing of his resentments, I verily beleeve he will meet with that death between the armes of Zabaim and Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaira, which he would have found in the sea. Knowest thou what thou sayest (asked Polexander) in a tone expressing his affright? Yes very well, repli'd the Rover, and know more, that the onely griefe of meeting with Iphidamantus, where he thought to have found Axiamira, hath made him to confine by a quick despaire his vaine and long hopes. Relate that strange resolution (repli'd Polexander) whilst we goe to succour that despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man; presently he call'd for Diceus, and commanding him softly, to cause his ship to be steer'd neere to Zabaim's, bid him with-draw, and he himselfe shut the dore to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerta's cabin: whilst he was speaking to Diceus, Cydaria was stolne behinde the sicke Princesses bed, and set her selfe on it, to heare Hamet, and not be seene. Our Heroë thought it so, and beleeving the Pirate's relation might contribute much to his sisters sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, intreated him to make known very particularly what he knew of his master's misfortune. Hamet being a little recollected, began his discourse thus; Some quarter of an houre after the newes of our General's victory came to our Navy, our Sentinels gave us notice there were a many sailes descri'd at the mouth of this River; this being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the fires on the coast, and by those in guard at the entrance, our Admirall made ready, and put the ships in battalia. But this alarme lasted not long, as you have heard; for presently two ships brought our Admirall newes that the discovered fleet was the King of Senega's, who as Bajazet's friend had for his aid arm'd all the vessels he could make ready. Our Admirall who was absolute in his command, sent not to Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet for his direction, but presently dispatch'd Telisman and my selfe to Zabaim. We made to him, and coming aboard, perform'd those complements whereto his assistance and quality obliged us; he seem'd very sad, and perceiving we tooke notice of it: Pardon me (said he) if I entertaine you not with all the joy I ought to shew you. As you came, my wife and my selfe were busied about the cleering (to our selves) somewhat which even now makes me not able to speake to you but with some disturbance: the adventure is such, as you must beare a share in it, but that you may the more freely understand it, let us retire to some roome in the place where we are, both more commodious and quieter then here among so many Souldiers and Mariners equally affrighted. Zabaim having received us with these civilities and excuses, brought us into his cabin, and spending not long time in speaking of his forces and the cause of his getting them together: My ship (said he) with some few others, staid at the foot of that dangerous rocke which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hangs the entrance into this River, and I attended the Moone rising for my setting saile againe, when I heard a voyce over my head which in words the most lamenting I ever heard, besought heaven and earth, things sensible and insensible, to be witnesses after his death of his faith and constancy. Whilst I was attentive to those complaints, there grew a great bustling among the sailes and ropes of my ship, and running to see what it was, I found a man hung in the tackling: I commanded to have him straight taken downe, and seeing that the height from whence he fell had depriv'd him of his senses, have caus'd him to be brought into a cabin neere to this; no sooner cast I mine eyes on him, but I know not what remembrance fill'd me with feare and horrour; my wife coming in to practise that charity which hath gotten her the name of Mother to the afflicted, earnestly look'd on him, and was no lesse troubled then I. We have for these two houres done all we can to get out of our astonishment, and o'recome the long trance of that unfortunate man, but as effectlesse in the one as in the other; this is the cause you have not been entertain'd as you might expect: When Zabaim had ended, Sir (said I) may 'tis fit our Generall were advertis'd of the accident, therefore we both beseech your Majesty to let us see that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate person. My thoughts (said the King) which are not yet well setled, made me forget that which particularly I had a desire to tell you; 'tis, that I am much deceiv'd if the man we have succour'd be not one of the principall of your Army. By something he weares he seemes to be a man of command, and if my wife mistake not, it must necessarily be your Generall himselfe. Here Zabaim stopp'd, and we who found no likelihood in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, besought him to let us see the man, and to put him out of the opinion he was in, we related to him what Bajazet had done that very day: but assoone as he shewed him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54727:228"/>
to us, lying yet stretched out as dead, I knew him and cried out 'twas my Generall. My companion as much afflicted as my selfe, thinking Bajazet had beene dead, cast himselfe on him, and kissing his hands, began to call to him in his eares, as all the Sectaries of Mahomet use to hollow in the eares of their dead. In the meane while whether Nature after it had beene so long time dull'd, awaked suddainely, or the Princes strength recall'd by their applying of remedies had disengaged his spirits which his fall had as 'were suffocated, so it was that Bajazet came to himselfe. The first signes of life he gave us, were his sighes, which being not well perfected pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the place of their conception, and were not perceiv'd but by their heavings about the seate of his heart; These halfe-sighes were followed by others, which seem'd to flye headlong to get forth. At last, after he had a while mutter'd what none could understand, yet came he out distinctly with this: I will no more depend on the injustice of fortune, and my soule unloaden of the weight of my body, may freely goe in quest and finde thee faire Axiamira in what <unclear>corner</unclear> of the earth soever my cruell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny hath hidden thee. Almanzaira recovering from her deadly sorrow by degrees as her Son came out of his swoon, ceas'd not to invoake that eternall Pity which had so often and so miraculously redeem'd her out of her afflictions; and to beseech thence with her teares, an end to those miseries which continually travers'd her life. Her prayer ended, she oftentimes kissed Bajazet, whose head she kept on her breast, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him sometimes Almanzor and othertimes Bajazet, intreated him to know her and to come out of his reaveries. To strike his imagination with some name well knowne to him, she intreated him to looke on Almaid and Hydaspes who infinitely grieved for him: At those names he strove to open his eyes, but the brightnesse of the lights for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him to shut them againe; Almaid (said he) and Hidaspes are with me, for their fidelity would not permit them to survive my death. You are welcome, deare Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of my many miseries; and since in your life-time you have lov'd nothing more deare then my company and contentment; continue that affection, and joyning for ever your shadowes with mine, let us goe together in quest of faire Axiamira. Whilst Bajazet mov'd all that heard him to compassion, and Zabaim with Almanzaira melted into teares, I came to that incomparable lover, and so talk'd with him as he came out of his musing. Yet no sooner was he come to himselfe but he began to cry out as he had felt some great torture, and afflicting himselfe for being alive: How Bajazet (said he) thou liv'st then, and yet hast for ever lost the hope of finding Axiamira! Ah Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der! Ah Iphidamantus! what will you say of me? To get him from this new affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. I said you were in great care and search'd for him every where. With that I came away, and had so good fortune as to meet with Diceus when I was out of hope of finding you. If therefore you regard the friendship of Bajazet, save his life while it is in your power. Here Hamet ended; and Polexander replied (to comfort him) that his Generall should soone have satisfaction. But what doe you the while, faire Cydaria? You sigh in secret, you beare a part in the griefes you conferre on the loyall Almanzor, and repent for suspecting so wonderfull a constancy. I see well your scrupulous vertue growes angry with your disposition, and it is not lesse griev'd then your lover, to be compell'd to receive so sensible a blow, and not have sufficient armes to defend it selfe from it. But let her not believe, that in giving way to so powerfull an Enemy, she les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens her reputation. 'Tis true your severities are overcome, and abandoning a place they had so couragiously maintain'd, they would exhibit to your thought, your being accus'd of weakenesse or cunning. But let not your faire soule feare these calumnies. You yeeld way when it is both just and glorious not to defend your selfe. I could not refraine from this exclamation, seeing what transports and anxieties the newes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazets despaire wrought in the faire and discreet Cydaria. Certainely her vertue strove incredibly to hide her resentments, and not let her selfe be overcome by this unlooked for accident, but the weaker part of her soule, suppressed the stronger, and wisdome was enforc'd to give place to love. Polexander who seem'd to be ordain'd by heaven to be the comforter of all afflicted, and the Lovers Mediator betwixt Love and Fortune; understanding his Ship was come up to Zabaim's, left Cydaria with Melicerta, Achomat and Iphidamantus, and went alone to prepare Bajazet for the receiving that happinesse
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54727:229"/>
he came to present him. When Zabaim and Almanzaira knew him, they were so much overjoyed, that they seem'd to have no more thought of the danger wherein their owne sonne yet lay: O my deare deliverer (cry'd Almanzaira) turne your eyes on a miserable mother which hath no life but in the life of her sonne; and now perfect that which you began in the Isle whereinto Fortune had exiled me. Heaven promised me at that very instant you arriv'd there, that the period of my miseries should be the work of your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and extreame charity. Perfect a promise which should be infallible, and since you have preserv'd the mother in her selfe, save her againe in her sonne. Madam, reply'd Polexander, the spectacle here is such a wonder to me, that I can scarce beleeve what mine eyes and eares informe me; surely the ill Angell, Enemy to the greatnesse of your race, hath driven Bajazet to a resolution, which in all likelihood was not to be expected, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the vigour of his spirit, or from the power of fortune her selfe. 'Tis not past five or six houres since he came off victorious from a Combate, whereto he had beene challeng'd by the Prince of Morocco; and Achomat, Iphidamantus, and my selfe, were preparing our selves, to see him triumph over his enemies, and the Town he hath besieg'd; when Hamet brought us newes of his despaire: If Madam, I divine right, I know the cause, and can by consequence promise your Majesty to give an end to it. I do not doubt it, (repli'd Almanzaira) and how great soever our afflictions are, I hold them not past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, if you undertake the cure. A fairer hand then mine (said Polexander) must be imployed in so great a restauration, let it suffice that I know where 'tis to be had; and you have nought to doe but to render the patient capable of receiving what shall be prescribed for the assuring of his recovery. 'Twas thought Bajazet heard these last words, because he presently opened his eyes, and made plainly appeare, he had absolutely forgotten all he had done since his parting from Polexander. He arose, and knowing the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many strange faces, You see (said he) how fortune continues the signs of her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: Abdelmelec is dead, Morocco is brought to the extremity, I have forced out of her Kings hands, that which made me proclaime warre against him, and yet am I more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then I was before my victories: the happinesses I desire not, come head-long tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in at my pleasure; and that which I wish for, runs from me in what part of sea or land soever I follow it. Put out of your minde (repli'd Polexander) a beliefe which may be was true in times past, but is not now: you shall finde at Morocco, what you seek, there. Hely who deserves not the fruition of Axiamira, could have only her picture, but Almanzor, whose vertue can never be worthily enough recompenc'd, shall when he please possesse Axiamira her selfe. Bajazet, scarce giving Polexander leave to end what he had begunne, and besides not taking notice of one of them that were about him, imbrac'd our Heroë, and calling him often his Lord and Deliverer, Doe not (said he) deferre the execution of your promise: the happinesse you propose to me is so great, that you must give me leave to doubt of it, till mine owne eyes assure me. I refuse not the condition (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered Polexadder) but what will the King your Father say, or the Queen your Mother thinke, if you goe hence without rendring them that to which nature and their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bindes you? Bajazet started at those words, and looking about him, he not onely knew Zabaim (for he had often seen him) but beleeving who Almanzaira was, both by Almaids relation, and instinct of bloud, he cast himselfe at their feet, and besought them to pardon his present and forepass'd extravagances? 'Tis I (my sonne) said Zabaim that should aske to be forgiven for mine, and intreate you by my repentance, (which is the onely thing can winne you to a forgetfulnesse of my faults) to blot out of your memory all that I have made you suffer since the day of your birth. And I my sonne, said Alman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaira, (casting her selfe on Bajazets necke) beseech you to lay all the accidents of your life on the secrets of that Providence which cannot possibly faile, and to beleeve, that no fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister thing hath betided you but for your better availe. Bajazet had many good things to say, but the imperious object of that beauty he wished for, not permitting him to have a thought for any other then her selfe, made him contract them into submissions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses. Almanzaira, who was incomparable in all her endowments, desirous to conferre a part of her contentment on her sons passion, intreated Polexander to acquit him of his promise, and not deferre a pleasure which might be the ruine of many others. Bajazet shall be satisfi'd (reply'd our Heroë) and his satisfaction shall be the more perfect, in that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:54727:229"/>
for the receiving it he shall not lose the pleasure he takes in the sight of the King his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and your selfe. What must I doe to be so happy? (cried Bajazet) with the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency of a man truly passionate? nothing (said Polexander) but to goe from this ship into mine. Zabaim, who had at least gotten this advantage over his extreame amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inclination, to be the most civill of all men, said, That though Almanzor should once againe be jealous of him, he would be the first to see his ancient Mistresse. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently there were plankes laid between the two ships, and not onely Zabaim but Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira, (whom Polexander led) and the timorous Bajazet, went aboard our Heroe's ship. Achomat and Iphidamantus came to welcome them, and their complements en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded brought them into the cabin where Melicerta and Cydaria were. Almanzaira, who went in first, first saluted the two Princesses, and Polexander presenting his sister to her; See here madam (said he) the cause of all your sons discontent, I deliver her into your hands to be punished in a way proportionable to her offences. Almanzaira in stead of answering Polexander, addressed her selfe to Cydaria; I doe not (said she) beleeve you so guilty as your brother would perswade me; nor doe not thinke you are a stranger to me; 'tis long agone since I knew you, and if Polexander call to minde what he saw in my hermitage, he can tell you, how you kept me company there, and your picture was one of my principall ornaments. Cydaria, shewing her vertue by her modesty, and her wisdome by her answer; I was (said she to the Queen) most happy in a time when I esteem'd my self the most unfortunate Maiden alive; and by that which it hath pleas'd your Majesty to let me know, I acknowledge, fortune did justly handle me so cruelly, since in lieu of being thankfull for her favours, I accus'd her for want of pity and justice: I aske her pardon heartily, or rather, to shew my thankfulnesse for the good I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, to the person to whom I owe it, I persever in my continuall contempt of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and cast my selfe at your feet to render you my humble acknowledgements for your exceeding favours. Madam (repli'd Almanzaira, having staid her from kneeling) I meane not that you shall so easily be acquitted of the debt you owe me: I desire you would give me the Originall, for the care I tooke in so well preserving the Copy; and that you will contribute somewhat to the safety of him that would have hazarded his life so often for you. Cydaria could not answer the Queene, because Zabaim, Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, Bajazet and Iphidamantus, entring the cabin, they were ingag'd to begin new ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities. The King of Senega blush'd in seeing againe that face which had power to overcome all Zelopa's enchantments: Cydaria grew red too at the remembrance of some former passages; but she presently grew pale, and had much adoe to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right when she saw Bajazet between Achomat and Iphidamantus. Zabaim, as reform'd as he was, left not to be very pleasant and gamesome, and told Cydaria (after he had saluted her) he repented him not of his former perceptions. I found you faire in Guinea, (said he) I finde you faire in Morocco, and if I may speake it with awaking the jealousie of any that shall hear me, I love you no lesse now then I did then: yet there is this oddes, (he added, smiling) then I lov'd you with an intent to enjoy you my selfe, and now I love you that another may be happy in your fruition; I am certaine the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son will not displease you, for if my memory faile me not, I call to minde that you had no great mislike to him I would bestow on you. Cydaria, that had a flexible and pleasant wit, and who gracefully altered her discourse and humour, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of such personages whom she would oblige, smil'd before she would answer Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim, and casting her eyes downe a little. I do not remember (said she) ought of what your Majesty talkes to me: The accidents which are befalne me since I came out of Guinea, have so wrong'd my memory, that I have scarce enough left to keep me from not knowing my selfe. Zabaim in lieu of answering, went to take Bajazet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting him to Cydaria, Here's one (said he) will put you in minde of those things you have forgotten: I am sure he hath not; and there is nothing that betided you whereof he cannot give you an exact account. Bajazet would faine have borne a part in this franknesse of humour, but he was not master of his fancy: Love which is a severe God would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not have him jeast with his mysteries; he appear'd there before Cydaria, overjoy'd, but abashed and confused. If he had hope, he had feare too; no sooner did any heate appeare in his face, but it was called backe to its center, and forc'd to give place to a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54727:230"/>
chilnesse, which ftoze his bloud and made him as pale as death. Almanzaira did the part of a good mother in her sonnes extremity; she spoke to his Mistresse for him, and said so much, that she must have been farre lesse inclin'd then she was to beleeve it, if she had not been perswaded: after the father, the mother, the brothers and friends had laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of this easie recomplement, they thought it best to leave the remainder to love. Bajazet had never a Second left to serve him against Cydaria, and Iphidamantus was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with Melicerta; whilst these foure lovers swumme in such delights which cannot be knowne nor expressed by those that love not; Zabaim, Almanzaira and Achomat equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfi'd, consulted together about the accomplishment of their childrens desires. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander's Officers, who well knew their charges, had in the meane time prepar'd a feast worthy the company in their masters ship: the neatnesse and magnificence of it strove for priority, and though the sea have not those commodities which are found on land; the place yet where those Princes were entertain'd, made them see that Polexander was able to master all kinde of difficulties. During the repast, divers discourses were on foot, at last Iphidamantus was intreated by the company, to tell them by what meanes he fell againe (under the habit of a maiden) into the hands of the King of Morocco. Melicerta who had a farre greater desire then the rest to heare her lover, impos'd silence assoone as any one would speake, and shewing an attention even before Iphidamantus began his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, anticipated the pleasure she was to receive by it. Iphidamantus, loath his Mistresse should stay any longer in expectation of what he desired, began thus the sequele of his adventures.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Continuation of <hi>Iphidamantus</hi> History.</head>
                  <p>THis is the second time the King of Morocco's eyes, (as ill judges of beauty as his old yeares are unfit for love) have taken me for Cydaria. The first was when I left the service of the Grand-Signior: as I was in quest of Polexander, I was ship-wrack'd on the coast of Morocco, but never was shipwrack accompanied with so strange an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for no sooner was I got on shore, but a many Souldiers of Guargetsem Fortresse tooke me up with extraordinary shoutes, and making the places about to resound with the name of Ennoramita, brought me right to their Kings chamber. That Prince over-joyed to see me, a hundred times repeated the same name, cast himselfe at my feet, kissed my hands, us'd me like a Goddesse or an Angell, brought me into a chamber royally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd, and left me among many women and blacke eunuches. To this Iphidamantus added, that which he before related to Polexander; and coming to his departure from the Pirates Island, till this time (said he) no man ever knew, no not Polexander, the true cause that made me forsake Bajazet. I must now declare it to you, and not feare to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse my faults, since I have so exceeding milde judges; I was enjoying the delights of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet's Isle, and (I confesse it to my shame) never thought on Histeria's death, nor Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa's miseries, when the quietnesse of my minde, and the mirthsomenesse of my humour forsooke me without any apparent cause. That which till then pleas'd me, began to be distastfull, and the pensivenesse, sighes, and Bajazet's disquiets, which I could hardly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, became my most pleasing diversions; I found delights in solitude; company was irksome to my melancholy and restlesse thoughts; I learnt to sigh in earnest, and found pleasure in it; sleep left me; and I knew by my long and troublesome watchings, how cruell the nights are to the sicke and unfortunate. Though I grew angry at this new manner of living, yet I found some sweetnesse in it; one night, when certainly I slept, though I thought my selfe awake, a great flash of light dash'd all obscurity from my chamber, and strooke into mine eyes: at first I took it for lightning, but the same lustre having (as it were) dazeled me the second time, I opened my bed-curtaines to see what it was, and perceiv'd walking with an incredible sadnesse and slownesse, a young mayden which had her breast open'd with some blow of a sword: the bloud gush'd out in great clots from the wound, and the faire apparition, inlieu of being terrifi'd, look'd on it run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out, with a great deal of pleasure; holding her eyes thus fix'd on her wound, she drew
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:54727:230"/>
neere me, and shewing it to me with the point of her bloudy sword, Looke on it (said she) as well as I, insensible Solyman, we have no lesse contributed to it the one then the other: 'Twas indeed this hand and this sword that made it, but 'twas thy disdaine and inhumanity, which drove both to this desperate action: Make thy selfe drunke with this bloud, since thou hast so thirsted for it, draine out all that rests in my veines, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thy cruelty, so it extend no further, and that my poore sister who languisheth in a desert Island, be not compell'd to have recourse to my violent remedy for the cure of that malady whereof thou art the inflicter. With these reproaches the Ghost vanished, and I awaking found my selfe as cold as ice, and as wet as if I had newly come out of a river. Alas! (cry'd I presently) faire soule, which accusest me of thy death, thou knowest well that I am but a farre distant cause, and though my inclination would have drawne me to love thee, yet my reason must have hindered me from it. I confesse yet that I am guilty, since thou condemnest me, and would to heaven my ruine could restore thy life againe; thou shouldst see me runne to my death with joy and alacrity; but since these wishes and vowes are but bootlesse and vaine, I will make one more just and solid, and from this day engage my selfe, never to be at rest, till I have given Melicerta satisfaction. I cannot tell you whether it were the effect of the vision, or my vow that wrought my alteration; but presently, of impassible, I began to be all passion; and felt all those torments which Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander and Bajazet had so often described to me: I cast my selfe out of my bed, and scarce having the patience to dresse me, went to Bajazet, not knowing well what I did: Brother (said I, all amazedly) I love, and my desire to finde the worthy object of my affection, will not permit me to stay longer with you. Bajazet will tell you if you please, that hearing me talke thus, he thought me out of my wits, and asked oftentimes to what end I held a discourse with him so out of all appearance? 'Tis very true though, said I, and that you may not doubt of it, hearken to such things as I never yet disclos'd to any. Thereupon I related to him all which had happened to me at Constantinople and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto; and ending with the vision I had lately seen, I fill'd him with as much astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as commiseration: Besides, knowing my sicknesse by his owne experience, Away, away (said he) deferre it no longer, 'tis not justice that you should be exempted from the fate of your family. He gave me a good tall ship, with all such as I would chuse to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me, and taking his leave; My dear brother (said he) I will quickly follow you; and but for Almaid and Hydaspes whom I daily expect, I would be as well a companion in your voyage as I am in your fortune: thus we parted, and 'twas after our separation that all those accidents betided me which I have recounted. After I had been some while with Polexander, and saw him (as well as my selfe) in a longing to attempt his fortune againe, I left him steering for the inaccessible Island, and bore up for the Straights of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braltar, to get into the Mediterranean Sea, and enquire after Melicerta either in France or Italy. The winde driving me on the coast of Barbary, I landed in the territory of Argier, and went into the Towne with an intent to see whether Melicerta had not been so unfortunate as to be taken by those Barbarians, and enchained among their slaves: But my search was as effectlesse there as it had been in other places; and for being too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in those parts, I lost the hope of seeing Melicerta againe. That Towne being peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with a many severall Nations, and of all kinde of wits, amongst others feeds a great sort of men and women which make profession of calculating nativities, to divine of things lost, and foretell of what is to come: I went to one of these Cheaters which was of most reputation; 'twas a Marabou called Cid Amatonis, which dwelt without the gates of Argier: after that false Prophet had done a thousand superstitious Ceremonies wherewithall he was wont to deceive poore people; he told me, that which I searched after, was not to be found but among the dead. Polexander interrupting his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Had you (said he) understood the true sense of those words, you would not accuse your Mirabou of ignorance and lying: for 'tis very true (insensible Solyman) that the treasure you look'd for, was shut up among the habitations of the dead, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and generous Melicerta had chosen for her retreate the Tombe of her dead sister. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerta was a little moved at Polexanders reproving his brother, and therefore speaking with her accustomed sweetnesse; My Lord (said she to our Heroe) you know that Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus hath made his peace, and by consequence we must not revoke to memory things
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54727:231"/>
passed. The company could not heare these milde remonstrances, without admiring the goodnesse of that Lady that made them, and ravish'd with Iphidamantus strange accidents, intreated him to proceed; which he did (from where his brother had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted him) thus: I confesse (said he) when Cid Amatonis had made me this fatall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, I laughed at his art; and told him I was sure the person was alive whom I sought for. My art (said the Mirabou) deceives me not, and however assures me, that personage is inclos'd in a Tombe; and for confirmation of that verity, Know with young man (too faire to be happy) that this face so full of allurements shall quickly finde greater then its owne: there are Sorceresses in this city, that trouble not themselves as those of old did, with drawing the Moone downe from her Spheare, in spoiling with haile their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies harvests, nor to change the course of Rivers; their imployments are farre more mortall and sad towards such whom nature hath endow'd with any lovelinesse and beautie. Those they binde in unperceiveable chaines, and by their sorcerie, depriving them of all understanding, sell them to rich voluptuous women, who finde no pleasure truly high, if they change them not every day. Looke to thy selfe young man, this misfortune threatens thee; it hangs over thy head; 'tis done; thou art lost. I went (with that) out of Amatonis hermitage in such a choler, that I scarce had any feeling of my miseries; and had not gone a hundred paces into the Town, when a women, covered with a great vaile, and holding a long Chaplet after the Turkish manner, staid me by my arme. What (my sonne, said she) 'twas sure your ill Angell that led you to the Cell of the abominable Amatonis. Bethinke your selfe well (said she) affrightedly; Doe you know what you are? Doe not you take your selfe for some Tiger or Lion, or other such beast? For 'tis the custome of that wretch to trouble the mindes of all that consult with him: I confesse, I was so weak as to stop at the words of that old Phantasm, but finding no alteration in my selfe: Mother, (said I) the man you speake of, is not so good a friend as to deprive me of all reason and knowledge: but on the contrary, hath (for all my life time) made me miserable in conserving it to me, and rob'd me of that little hope which kept me alive. He hath taken nothing from you, but he may be glad to restore it, repli'd the old woman: Beleeve me (my sonne) his predictions are all false, and many times already he hath for his impostures given satisfaction under the cudgell of the hangman to the indignation of the most eminent in this Towne. Ah, Mother, said I, if you would bring me to some one that could tell me newes of the good which I have lost, I promise to make you forget the incommodities of your old age. My sonne (quoth the Sorceresse) 'tis my custome to doe good to every body, and receive no requitall. Come along and assure your selfe how extraordinary soever your affliction be, I will finde a remedy for it. My griefe and passion which made me more senslesse then I have been fince, through that old womans inchantments, wonne me to follow her, to the end I might learne the scituation of that Island where the Ghost of Histeria had shewed me Melicerta. I should be too tedious, if I related to you the richnesse of the house, whereinto the Witch brought me: without it seemed a little one, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were stately roomes and lodgings, with furniture of silke and gold, and a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wherein many fountaines mingled their sweet murmurs with the perfumes of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range trees and Jessemines. Assoone as I was in this delightfull lodging, Thou art wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, childe of my heart, said the old Sorceresse; and being thus entertain'd, she led me into a Closet which was all hung with the pictures of the fairest Ladies in Africa. Mother (said I) if that pity which you lately shewed me was not fained, and if ever ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miseries have sensibly touched you, doe your utmost indeavour to give some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the most unfortunate of all men. I extreamly love a Lady, as great by birth as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable in beauty, and my miserie is such, that I know not to what part of the world she hath betaken her selfe: She is in no lesse care for thee my sonne, (repli'd the Witch) then thou art for her; cheere up then, and assure thy selfe, that ere long you shall both receive the contentment you seeke after. This discourse was a wonder to me, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, since we easily beleeve what we wish, I imagin'd this woman would not have promis'd me a thing so assuredly, if it had not beene in her power. I intreated her to let me see assoone as she could the effect of her promises. How (said she) what? dost thou not see it? I with that turned my head, and saw at the closet dore a young Lady
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54727:231"/>
very lovely and richly clad, whom I thought to have othertimes seen; but I knew it was not Melicerta, and as I would have found fault with the Witch for deceiving me, that Lady cast her selfe about my necke, and moistning me with her teares, Is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (deare Solyman) said she, that thy insensibilitie should continue still? Doest thou not repent thee of the griefes thou hast made me suffer by thy neglect and flight? It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a yeare that I have sought thee, and neither the thought of my birth, the feare of dangers, nor the duty I owe my father, have been able to detaine me. I have crossed all the Mediterranean, got into the Ocean, and finally not knowing where to finde thee, retir'd to this Towne: For these eight dayes I have enquired diligently after thee, I have imployed all the Sooth sayers and Magicians, to learne what place hid thee from my inquiry, but none could satisfie my passion. This aged woman onely mov'd with my affliction kept me in hope of seeing thee againe; and as one day (to please me) she shewed me thy amiable face in her inchanted glasse, on an instant she snatch'd away that powerfull crystall, and cri'd to me, runne; for at this very time Solyman passeth by the windowes of your chamber. My love making me forget what was seemly, made me run not onely to the window, but into the street to imbrace thee; thou vanishedst from mine eyes, and for all that I could doe from that day hitherto, it hath been out of my power of seeing thee againe: This faithfull companion of my miseries seeing how extreame they were, was willing to mitigate them by her art; and going forth hence this morning, Daughter (said she) give over your teares, and put on againe your former blithenesse; this day thou shalt fee thy insensible faire one; I gave credit to her words, and see they were not frivolous. I hold thee now my deare Solyman, and protest that nothing but death shall separate me from thee. The kindnesses and talke of that Lady had so disturb'd the little sense was left me, that all I could doe was to looke on her with mine eyes, all threatning and full of anger. Shee on the contrary cast her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous glances on me, and beseeching for some pity on her afflictions; Alas (said she) is it possible that the unfortunate Ennoramita must eternally intreate and never be heard? At that name, I remembred that she who spake to me was the same daughter to the King of Tunis, whose young errours I have related to you, and found my selfe extreamly pusled; yet faining not to be so; Rather (said I) Ennoramita is it possible, that so great a Princesse as your selfe, should so abandon the place of her birth, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on the trade of a vagabond and lost one, have so little care of her reputation? Let some other then thee (cruell Solyman, repli'd she) upbraid me for that fault: For thine owne part, thou shouldst like it, and canst not with justice deny it a recompence; I confesse, the anger of seeing my intentions cross'd by this fatall meeting, carried me beyond what was fitting; I laid on her a thousand more imputations; I condemn'd her furie and blindnesse, and having often threatned the old Witch, I strove to get my selfe out of the hands of these two enraged creatures. Deare Solyman (said Ennoramita) forsake me not in the estate I am; I have not much longer to live, since thou canst not indure that I should love thee: stay but a little and thou shalt see thy selfe freed from this miserable wretch. The old woman, who as I have heard since, had been the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse nurse, and had made her undertake her voyages with an assurance of finding me; had rather see me perish then not content Ennoramita's passion. I cannot tell you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were by words, by soft feelings, or other witch-craft; but in the very instant that I went out of the closet into the chamber by which I came; I felt my selfe strucken as with the stab of a ponyard, and losing all knowledge, fell in a swoune on the floore. I cannot tell you what Ennoramita and the Sorceresse did during my trance; but when I came to my selfe, I found me in a bed, without any memory of what had passed. I forgot Melicerta, I remembred not my voyage, I had cast mine owne selfe so farre in oblivion, that there remained no more knowledge of it in me, but that me thought I was not the same I had beene. Notwithstanding, Ennoramita' charme had a successe farre differing from that which Dircé (so was her Nurse call'd) had promis'd her. In stead of loving and sighing for her, me thought I saw (when she appear'd) something most horrible; and often times taking her in my visions for the bloudy and mournefull Ghost of Histeria as I had seen her; Alas! (cri'd I) follow me no more! I confesse fair Princesse I am guilty of death; I have stroke that ponyard into thy breast, but be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:54727:232"/>
by my ruine, and expose me no longer to these cruell serpents which continually burne me, but kill me not. Ennoramita grew almost desperate to see how I was, and wish'd every day that her Nurse could breake the charme she had given me: but being lesse able to suppresse the ill then to cause it, she advis'd the Princesse to carry me to Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis in a maydens habit; to which Ennoramita consenting, and making preparation for all things needfull to the voyage, departed, assoone as she saw a little diminution of my frenzy. By her returne, she restor'd to the King her father, the life she had almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd him of by her flight. That Prince, who without doubt had by his example con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to his daughters follies, treated her as his companion, rather then as if he had been her father. He was pacified in keeping her more carefully then before times, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert her immodest affections resolv'd to visit her every day after dinner. For my selfe, who passed from my former frenzy into so deep a melancholy, that I did nothing but sigh and weep, and made Ennoramita's life so irksome, that she had infallibly slaine her selfe if the Nurse had not at all times assur'd her, that as my frenzy was turn'd into a melancholy, so that melancholy waxing away by little, I would become such a man as she had alwayes wish'd me. In the meane time, the King of Tunis casting his eyes on me, took me for what I was not, and would needs know of his daughter where I was bought: she fitted him a leafing, and said, That seeing me at Argiers in the market where they sold slaves, my comelinesse gave her a minde to buy me; and were it not for the griefe which disquiets her, she were the most pleasing creature in the world. Alas! what ailes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> she (ask'd the King her father?) 'Tis a strange griefe repli'd Ennoramita: she hath so passionately loved a Canarian, that losing him by a tragicall accident, she hath never since given over her fighes and lamentations. This melancholy, in lieu of lesning by time, still encreaseth; and from time to time so disquiets the poore mayden, that none without pity can see her actions or heare her complaints. Heare I beseech you a strange example of our fantastik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; That King who was no more master of his wits then Ennoramita, had seene me divers times, and though he thought me a maiden, and beleev'd me faire, yet had he not intimated any affectation toward me: but no sooner had he heard the tale his daughter invented, but he tooke a particular pleasure to entertaine me, and imploy'd all his best Rhetoricke in the Essaying to sweeten my sorrowes. He spoke to me of my pretended lover, held his condition happy, since it made him receive so great proofes of my love; and protested to me he would not complaine of his fortune, if by his death he could bring me to the like resentment. To this I answered with fighes and teares, and that franticke Prince found lovelinesse in my melancholy: he pleas'd himselfe in it, and stirr'd not from me; at last he was constrain'd to let his passion breake forth, and to satisfie it, to take his Rivall (I would say his daughter) for his confident. Imagine whether I were not happy in having but one part of my reason at that time; and what a redoubling of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it had been to me, if being perpetually to oppose the folly of the father and the love of the daughter; I had besides been afflicted with the remembrance of Melicerta. Enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramita's Nurse labour'd on one side to annihilate her former charme by a second, but not being able to doe it without putting me to extreame violences, she so altered the body to comfort the spirit, that I fell ill of a sickness which all the Physicians of Tunis at first held incurable. After a continuall feaver of forty dayes, and a weakning of all parts of my body, so generall, that there was nothing left me but my sight, I beganne to feele some small ease; I then began fully to know my selfe, and ask'd (alone) where I was; since when and how I fell sicke, and why I had given over the quest of Melicerta. By little and little my memory came againe, and though it shew'd me, one after another, the Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a's of such things as had betided me before I fell into the hands of Ennoramita, yet could it not make me call to minde what had befalne me since: As I troubled to know the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quele of my adventures, Ennoramita came to see me, and commanded all those that were in my chamber to with-draw. When she was alone, she fell on her knees, and taking my right hand which was out of the bed, By this hand which I kisse, said she, and by this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission wherewithall I implore thy goodnesse, deare Solyman, pardon me those faults which the excesse of my love have made me commit against thee. I confesse I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thy love, since I would have purchas'd it by other charmes then those of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perseveranee: but if I have judges a little more pitifull then thy selfe, I shall finde
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54727:232"/>
mercy. For tell me lovely Soiyman, what faults are pardonable, if that of too much love deserves to be punished? The Princesses speech did renew in my memory, but confusedly, some particularities of my sicknesse, and that reiterating the desire I had to know all: Faire Princesse (said I) the unfortunate Solyman knows too wel theeffects of love, to condemn as criminal the actions to which he enforceth us. Al that his absolute power make us undertake is just, and if some one think otherwise, he knows not what love is. After this, fear not faire Princesse to declare what you have done to me; &amp; know that we never understand better how violent a passion is, but when it puts on such as it possesseth to actions extreamely violent. May I beleeve, replied Ennoramita, that 'tis from thy selfe, and not the vertue of some new charme, which gives thee so favourable thoughts, and makes thee so pitifull? If it be so, let Fate doe its worst, I will never thinke my estate unhappy. Ennoramita, having put on this resolution, related to me all that I have told you, and the meanes she made use of, to try the overcomming my insensibility. Afterwards she acquainted me with the causes of my last sicknesse, and suddainely casting her selfe on me; Deare Solyman (said she) I say not, if thou love me, but if thou hast pity on a Princesse who is even mad for thy love hinder me (since 'tis in thy power) from losing mine honour with my life. Thou hast both in thy hands. Deale with them as a man truly generous, and strive to constraine thy selfe a little, that the King my father may not discover how I have beguil'd him. I aske thee nothing, but that thou faigne thy selfe to be a maiden, and induring the love he beares thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be so noble as to draw me out of a labyrinth whose intricacies thou onely canst winde through.</p>
                  <p>Instead of answering the Princesse, I began to reflect on her miseries and mine owne; and exclaiming against heaven; Justice eternall (said I) which raignest over us, why intendest thou to inflict such strange punishments on poore miserable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are but the play-toyes of our passions, and the examples of a deplorable weakenesse? And thou unfortunate Princesse, (then I addressed my selfe to Ennora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mita) what pretend'st thou by thy obstinate affection? Thou lovest a wretch that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love thee. I must needs confesse it, I love as well as thee, and my love as well as thine, is accompanied with so cruell a destiny that it cannot attaine to what it aspires. Thou follow'st me, and I follow another. I flye from thee, and by another am as fast fled from. Thou intreatest I would have pity on thee, I grant it, provided thou be not unpitifull to me. Let's do the like one for another; and since our diseases are equally dangerous, let us run both to the same remedy. 'Tis fit I should conforme my selfe to your opinion (replied Ennoramita) but 'tis impossible for me. I wish thy peace, and yet I cannot chuse but disturbe it. Yet I am not desperate of being able to please thee, but thou must give me a great deale of time to performe a matter of that difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Grant me that which I request thee, and I will yeeld to what you desire. This last word so seis'd on the Princesses heart, that she was neere suffocated in pronouncing it. The teares fell abundantly from her eyes, and her sighes impetuously driving out one another, resembled the impetuous course of a torrent which had overflowed the damme that oppos'd it. No sooner was she a little resettled, but the King her father came into my chamber, and accosting me with a countenance that witnessed how deare my life was to him: Now (said he) I perceive my prayers have beene heard, and heaven hath granted to my Sacrifices the recovery of faire Philomela, ('twas under that name En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramita made me passe for a maid.) And truly (said he) it had beene too rigorous, had it condemned to a precipitated death, or to a perpetuall languishment, a beauty, which for its owne glory, merits not onely to live long on earth, but to be there perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually happy. Sir (replied I) if ought could give me comfort in my sad fortune, I had met it in the entertainement I receive from your Majesty and the Princesse your daughter. But alas! the misery I am falne in is so great, that not onely it can have no end, but it even deprives me of the capacity of being comforted. Melicerta is dead, and by consequence there is no more happinesse left for me in the world. The deare name of Melicerta renewing within me the sense of those miseries whereunto I had exposed her, drew such abundance of teares from mine eyes, that Muley Hassen could not doubt the truth of my losse. He thought it fit, (seeing me so sensible of my misfortune) not to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:54727:233"/>
discover any griefe of his owne. He therefore contented himselfe in making appeare to me by reasons and examples, that 'twas a thing unheard of among men to love that which had no existence. But (he added) I hope, the same hand which hath redeemed you from the grave, will free you from these mournfull and funerall cogitations which are so fatall to your repose. Many other words he us'd which I will not repeate, and 'twas very late ere he went from me. As long as my extreame weaknesse forced me keep my bed, all the day and part of the night I had with me either the father or the daughter; assoone as the one left me, the other tooke the place, and both of them spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to me of their affection, in lieu of afflicting (as you may imagine) they comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me; since they represented to me mine owne. I utter'd boldly before them both, the deare name of Melicerta: I besought her to heare my laments, to thinke how my constancie was assaulted, and to give it the vertue of continuing victorious. When I spoke thus before Ennoramita, Shall I (said she) make my prayers contrary to thine, or implore heaven not to heare thee? In one same instant my affection commands and forbids it, it would have me love thee owne for mine sake, and by the same reason wish the losse of Melicerta: on the other side, it would have me love thee for thy sake, and by consequence pray for Melicerta's safetie. Thus that happie enamour'd Lady is not onely beloved by him she affecteth, but is affected by what she persecuteth: Againe, Solyman in this contestation meets both with his content and glory; he satisfies his passion in resisting what opposeth it, and by the power of her allurements, makes Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerta triumph on her Rivall. Thou art alone, ô infortunate Ennoramita, the person on whom Heaven powres all its choler, and Love hath chosen as a victime which must be sacrific'd for the happinesse of Solyman and Melicerta. The Princesses passion still furnish'd her with so many new thoughts, that I had need of a wonderfull memorie to retaine them: The King her father produc'd no lesse, and seeing in the declining of my sicknesse, that my mirthsomnesse came againe with my strength, he thought Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerta began to be worne out of my memorie. That opinion gave him the boldnesse to discover his love to me, and intimating that he would not treate me as other beauties which he kept shut up for his pleasure; he at first promis'd me the Crowne of Tunis. Your vertue (said he) and beautie which are both extraordinary, exempt you from the Law of indifferent personages. I will suspend the customes of the Kings my Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, to teach all Barbary, that a merit without comparison, may worke something without example. Philomela shall be plac'd in the Throne, without feare of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or Rivall; and if her vertue cannot indure in my Palace, any subjects of impuritie, from this houre I breake open the doores of my Seraglio, and give both libertie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to so many faire slaves as the chance of warre hath given me. To all these faire promises I continually oppos'd my inabilitie of accepting them, and the losse of Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa. 'Twas a great deale worse when I had absolutely recovered my health, and that the beautie (which I will beleeve I had for feare of disobliging Cydaria) taking new vigour, shone in the eyes of Muley Hassen (as he told me) like the Sunne when after his leaving the Tropicke of Capricorne, he ascends towards that of Cancer. But leave we at last these extravagancies of love, and (since 'tis the will of Fate) end this Comedie by a tragicall Catastrophe. Muley Hassen and Ennoramita, meditated on nothing but how to become masters of a place which they had so long and vainly assaulted; when they themselves were set on by the Garrison of Argiers, who had correspondencie with some inhabitants of Tunis: The Towne was instantly wonne, and the Palace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, before Muley could resolve whether he should defend himselfe or flie; the Turkes (who knew his cowardise) urg'd him to yeeld, and after two daies battering wonne it by force. See what love can doe? Muley, fearing more my losse then his owne, no sooner saw the Turkes enter the Court of his Palace, but he ran to my chamber, and staying at the dore with his sword and buckler, made them see, that he who wanted a courage to defend his Crowne and life, had an extraordinarie one to maintaine his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and protect his pretended Mistresse. The most resolute Turkes gave ground before the blowes of that Prince, and seeing their obstinacie to contest with him, did but serve to ruine them, they talk'd to him of his safetie, and that he should not hazard with his owne person, his daughter, and people. Ah traitours cri'd the Prince, you have not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54727:233"/>
your faith, and forc'd my City, with an intent to have a care either of me or mine; No, I will die like a King, and not doe as those infamous Princes, who to prolong an unfortunate life, cowardly present their neck and arms to the fetters of your Tyrant. With that he flew among the Turkes, and though they had command not to kill him, yet the necessity of defending themselves, made them neglect that order. Assoone as I saw him fall at the feet of his enemies, I was touched with an extreame shame for counterfeiting so long the maids part. In a rage I flung out of Ennoramita's armes, who besought me, not to hazard my selfe, and seising on a Cymitar and Target which were falne from a dying Turke, I flew on those that were entred my chamber: some of them I slew, and drove out the rest; I thinke verily that the respect to my sexe, bridled the Turkes fury; for exposing my selfe as I did to their arrowes and swords, it had been very easie for them to have given me my pasport with Muley Hassen. Ennoramita, seeing me in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, forgot what she was, and the feare of my losse causing a neglect of her preservation; she ran after me, and as my buckler boldly defi'd death which inviron'd her on all sides. One while the Turkes in respect to of her, retaining their fury, she fell on her knees, and imploring their pity; Take my Crowne (said she) and leave me this companion of my miseries; but as she would have gone on with her petition, an arrow, shot at randome stroke through her tongue, and passing on, so dangerously hurt her, that she fell downe halfe dead: presently she cast her eyes upon me, and calling me with a weake and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full voice, Deare Solyman (said she) what a favourable shot was this, since in depriving me of my life, it hath taken away my feare of losing thee? As she ended these words, the bloud choaked her, and I (who thought I could not live without shame, did I not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renge the death of the father and the daughter) so provoked those which would have spar'd me, that they lost all respect, and left me for dead between Muley and Ennoramita. The Basha Aladin who commanded the forces of Argier, hearing that one onely Lady resisted a great many Turkes, sent word, they should beware of wronging me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after came to see me; but he found me among the dead, and witnessing he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame angry at it, would have had all those Souldiers undergoe the edge of the sword, whom he thought authors of my death. He drew neere, to see whether I were absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead, and perceiving in me some remainder of life, commanded his guard to take me up, and brought me into the chamber of the too generous Ennoramita. His extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care of me sav'd my life, and the warinesse wherewithall I conceal'd what I was, thriv'd so happily, that I was alwayes taken for a woman and so look'd after. The Turkes being absolute masters of the Towne, and not weeting from whence any force could come strong enough to trouble them in their conquest, gave themselves over to all kinde of liberty. But when they thought least on it, they were set on by a Cozen to the late King (called as himselfe) Muley Hassen, and whom the jealousies of State had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished into Mezila, which is on the confines of the Numidian deserts. That Prince understanding the devastation of his countrey, got together a great many Arabians, which usually frequented that Towne, and assembling all the souldier-like of Distef, of Necan, of Thefas, and of Thebessa, fell, unlooked for, into the City of Tunis, cut part of the Turkes in pieces, and compell'd the rest to retire shamefully to Argiers. Thither was I convay'd by the Basha's Eunuches, and so carefully garded, that when I strove to escape, I found all meanes depriv'd me, and all wayes shut up: but love who had brought me to this precipice found a way to draw me out againe. A little while after Aladin's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to Argier, the same Abdelmelec whom Almanzor lately slew, came thither with a glorious traine, and having treated about divers things with the Basha, acquir'd his love so farre as to live with him like a brother. The Basha desirous to give him an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary testimoniall of it, brought him one night into my chamber, and having given him time enough to looke on me; Her valour (said he) is no lesse rare then her beauty. Abdelmelec presently knew me, not for Iphidamantus, but for Cydaria; I knew him too, and instantly plotted to make use it; neverthelesse I feign'd as I had never seen him, and he did the like by me: We had besides liv'd long enough among the Turkes, to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how suspicious they were, and how jealous of what they lov'd. Abdelmelec af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had dispatch'd all with the Basha, return'd to Morocco, and Aladin being call'd backe to Constantinople, made ready for a voyage that must cost him his life. The very

day Abdelmelec was to goe thence, a Blacke-Moore woman, who went for a foole in the Basha's house, coming (as she was wont to doe) into my chamber for my diversion, as she danc'd about, let fall at my feet a Cane which she held in her hand. By the signe she made to me, I presently understood by her letting it fall, there was somewhat in it; I therefore tooke it up, and keeping it in my hand till I was in bed, I broke it, (when my women were with-drawne) and found a paper with these words:
<q>If the faire Ennoramita preferre not the inglorious servitude wherein she lives, before the honours which are assur'd her in Morocco, she will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute somewhat to the enterprise now in hand for her deliverance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ravisht with this advertisement, I spent the whole night waking, and did nothing but invent meanes to make good use of the occasion was offer'd me; I found no way better then to leave my selfe to be guided by those that labour'd for my liberty. Assoone therefore as it was day, I made this answer to the note I received:
<q>To beleeve that a Captive delights in his irons, and refuseth an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberty, is to suspect him of folly or stupidity: Who ere ye be chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table friends to the distressed, goe on in your designe, and expect from me all the assistance I owe my selfe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Ticket I put into one piece of the broken Cane, and when the Black-moore came againe, I threw it at her head: she tooke up both the pieces, and after she had sufficiently rail'd at me, went away. In almost eight dayes I heard no more newes of my foole, nor knew any thing of those which had promis'd to assist me: In the meane time the Basha gave order for his voyage, and so hastned all things, that he was ready to be gone fifteene dayes sooner then was thought on. The day of his departure being come, I leave you to imagine to what passe I was brought, I saw the furniture taken out of my chamber; I noted my being watch'd by almost twenty Eunuches, and seven or eight old women that seldome forsooke me; I perceiv'd my selfe ready to be ship'd and carried to Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople. In this extremity, my resolution was (if all other help failed) to throw my selfe headlong into the sea. On the instant, some ill newes the Basha received from his friends at the Port, so astonished him, that he forgot his accustomed care of his Mistresse; and 'twas well seen by his perplexity and disquiet that the Divan made ready a strange wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for him. Every one imbark'd in a hurry; they brought me to the haven, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had I one foot in the skiffe that was to carry me to our gally, when some twenty or thirty men coming out of a backe creeke, with their Cymiters in their hands fell on the weake and fearfull troupe that were with me. They quickly dispersed my Eunuches and women, and having taken me, conveyed me into a Galliot, which lay close within the creeke. Presently the alarme was given on shore, and in the Basha's ship; every one cryed that Ennoramita was taken away, but their cryes were in vaine, for the little Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley wherein I was, sailing with an incomparable swiftnesse, quickly got out of sight of Aladin's ship, and the coast of Argier. I thought on nothing lesse then on my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, when she came and fell on my neck: she asked me whether those of her countrey had any wit, and whether she had not been cunning enough. I repli'd, her service deserv'd a good reward, and that, I did promise, with her liberty, so soone as I could get free my self. She answered me, that she had already in part received what I promised, and then falling to play with finger-knackers, and doing a many more fooleries, she put me off from thinking on matters of more consequence. My Galliot sailed into the straight, and yet I could not learne into whose hands I was falne; but entring the maine Ocean, I descried two ships which made up to ours. At a signe was given our Mariners by a cannon shot, they gave over rowing, and when the greatest was clos'd with us, they cast out a ladder to have me come aboard: I was received by Abdelmelec himselfe, who in his owne name and his fathers, made me such a welcome, and used me with such entertainment, that Cydaria is very unthankfull if she doe not one day acknowledge it. Cydaria, unwilling her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers jeasting should goe unanswered, You should (said she) have told Bajazet of it, for
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54727:234"/>
(may be) he would then have done so much for my sake and your good friend Abdelme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec, that he should not have laine in so ill case as he now is; but be not you so incivill as not to render that Prince the ceremonies he did you. Iphidamantus going on againe: If (said he) I was well entertain'd by the sonne, I was not lesse but better by the father: Assooneas I landed, he came to welcome me with a preparation which might be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a little triumph. The name of Ennoramita resounded every where, the flutes, the cymbals, and all other instruments of musicke used by the Africans, invited every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dances and other rejoycings. At first, I was (according to the custome of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey) brought into those stately bathes which I have described to you, and put into the hands of some of those women which had before served me. From the bathes, I went into that famous closet, which was as a Temple consecrated to the Portraict of Cydaria. To the Portraict of Cydaria? said Almanzor, red either with jealousie or choler. How! by what meanes came Hely by it? By a way which I will tell you at more leasure replied Cydaria: He shall restore it (said Bajazet) or it shall cost him his life and the ruine of Morocco. All the company not disallowing this amorous agitation, Iphidamantus proceeded thus; Being then in that chamber all inlightned with gold and jewels, Hely, who had put on the habit of a young man, and painted himselfe to regaine what age had rob'd him of, came to see me, and us'd the same language he had done, the first time he mistooke me for Cydaria. In finishing his speech, he turned towards the Princesses picture, and pointing to it, See (said he) what hath preserved my life during your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; when my griefe hath spent my spirits, and orecome my resolution, I had recourse to this faire picture, to refresh both the one and the other: I there found wherewithall to resist my longings, to keep my desires in vigour, and even wherewith to passe over your contempt and aversion. Heaven which knowes the innocency of my affection, after its triall by so many crosses, hath at last resolv'd to recompence it; give your consent to so just a decree, and disarming those eyes of their usuall disdaine, which never appeared milde to me but for my ruine, requite at least by some favourable aspect the long torments your beauty hath made me undergoe. The goodnesse of that Prince (which indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd an acknowledgement) made me resolve to disdeceive him; I therefore besought him to give more credit to my words, then he had before-time, and to suspend a while that passion which had twice almost cost him his life, that he might so the better consult with reason, and no more contradict a knowne truth. He smil'd, and shooke his head when he heard me say so: I am very sorry (said I) that my misfortune in bringing me hither, makes you call to minde againe, a person, that doth but perpetuate your afflictions; could I have found any other way that might have freed me from mine enemies, how irksome soever, I would have attempted it rather then have had recourse to your assistance: Not, but that I am glad to be obliged to so great a Prince as your selfe, but owing you so much already, my conscience upbraides me every moment, that my resolution to cast my selfe againe into your hands, was the most ingratefull part could be acted. The reason is very forcible, I knew (it told me) your errour, and to bring into his sight againe, that fatall face which disturbs the peace of your age, was wittingly to continue you in it: but since it hath not been in my power to divert this inconvenience, I will stop the progresse of the mischiefe it workes, and freely tell you, I am the brother of that Ennoramita who is onely faire for your affliction. Ah (replied Hely) if you love me, I beseech you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble no more, for it will not worke the successe you hope by it. 'Tis not much lesse then a yeare, since you thought by such a device to cure me of my passion. But dear En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramita what got you by that cunning? Nothing but the augmenting my torments and almost the ending my dayes. If in lieu of humbly intreating you as I doe to be somewhat favourable unto me, it were permitted to make you some few upbraidings; in your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science should I have not have just cause to blame you for your flight? and being your owne judge, may I not accuse you, for putting your life and honour in hazard, rather then to indure the company of a Prince who hath had no other designe then to bestow both himselfe and his Crowne on you? Reflect (if you please) on all the misfortunes which seconded your flight; thinke on the dangers you have run, the slavery whereinto you have falne, and if your life be not considerable, thinke at least into what hazard you have engaged your honour: after that, (what mislike soever you have towards me) you
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54727:235"/>
will be inforced to confesse that it had been farre more easie to beare with the afflictions of poore Hely. I see well (said I) there needs somewhat else then words to free you from those errours you have no minde to leave, exact from me therefore all that you can imagine most prevalent to give you an absolute manifestation of so important a truth; and at last plucke off the cause of your voluntary blindnesse. Hely lov'd so modestly and so respectfully, that fearing to offend me, he with-drew, and in going out of my chamber, told me, he rather desired to be miserable all his life, then once to contradict me: two or three dayes he left me in quiet, and though all his happinesse consisted in my fight, yet had he rather lose that contentment, then to run the fortune of displeasing me. At three dayes end, (whether he would or no) he returned to his former solicitations, but assoon as I spake of freeing him from his error, he flung away, and saw me not, or if he did, 'twas by some secret chinkes or holes which he had made in the walls of my chamber. In that manner did I live neere three moneths, and indeavoured to winne some one of the slaves which waited on me, to get me the apparell of a man, and some armes, and by his means free me from the hands of the senslesse old King. The Negro woman that came along with me, seemed to be fit for that purpose, but Hely had too much pleas'd her, for fearing the like turne she had plaid the Basha Aladin: I had no sooner then spoke to her of my escape, but she rudely chid me for it; and assuredly by her advertising the King of Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, I was more strictly garded then before A few dayes after this milde detention, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that all the Court was in an uprore, and that a great many sail of ships were disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at the mouth of the River of Tensif: This allarme increasing by the arrivall of some Embassadours, Hely came to me one evening, and delivering me a paper; Read this (said he) and afterward (if you can) perswade me that you are not Ennoramita. I tooke the long Scroll, and if my memory deceive me not, there was written in it, thus:</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>BAJAZET</hi> Generall of the Pirates, to <hi>HELY</hi> King of Morocco.</head>
                  <p>HAd I not farre more regard to what I owe my selfe, then I have in considering those violences wherewithall the unrulinesse of thy passions dishonours the later yeares of thy life, I would not solicite thee (as I doe) by Embassadours; but instantly imploy the justice of my armes to compell thee, by a severe chastisement to a repentance of thy crimes. Thou shouldst blush Hely, to have in thine old age those raging agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are not allowed to young men, but that nature permits them not to be wiser; not that I declare my selfe against love, or by an indiscretion too common, blame that in another, which I thinke honourable in my selfe: I disallow such vices, which to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, insolently put on the face of vertue: I utterly condemne all impurity, and I abhorre all disordinate affections and violences. In a word, I detest that madnesse by whose intemperance thou treatest like a slave a Princesse, that can raise in armes all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and Africa, for the subversion of thy tyranny. For mine owne part, who am the meanest of those which have dedicated their armes and lives to her service, I here protest to avenge her oppressed innocencie, if my Embassadours have not perswasion sufficient to prevent thine owne destruction, and give liberty to so many Princes as are fetter'd in the same irons wherein the faire Ennoramita is enthralled.</p>
                  <p>After I had read this Declaration of Bajazet, I cast mine eyes on Hely, and thinking to give him such counsell as he would not neglect; It shall not cost much (said I) the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting those disasters which threaten you, send me to Bajazet, it may be his affection will make him as cleere sighted as your selfe, and winne him to beleeve he hath found what he sought, when I am once in his hands. Rather cri'd Hely, let our great Mahomet perish from the memorie of the living, let me rather see mine Empire desolate, and the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hely crushed under the ruines of his Palace! With that he left me, and his naturall quicknesse rekindling I know not what remainder of fire in his frozen veines, he call'd for his armes, and denying to heare Bajazet's Embassadours any further, gave command
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54727:235"/>
they should presently depart from Morocco. Those Rovers accustomed to cast forth their andacious threatnings, storm'd &amp; thundred even within Morocco against her own King; and one of them throwing downe his Cymetar in the market place, I vow (said he to those that were about him) never to weare any againe, till I see my selfe and my Companions Masters of this City. This threate affrighted part of the Spectators, and gave the bold Pirate a brave passage through the astonish'd people. Assoone as Bajazet understood how his Embassadors had beene treated, he call'd his Councell, and desirous more and more to engage the Pirates in his designes, 'Tis no more (said hee) my sole interest that obliegeth you to besiege Morocco. 'Tis the honour of your former actions that calls you to its protection. The insolence of this barbarous King hath of a private quarrell made a publique injury. You are all wronged in the persons of your companions. Your honour, of which they were deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries in the qualities of your Embassadors, complaines of it by me, askes you Justice for Helie's impudency, and accounts you unworthy to live if instantly you run not to be avenged. The Pirates animated by so powerfull a speech, all at once swore the ruine of Morocco, and without delay came in a wonderfull order to land on both sides the towne. The Cavalry which was fallied would have opposed their landing, but the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers artillery thundring among the Squadrons, soone left the shoare free. If Bajazet could indure to heare his owne praises, I would tell you how valour and Judgement wholly possessing him, triumph'd both on the power and wiles of Hely. The very first day the City was block'd up, and in lesse then fifteene more, (contrary to the generall opinion) it was so inclos'd, that even the Arabians, which make their way any where, were not cunning enough to get in. I will not relate to you the many brave combats were had during the two first months siege. I will onely speake of what concernes my selfe. The City was hard laid to, and the most part of the Inhabitants wanting what was necessary to maintaine life, murmur'd against Hely's folly, and spoake aloud, that 'twas fit to drive from the towne that secret plague which would quickly wholly ruine them. For my part I besought Hely to bethinke himselfe, to stop the torrent of the publique calamities, and not to hazard his people, his Crown, and his life for an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy. To these remonstrances, he was as deafe as he had beene to others, and said, that if he had not taken armes for my defence, yet would he have done it, to correct a company of theeves, who for sport sake were come to offend him. When I saw I could do no good on the old man, I sent for Abdelmelec, and told him, I held my selfe guilty of his Countries ruine, and the losse of his father, if I conceal'd any longer from him a thing that might put an end to the warre. Know therefore (said I) that I am not Ennoramita or rather Cydaria. I am Iphidamantus her brother; and Nature hath made us so like, that in many places where fortune hath led us, we have beene taken one for another. What I say is so easie to be proved, that you may instantly cleere the doubt. Give me such a habit as I ought to weare, bring me armour and before night I will shew you my actions shall not be those of a maiden. When you shall be so farre assur'd, I will go to Bajazet, and obliege him by my armes, or intreaty to acknowledge his error, and not to doe an injustice out of a desire to resent an injury. Abdelmelec shew'd a great deale of judgement and courage in his answer. I beleeve (said he) that you are Iphidamantus rather then Ennoramita, and aske no other proofes of it then those you gave at Tunis. If the King my father thinke it fit, I am of opinion you should be set at liberty, but shall never consent to your going to the Generall of the Pirates for an end of the siege. We have beene too much wrong'd, to hearken to an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We have beene beaten, and are so daily; 'tis fit we should have our turne too on our enemies, and repell by force the insolence of these theeves. I speake not this to hinder you from prosecuting your inclination. If the Generall of the Pirates be your friend, I advise you to do that which friendship expects from you. I will engage my self to give you clothes, armes, and horses, and to conduct you safely into his Campe. But assoone as you shall be there, I will hold you as one of my enemies; and in such occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the warre shall offer us, I thinke we have no consideration of one another. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delmelec (said I) your generousnesse makes me go from my proposition. I will speake
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54727:236"/>
to you no more of peace or Bajazet; but expect for whom the chance of war will declare it self. For mine owne part, I sweare to you to thinke on no mans interest but yours, to vanquish or die with you; and betide what may, not to forsake you, till the death of one of us dispence with my promise. Assoone as I had made this Declaration, Abdelmelec imbraced me, and witnessing his resentment of my profers, I now (said he) beleeve indeed that you are a man, for your resolution cannot come but from a masculine heart. But keepe this businesse secret, that my fathers humourousnesse crosse it not: The next day Abdelmelec sent me clothes and armes, and both of us making use of the occasions offered by Hely's sudden sicknesse, wee made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sallies, in all which I went by the name of the unknowne Knight. I should be very vaine-glorious if I told you my presence rais'd againe the affaires of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco; but since you command mee to relate my adventures, I will not conceale my fighting so happily in divers conflicts, that Bajazet was constrained to recall the troupes hee had lodg'd on the side of Fez, and towards mount Atlas, as well to hinder any succour from the Moores, as to oppose the incursions of the Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Wee seldome sallied but wee brought in prisoners or much incommodated Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet's Campe. When a companie is reduced to the like extremitie as those of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco were, there needs no such wonders to be done for the getting a reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. By this meanes, the unknowne Knight made himselfe so famous in so short a time, that his name came to the eares of the ficke King. He would needs see mee, and Abdelmelec must bring me to him, even with the hazard of being no more unknowne. But sicknesse had so altered the good old Kings senses, that he neither knew me by word or countenance. Many times hee imbraced me, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mee the tutelar Angell of Morocco, sent at need by his great Prophet, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the taking into my protection the safety of his people; and to expect from Abdelmelec those acknowledgements which death might perchance hinder him from rendring mee. I gave him many thankes for his profers and well-wishes, and told him, I hop'd his age would not alwayes be crossed, but that Heaven reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for him a peacefull and contented issue out of all his troubles: in the meane time I advised Abdelmelec to send to Fez for succour. But Granada's desolation, and the mortalitie or exile of that Kingdomes Subjects (before-time so flourishing) had so abated all the Moores courages, that they were farre more miserable in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica then they had beene in Spaine. Their misfortune was still in their sight; they thought continually Ferdinand and Isabell were imbarking for Africa, and that great name of Cardinall of Spaine was a perpetuall cause of astonishment and feare. They still privately sent us victualls, and in such plenty, that from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward the Citizens of Morocco beleeved Bajazet would be inforced to raise his Siege. Some little time after, one of our Spies, (ill informed, as most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are such kinde of people) gave notice, that Bajazet was re-inforced by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty succour, under the command of one of the prime Basha's belonging to the Grand-Signior. Thereupon Abdelmelec and my selfe resolved to make a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sally, to discover their new aide, and know whether it were compos'd of Turkes or Africans. There was not in all the Siege so brave a conflict as at that time; we were in fight from morning till night; Abdelmelec incountred Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet, and I (not knowing him) buckled with my benefactor Achomat. Night onely severed us, after the losse of more then two thousand men on both sides. At last, wearied with the Siege, and perceiving the succours from Fez failing us; we must render our selves to their mercy, I got Abdelmelec to a resolution of determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all by a Duell. Wee therefore sent our Defye to Bajazet and Achomat, which they accepted; and each party being agreed on the conditions, we waited with equall impatience for the day on which this great difference was to be decided. Two dayes since I sent an intelligent Spy into Bajazet's Campe, and commanded him not to returne till hee knew certainly who the Basha was with whom I was to change blowes: last night he came backe, and related, that being stolne into Achomats Tents, he had learnt who he was, and for what cause he was come to the Siege
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54727:236"/>
of Morocco: This newes so surpris'd me, that when Abdelmelec this morning came into my chamber, to conduct mee to the place appointed for our Combate, he found me still in my bed. He began to chide me for my sloath, and imbracing me with a great deale of love; Deare Iphidamantus (said hee) I have long time wished for this day: 'Twill tell mee what shall be my fortune, and one way or other, I promise to my selfe before night, I shall have no more to long for. Whilst hee talked thus, I got ready, and arm'd me; not for my defence, but to oblige Achomat to take his revenge of mee, and to hide my designe from the Prince of Morocco. You know (without doubt) this daye's successe, and how farre happier it hath beene to mee then Abdelmelec; I will therefore trouble you no further. Thus Iphidamantus ended the relation of his strange and sad Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures.</p>

When I was left alone (for so I may say I was after the departure of Iphidamantus) there was nothing that hindered me from continually meditating on the losse of Cydaria: she had been constantly in my thought, but she was never so there, as she was then. I fell into such impatiencies as no consideration could moderate, and though I had put on a resolution to expect in quiet Hydaspes and Almaid's returne, yet was I tempted to abandon the Generall-ship of the Rovers, and put my selfe againe in quest of Cydaria. After three moneths absence, Hydaspes returning, he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that he had sail'd along all the coasts of Africa, landed in all the principall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Townes, searched all the Isles from the Cape of good Hope, even to Denmarke, and all in vaine. Imagine what griefe this generall ignorance of the world cast on me, and to what extraordinary meanes it made me run, to know at least whether Cydaria were alive or no: I confesse I refused none, and meeting (among our Pirates) with an Italian, which brag'd of his great familiarity with Spirits, I press'd him to consult with them for me, and to learne what I was to expect for the future: he promis'd to satisfie

I stood very earnestly heedfull, not to lose any one of the apparitions, and presently saw a sea covered with many ships, and a land-skip very little differing from that about Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco. In the midst of that Countrey description, I saw a City besieg'd both by land and sea: After many conflicts, I noted one, wherein a Knight having often changed his arms and cloathes, sometimes seem'd to me a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ttering somewhat which I understood not, presented to me a picture which I instantly knew to be the lively portraict of Cydaria. Whilst I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished with that object, a thicke cloud rob'd me of it, and presently I heard, or at least thought I heard some deafe sounds, and plaintive lamentations which bewailed the death of a father, a daughter, and a lover. Those complaints were no sooner ended, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers peales of thunder coming from a farre off, broke over the besieged City, and ore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed under its ruines the most of them that were within and without: in a moment, I saw the sheet cover'd with dead bodies, at which sight I was st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Whilst I sought for her amongst the dead, I saw her come from the sea side all sad and desolate, making signes to mee, to forsake so dismall a place: wherewithall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all those figures vanished, and I found my selfe so weary, and so little sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in my curiosity, that I went thence with a resolution, never to have any so ill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: Neverthelesse, not knowing what to conceive of such things as I had seene, I did some while neglect them; but by little and little feare making them passe for truths, melancholy made them more horrible then they were. I thought I should be suddenly besieg'd in mine Isle; and after my being kill'd in some Combate, my vanquisher would bring me to see Cydaria againe; I meane, that being dead, I should goe againe to meet with the shade of that faire Princesse: So blacke a fancy having long time roll'd up and downe my imagination, I held for certaine that Cydaria was dead, and that beliefe made such an alteration in my health, that by little and little; I lost the strength which I had recover'd after my last sicknesse, and I fell into a languishing, that made mee undergoe for three moneths together, more cruell deaths then death it selfe. I had no more left then my speech and my sight when Almaid arriv'd, and knowing well there was but one way to save me, he was no sooner come but he put it in triall: hee therefore related that he had seen Cydaria, and how the King of Morocco forcing her from Tunis, had brought her to his Court, but so guarded, that it might at once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They fail'd not of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; the next day was their Assembly call'd, and all things passing therein according to my wish, some were deputed to me to let me understand all their resolutions: two dayes after, I went into their quarters to thanke them, and perceiving their affection, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the generall musters to be the day following when all the Army was at the place destin'd for the like actions, I came out of the Fort with my Principall Officers, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a review of al the battalions, I stepped up into the place whence I was wont to speak to them: I made knowne to the Rovers my resentment of the last proofe of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and when I would have come to the point, and excited them to warre through the hope of booty, they shut my mouth with their acclamations and clapping of hands. Which done, they drew their swords, and holding them over their heads, began to cry out, that I should lead them whither I listed, that they had no other will then mine, and that they would alwayes value my content beyond their owne profit. I returned thence to the Fort so satisfied with their conformity, that the remainder of my melancholy and

Assoone as he had ended his pleasing narration, I promis'd him to returne to Senega, and casting my selfe at the feet of the King my father, to beseech his pardon for my extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant actions; but my duty and honour obliging me to put a period to Cydaria's teares, before I gave any beginning to mine owne quiet: I imbark'd two dayes after, and arriv'd at Morocco, so, as Iphidamantus hath related. Thus ended Bajazet, and presently Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim and Almanzaira retir'd into their ship; Cydaria and Melicerta abode in their own, in company of their Lovers: For Polexander and Achomat, they caus'd themselves to be wasted to shore, and mounting on horsebacke, came to the camp a little before day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breake. They enquired of what had pass'd in their absence, and understanding there was an extraordinary silence in the beleaguer'd City, imagined that Hely was fled thence, and the Citizens would no longer hold out. This opinion made them resolve for bed, to take that rest which their enemies gave them. They slept as long as their disquiets would give them leave, and awaking after many interrupted slumbers, went to Iphidamantus and Almanzor, who loath to trouble them, were walking before their tents: thence they went all foure, whither the Lawes of war call'd them, and having sent divers Cavaliers even to the gates of Morocco, and seeing no man come out to charge them, they were confirm'd in their opinion, that there was not any of defence left within the City. After they had made the round of the Entrenchments, and given fitting orders, they return'd towards the river, and went aboard Zabaim's ship. where they found Cydaria and Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa with Almanzaira, and forgetting all their warlike humour, made appeare by their civilities and discourse, that they were no lesse pleasant then invincible. Zabaim inquir'd of the state of the Siege, and understanding how 'twas, intreated those Princes to send and offer peace to the King of Morocco, and not tie him to conditions unworthy his birth and courage. Bajazet promis'd to send an Herald that very day, and to treate him as a King; in the meane time, their dinner being brought in, the Princes and Princesses set them at table, and after their repast, Achomat was intreated by the rest to recount the particulars of his life, which fame had divulg'd for something more then the ordinary life of men. The Basha blush'd at those prayses, and when he was resettled; If (said he) I durst dispence with your command, I would (surely during a time of victory and joy) keep me from intertaining you with a subject so mournfull and unfortunate as is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiny of Achomat: But since you desire by that recitall to moderate your contentment, for feare their excesse may be somewhat irksome, I will tell you, that I come from the most unfortunate linage that ever was adorn'd with the ornaments of Soveraignty. An unfortunate father begot a more unfortunate sonne, and that to be bewailed sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a father, to perpetuate the miseries of his house, gave life to two Princesses, which without a wonder could not be but most wretchedly unhappy. Achomat, by this preface, having prepar'd the mindes of his Auditors for things so infinitely tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, briefly related the same disasters which Melicerta had made knowne to Polexander and Cydaria, and after he had repeated the losse of his daughters and Iphidamantus flight, thus he proceeded: The victorious Emperour of the Levant, no sooner heard that Solyman had forsaken the Army, but he thought (like a second Castriot) he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted to the Christians, to avenge him of his long slavery, and the death of his father; thereupon he sent for me, to make knowne his resentment, and take on such resolutions as were answerable to the greatnesse of his indignation. I did what I was possible to moderate his fury, and retard the fearfull desolations wherewithall he threatned the Christians. No, no, (said he) since those dogs neither regard the mildnesse under which they live in mine Empire, nor the power I have to ruine them, they shall feele how fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full my corrections are: They have rob'd me of Solyman, as they did the great Monarch (to whom I owe my life) of the ingratefull and perfidious Scanderbeg: And they shall feele too, that mine arme is no lesse redoubtfull then great Amurath's. Let's doe more (my deare Achomat) and not be satisfi'd by the ruine of a part of the guilty, but on with fire and sword to the laying waste of all Christendome; and by an universall ruine, raise

our vengeance farre above the injurie we have received from them. After the Sultan had spoke thus, he commanded I should bestir me for the execution of his commands; I retir'd without replying, yet with an intent to mollifie his rage, and turne away from over the heads of so many Innocents the dreadfull thunder which threatned them: but fortune presently gave me cause to follow that Princes inclination, and (if I dare say it) to inspire him yet with farre more cruell ones. I was no sooner entred my tent, but Postes came and presented me letters from my deare and desolate Rozelana; by them I understood, how Histeria and Melicerta were stolne out of her Seraglio, and to follow Solyman whom they passionately lov'd (as a Jewesse informed her) had disguis'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the habits of men, and been ship'd away with the Proponticke troupes. Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the height of my sorrow, my shame and rage: I tore my haire, rent my clothes, and curs'd my birth: I even storm'd at Heaven, and thence ask'd reason for the rigour of it's judgement; as if my conscience had not incessantly upbraided me for my parricide, and the daily denying my ransomer in the Mosquo of his adversary. After I had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all manner of blasphemies and imprecations, I read againe the incomparable Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zelana's letter, and finding at the end, that she besought me to have pitie on her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to regaine them from the hands of their ravisher; Yes (said I) faire Princesse, thou shalt be obeyed; the traitor Solyman shall not glut his bestiall desires without just punishment; this very hand which deign'd to give him his first nourishment, shall not be afraid to force his dearest life from him. With this resolution I went to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and casting my selfe at his feet, Sir, (said I) I come to aske your Justice on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Solyman; he hath not onely violated in the person of your Majestie, but in those of the Princesses your Grand-children, those so holy and inviolable Lawes which command us to adore the bloud of the Ottomans: he hath rob'd me of Melicerta and Histeria, and that mercilesse snake which I have bred in mine owne bosome to kill me, more then once, hath stung me in all those parts where he thought his sting would be deadly. Justice askes from your thunder-darting-hand the punishment of this monster, but what said I? No my Lord, profane not your blowes in avenging me on that cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe; he hath questionlesse perpetrated this act, to make himselfe renowned by the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he expects from your royall hand: but command this unfortunate father to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise him, and give not that thiefe time to finde a Sanctuarie where his crimes may be victorious and at quiet. That traitour shall die for't (replied the Emperour) in what place soever of the world he hath made his retreate; Goe Achomat, goe, whither our common griefes call thee; and by prodigious chastisements, teach the Christians, that though many treasons prove happy, yet the traitours are continually miserable. By these words, the Sultan having given me command to dispose of his Armie, I staid some few dayes to let him know the severall enterprises I had on Italie. When he had fixed on that, which he imagined to be the most glorious and easie, he prescribed me the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for execution; and some few dayes after, leaving the Towne and coasts of Lepanto all waste, he tooke the way of Constantinople with onely fifteen Gallies: the next day I set saile, and with forty thousand fighting men, landed at Calaurea; presently I won the Towne of Cariatha, and made my exceeding furie be felt, not onely by men, but even of women and children. All indifferently passed by the sword or fire, and I make no question but all Italie had been the prey of my victorious Armie, if the love I bare my daughters had not made me forget what I owed to Bajazet's affection. Among the sea faring men that were taken about Calaura, there was a Pilot, who seeing himself at the point of losing his life, told them that had laid hands on him, he had somewhat to say to me of more importance (for my owne particular) then the conquest of Italie: though they beleev'd him not, yet for feare of an errour, they brought him to me; I make no doubt (said he to me presently) but that the losse of Solyman Basha, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I made the Pilot arise, and promising him farre more then he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, I understood how Solyman was gotten away, and whither he was gone, but I could heare nothing of my daughters. The love of revenge made me resolve to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54727:239"/>
mine Army, and to goe alone where Solyman resided: I therefore reimbarked all my troupes as speedily as I could, and leaving with the Generall at sea, a letter directed to the Sultan, for his approbation of my action, I steer'd towards the Canaries. I heard in the Isle of Teneriff, that Solyman (whom they call'd Iphidamantus) had been there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a moneth with Polexander, but was gone thence fifteene dayes past; and to heighten my affliction, they told me he was put to sea againe in quest of a Turkish Princesse which he had lost: hereupon I presently left Teneriff, and without inquiring after Solyman in the other Islands, repassed the straights, and sought him under a strange name and habit in a thousand places of France, Spaine, and Italie. After a yeare spent in those voyages, I put me againe into the Ocean, and about a moneth since, by good hap, I met on the coasts of Fez, a skiffe, in which there was none but Moores and Granadians: I inquired newes of the Countrey, and understood that Morocco was besieg'd by the Pirates of Cape Verd, and was defended by Abdelmelec, and a Knight which call'd himselfe the unknown Knight. I got him to describe that Knight to me, and assoone as I heard of his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comelinesse and valour, I imagined it was Solyman. The next day I came into Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet's Campe, and concealing the true cause of my coming, feign'd others to him probable enough to take away all suspition he might have of me: he us'd me after his manner, that was with incomparable civilities, and offering me the command of his Army, made me repent my dissimulation. With an extraordinary freenesse he declar'd to me the cause which had ingaged him to this Siege, and by that Declaration, wip'd off all my griefe for the dissembling mine owne businesse; for I leave it to your thoughts, to what hee had been obliged, had he once knowne I sought his Mistresses brother of purpose to kill him. I waited therefore (without discovering my selfe) the occasion of seeing Solyman with his sword in his hand. Yesterday it happened as you have heard, indeed the successe was not such as I hoped, but so, as I was to expect from that eternall Mercy, which by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible wisdome, out of the greatest ills produceth the greatest happinesses. Thus Achomat ended the recitall of his fortunes, and fill'd the hearts of his Auditors with so much pity, that even the most contented there, were for that time incapable of feeling their owne happinesse. This converse had lasted longer, had it not been disturb'd by a great noise which came from the land, and by an allarme given as well in the ships as in the campe. Bajazet and Achomat knowing how necessary their presence was in the like occasions, tooke leave of the company; Polexander and Iphidamantus followed them, after they had intreated Zabaim not to forsake the Princesses: They got to the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Bajazet had got together againe the troupes which the enemy had driven out of the trenches. Polexander's arrivall inspiring the valour, nay the temerity of the most cowards, all the Pirates went on furiously against the besieged, and after a conflict which lasted farre within night, forc'd them to retire for shelter behinde their bastions. The foure Princes were much troubled to know who had animated the enemy with that bold resolution, when they brought them thirty or forty prisoners: A Knight among them of a very brave aspect, making way through his companions, stopp'd before Bajazet, and thus spoke to him: I am of the Princes of Granada, and the eldest of the Abinzeragues, which have surviv'd the ruine of their Countrey. The unfortunate Boabdilez not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during the slavery of his people, nor the pride of his conquerours, hath lately left Spaine, and passed into Africa with all the remainder of his forces. Ten thousand Moorish Knights, and forty thousand of his Subjects have followed his fortune, and found a safe retreate in the goodnesse of the King whom you so much injure, without any wrong done you. The miseries from whence we but newly came, had so quell'd the courages of our most hardy souldiers, that finding themselves to enjoy some quiet in the places appointed them by the King of Morocco, they could not till now resolve to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on their armour: But the King my Master, asham'd to see that Prince running the hazard of being ruin'd, who had sav'd him, got to horse with a hundred of his Knights, and stirring from place to place, to incite the Granadians to the defence of their Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, so urg'd them, that they forsooke their wives and children, and under the conduct of the King himselfe, fortunately cast themselves into Morocco. Boabdilez and Hely thought it fit, that to honour the succours, I should sally with some troupes and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what trouble you, which I instantly obeyed; and my act had been very fortunate, if the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54727:239"/>
end had answered the beginning: that which I have more to say, is this; If you are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated as much by your generousnesse as valour, after your overcoming me, you will doe the like on my adverse fortune, and send me backe to the King my Master, since you will not have much to boast on in detaining, that had so little honour in taking me. That mischance which cast me under my horse, is to have all the glorie of my being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner; let not that vaunt of it, or dare share in your actions, for which you should be beholding to none but your owne vertue. Bajazet would gladly that Polexander and the two other Princes had answered the prisoner, but thinking it not fit to treate them with so much ceremonie; he did what was fit, and resuming the principall points of the Abinzerrago's speech; The King (said he) whom you have justly tearm'd unfortunate, should not beleeve that my companions and my selfe have so little courage as to suffer the injurie he hath done us. We had nought to decide with him, nor had our actions given him any pretext to denounce warre against us; yet comes he to crosse our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, and beget to himselfe enemies, in a time when he hath need of Protectors: hee shall feele how powerfull they are, and finde in Africa conquerours, no lesse cruell then Ferdinand and Isabella. You thinke to justifie what he hath done, in publishing, that honour compell'd him to assist the King of Morocco, and without failing in the most just resentment that can be among men, he could not denie him aid. I cannot beleeve him so acknowledging to a stranger, since so poorely abandoning the defence of his Countrie, he both witnessed his ingratitude to his owne Subjects and to himselfe. The Abinzerrague gave an extraordinarie ejaculation to hinder Bajazet from going on in his speech, and forcing himselfe out of the hands of those that held him: Command (said he to Bajazet) command them to kill me, and give over to treate a King so unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who though extreamly unfortunate, and utterly ruin'd as he is, yet remaines a King still. With that he flew at a partisan, and in the furie he was, had certainly kill'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but Bajazet seiz'd on his arme, and after he had disweapon'd him, promis'd, in regard of his generousnesse, thenceforward he would forgive Boabdilez weaknesse. To repaire the fault I have commitied (said he) I set you at libertie; but on condition, that to morrow you make appeare to us whether you are worthie the favour you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. Returne therefore to Morocco, and tell Hely that my good fortune hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd the treasure he had stolne from me. That the faire Ennoramita hath regain'd the libertie he restrain'd her of, and but for that Princesses picture which he keeps with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her consent, I had already rais'd the Siege, and made appeare by my retreate, that I came not to oppresse the weake, but to chastise the oppressors. Let him therefore be sure that neither my selfe nor my companions will stirre hence, till he hath given us that fatall picture; since it cannot be in his keeping, but we must (one way or other) thinke the divine Ennoramita to be still a prisoner. I adde another condition to this, and 'tis, that Boabdilez depart presently out of Morocco, with all those he brought into it, and returne to the place whence he came; to the end, the honour we have acquir'd receive no diminution, and that all the world may know, the sole love of justice, and not the feare of enemies, hath made us forgoe a more certaine conquest. The Abin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerrague either affrighted or ravished with Bajazet's courage, thank'd him with a great deale of submission, for the libertie he had restor'd him, and promised faithfully to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver to the two Kings the conditions of peace which he had propos'd to him. The Moore was then safely conducted to the gates of Morocco; at his entrance met the two Kings, who thinking he had been slaine, were preparing for a shamefull flight. Whilst by his coming he resettled those affrighted and timerous soules, and yet amazed them with the conditions presented from the besiegers; our foure Princes returned to Zabaim's ship, and there found the Princesses who had passed the afternoone in those ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions which accompanie love and favour. The Heroes returne having restor'd to their mindes thir former quiet, and the recitall of their conflict filling them with admiration; Polexander who affected all occasions whereby he might extoll Bajazet, I must confesse (said he) that Almanzor surpasseth in the art of well-loving all those which to this day have gone for the most perfect lovers in the world. He is not content with the depriving the King of Morocco for ever, of ever reviewing Cydaria, but will even have away her picture, and as if he were jealous of the frivolous pleasure which a
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54727:240"/>
portaiture may give his Rivall, hath sent him word, that he must resolve either to send him that picture, or to be buried under the ruines of his City. With that Almanzaira began, and said, the extremity was ill, and 'twas to he feared lest the eternall Justice grew weary of permitting those youthfull offences. Cydaria contrived the discourse, and casting her selfe at the feete of the King and Queene of Senega, humbly besought them, in this occasion to shew the power they had over Almanzor, and not permit a resolution which for an imaginary good might bring on a certaine mischiefe. Melicerta was of her opinion, but Zabaim rejected it as proofes of their Sexes fearefulnesse, and the two brothers intending not to crosse a thought so conformall with their owne, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated Bajazet not to let himselfe be overcome by the onely perswasions of Ladies. After these pleasant contestations the Princes and Princesses set themselves to table, and spent part of the night in the sweetnesse of their incomparable communication. A little before midnight Polexander and the three other Princes, fearing some new Sallyes, tooke leave of Zabaim and the Ladies and came to the Campe. They had not beene long there, where the Moores desirous to regaine by force what force had got from them, fell on the workes that were most advanc'd, and cutting the throats of the Guard, cloy'd twenty pieces of Cannon, fired their powder, and retired with very little losse. This successe raising their courage, and dissipating their feare of the Pirates valour, they grew perswaded, that if they offered them battle they would compell the Rovers to a shamefull reimbarking. Hely and Boabdilez suffered themselves to be blinded as well as their Subjects with the flash of this adventure, and egg'd on by the Abinzerrague, resolv'd in full earnest to come to handy blowes, and force the Pirates to raise their siege. To that end, the two Kings (alike unworthy their condition) sent a Herauld to Bajazet, and to revenge by an extreame contempt the small esteeme Bajazet had made of them in the presence of the Abinzerrague, they commanded the Herauld to speake to him as to a thiefe; That Officer, who with his milke, had suck'd the insolencie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall to the Moores, came to Bajazet, whom he found in his Tent with Polexander, Achomat and Iphidamantus. He presented himselfe before him with a pride worthy of laughter, and without asking leave to deliver what he had in charge: I come, said he to Bajazet, from the great King of Fez, Morocco and Trevisan. I command thee in his name, that within foure and twenty howres thou depart from these coastes; and since the unworthinesse of so many Kings whom thou hast engaged in thy robberies, give thee forces and retreates in lieu of prosecuting thee as a publique enemy; Go on; and on the Seas pillage such unfortunate Merchants as cannot defend themselves. But if thou wilt not have a hangman to avenge all Africa for so many murders and thefts wherewithall thou hast even made her desolate, take heed how thou set'st foote againe on the Territories of the King my Master. Bajazet shew'd a great deale of moderation during his insolent Speech, and even preserv'd it when he was oblieg'd to answer. At last (said he to the Herauld) judge how farre my Companions and my selfe are from those violences which the King thy Master upbraids us withall. Returne, and tell him that scorning his injuries and force, we will not part hence till wee have reduc'd his whole City into cinders, if he doe not speedily come with the portracture of Ennora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mita, and on his knees aske the lives of his subjects and a pardon for his insolencies. The Herauld seeing what fortune he was to run, for his too much impudence, made a very low reverence to the Princes, and retir'd so extreamly affrighted that when he was got within the gates of Morocco he thought himselfe not free from the hands of the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The answer he made to the King his Master in the presence of the King of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, fill'd them both with feare and astonishment. But the Abinzerrague, and the other Moorish knights promising them to bring Bajazet alive or dead, and to cut the throate even of the last Pirate, made them at last consent to a battle. All the day was spent for that preparation; and our Princes understanding the resolution by one of their Spies, drew from their Ships, all their fighting men. They then sent Zabaim no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, who (the most valiant of his age) desirous to make it appeare that his yeares had not brought him to the weakenesse of quitting his armes, set six thousand men on shore which he had in his fleete, and putting them into a battalion, march'd himselfe in the front, and so came and joyn'd with Bajazets Army. His troupes were much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54727:240"/>
and lodg'd in the most commodious part of the Campe, and appointed to make a body for their last Reservall. Bajazet the same day review'd the whole Army, and after he had given order for the battle, left all the rest to the Marshals of the Campe. After dinner he chose the most eminent risings where to lodge his Canon, and gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice through all the Regiments that next day every one was to performe his duty. Whilst the Officers acted their commands, Zabaim and the foure Princes thought they had time sufficient to give the Ladies the good night. To them they went with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary diligence, and found the Queene of Senega in Polexanders ship. She was gone thither to comfort Melicerta, who having beene much troubled all night with dreames and fearefull visions, awaked in a fever. Achomat seeing her so wan and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, cast him selfe on her, and melting in teares; Is it possible (said he) my deare daughter, that heaven will give no period to our miseries? My Lord, (replied Melicer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta) Heaven of whom you complaine, hath by infallible advertisements assur'd that that end is neere. The last night I saw the Sultannesse my Mother, inviron'd with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light, yet with a melancholy countenance, and her eyes full of teares. She held out her hand to me, but turn'd her head aside, as if she had a horror to see me, and plucking to me with violence: Come Melicerta, (said she rudely enough) and flatter thy selfe no longer with vaine hopes. Thou must follow me, and we must reunite for ever. With that me thought I gave a shreek as loud as I could, and that brought you to me and Iphidamantus; but presently the heavens open'd, and with a clap of thunder strooke you both dead at my feet. My dreame was not yet ended when Cydaria awaked me, and asked why I made such lamentation? If now (said she) my prayers can obtaine any thing from you, if the preservation of your afflicted daughter be deare unto you; in briefe, if I be able to comfort you for the losses you have suffered through me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you by that Deitie which you have made me worship from my infancie, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the dangers of warre, and winne Iphidamantus to prevent by a little feare, the misfortunes wherewithall his valour threatens him. Daughter (replied Achomat) those who are better seene then I am in the interpretation of dreames, may free you from that apprehension yours hath given you: for mine owne part, who give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit at all to them, I can say nothing, but that the visions you have seen are the remains of that deep melancholy you got by living among the dead. Iphidamantus came to Melicerta as her father ended his speech, and taking her hand, which burnt, Doe not (said he) feare the accidents of warre, but rather those of your feaver: 'Tis that thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-bolt which your dreame should make us doubt of, and without question if you strive not to divert the blow by giving way to your cure, but your father and I shall suffer under it. Your persons (repli'd Melicerta) are so deare to me, that I must with a great deale of pleasure resolve to whatsoever can be for their preservation; and I would to heaven, the small remainder of my life might put yours in suretie; but since 'tis your will, I will refuse no remedie, prescribe all you thinke fit for my health. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently Diceus was call'd, and after some consultation with Bajazet's Physicians, let Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licerta bleed, which somewhat quieting her fits, she grew more mirthsome, and lesse troubled. Iphidamantus perceiving so great an amendment, and seeing he could not be permitted long with that Princesse, was willing to make his best use of the happy moments; he sate neere an houre (alone) at her beds-head, and asking pardon for his former insensibilitie, besought her to give his affection some signe that it was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Melicerta thereupon gave him her hand to kisse, and intreated him to have a care of his life. Could I give my whole age and thoughts to that amorous couple, I should recount to my Reader so much sweetnesse produc'd by love in that converse, that I am most certaine, the most severe, and most insensible that can be found out, would not be able to keep himselfe from falling in love, after its due consideration; But I dare stay no longer with these two lovers: Bajazet and Cydaria accuse me for my not disinterested pen; and Polexander, to whom I wholly owe it, justly u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:54727:241"/>
mutuall gifts. Iphidamantus put on Melicerta's wrist, a bracelet of pearles of a distinct forme and extraordinary greatnesse: Melicerta commanded one of her women to bring her a scarfe wrought with a Spanish stitch, linck'd with rubies, which she cast ore Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus, but in putting it on, her arme was unswath'd and so bloudied the scarfe: at which sight Melicerta gave a great shreeke, and affrighted with the presage, would have taken the scarfe from Iphidamantus. But the Prince humbly beseeching her to leave it him; Doe not beleeve Madam (said he) that the losse of your bloud is an effect of fortunes ordinary malice; 'tis an act of love's goodnesse: he is not satisfied with my wearing the tokens of your favour, but would have me the depositary of one of the most precious parts you can call yours, that so in the conflict, I might remember you fight with me, and should feare nothing, having a second that is perpetually victorious. Heaven grant (repli'd Melicerta) that your interpretation may be truer then mine, and that it may be onely the excesse of my affection that fills me with such extreame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightings. Melicerta, seeing her lover upon parting, cast her armes about his neck, and gave her faith to live and die with him. Iphidamantus promised the like, and those two faire soules ratified the accord more strong, and solemnely then all publicke contracts by such kisses, as were by vertue of their promises, made innocent and lawfull: This short content was followed by long sadnesse, at least, counting the time, not according to the course of the Sunne, but the computation of such amorous Soules. They broke from one another with a like violence, and whilst Melicerta gave her self over to new griefes Iphidamantus went to Bajazet. He was with Cydaria, and tasted such pleasures as till then he was ignorant of. He related to her the particulars of his Rovers life, and during the recitall, tooke those civill liberties, which the scrupulous virtue of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stris permitted him. When he was forc'd to take leave of her; Madame (said he) assure your self that fighting for your honor it is not possible but wee shall come off victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In speaking it, his countenance, action, and words, were as so many infallible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the approching victory. Cydaria, so tooke them; yet seeing her lover departe, could not refraine from teares. Zabaim, Polexander, and Achomat, at the same time taking their leaves, retir'd to the Campe, and spent part of the night in rest, that they might not sinke under the travell the next day provided for them. At day-breake the four Princes arose, and having offered their hearts and lives to the all-powerfull Deity, mounted on horsebacke and rid to see the order and number of the Troupes. Their Army consisted but of twenty or five and twenty thousand men, but all so valiant and well disciplin'd that there was not an Army how numerous soever was able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. The Infantry was divided into two and thirty battalions which by their distance might succour one another without running the hazard of intermingling or disordering one another. The Cavalry was placed on the wings, and lead by Polexander and Alcippus. The Moors march'd out of Morocco in good order, and had placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a place very advantageous, had not Bajazets Canon hindred them. Their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry began the skirmish. The Granadians came on horse as well managed as theirs, and made their Enemies confesse, there were not better horsemen to be met withall. After the Cannon had played and the horse met, the battalions mov'd. Bajazet fought on the right wing with sixe thousand Pirates. Achomat on the lefte with foure thousand. Iphidamantus led the battle, and Polexander who was every where with a thousand horse forsooke none that had need of his great courage. The first dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fi l'd the ayre with fire and smoake, and covered the earth with blood and dead corps. The Pirates who were used to fight by dint of sword assoon as they had given their first volleyes, taught the Moores a manner of fighting, as new to them as harmefull. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, with his body of horse transpierc'd all that came before him, and reserving his sword for illustrious blowes, killed none but such men as were extraordinarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable, either by their quality or valour. Achomat who did no lesse wonders, passed even to the Rere-guard of the Moores to meete with the King of Morocco or of Granada: but they had no minde to be there, but were placed on the walls, from whence under the covert of a Scarlet Pavillion they beheld the voluntary sacrifice of so many men, whom their private interest exposed to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54727:241"/>
met, and at that time his Cymeter might be compar'd to thunder when it lights in a forrest. Bajazet as the most interested in the battle was likewise the more eager in the fight, he searched every where for the bold Abinzerrague, who had brag'd he would fight with him, and met the Granadian after he had beaten downe many of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: assoone as he came up to him, 'Tis (said he) now at this time, that thou must make evident to us, thou knowest how to make much of the liberty we have given thee; The Abinzerrague knew him, and came on so bravely, that he doubted not but the strength of his arme would answer the boldnesse of his speech; they fought almost a quarter of an houre, without advantage, yet they saw the Moore was inferiour to Bajazet, as much as a hardy Faulcon to that alwayes victorious bird which findes his element in that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full region where the thunder is bred. The illustrious Rover was neere assur'd of the victorie, and his Enemie reduc'd to the quitting his armes or life, when above two hundred Moorish Knights came to aide him, and forc'd Bajazet to thinke of his owne preservation in lieu of prosecuting his victorie. Iphidamantus, who had put to flight the King of Morocco's troupes, and beate them into the gates of the citie, brought back his forces where the Granadians yet disputed the victorie; one squadron of the Moor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> he routed and put to their heeles, and so came to the place where Bajazet was ingaged: these two great courages being met, and followed by a small companie of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute pirates, made the stongest battalions to stagger, and by wondrous valour which terrified the valiant'st Granadians, compell'd, maugre their ancient pride, to leave to them the honour of that day. The slaughter was great, and had beene farre more, but for the approaching night, and neernesse of the Towne: there fell in the field but fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or sixteene hundred of the Pirates; Zabaim neither left his station nor fought; of the foure other Princes, three were lightly hurt; the fourth which was Achomat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from the fight cover'd with wounds and bloud; he tooke heed of nought but to overcome, and that care tooke good effect, as you have heard, but so unfortunately for him, that after he had put off his armour, and Diceus had searched his wounds, two of them were found if not mortall, at least most dangerous. Polexander, Iphidamantus, and Bajazet, went to visit him, and witnessing their sorrow to see him in that case complained of their fortune, and detested so deare a bought victorie. Why my friends (said Achomat) did you thinke me invulnerable? I confesse I am wounded, but I have life enough left me to fight againe to morrow, if our Enemies have courage enough to come once more out of their walls: give over then that sadnesse which hinders you from savoring so great a victorie; and for feare of making your selves unworthy of so brave a day, cast your thoughts on him which is the author of it, and goe presently to render to his protection the thankes he expects from your acknowledgement. The Princes being by a sacred advertisement put in minde of their dutie, returned to the place of the battle, and according as they had bin bred up and instructed, vowed; some Temples, others Mosquys to the same Deitie which they acknowledged all to be the Author of their victorie: Polexander and Iphidamantus caus'd a Crosse to be erected on a hillocke in the midst of the Plaine, and adorning it with spoiles taken from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, fixed an Inscription of Gratitude on it.</p>
               <p>These actions of pietie being ended, the newes of the battle was to be sent to the Princesses; Iphidamantus and Bajazet tooke on them that charge: Melicerta startled with joy and feare when her lover entred the chamber: Come deare Iphidamantus said she to him, and tell me where is my honour'd Achomat? Madam (repli'd the Prince) he stayes behinde with Zabaim and Polexander, to give new orders to our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and (if I be not deceiv'd) to make them ready for another battle. If it be so (said Melicerta) I shall see my good father this night, but I feare much hee is not in case to come hither. Iphidamantus was urg'd to make many protestations for the quieting the minde of that Princesse; at last the beleev'd him, but 'twas to comply with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame love she bore to Iphidamantus. An houre and more he stay'd with her, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet was not lesse time with Almanzaira and Cydaria; he related to them how mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters had happen'd, and spoke not but by the way of Achomat's hurts, for feare of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling ought of sadnesse with the mirth of their conversation. The good fortune of warre giving him a little more boldnesse then he was to take, he besought Almanzaira
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54727:242"/>
to perfect her happinesse by obtaining from Cydaria a declaration, which hee was not so overbold to aske, nor deserving enough to merit. I have (said Almanzaira) preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted your intreatie, and knowing well you could not enjoy your full happinesse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Princesse assent, I have besought her not to oppose a Fate which hath been writ even by the hand of Heaven: she hath initmated to me, that my intreaties were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with her; she for my sake hath even cast aside her intention, and if Polexander ruines not your happinesse, I see not what you are to petition more. Cydaria blushed at the Mothers speech to her Sonne, and yet by a smile she shew'd she was resolv'd not to contradict her; Almanzaira desirous to oblige Bajazet to the height, tooke Cydaria by the hand, and clasping it with her deare Sons, I wish (said she) your hearts were as strictly joyn'd as your hands; and that future time give you as much content as you have indur'd afflictions in the former. Cydaria drew away her hand so hastily, as if shee had fear'd to ingage her selfe, and looking on Almanzaira with a pleasing amazement; What doe you please to doe Madam? said she, Had you that powerfull Character by whose vertue that which is bound on Earth, is confirmed presently in Heaven, I should be now in the power of Bajazet. Lady (repli'd the Queene) I shall never love Almanzor so much, as to submit you to his discetion; his greatest glory is in acknowledging yours, and in that little time he had the honour to hold your hand, hee made an irrevocable oath, never to be dispensed from serving you. Bajazet durst say nothing, for feare of speaking somewhat that might displease Cydaria; onely by his humbled countenance, he told her, she was acknowledged by him, for the absolute arbitratour of his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as well as his life. Cydaria would not abuse that Soveraigne Authority; she tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Almanzaira, and the colour coming into her face, 'Tis fit Madam (said she) that you be obey'd, and Almanzor treated as a personage farre beyond others. I referre all that concernes my selfe, to the disposall of your Majestie and Polexander. 'Tis too much, cri'd Bajazet, transported as a man that could give no bounds to his joy; all the hazards I can expose my selfe to for your service, cannot make me worthy of the least word you have spoken in my favour: be pleas'd withall, that in kissing your hand (which he did in saying so) I may sweare, as if I touched our Altars, that I desire no other honour, then to merit by all the actions of my life, the continuation of my most humble servitude. Bajazet had no sooner ended his generous protestation, but hee tooke leave of the Queene and his Mistresse, and went with Iphidamantus to Zabaim, Polexander, and the unfortunate Achomat. In the meane time, Melicerta no more troubled by the powerfull charmes which were inseparably annexed to the faire Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus person, called to minde her father, and her propheticke spirit representing him to her wounded as he was, she called one of her women in whom she most trusted; Eliza (said she to her) I can no longer live in these afflictions; in this extremitie thou must needs testifie to me, how justly I love thee, and (without being stopp'd by any occasion whatsoever) goe secretly, and learne whether my honoured father be alive or dead. Iphidamantus surely deceived me, when he protested he was not wounded: the extraordinary agitations of my minde force me, not beleeve him, and to thinke that my Lord the Basha is reduc'd to an estate very deplorable. Eliza accustomed to obey, and not dispute her Mistresse commands, went to put on a man's habit, which she had formerly made use of in the like occasions, and came to the Campe unknowne of any: there she inquired for Achomat's quarter, and finding it, entred his tent a little after Iphidamantus and Bajazet were got thither. A great disorder there was by meanes of the generous Basha's wounds, and every body indifferently came in, that the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rt Prince might at least have the comfort of seeing how much he was lamented. Eliza came so neere to his bed, that she heard him speake of Melicerta, and besought Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus to goe and prepare her minde for the constant receiving the newes of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune: Eliza, no sooner heard Iphidamantus answer, but she slid out in the crowde, and returned with the same diligence she came. When she was alone with Melicerta, Madam (said she) the Prince your father is alive, but he is wounded in so many places, that he is forced to keep his bed; the Chirurgeons are of opinion that his wounds are dangerous, yet they despaire not of healing them: for the rest, Achomat infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to see you, and intreated Iphidamantus (when I came thither) to repaire to you,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54727:242"/>
that by the power of his advice, he might suppresse your first agitations, and by some sleight make you swallow so bitter a potion as he brings you. O bloudy decrees of the eternall Justice (cryed Melicerta, interrupting Eliza) see the beginning of such things as it hath resolv'd! My dreames have the same dismall interpretations I alwayes dreaded, and I learne thence, but most cruelly, that in vaine the unfortunate take paines todivert their destinie. Unprofitable words, vaine considerations! why keep ye me in my bed? 'Tis not a fit time now to talke of rest and health. Let's hasten Eliza, ô let's run whither our piety calls us, and not be husbanding a miserable life, which (may be) must this day be taken from us: With that Melicerta flung out of her bed, and scarce gave her woman time to cloath her; she went privately from her ship, and without taking leave of Almanzaira, nor her deare Cydaria, was carried in a chaire to Achomat's tent; she entred that wherein he lay, without giving notice of her coming, and so surpris'd Polexander, Iphidamantus, and Bajazet, that as amaz'd they cry'd out all at once. The wounded man rais'd his head, and about to aske what was betided, saw Melicerta, who unable to speak, or uphold her self, fell downe on his bed: My deare daughter (said he) thinke on me! and consider that thy griefes wound me a new: curb then those too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent witnesses of thy love, and give over at last to wrestle with a Power that cannot be surmounted. Though Melicerta was extreamly transported, yet she heard what her father spake; and to conforme her selfe to his will, so much forc'd her selfe, that one might say, she in a moment pass'd from an extreame anxiety to an extremity of quiet: shee arose from her father's bed, and having kiss'd him with an admirable constancy; My Lord (said she) I could not be your daughter, and do lesse then grieve for your misad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; not that I thinke it dangerous, for if your friends countenances dissemble not, nor deceive me, I see no cause we have to feare; set your minde therefore at rest, and be pleas'd that I share with you, at least in such ills as you had never tri'd, had you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been father to your unnaturall Melicerta: With that she grew pale, and but for Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damantus who held her, she had falne flat on the ground; she was so weake with her former sicknesse, and strove so exceedingly to hide her sorrow, that without the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull courage wherewithall she had alwayes us'd to oppose her miseries, she had even then forgone that poore remainder of life which was left her. She had not been there much above an houre, when two of Bajazet's Officers entered Achomat's tent, and told their Generall, they brought him some Eunuchs which were taken in the camp, and being forc'd to speake, said, they belonged to the Princesse Rozelana, wife to Achomat. How subject is the judgement of men to be deceived! I say so, because Bajazet rejoyc'd at the comming of Rozelana's Eunuchs, and thought their bringing newes of that Princesse would not be a little comfort to Achomat. He went therefore to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha's bed-side, and assuring him his wounds were not mortall, promised, he should short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive such consolation as would much further his recovery: Whence can it come? (said Achomat.) From the person you love best in the word, replyed Almanzor. Alas, said the Basha, my dear Rozelana knows not where I am, and what afflicts me more, is, that thinking me lost with her daughters, she laments, and spends in tears and fighes the best dayes of her life. She must needs be better inform'd (said Bajazet) then you imagine, for two of her servants are newly come hither, and desire to have the honour to see you. Let them come in (said Achomat) let them come quickly, and in saying so, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in such a posture as made Diceus beleeve his wounds were not so dangerous as he thought them. The Eunuchs presently came in, and because they were extreamly black, and very unseemly, they could not judge by their countenances, whether they brought good or bad newes. Achomat tooke the letter they presented him, and without giving eare to his daughter or the Princes, who intreated he would not straine himself, call'd for a light, and read what followes.</p>

so much affliction on you; but withall, I confesse it would not have me part hence without assuring you, that death it selfe cannot rase you out of my thoughts: I die then my dear Achomat, but I die contented, since I could not live any longer but in affliction, and by consequence you could expect nothing from me but teares and trouble. I do not intreate you to be insensible of my losse. On the contrary (my deare Achomat) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire thou wouldst never be comforted for it; yet if it be true that you love me, I, even dying, intreate this favour, that you will live as long as the eternall Providence hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. I can no more, Death forceth on me, and were it not staid by that victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hand which triumph'd over it in the grave, I should not have time enough nor strength to assure you that I die a Christian.</p>
                  <p>WHen he had read over the Letter, he sigh'd, but so weakly, that they thought not he had receiv'd so sad newes; he turn'd to his Eunuchs, and calling one of them by his name, Narcissus, said he, didst thou see her die? Yes, my Lord (reply'd the old Eunuch) and these unfortunate hands (with that he lifted them up) have for ever clos'd her eyes. He had no sooner said so, but he tore that little haire remaining on his head, and casting himselfe on the earth, began againe to lament and weep with his companion. Melicerta who had alwayes prophesied her afflictions, anticipated those contain'd in her mothers Letter, and forgetting all her high resolutions, O heaven! (cry'd she) must there need so many blowes from thee, to kill so miserable a wretch! With that Achomat reach'd her her mothers Leter, and then fell back on his pillow: she scarce tooke time to read it all, but cry'd out, O detestable creature that I am! O monster twice a parricide! blinded passion! unjust, or unpowerfull heaven! We are all three alike guilty: the one hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the mischiefe, the other advis'd it, and the last could not defend her self from it. Her respect to Achomat and the other Princes, staid the current of her laments for that misfortune, but it could not stop that of her despaire. The presence, the teares, and entreaties of Iphidamantus, could obtaine from her no other then a faigned compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sency. For Achomat, he was silent, and though his love to his daughter made her ever extreamly deare to him, yet he never troubled himselfe with forbidding her lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nor intreating her to live. In this manner was the night spent, at day-breake, Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim, Polexander and Bajazet, call'd on by their troopes, with much griefe left the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the daughter, and would have obliged Iphidamantus to stay with them; but in the very instant Almanzaira and Cydaria came into the tent. On the newes they heard of Melicerta sudden going away, they imagin'd Achomat was dead; and not to abandon that Princesse in her extreame affliction, were come to the Camp. Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus leaving his Mistresse againe in the hands of Almanzaira and Cydaria, humbly be sought her permission to follow his brother and friends; Goe deare Iphidamantus (said she) goe, since thou wilt, and my ill fate suffers me not to forbid thee: with those words she grew speechlesse, and her scattered eyes gave apparent singes of her soules dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. Iphidamantus stai'd till she was recollected, and when he thought she had no more need of his being there, he went to the place where they were to fight; there he found Polexander, Zabaim, and Bajazet, examining one of their Spies, a crafty fellow, if there were ever any; he inform'd them, how he had been all the night in the palace of Morocco, and that both the Kings resolv'd to flye, when a great noise was heard on that part next to Mount Atlas, and presently there came in a Knight, who advertis'd them of the arrivall of twenty thousand Arabians; I saw them enter (said the Spy) and though the number be great, their equipage and order are both so ill, that I make almost no esteeme of that succour. The Princes without much relying on that man's opinion, or neglecting their accustomed providence, tooke care to put themselves in case good enough to receive their Enemies, and to repell them how valiant soever. To that end they chang'd the manner of their battle, and presently call'd their enemies to combate; the Moores on their side, reinforc'd by the Arabians, march'd into the field, and put themselves in battle-array: Polexander causing his vantgard to advance to a special piece of ground whence they could not be dislodg'd, &amp; seeing some of them a little foil'd with so many combates, thought it was not amisse to speake to them; My companions (said he) doe not beleeve your toile or danger this day will be comparable to such as you
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54727:243"/>
have gone through; all that you have to doe, is to perfect that fight which night inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and assure your selves of the victorie you had already wonne: those who are to meet withall, with a boldnesse that seems not to know you, are the same run-awayes whom but last night you forc'd all in disorder to flie into their towne, and to preserve their lives with the losse of their honour; I confesse they have some succours come to them, but I leave you to judge what they are, being compos'd of Arabians, that is, of so ill Souldiers, that all Princes who would well wage warre, cashiere them from their Armies; they are theeves, who never set on any but such as will run from them. On then my companions, fall on, where victorie (aloud) calls for you, she declares her self once more on your fide, and askes from your hands but a few Palmes which are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dresse her Crowne withall. After this Speech to his Souldiers, Polexander fell in among the Enemie; with the first incounter of his lance, he overthrew the Abinzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rague; Iphidamantus slew him who onely surviv'd of the Morocco Kings race; and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet ran through and through the Arabian Generall. These first incounters affrighting the Moores, they apparently stagger'd, and but for a Body of Granadians, which kept them from flying, the fight had been ended in the very beginning. Iphidamantus made himselfe a way amongst their Cavalrie, and not considering whether he were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or no, passed furiously through their fire, pikes and lances. Polexander on his side, having no more to act, turn'd otherwhere, and asking in every place for Iphidamantus, hasted to that part where he was said to be fighting; hee could not come to him by meanes of a battalion of Moores which stopped his passage, and coming on with much co fidence, engag'd him to fight; he shew'd them to such as followed him, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without scarce any stay, My friends (said he) there are onely these men that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with you for the victorie; teach them they are no more invincible then those you have already defeated; your valour receives a diminution to suffer them to be so long in case to resist you; give way then to be govern'd by your just anger; they must, nay, 'tis fit they should be inveloped with the fortune of their companions, and not contest any longer with you for the honour of this day: But what said I? they must? they are already o'recome, since I see you are resolv'd to set on them. Though these words were perswasive, yet they were more true; for the pirates fell on as if they had been untoil'd and fresh, and without any other care then to die honourably, (with their incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Leader) passed through that masse of men, armes and horses. The valiant Abin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerrague had promis'd his ambition to conquer some one of our Heroes, but it was farre easier to make such a vow then performe it; he came full gallop to meete Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, and calling to him afar off to defend himselfe, ran against him with a firme beliefe, that at least he should unhorse him: Polexander stai'd for him, and turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side with his sword the point of his lance, with the same weapon ran at his throat, but it did onely rase the skin; the Abinzerrague began to accuse Mahomet for his misfortune, and casting away his lance, came with his sword drawn at Polexander; never was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate more furious, nor accompanied with more spectators, for as if it had been a thing agreed on by both Armies, all those that were fighting, forgot one another in the heate of the battle, and standing still with their swords drawne expected the successe of the Duell, which was such as my Reader imagines: the Abinzerrague at last sinking under the stroakes of invincible Polexander, receiv'd two deadly blowes, and fell almost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently under his horses feet. The Granadians seeing their Generall dead, look'd like those inchanted bodies which have no other motion then what they take from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which animates them; they presently threw away their armes, either to flie the more lightly, or to be the sooner slaine, and by their cryes and disorder, were the first that proclaim'd the Princes had wonne the battle. Bajazet, who had cut in pieces al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Arabians, and followed them above a league, returned from the chase with a gallant troupe, when he met those whom Polexander hardly pursued: He put all to the sword to free himselfe from the trouble of a third day, and by that slaughter made an end of all was to be done. Those who have most exactly spoken of this warre, have written, that either during the siege or in the two battles; the pirates were almost whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exterminated, and that Bajazet found not above two thousand remaining after the taking of Morocco. There were slaine above thirty thousand Moores, more then ten
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54727:244"/>
thousand Granadians, and twice as many Arabians. Assoone as the battle was wonne, there was so generall an affright in the Towne, that the two Kings fled thence by night, and staid no where till they were farre gotten into the hideous Sanctuaries of Mount Atlas. Polexander and Bajazet, who knew as well how to make good use of a victorie as to overcome, fell into the gates of Morocco before the inhabitants were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected from their former fright; they found them open and abandon'd, and entred the Towne with all the discretion experienced Captaines use to temper their earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in so nice occasions. Those few pirates which remained alive, desirous to revenge the deaths of their companions, ran through the streets with fire and sword, and made such ravage and havocke, that to this day may be seene to what excesse their inhumane courages drove them; whilst they abus'd the priviledges attributed to their condition, Polexander and Bajazet rid out of the Towne, and not knowing where to finde Iphida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantus, posted into the field where they had fought the battle; they found him not there, and thinking he was return'd to Achomat and Melicerta, rode towards their tents. In their way, they perceiv'd Zabaim who was extraordinarily sad, they demanded the cause, and he told them that in the last fight of the Granadians, he had thrust in among them to disingage Iphidamantus, but that his assistance could not save the Prince from falling under the number: at this lamentable newes, Polexander could not refraine from teares, and besought Zabaim to bring him where he had seene Iphidamantus fall; they went all together, and by the light of the City on fire, search'd the dead, and found that Prince (the fairest and most valorous of his time) drown'd in his bloud, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron'd with a great many Moores whom he had (infallibly) slaine. Polexander fell downe on him, and interrupting his complaints with his sighes, Ah! my brother (said he, lifting him up) see then the fatall accomplishment of such things as thy poore Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa hath so often and so vainely foreseene; thou art dead deare Iphidamantus in the flower of thine age, and Heaven either for love or envie was onely pleas'd to shew thee to the world. Bajazet was not to be comforted, he tooke on against the stars and men, and accusing himselfe for Iphidamantus death, Wretch that I am, said he, 'tis I that have cover'd this faire body with all the wounds that disfigure it, and that conspir'd with the Moores to ruine that valour which I could not equalize. Zabaim, whose age and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience made him lesse sensible then the other two Princes, intimated to them, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would forget their profession, they could not with justice lament Iphidaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus death, since the like disasters were inseparably annexed to the use of armes; besides, Iphidamantus dying so gloriously, and in seventeene yeares of age having raz'd out the memory of all that had been great and admirable in former times, he was rather to be perpetually extoll'd then any thing at all lamented. Polexander suppressed his griefe that he might not be seene to affect a vertue so troublesome and vulgar, but thinking on the deadly wound Melicerta was to receive, Poore Princesse (cri'd he) thou said'st right alwayes, that there was no true felicity for thee, and that those favours by which Fortune seem'd to reconcile her selfe to thee, were but treacheries and snares of which she would make use to make thee the more sensible of her inhumanitie; shall I conceale from thee the losse of thy deare Solyman? Nay, shall I make knowne his death, which will be thine? Polexander could not goe on with his complaints, Bajazets lamentations hindred him, and Zabaim's remonstrances obliged him to returne to the Camp. He therefore commanded Diceus to carry off Iphidamantus corps privately, and taking Bajazet forcibly away, came to Achomat's tent; all was there in confusion and teares; the newes of Iphidamantus death had beene brought thither, and no body knew the anthor. Melicerta at the first hearing of it, giving her selfe desperately over, flew as she had been distracted out of her fathers tent; If Almanzaira and Cydaria had not with-held her, she had run to search for Iphidamantus among those that lay scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and slaine on the place of battle, as so many sacrifices offered up to victorie. Assoone as she saw Polexander, Give me my Solyman (cri'd she) restore the treasure you have stolne from me; and thou ambitious and adventurous Bajazet, wer'st thou not content with the robbing me of Achomat? must Iphidamantus death be added to his, as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond trophy rais'd to the honour of thy bloudy and furious passion? Almanzaira strove to appease her, Cydaria wept, Almanzor tore his haire, Polexander sate setled and mute,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54727:244"/>
Achomat all-dying as he was, bewail'd Iphidamantus death, and entreated Melicerta to moderate her sorrow, but she was deafe to all counsell and intreaties; sometimes she cast her selfe on her fathers bed, and then againe flinging through the company in Acho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat's tent, besought them (at least) to give her leave to go search for her husbands body. Achomat call'd our Heroe, and entreated that last contentment to his daughter and himselfe; Polexander besought him to thinke on what he desir'd, and to conceive what a furie his daughter might fall into at the sight of a body made so dreadfull and disfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with wound. There are (repli'd Achomat) some sicke persons to whom many things are deni'd, because many things may wrong them; but there are some other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine who are to be deni'd nothing, because their diseases being incurable nothing can hurt them: my daughter and my selfe are of the latter sort, there is no more thought to be taken for our preservation; all that our friends can doe for us, is to let us die in quiet, and (since poyson is no more dangerous for us then physicke) give us the one assoone as the other. Polexander, wonne by those reasons, but more by Melicerta's frightfull actions, commanded Iphidamantus body to be brought, and laid it on a bed neere to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chomat's. The Basha would needs see it, and making a worthy reflexion on that great example, of the frailtie of Princes lives; Greatnesse of the world, (said he) sensuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, momentarie beauties, come and see what you are in a portraict so truly represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you! And thou faire soule too soone dislodg'd from so faire a prison, flie not hence alone to the place of thy eternall rest! Achomat and Melicerta would follow thee, and participate of those promis'd incomprehensible joyes. No body heard Achomat, for Melicerta made such a noise, that nothing was to be heard but her lamentations. At last (to contemplate Iphidamantus) she grew silent, and grasping him in her armes, had certainly then dy'd on him, had she not been taken off: Achomat call'd her, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her reason surmounting her griefe and furie, she knew her fathers voice, and ran to his bed. Achomat, who decay'd, and grew palpably weake, and scarce able to speake, stretch'd his hand towards her, and presently letting it fall, Daughter (said he) give thanks with me to that Goodnesse which is at last wearied with our sufferings; if thou desirest I should die in some peace, moderate thy lamentation, and thinke thou hast lost not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>g, but what thou wert sure and bound to be depriv'd of, sooner or later. With that he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>f<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his hands to heaven, and addressing himselfe to that Power which could onely heare him, he gave up the ghost. When Melicerta, growing more furious then before, tore her face, pluck'd off her haire, and attempted often to seise on some sword to fall on; Almanzaira and Cydaria expressed, that if she continued as she was, that she was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other then the losse of her soule with her life; that consideration resetled her, and after a while musing, she cast her selfe on Achomat, and presently starting up again, But (said she) this is onely the halfe of my miseries, with that she ran to the other bed, and drawing the curtaines, stood like a statue, at the pitifull sight of so late an admired and faire a countenance, and now shaded with the obscuritie and horrour of death; she kissed him, and afterwards looking on him without any apparent disturbance, O short (said she) and unfortunate love of humane creatures, glorious and pitifull remaines of the fairest of men! Iphidamantus, deare Iphidamantus, is it thus that we were to be link'd with bonds more strong then time or fortune? Must I needs leave the tombe wherein I had buried my selfe alive, to be the spectatresse of thy precipitated death, and see thee againe after so long a separation, onely that I might lose thee more then once? Yes, it must be, for heaven had so resolv'd it, let's therefore fully perfect our destinie: Those were the last words she spoke, afterwards she did nothing but sigh, and utter some inarticulate speech; and then leaving her lover to returne to her father, she imbrac'd him neere a quarter of an houre, without giving eare to Zabaim's intreaties, Almanzai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's exhortations, Cydaria's laments, nor the supplications of Polexander and Bajazet. When she perceiv'd she could no more, she went from her father to Iphidamantus, and laying her selfe downe by him, tooke his hand, kissed it, and so gave up the ghost. These three so considerable dead bodies, and so neere to one another, made Polexander and Bajazet almost forget what they owed to themselves; at last their servants drew them from that mournfull place, and even forc'd them to retire to their vessells. Bajazet suspended his passion to accord with that of his Mistresse, and for two or three dayes did
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54727:245"/>
nothing but sigh and nourne with her; the fourth he tooke the hardinesse to speak, and told her that so faire and excellent a soule as hers, should be above all the malice of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: But Cydaria was of too noble a nature to be o'recome by so barbarous a philosophie; she had lost the halfe of her selfe in losing Iphidamantus, and 'twas fit she should have more then ordinary resentments; well might she yet strive to arme her selfe against reason, but time and love, which are as powerfull as death, made her yeeld, and quit her complaints and sorrow for the respect she bore to Polexander, Zabaim, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manzaira, and Bajazet's continuall sollicitations. Eight or ten dayes passed o're, during which time the Citie of Morocco was almost utterly ruined; that famous palace which Historians have describ'd to us as a master-piece of the African Kings magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, was subverted; the Temples scap'd not the furie of sacrilegious hands, and those three golden apples which shine on the point of the principall Mosquy, were hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd by the vertue of such enchantments as are their eternall defence and guardians. Bajazet would have nought for his part of the booty but Cydaria's picture, which was found in a private Mosquy of Hely's lodgings. Presently after, he sent command to the pirates, and the King his father's souldiers, to come from the Towne, and repaire to their colours; they obeyed without compulsion, being so rich, and tir'd with ill doing, that they wished for nothing more, then to put their pillage in some place of safetie. Polexander (for his part) pressed as much as he could their depart, which in his opinion might produce some great change of his fortune; Zabaim and Almanzaira desired it as much as he; Bajazet presently agreed, and so with as faire a gale as could be wish'd, they weigh'd anchors, and landed happily in the Island of Fez: there Zabaim visited the tomb of his second sonne, and Polexander restor'd to its ancient sepulchre, the body of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Melicerta. Her Father was laid on her right hand, and her Lover on her left, with Trophies of Warre and Love; and Inscriptions, which had lasted to this day, if the pride of Spaine had not subverted all the Monuments which might have preserv'd to after times, the memorie of our Heroe's conquests. From thence they passed to the new Isle of Alcidiana, and among the triumphs and rejoycings answerable to the time, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>arriage of Bajazet and Cydaria was concluded; a few dayes after that glorious Ceremonie, Zabaim and Almanzaira tooke thence their sonne and daughter to enter in possession of their estates, and solemnize among their owne subjects, the feasts of so illustrious and long-wish'd for an alliance. Whilst Senega, Guinea, Melly, and many other great Provinces wash'd by the Niger, drain'd their riches and inventions, to raise every where eternall remembrances for Bajazet's returne and marriage. Polexander by degrees and insensibly relaps'd into his former melancholy, and held all those for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors who assured him he should one day reinjoy the felicities he had lost; A Canarian (one that had been a great observer of the stars) came to him a little before he set to sea, and knowing his designe, Sir (said he) those which have not my knowledge in future things, having taken notice of those misfortunes you are like to fall into, advise you to give over your voyage; but I, who even now foresee the event, intreat you to hasten on, and not lose the benefit of certaine constellations, which seeme to shine onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with the malignity of such others as threaten you; set saile therefore, and hold it for infallible, that your happinesse shall not be farre off, when you see your selfe reduced to the most unfortunate estate, ever any great Prince like your selfe ever met with: Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander neglected this counsell, as others, and yet for feare of disobliging the Author, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Prognosticator being gone, Polexander set saile with Alcippus and Diceus, the deare and inseparable companions of all his fortunes; hee commanded his to steere right North, and without varying either West or Easterly, to hold on his course on the same point. All that ever experience and the art of Navigation have taught the most judicious Pilots, that man observ'd in the guiding his ship, and a winde from Africa seeming to be risen, expresly to favour their enterprise, made Polexander beleeve he should not alwayes be unfortunate. The hundred leagues which they held to be from the Canaries to Alcidiana's Island, were reckoned by so exact a computation, that the Pilot's Mates assured Polexander, they had not miscounted a mile; for all that no Isle could be discovered, and the ship still made on with all her sailes.

Two dayes and two nights he attempted severall courses, and rectifying himselfe by the help of his Compasse as often as the winde put him off from his first Rhombe; he had the boldnesse to tell Polexander, that in spight of the power of what Demons soever, he would finde that inchanted Island. These promises were too audacious to be licenced, and indeed were punished by a contemning which was like to cost their Authors life. At the fifth dayes break, those that were in the top of the maine Mast began<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who durst not beleeve what he so much desired, went up into a place from whence he might discover all that was round about: That land he saw, and his heart beating (so much did that object master his senses) I know (said he) well enough what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Alcidiana's just anger hath provided for me; but how worthy is my mishap to be envied, since the lightning that threatens me, is to come from the faire eyes of that Princesse! Whilst he spake thus, his vessell flew on the waves, and seem'd to take part in her masters rapture. Assoone as they were in the roade, they knew the discovered land to be an Isle: Polexander unwilling to trust to any body in a thing so important to him, commanded the shallop to be lanch'd, and taking none with him but Alcippus and Diceus, caused himselfe to be landed with all haste. He came on shoare in a very hidden and private place, and therefore went further up into the Isle to descry it; hee had not gone above five or six hundred paces along the coast, but he perceived the points of many turrets: with that hee went some hundred paces further without saying any thing; but when he was gotten to the top of a rocke from whence he plainly discerned the pavillions whose tops he had onely seen before; 'Tis the fatall Palace (said he) which I forsooke to pursue Amintha's ravishers. He spoke it imperfectly, his excesse of joy transporting him, he grew pale, he trembled, and underwent all the agitations that an extreame Love ever yet troubled the strongest minde with: sometime hee thanked Fortune, then he blessed Love, and ever among mingling Alcidiana; I have no sense (said he) but wrongs the extremitie of happinesse I enjoy. I confesse (O ye Divinities equally powerfull) that to you I am infinitely oblieged; but to shew such vulgar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements for so extraordinary benefits, is to be ingratefull. If there be any one which may be accepted, 'tis the confession I make, that it is not lesse impossible for me to expresse, then to acknowledge sufficiently your incomparable gratifications: with that he turned to Alcippus and Diceus, and knowing not what was best to be done; Advise me my friends (said he) for in the case I am, 'tis a hard matter for me to counsell my selfe. Alcippus replied, he was not so well in Alcidiana's favour, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent himselfe to her without the advise of some one of his ancient friends, by whom he might understand how the Queen was affected towards him: 'Tis true (said our Heroe) I should be more guilty then Alcidiana imagineth, if I made no scruple of coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let's returne to our ship, and there we will deliberate at leasure in what manner 'tis fit I should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my self for the punishment my disobedience hath deserved. Presently he turned himselfe to sea-ward, but he had not gone twenty paces e're his mind altered, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to attempt on fortune, and to try what should become of him: Alcippus laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him all that he thought most perswasive to divert him from so dangerous a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but all was in vaine, and so was of force to follow him. After they had left the sea coast and traversed a plaine, watered with many sweet rivers, beautified with faire

houses, and encompassed with a wood of very high trees, into part of which they entred, because their way ingaged them; they had not gone farre in when they stopped, at the sound of a flute and bagpipe: Polexander imagining whence the musicke came, went out of the largr way, and striking into a path fast by among the trees, came to a crosse way, invironed with five or six little cottages; there they saw two shepheards seated at the foot of a tree, playing on the instruments our Heroe had heard, and ten or twelve young children dancing before them, who made him see by their rurall habits, but faire ones, that their fathers were not reduced to the necessity of the European Shepheards. Polexander ravished with this adventure, would have addressed himselfe to the Pipers, but the poore men affrighted in seeing him, fled with the children; our Heroe followed to the cottage whereto they retired, and had made such an out-cry, that five or six other shepheards well clad, and armed with staves like our halfe pikes, from severall places came resolutely towards him: Hee spoke much to them, but imagining they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him not, he tooke a little diamond (which by chance he had on his finger) and offering it to them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

They took the ring, and after they had well gazed on it, imbraced Polexander one after another, and shewing him many civill respects, invited him into their cottage: thither he went, where he beheld two women, whose naturalnesse that had nothing of what was silly, and beautie without art, might have made them taken for some of those famous shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardesses of the ancient Arcadia; there wanted nothing to his satisfaction, but to make himselfe understood, but that being not then possible, he thought best to talke to them by signes. In lesse then two houres he made them conceive what he desired, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating he would willingly change his habit for some of theirs, they went and fetched him one made of fine linnen and shining as silke. The women likewise brought him hats, and buskins, so neatly made, that Polexander imagined he should be too finely dressed in those clothes: notwithstanding he tooke that which was fittest for him, and gave the other to Diceus. Never was he better pleased then when he had hung a scrip (made of a Hynde spotted Fawnes skin) in the place of his sword; and taken in his hand a sheep-booke, whose knots and carvings would yeeld matter for a long descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a man that had more leasure then I have. He looked on himselfe as on another Paris, going to be Judge of all that was fairest in Heaven or Earth; presently he sent back Alcippus with a command to attend him eight dayes in the roade, and keep his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise secret: Alcippus obeyed without reply, and Polexander leaving his rich apparell' with the shepheards who had given him of theirs, made them understand by his signes that he would goe to their Princesse castle. Whether the shepheards conceived what our Heroe meant, or apprehended him not, once they staid him, and by their woefull countenances and joyned hands, seemed to have him know there was an extreame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in approaching that castle: hee gave not the interpretation he should to the shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards signes, but knew it afterwards when it was too late. Having then sent away Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus and taken leave of his hostes, he took the way to the castle, and growing merrie with Diceus about their pleasant incounter, had not walked an houre but he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a musket shot of that fatall castle: he descending a little hill, and crossing a meadow bordered on both hands with willowes and poplars, he came before a great plaine invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with very high railes, and beyond them with a file of blacke men chain'd to one another, and all arm'd with bowes and arrowes. As farre off as those Archers had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scry'd Polexander and Diceus, they gave a shout, and presently sent them a flight of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, from which they could not so well shelter themselves but some met with them; Polexander unwilling to be taken for any other then he seemed, fell on the ground, and expected when those fettered devils would be somewhat pacified. Not one of them left his station, but ten or twelve men lesse blacke then the guard, coming out of some tents that stood in one corner of the place, ran to our two adventurers; one among them taking our Heroe and his man for the shepheards of that Countrey, ask'd, why they had dar'd to violate what their Queen had forbidden: Polexander hearing Spanish spoken so far from Spain, answered in the same tongue, that they were two strangers, by a storme driven on that Island, and bearing it was commanded by a Queen, whose like the world afforded not, we much desired to doe her our obeysance, before wee betooke our selves

selves to sea againe. The Castilian replying with their naturall haughtinesse, If (said he) thou be not so happy as to have had thy birth on this famous Earth which produceth none but invincible men, be assured thy curiositie will cost thee thy life. Polexander smil'd at the threats of this new Rodomant, and answered thus, It is a hard thing for me to tell you the place of my birth, but I can well assure you I have nought of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard in me. Ah wretch! (cri'd the Castilian) what sinne hath brought thee to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Yet speake, and without dissembling thy thoughts, tell me if thou hast never lov'd. I wonder (repli'd Polexander) how a Spaniard can aske me that question; answer to it your selfe, since 'tis the beliefe of all Spaine, that 'tis harder to live without loving, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> to live without breathing. The Castilian in lieu of continuing the discourse, turned to those that came with him, and commanded them to performe their charge; thereupon they straight fell on Polexander, who would not defend himselfe, and put on his legges and armes such chaines, as almost tooke from him the use of either. Diceus was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted accordingly, and with his Master led to the palace: there they were shut up in a vaulted chamber, and had leasure enough to reflect on so diversified an accident. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, after a long meditation breaking his silence; Was not I (said he) sufficiently accustomed to the malice of that ill Spirit which prosecutes me, to mistrust his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and imagine he would use me with as little favour in this occasion as in others? as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly (quoth he, turning to Diceus) my desires have made me of a too easie beliefe. I am not in Alcidiana's Isle, and plainly see, that what I tooke for a haven is a treacherous roske, on which all my hopes are suffering their last shipwracke. Whilst he ended thus, the prison dore was opened, and many Souldiers, who by their lookes and words, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed their barbarisme, confusedly entred, and plucking Polexander with a brutish fury, commanded him to follow them. He obeyed, with the patience of a man truely cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and after he had crossed many great courts, mounted by a winding staire, which was a master-piece in Architecture, into a hall, that might be said, the most that art could doe. It was of an extraordinary breadth and height, and had light by great overtures which were contrived betweene many rankes of Pillars: the vault was of great stones, naturally blue, and speckled with stars so glittering, that they seem'd of perfect gold. Polexander tooke no great heed to those rarities, but had his eyes fixed on a troupe of Ladies which stood round about an empty throne; assoone as he was seene there arose a little murmure amongst them, and a while after, a woman of some forty five yeares old ascended the throne: she was so loaden with diamonds and pearles, that 'twas well seen she would borrow from her dressings that Majestie which nature had deni'd her. In effect, she might have been taken rather for an Eunuch clad like a woman then a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man indeed; her haire was red, her colour swart, her height excessive, and her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance so ill, that had she not been lamentable meager as she was, yet had she been the very true image of horrour. When she was set, and her Ladies, with that blinde and servile obsequiousnesse, which thinkes of nothing but custome and interest, had wirnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their feare and worship, she call'd for Polexander to come neerer, and ask'd him what he was, whence he came, and why he had taken on the habit of one of that Islands shepheards. To that, Polexander (answering with all the respect, which reason wills us to observe to all persons which carry the particular signes of the Divinitie:) Madam (said he) I am a Prince farre more unfortunate then I esteem'd my selfe two houres since; I seek after that which is impossible for me to finde; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Infallibly (said that incomparable phantasme) turning to her Ladies, see here one of those mad men against whom those lawes are established which I cause so rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to be observ'd. Is it not true (said she to our Heroe) that thou art in love, and callest all such who are not so, monsters; whom nature hath produc'd in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as she hath done nights, winters and diseases: confesse thy fault boldly, but I much feare, that cowardise which is inseparably with these esseminate youths, who lay all their glory in the conquest of I know not what young minion, will keep thee from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it knowne: speake, speake poore witlesse man, and deserre not till torture draw the truth from thee.

and charming countenance, wherewithall he was wont to reigne over the freedome of men, and even give a feeling to insensibilitie it selfe: Your Majestie (said hee to the Queene) may give me leave (if you please) to leave off my observance, for the defence of an innocent whom calumnie hath made despicable; If you beleeve (Madam) that love is a monster, you beleeve withall that youth is the greatest defect of life, and the Sunne should be accounted a prodigy. The Queene suddenly turning her eyes into two comets as red as her haire, threatned Polexander with a terrible death, and without any more hearing him, commanded he should be delivered into the hands of the hangmen. Before Polexander would be inforc'd to be withdrawn from that Megera, Madam (said he) 'tis not the custome of those who govern discreetly to condemn any that is accused till the cause be known; Your Majestie beleeves me guilty in taking on me the defence of love, and I, on the contrary should thinke my self so, if I wayv'd it? Command some Knight of your Court to take armes, that by a just combate hee may either force my life, or make me dishonourably unsay what I have maintained in your Majesties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: such a command will be as equitable as glorious for him. The Spaniard of whom we have spoken, fell presently at the Queenes feet, and transcending all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which make his nation ridiculous; Great Queene (said he) be pleas'd to permit me to be the exterminator of a monster, as feeble as he whose defence hee undertakes: but if your Majestie will please to command hee be strictly guarded till the day of combate, for I reade already in his eyes, that the propositions he made, are but cunning pretexts to save himselfe by a shamefull flight. Polexander, at some other time would have laugh'd at that Gallant's extravagancy, but for divers reasons growing cholericke, he retain'd himselfe onely in his first temper, and told the Spaniard, that if it pleas'd the Queene, there was day enough to decide their difference. The Castilian who was very valiant, tooke Polexander at his word, and would not rise from before the Queen, till he had got leave to fight. At the request of the Ladies it was granted him, for they, having no other malice to love then from the tongue, were very glad to see him triumph over his greatest enemies. Hereupon Polexander was unbound, and delivered into the hands of the Spaniard. The Gallant very insolently made use of his authority, and carried to an excesse of pride which made him forget his owne alloy, he spoke of his combate as if our Heroe had been already reduc'd to beg his life of him: he often told the Prince, that 'twas not his humour to shew them any favour who were so rash as to interchange blowes with him; to which Polexander repli'd, he would intreate any courtesie from him, but that he was resolv'd to make triall of whatsoever the chance of armes had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd for him. When hee came to the Bragadochio's lodgings, hee intreated him the leave of sending to his ship for armour; No, no, repli'd the other in scorne, I have servants here that will furnish you with armes and horse: the Prince thanked him for his profer, and patiently indur'd all his insolencies. Whilst hee was in this decadence, a young man very well clad, came into his chamber, and after divers extraordinary ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities done him in the name of a Lady of the Court, My Mistresse (said he) understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that you had not here either horse or arms, hath taken care to provide you of both, and commanded me to intimate, that for Polexander's sake, she sends them to Love's defender: she beseecheth you to make use of them, and imagine, that going to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the power of Love, you goe to fight for Alcidiana's beautie. Polexander was no lesse surpris'd then ravish'd at these words, and did his utmost to get from the young man his Mistresses name; but the Squire humbly besought him to be ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Go then (said Polexander, putting a faire diamond on his finger) and assure thy Mistresse, I will strive to make my selfe worthy of her Present and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell. The Spaniard grew mad at his enemies faire fortune, and insolently told the Squire, he would advertise the Queen of his Mistresses flippery: You owe her too much respect (repli'd the young man) to doe her that wrong, yet you may doe as you please, and with that tooke his leave of Polexander, not giving any the least reverence to the Spaniard. Our Heroe presently opened the armour was sent him, and found it very faire; the shield was of an extreame well polish'd steele, in the midst whereof was painted a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which being repuls'd and stopp'd by a Damme, foam'd with rage, and shocking on it impetously, seem'd to shake the very foundations: The word was, [I will overcome.]

Then he went to see his horse, and finding him such as was promised, commanded Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens to put on his armour. In the meane time the Spaniard calling for the armes he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to use, made shew of a great deale of impatiencie till he were all ready; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending with Polexander into the court of the castle, went to his stables, where among a great many horse, he chose one that had no other fault, but his being as proud as his Master. Polexander, all arm'd as he was, would have no help to get on his; Diceus had the honour that day to be his Squire, and carried his Helmet and Lance into the field, and gave him both assoone as the Spaniard was ready for fight. The place could not be better, (for 'twas the same rail'd in with lists where Polexander was first seiz'd on) nor the season more favourable, since the aire was so extraordinary calme; but the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, though it were compos'd of a Queene, of many Princesses, and a great number of Ladies, was not yet such as our Heroe could have desired. Assoone as all that Court were at the windowes which looked into the lists, and the Queene had given the signal, the trumpets advertis'd the Combatants of their devoir; the Spaniard gave spurs to his horse, and made him start and fly on like lightning: Polexander putting on his eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and inveloping himselfe (as I may say) in a cloud of dust rais'd by his horses hoofs, met the Spaniard in the midst of the careere, and with the extreame shock he gave him, bore over horse and man, and made him roule two or three turnes on the ground. There was not a Lady (the Queene excepted) but began to cry out for joy; our Heroe the meane while attended till the Don was got up, who darting fire from his eyes, and blaspheming what was most venerable above, freed him from his horse, and came on with his sword drawne to avenge him on his enemie. Polexander, to take no advantage, alighted, and met him with an intent onely to disarme him; but the Spaniard made him know, he was truely courageous, and knew how to die with honour: for he would never either confesse himselfe vanquish'd, nor aske his life, though the blowes he receiv'd from that thundring arme, (to which no other is to be compared) made him feele sufficiently that he must either humble him selfe or die. Polexander often drew backe to give him time to thinke of his preservation, but perceiving he scorn'd it, thought himselfe not bound to value his life more then its master did; he therefore let drive so furious a blow on his head piece, that cleaving his skull, he laid him dead at his feet. The affrighted Queene seeing the defender of her extravagances so rigorously chastis'd, shot from her eyes as dreadfull flashes as those of comets, and commanded eight or ten Knights which were under the window, to avenge her on her enemy. They were not lesse barbarous then their Princesse, but came all cowardly rushing on Polexander, who so stoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them, that with the three first blowes, hee laid two of them along and dead; a third he made safe enough for fighting, and cast such a terrour among the rest, that had he delighted in bloud, he might have shed what he had listed without any hazard. Hee therefore contented himselfe with the driving those wretches before him, and thrusting them to the utmost list of the field: the Queene at the sight plai'd the mad woman, and ask'd her Ladies who had brought that devill into her-dominion; shee that was next to her, making a low reverence, and humbly beseeching to be heard, If your Majestie (said she) considers nothing but for the present, you may beleeve this stranger came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for no other ends but such as might tend to your disadvantage: but if you cast your thoughts on what hath passed, and may betide, you will confesse that a particular prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from heaven hath sent you this redoubted. Knight to avenge you of the cruell Astramadan's tyrannie, and to extinguish for ever that bloudy tribute hee exacts from your subjects, for the safety of your owne person. Tisiphone (so was the Queene call'd) meditated a while on what the Lady spoke, and confessing to her selfe that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander's preservation was very behovefull for her; shee staid those who were running to the defence of their companions, and with her loud and terrible voyce, commanding them to lay downe their weapons, sent word to Polexander to give over the prosecuting her servants, and come presently before her. Hee obeyed without disputing that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses will, and presented himself all arm'd save his head; she found him more pleasing in his armour then in the habit of a shepheard, and pardoning him the death of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard and her Knights; If (said she) you will obtain the liberty to love, you must avenge me on a Barbarian, who by his brutishnesse hath forc'd me to beleeve, that Love was a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, that was otherwise too much amaz'd then to note the Queenes impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, promised her all she desired, and humbly besought her to hasten as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly she could the occasion in which shee would imploy him; and so tooke leave, and was (by her command) put in posssession of the unfortunate Castilians goods and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; presently he dispatched Diceus to his ship, to bring him thence such necessaries as he wanted, to call for Alcippus, and to give order to his Pilot to disanchor from the rode where he lay, and to ride in that of the palace. In lesse then foure houres all this was done, and Polexander clothing himselfe according to his birth, and the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his fortune, made appeare by a pleasing mixture, state and magnificence inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with sorrow. His earnestnesse to acquit him of the promise to Tisiphone, scarce giving him leave to breathe, he went to her presently after supper; she welcom'd him with as smiling a countenance as she could put on, and looking on him with an attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which seem'd very strange to the Ladies, did a thousand braveries, and ingag'd her selfe so farre in a businesse she knew not, that she strai'd and was lost, without any hope of ever recovering her old way: she retir'd much later then she was wont, and had not her women advertis'd her of it, she had spent the whole night with Polexander. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as she was in bed, she strove to sleep, but she perceiv'd that some (I know not what) strange thoughts, and certaine unknowne desires, spight of her heart kept her eyes waking. At first she began to grow angry with her selfe, and having a spirit as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant as malicious, shee alter'd her minde a hundred times in an houre; went from praises to reproaches, and in a word witnessed, whether in loving or hating too quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that she was neither capable of love or hatred. When shee perceiv'd her thoughts were resolv'd to keep her awake, I will (said she) traitors as you are (which deceive in soothing) hinder you well enough from the prolonging your malice: I am not so farre from the Port, but I can enter againe when I list. Retire then ye too importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate gusts, and hope not my voyage will be long unlesse the faire gale continue. Love, who intended to avenge himselfe on this extravagant woman, would not terrifie her with these beginnings: he gave her the calme she demanded, and rais'd not a tempest, till she had lost all kenning of the haven. She then slept, and the next more awaking with an extreame desire of re-seeing Polexander, she loaded her selfe with so many jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that if our Heroe had been covetous, he would certainly have found her very ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But being not in humour to remarke ought of faire or foule in Tisiphone, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought her againe to send a defiance to her enemie, or be pleas'd himselfe might carry it. Tisiphone forg'd excuses to retaine Polexander neere her, and whether he would or no, oblig'd him to stay seven or eight dayes for the returne of such Heralds as she had sent to challenge her enemie. During which time Polexander abode alone, as long as he could be permitted; and one evening being retir'd into his chamber, Diceus adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd him there was a Lady at the dore who desir'd audience; Let her enter if she please, (said Polexander) and straight way rising, went to receive her with his wonted courtesie. When shee was in place where she might speake unheard of his servants, she tooke a vaile off her face, and approaching the lights, Cast your eyes (said she) Polexander on a person which hath been sometime in your esteeme, to let her know you have not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forgotten her. Our Heroe instantly knowing the Lady both by speech and countenance; Doe not (said he) mine eyes deceive me, or doe not I flatter my selfe with a vaine beliefe, if I take you for Amintha? No, (repli'd the Lady) you are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, I am Amintha: but before I can relate by what chance I came into the service of this Princesse so differing from Alcidiana, I must acquit me of the commission she gave me, and tell you, that after I had been a long time your confident, I at last became hers.

Doe me then the favour (said Polexander) to relate what your fortunes are, and (without losing time) the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of this old woman. Presuppose I know them all already, and thereafter frame your selfe such an answer as you think I would make to your propositions. Truly (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd

Amintha) you shall not scape so easily; you have made the wound, and you must worke a remedie; she spoke those words smiling, but perceiving Polexander tooke no pleasure in it; Know (said she) that Tisiphone is passionately in love with you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to neglect her owne interest for feare of your losse, she deferres as much as she can the combate you are to have with Astramadan: but to instruct you who that Tyrant is, I will relate what hath betided me since I was stolne away. To begin my discourse of it well, it must be by rendring you all acts of gratitude for the obligation in which I am bound to your valour for avenging me on my greatest enemie, in killing Tisiphone's protectour; I cannot tell you on what humour that insolent Spaniard cast his eyes on me, the very day that Alcidiana came to the palace of the sea; but I can say, hee found me so pleasing his fancie, that knowing well he was not like to obtaine me by his merit, he resolv'd to get mee by cunning. To that end, hee came to my lodging like a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and having unfolded all that the luxurie of Spaine hath most voluptuously found out; he told me that he had a whole magazine of such things in his ship, and if I would goe downe to the haven, he would shew me such jewels and rarities as the Queene had not in her closet. I confesse freely to you that my curiositie which is farre more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to me then distrust, made me give credit to that traitor; and besides, I that never had so good an opinion of my beautie as to beleeve my selfe worthy the stealing away, thought the Spaniard (who call'd himselfe a merchant of Lisbone) had no other designe then to sell well his merchandize. I put off that visit till next day, and promised him to come aboord in the morning, before Alcidiana was awake, which I perform'd, accompanied onely with an Esquire and two women. He took me into his shallop, without making shew of any thing that might give me the least suspition; and in a trice getting me into his ship, talked of nothing but of Spanish cut-workes, amber'd skins, Essences, and other the like commodities. But I was no sooner aboord then foure of his servants laid hands on my Squire, and strictly bound him; my selfe and my women were brought into the hinder cabin, and reduc'd to the estate of reclaiming your suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour without hope of obtaining it. Whilst I made these unprofitable acclamations, and rail'd on the Spaniard for his impudence and treacherie, he made me be held by foure of his servants, and answered me not a word till his ship was farre off at sea. But when he had lost sight of Alcidiana's Island, and saw he was not pursued by any of her vessels, he commanded his men to leave me at libertie, and casting himselfe at my feet, Madam (said he) I am none of those infamous pirates which scowre the seas for all mens destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the dishonour of women: An offence of State made me lose the favour of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabell, but with it not the qualitie of a Prince, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be taken from me but with my life, though they deprived mee of all my fortunes due by birth-right. I was forced to abandon Spaine, and seeke my safetie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dangers of the sea. The companions of my better fortunes have been sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in my adverse, and by a generositie, rare in the Courts of Kings, those true friends have stood constant in my miseries, and instead of abiding on the safe shore, when they saw me suffer shipwrack, threw themselves into the danger to witness their unparallel'd affection to me. These are they whom you see in my ship disguis'd like Souldiers and Mariners. I tell you this Madam, to free you from all feare, and fit you to beleeve, that being among men of qualitie, you are to apprehend nothing of violence: the greatest enemie you are to contest with, shall be the head-strong wilfulnesse of my too amorous inclination, it hath sometime made me aspire to the enjoying of a Princesse, which was one day to fill the throne of my King; and love who takes a pleasure (as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune) in seconding all daring enterprises, had rendered all my services so acceptable to her that could reward them, that I was on the point of ravishing from the King of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall all hope of the crowne of Castile. I cannot imagine you to be more rigorous then that Princesse, in denying t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Spaniards insolencie put me into a rage, and casting mine eyes on him more severely then my face and spirit promised, blaming him for his vainenesse so out of all apparance; I said, that at first I tooke him but for a pirate and a ravisher, but by his speech I held him for one most extreamly impudent, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

my deservings: when time shall let you understand how rare those treasures are which my affection hath in store for you, I am most assured you will alter your language, and to preserve me wholly to your selfe, will not permit my returne to Spaine. To these he added many other flourishing bravadoes, but let them be buried with him; it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice me to relate that after I had been neere a moneth so sued to and persecuted, and as much cause to complaine against heaven, and aske Justice thence for the violence I was like to suffer; either it or the sea tooke compassion of my teares, which animated against my ridiculous lover, dash'd his vessell in pieces on this Island: I sav'd my selfe unawares upon some great fardles of corke, which my feare made me lay hold on. He was taken up by fishermen which casually met with him among the rockes where we were shipwrack'd. All the rest were drowned, I was presented to Tisiphone the same day we were cast away, and the morrow after, the Spaniard was led by the fishermen (who had sav'd him) to the worthy husband of that excellent Princesse. When shee heard of the danger I had escaped, she seem'd to have some feeling of it; but when shee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood I had beene stolne away, and would never give consent to my ravishers desires; What (said she, cleane out of her selfe) you doe not love then? Is it possible (I repli'd) for any to love a thiefe and a traitor? You speake not enough (quoth the Queene) you must goe further, and say, It is not possible to love any man whatsoever. My fathers tyrannie hath inforc'd me to marrie the greatest enemie I have in the world; I speake it aloud, for I would have him know that my hatred increaseth daily, and if I meet not at last with some one of my subjects courageous enough to restore mee the libertie I am depriv'd of, I in my just indignation will finde strength enough to regaine it my self. Imagine whether I were terrified or no at the horrour of this first speech: But not knowing to what intent she had made it; I repli'd, that the hatred women might beare to men, could not (without blame) goe so farre as to their husbands. 'Tis to them (said the Queene) it should be most of all; for besides their being the tyrants over our liberties, they are to us continuall executioners, which, whether they flatter or abuse us, keep us night and day in torture, and are never taken by them from one, but to make us suffer a many others. At this second speech I was without an answer, and thinking my selfe not bound to contradict her, I intimated by my silence that I condemn'd her not. The first day I saw not the happy husband of that good Lady, but the next I had the pleasure of it; 'twas a Prince who truely was worthy the love his wife bore him; he was of a very ill looke, and a farre worse humour; he came to the Queen with a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish fullennesse, and presented her my ravisher with a certaine barbarous authoritie, which (not to lie) was capable enough to make me partly of Tisiphone's opinion. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as the Spaniard saw me, he gave an out-cry of admiration, and casting himselfe at the Queenes feet, Madam (said he) if your Majestie will have the honour to surmount that which o'recomes Kings, you have need of no other thing then to restore to mee a treasure which I thought had beene buried in the bottome of the Ocean. Fortune thought I had lost all that I could, but if you render me that Lady, (pointing to me) I make knowne that your Majestie will have inrich'd me with more then that blinde god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse hath depriv'd me of. Tisiphone presently imagining the Spaniard might be very usefull for her abominable designes, resolv'd to winne him, and to begin that divelish trafficke; This stranger is mine (said she) but if you be so venturous a merchant to buy her at my price, you shall have the first offer. The Spaniard answered, that if I were to be purchased by any action of valour, he would ingage himselfe to imploy his arme and sword both against heaven and earth to redeeme me. By that promise their conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ended; but as if I had been borne the object of all extravagancies, Thersites (so was Tisiphone's husband called) fell in love with me, and thinking to witnesse extreamely well to me the greatnesse of his love, he spoke of it to every body, and took for his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate confidents such as were accustomed to serve him in his other passions. Tisiphone knew it assoone as I, and though she was neither capable of love or jealousie, yet was she of rage and vengeance. That made her precipitate her execrable intentions, she plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Spaniard, and neither disclosing to me nor any of her women her secret practises, so manag'd them, that Thersites <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54727:249"/>
his cruell brother, and withall proclaim'd warre against him. The Isle whereof he is Lord is not distant from this above a dayes saile; thither went the Spaniard with a fleete, and had so good fortune by his armes, that but for the incomparable valour of Astramadan, (who came from afar off to the aide of his territorie) he had beene abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute master of. But that hardy Tyrant some three moneths since forc'd him from his Island, and I make no doubt but (to avenge himselfe) he had been already here, if hee could have gotten sufficient ships of war. Newes hath come to Tisiphone of his sending into Europe for vessells, and that assoone as they are arriv'd, he will imbarke his troupes to assaile her: she every day expects that enemie, and hath therefore set so many guards about her palace. But leave we Astramadan, and be pleased I goe on with the historie of Tisiphone; The death of her husband did but augment her aversion to all men, shee forbad on paine of death as well her subjects as strangers to come within three leagues of her palace, and to have alwayes before her eyes such objects as might confirme her in her hatred, and serve as instruments of her horrible cruelties; she sent into Africa for the most deformed and barbarous that could be found amongst the Negros: when they came, she commanded and made them cut the throats of all such as were of any eminent condition in her Court, and taking out of prison those whom her husband had cast there, gave them the title of Knights, and the places of greatest command and trust. That done, the Moores were chain'd, and rank'd about the castle to defend the accesses to it; the Spaniard was preserv'd not out of consideration of the services hee had done the Queene, nor that she thought her selfe bound to keep her word with him, but because she feared the arrivall of Astramadan, or rather that shee reserv'd him for the riddance of that tyrant in the same manner as she had freed her selfe from her husband. Now (since the Spaniard is dead) you are the man she will imploy in so notable an executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if you will hearken to her; or rather, if the affection wherewithall you have mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously stung her, be not as miraculous to reforme the defects of so depraved a nature. After Amintha had related thus much, she stood a while looking on Polexander, and seeing he spoke not, thus went on; Since I have so well described the qualities of your lover, and discovered all that is most excellent in her, I hope I shall have no hard taske to perswade you to love her. Polexander casting forth a sigh from the bottome of his heart, Amintha (said he) you know my estate is too wretched to finde a diversion in Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiphone's extravagancies; I seeke for Alcidiana, I sigh after her, and wish for nothing but the felicitie of her sight, though since your absence she hath proclaimed mee for an offender, and by an irrevocable sentence, wills that I should be sacrificed on the altars of the God of Vengeance. What is't you say (quoth Amintha)? I tell you what is true, repli'd Polexander. Pallantus whom I met in the pirates Island, related to mee the particulars of my sad fortune. Yet Amintha let us returne if it be possible to Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana, and submit my selfe to all that so deare and obliging an enemie can inflict. I wish no lesse then you (repli'd Amintha) the happinesse of reviewing the Queene; but what Angell, or what Starre shall so direct our vessell that it may at last cast anchor in some one port of that inchanted Island? Either Love (said Polexander) will open us the way, or it shall never be discovered. You have often told me that perseverance never yet met with invincible difficulties: I will try whether Amintha can tell a lie, and spend all the remainder of my life in the quest of a happinesse that can never be too dear to me. But I am certaine that should the Island which you call inchanted be so farre, so as to change places every day of the yeare, nay, even to beguile all the art of Navigation, yet should it not be prevalent to hide it selfe from the travels, searches and perseverance of my affection. All that I want is a Guide that can well governe that passion: Be you so deare Amintha, persever to oblige a man that owes you all his happinesse, and be pleas'd that assoone as possible may be, I may with-draw you from a place too infamous, to have the honour of enjoying you. Amintha repli'd, that if his desire were to get from Tisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone, he must force himselfe, and without being so cruell, comply (at least in shew) with the passion of that foolish woman. Our Heroe besought her againe not to laugh at an unfortunate man, but to beleeve heaven was too just to permit Tisiphone to retain that which was destinated for Alcidiana. Hereupon they parted, Amintha went to Tisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone, to whom she gave so many hopes, that the mad woman beleev'd she had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54727:250"/>
enough in store for her whole life. Her joy was interrupted by the return of her He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, who related there were already arrived six ships, men of warre to Astramadan, and he expected yet fifteen or twenty more, with which he intended to invade her. Besides (said one of the Heralds) he hath charg'd us to tell your Majestie, that he will not deale with you as a lawfull enemie, but intends to prosecute you as the murderer of his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and put you to the most dreadfull torture and punishment that can enter into the imagination of his hangmen. As for the stranger Knights defiance, hee laughs at it; and sends word that if within three dayes he come not to him, he will not faile to meet him here with ten thousand men. The Queene was so affrighted with these threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that she was like to forgoe all her love: she sent for Amintha, and opening to her how her affaires stood, said, that to enjoy the company of Polexander longer, she was ingag'd to lose it for a few dayes: But (said she) since I have made a vow never to trust to any ones promise, I will not suffer Polexander to goe hence, till I have good caution for his returne: I will therefore keep you here, his servants, and his ship, for I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he cannot get from me whilst I have you in custody; he may saile to Astramadan in my gally, and for feare that tyrant may worke some treacherie against him, I will send along five hundred of my guard. But Madam (repli'd Amintha) you shew but little love to the Knight in hazarding him thus. What shall I doe (said Tisiphone) with any appearance of humanitie? I know well I thrust Polexander into danger, in sending him so weakly accompanied. The onely remedie I finde for this inconvenience is to breake off his voyage, and should I doe so, I draw on me all the forces of Astramadan. Let him therefore set saile assoone as may be, for I desire to have my minde at rest whatsoever betide me. Amintha went instantly to let our Heroe know those two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of the Queene, and seeing him displeas'd at them; Never trouble your selfe (said she) for any thing, but how you may vanquish the cruell Astramadan: all the rest will be facile enough, yet I extreamely feare that tyrants perfidiousnesse; so doe I (said Polexander) the malice of Tisiphone. This discourse ended, they went both to the Queene, when Polexander instantly told her, he onely staid for a command to meete her enemie. Goe then presently, quoth the painted Megera: but remember brave Knight that my life depends onely on your valour, and your voiage must bring forth all that ever I shall enjoy of blisse or extreame misfortune. Polexander tooke leave of the woman with a resolution never to see her againe, and so went straight to imbarke himselfe with his Moores. He made his passage in fifteene houres, and at sun-set was within ken of the high towers which were built for the defence of Astramadan's port. Diceus, who alone of all our Heroe's servants had the libertie to accompany him, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his master to give leave that he might land with five or six Moores, and goe to Astramadan to sounder his intentions, and know in what manner he would entertaine him. Polexander who thought farre lesse on the combate he was about then on that he still waged with his discontent, yeelded to Diceus urgent supplication; and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the challenge he had written before he departed from the palace of Tisiphone, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to stay as short a time as hee could with Astramadan. This trusty servant landed with six Moores, and came quickly towards the place he was sent. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as he arriv'd at the port, he was staid, and when they understood whence he came, was receiv'd very civilly and brought to the Prince. Hee put one knee to the ground, when he saw the Majestie of him who had been describ'd for one most barbarous, and without shewing either feare or rashnesse, I belong (said he) to a Prince whose fame (may be) hath attain'd your eares; the hazards of the sea casting him on Tisiphone's Island, and finding her under the terrour of your armes, he thought himselfe oblig'd to undertake her defence. But to speake nothing from my selfe, See (said he, presenting his master's challenge) the reasons which have brought Polexander to fight with you in your owne territories; and neglect all considerations which might deterre him (if I may say so) from putting himselfe alone into the hands of a great many enemies. Astra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madan answered not Diceus a word, but taking Polexander's challenge, he read it with a looke that well witnessed his choler, and after made the messenger this answer. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your master, and tell him I will make him know that he beleeves nought of Astramadan but what is true: the cause he gives me to be his enemie, shall not hinder
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:54727:250"/>
me from allowing him that entertainment his vertue deserves. To morrow I will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him in the place I have prepared for the giving that satisfaction he desires. The onely thing I have to complaine of him, is, the facilitie wherewithall he hath beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to defend such crimes as cannot be expiated but by everlasting punishments. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus returned with that answer, and watch'd all night to put in order his masters equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page. At day-breake that Prince awoke after many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>bers interrupted with dreams and strange visions, and called for such armes as sufficiently witnessed the sad condition of his fortune. They were of an ashy colour, and there seene in many places sparkles which sparting from under the ashes, seem'd to intimate, that they nourished a fire which had no other aliment. Hic shield was of temper'd steele, which perfectly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented that blackish colour which is seen in an extreame deep water. In the midst was painted a Granado casting out fire on all parts, and these words graven round about it; [Nothing can quench it.] His horse's harnesse was of ash-colour'd velvet, one half of his plume was of the same hue, and the other like fire. Thus he came into the haven, and assoone as his horse was landed, he mounted and rid to the place for combate. He was but a while there when Astramadan came; That Prince clad in armour as polish'd as the best crystall glasse, made the sun-beames so extreamely reflect, that those which were about him scarce durst hold open their eyes. At the sound of the trumpets the two combatants parted from one another; but their meeting againe was farre otherwise: for Polexander received onely a fleight touch, but his enemie was incountered with so much vigour, that he was faine to catch hold on his horses mane, or else he had been born over his horses crupper. Our Heroe wondered to meete with so little addresse and strength in a personage which had been esteem'd almost invincible, but the sequell of the combate made him beleeve that Astramadan had put one of his Knights in his place. On that thought, he scorn'd to prosecute his victorie, and though the other came up to him very resolutely, he would not almost take the paines to fight; yet at last to put himselfe out of trouble, and to learne whereto tended so little advantageous a super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, bore his sword to the face of that weake enemie, and of two good eyes making but one not worth a straw, tumbled him dead betweene his horses feet. Presently hee cast his eyes towards a place fill'd full with people, as if they had been there either as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the death or cunning of Astramadan; but in the same time a new Knight en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the lists, and calling to our Heroe to take heed to himselfe, threw away his sword, and came on him with his battle-axe. Polexander thought then that Astramadan had neither resolv'd to keep his word with him, nor by the halfe to make him sensible of his perfidiousnesse; yet could hee not conceive what his reason was to assaile him but with a single man at a time: but wanting time to ruminate on so giddy an infidelitie, he went to incounter that second enemie, and in lesse then nothing made him keepe companie with him that had begun the combate. After that second came forth a third, then another, after a fifth, and to him two more, who incomparably more valiant then their companions, held Polexander play above two houres, and press'd him so neere, that if that Demon of valour had not been produc'd to surmount all others; wee must surely beleeve that Astramadan had carried away the victorie without fighting. But when the tyrant saw his seventh champion laid along, he came into the lists, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding new lances to be brought Polexander, came to him on the gallop; Knight (said he at their meeting) I alwayes thought that a great Prince should never undertake any thing unworthy his courage and honour: I have therefore alwayes us'd to make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (by some of my Knights) of those with whom I was to incounter. Both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Morocco have passed this law; the Prince of Zanhara surnamed the Invincible, hath voluntarily submitted to it, and many others whom I will not name have return'd hence with dishonour, for not observing so reasonable a custome. Of all those Princes, two onely have been thought worthy to be chastis'd by my arme; thou art the third, and I confesse thy valour makes me jealous: and I beleeve that when I have overcome thee, it will not be the least act of my life. Polexander who found this manner of fighting very handsome, could not chuse but smile at it, but his disquiets quickly put him out of that humour; If (said he to Astramadan) the Knights of other Countreys had the invention to put their enemies to the like triall whereto thou puttest thine, there would
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54727:251"/>
many a one have falne in combating, which might else have gone away victorious. When I shall travell (repli'd Astramadan) into strange countreys to defie such Princes as command there, I will make no difficulty to accommodate my self to their customes. Nor doe I (said Polexander) make any scruple in putting thine in practise, but 'tis fit I should know them before I be obliged to their observance: neverthelesse let us make an end of that which thy Knights have begun, and let not the inequality which is now betweene us be the cause of thy ingaging mee to new trialls. With that Polexander turn'd from him, and went to chuse the strongest he could finde amongst a great many lances. Astramadan tooke an extraordinary great one, and came against his enemie with an incredible furie. Polexander recollected all his strength, and carried with a just desire of vengeance, ran against his enemie with all the swiftnesse his horse had left him. The lances flew into shivers, Astramadan's pierc'd his adversaries shield; But our Heroe ran through both his enemies shield and cuirats, and gave him a great wound on the left side, from whence the tyrant lost a great deale of bloud, but his rage being farre more then his paine, he drew his sword, and with it charg'd Polexander with such horrible blowes, that at first all he could doe was either to ward or avoid them. At last he reveng'd himselfe, and made his Antagonist feele, he could as vigorously make use of his sword as of his lance. Hee made his cuirates fly in a thousand pieces, and with a back-blow (which is not almost imaginable) he not onely parted his helmet but cleft his head in two. The tyrant's death ended not the combate, for though Polexander were cover'd with wounds and had scarce force to uphold himselfe, yet he was constrain'd to renew his forces. A woman (all dischevel'd) entered the lists with a sword in her hand, and inciting every one to fall on our Heroe; Can you indure (my friends, cry'd she) that the inhumane Tisiphone's Protector, shall returne to her with your and my Lord's head? But should you prove so cowardly as not to dare revenge him, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull as to forget the benefits you have receiv'd, I alone fill'd with a just resentment, will on, and inforce from him the soule of this murderer. Those words were so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that all they about the barriers which had weapons flew on Polexander, and not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for death forc'd him at last to yeeld to their number. Diceus gave then a great proofe of his wonted fidelitie: he fought till he was so wounded, that he came and fell for dead at his masters feet. The multitude was not contented with that revenge, but being on a further prosecution, saw themselves assail'd by divers troupes which came from the sea-side, which flew with fire and sword through all the streetes of the city. Those that abode in the field were slaine, and the rest which had retir'd themselves into some advantageous places, after a little resistance ran the same fortune. The ships in the haven were burnt, and the towne almost wholly on a fire: the flame for the whole night made a new day, the better to discover the run-awayes to the cruell prosecution of the vanquisher. This succour a little too late for Polexander, was conducted by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphone her selfe: Love causing in that Furie, what crueltie had done in other times. She put to sea presently after Polexander, and with such forces as she had ready, followed him, either to make use of his victorie if he overcame, or not to over-live him if hee were slaine. She landed from her ship by the light of the burning towne, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing how great a massacre her men had made on those of Astramadan; she call'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her some Inhabitants of the Island, which had escap'd the Souldiers furie, and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion'd what was become of their Prince and the Knight who fought with him. They answered, that Polexander after he had slaine seven Knights belonging to Astramadan, and their master to boote, had been assaulted by that Prince's guard, and slaine after an incredible resistance. No sooner did Tisiphone heare this newes, but she caus'd those poor innocents to be taken, and their throats cut before her: that cruell execution satisfied not her fury; she hasten'd to the place of combate, and commanded her Souldiers to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect neither sex nor age, Palace nor Temple. Whilst those barbarous people with a great deale of pleasure executed so horrible a command, Tisiphone sought every where for our Heroe, but he was not there where she thought to have found him. Some little while after Diceus was falne (as dead) at his masters feet, he came to himselfe, and though he were exceedingly wounded, his affection yet gave him, if not strength enough, at least courage sufficient to surmount his misfortune, and indeavour to serve the King
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54727:251"/>
his master. Hee at first sight knew him by his armes, and plucking him out from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bodies which in dying were falne on him, did all his art had learn'd him, to see if there were any life left in him; for Polexander throwing forth weake fighes, and now and then groaning, made him conjecture he was yet in case to be assisted. Presently hee tooke on the very place some of the earth, mollified by the quantity of bloud which had been there shed, and clapp'd it on his masters wounds. After he saw hee was come to himselfe, Sir (said he) 'tis not enough that you live, but (if possible it may be) wee must worke so that your enemies know not of it: trie therefore to get hence, whilst the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, the night and distraction, gives you some meanes to escape. Polexander (who knew no more then Diceus of Tisiphone's arrivall) thought there was no other fit means for his safety then what Diceus had propounded: To make use of it, he quitted the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his armour, and covering himselfe with certaine skinnes which hee found on some of those he had slaine, (with a great deale of paine) followed Diceus. At every foote, he ask'd who had set Astramadan's city on fire: Diceus (who thought on nothing but how to save his master) answer'd he knew not; and so slincking from the light as much as he could, passed through divers companies of men without any the least stay. At last he got out of the inflamed towne, but taking a way cleane contrary to that of the haven, he led Polexander two or three houres through narrow pathes that lay betweene two little hills. The losse of bloud constrained the Prince through weaknesse to lay him downe, and he had infallibly falne againe into another swoune, if Diceus had not given him some graines of an exceeding cordiall composition. That faithfull servant thinking his master could bee in no safety whilst hee was in the power of those traitors that had so unworthily wrong'd him, went along the shore to see whether he were farre from the haven. He had not gone above fifty paces but he met with a pretty broad Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which rolling downe head-long from the top of the hill into the sea, stopp'd his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther passage. This obstacle would have almost made him desperate, but that he instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly spi'd (through the darke) a little boat made fast neere the banke of the torrent; into it he went, and finding there five or six oares, thought it not best to neglect a conveniency which was (as it were) miraculously offered him. Backe therefore went he to Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and intimating to him that extreame misfortunes aske the like remedies: Your good hap (said he) should it bring you from hence to the Canaries in a simple boate, will have wrought no greater miracle then it hath done in preserving your life, after the receiving so many wounds, and among so many enemies. Never then deliberate, (I beseech you) and betide what may, give not to the most perfidious of men, time to perfect their revenge. Polexander arising with a great deale of paine, Come (said he to Diceus) let's goe since thou wilt have it so, and bestow on the sea that body which thou deniest the earth. Without any more words he went on, and having no other armes then his sword, came to the rivers side, where entering the boat (by the help of his trusty servant) and cutting the rope that fastned it, the impetuousnesse of the streame bore him farre off into the sea with an extreame swiftnesse. At the same time, Tis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Being come to the place where the slaughter had beene greatest, she her selfe turn'd and remov'd a great many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and finding not that of, her Protector, began an incredible lamentation. In the meane while, Alcippus, who with a torch in his hand searched more narrowly then shee, came to the place from whence Polexander was newly gone, and knowing his armour, cri'd out, that he was certainly dead. His light fell out of his hands, and lifting them aloft, O Heaven! (cry'd he) jealous of extraordinary vertue, hast thou permitted an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous rout to extinguish by an obscure death the bravest life of the world? With that hee turned to Tisiphone, and presenting her his tasses, and one of Polexanders gantlets, See (said he) all that you shall finde remaining of that Prince whom you have delivered into the hands and to the mercy of these murderers. Tisiph one going out of one furie that had some bounds, to another which had none at all; tooke Polexanders gantlet, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting

it to the dead, as if they had beene in case to heare her, Villaines (cri'd she) who for these many yeares have been the authors of my afflictions, what have you done with Polexander after you had kill'd him? Shall I not have the comfort to injoy him dead, since it was deni'd me living? Seeke (said she, turning to Amintha and Alcippus) seek, ye faithfull servants of that unfortunate Prince, and if ye cannot finde his body, at least finde me his sword. What! you hearken to me, but assist me not, and instead of prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting your search, content your selves with unprofitable teares and lamentations. With that she cast her selfe on the ground, and besmearing her hands and clothes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving many bodies drown'd in their bloud; continued till almost day-break that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible exercise. At last she found out Astramadan, and her hatred (all goary as he was) making her know him, she seem'd to be infinitely joy'd at that incounter: instantly she began extreamly to raile on him, and finding a sword cut off his eares and his nose; and the inraged woman (not to be satiated at halfes) commanded two of her Moores to strip the wretched Prince, and assoone as he was naked, she ran the sword in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his body, and rending his breast, and tearing out his heart, Accursed heart (cri'd shee) how unfortunate am I, that thou art no more capable of suffering. How glad should I be couldest thou revive againe, and become sensible, that thou might'st feele the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of my hatred and torments! but as dead as thou art, I must teare thee in pieces, and taste at least the shadow of that pleasure I had enjoyed in eating thee alive. To it, Tisiphone, glut thy selfe with this accursed heart; avenge thee as much as thou can'st, since thou canst not as much as thou wouldest: and intermingling love, hatred, despaire, revenge and death together, give succeding times a prodigious example what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can doe, when she is as hardy as she is unfortunate. With these words the inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged woman gnaw'd off and swallowed a piece of Astramadan's heart; and whether that dismall morsell choak'd her, or (as 'tis most likely) the excesse of her furie discompos'd all that order of nature which preserves life, so it was that she fell starke dead at Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha's feet, and freed her age of a monster which had made Heaven accus'd of Injustice, had she not been punished by an exemplary chastisement. Amintha, Alcippus, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Polexander servants, being delivered from that womans tyrannie, thought of nothing <unclear>but</unclear> on what they had lost: Dead Polexander was the onely object which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came master of their thought. They invited one another to weepe and bewaile him, and to preserve his memorie for ever among them, made a vow to keepe more charily then their lives, the reliques that were left of him. Amintha tooke the gantlet which Tisiphone let fall in dying, Alcippus his helmet, and distributed the other pieces of his Princes armour to his most affectionate servants: which done, he erected a pillar in the midst of that fatall place, and fastning to it Astramadan's armour, all broken as it was; tooke a great shield which he found all whole on the ground, and writ thereon with bloud these words following:
<q>
                        <hi>Polexander</hi> for the eternall memory of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and <hi>Astramadan's</hi> Treachery, in the midst of this by fire consumed Towne, hath here fix'd his Enemy's Armes which he lost with his life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Trophie being erected, Amintha and Alcippus returned to the port, and imbarking themselves in our Heroe's vessell, thought of nothing more then how to accomplish the vow they had made to eternize the lamentation for his death. But he (in the meane time) laid along in his boate without any more strength then what might suffice him to undergoe his many wounds, was row'd on by the weake armes of Diceus, or rather by fortune, who desirous to belie those who accus'd her of that Prince's death, imploy'd all her endeavours to preserve his life. His boat made mighty quicke way, whilst it was carried by the violent swiftnesse of the torrent; but when that impetuousnesse was lost in the bosome of the Ocean; Diceus perceiv'd he had not strength enough to handle the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54727:252"/>
oares, and imagining straight he had lost his master in striving to save him, did so vively resent it, that the most of his wounds opened againe, and he the second time fell for dead at his masters feet. The Prince beleev'd he was so indeed, and bestowing on him some teares as the last tokens of his affection: Goe Diceus, (said he) goe to thine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall rest; and if Fidelitie as the most necessary vertue, is the most worthily recompenc'd, take thy place among the highest thrones which Eternitie reserves for the truly blessed; I shall soone follow thee, and restore (if I dare hope it from the mercy of Heaven) the prsence of that master whom thou hast alwayes so extreamely loved. After he had spoke thus, he stood some time without losing his sight and yet not seeing any thing; but by little and little growing weaker, it seem'd to him as if a thicke cloud tooke all light from him. Then indeed 'twas he thought he should die, and that the judgements of heaven laying before him the vanities of his youth, as so many causes of his condemnation, and the ill imployments in which he had exercised his life; hee fell to his oraizons. After which he left all knowledge, and lay a long while be twixt dead and alive. In which time his boat carried by the waves out of sight of the desolate Island, floated almost two dayes at the will of the the winde, which having no lesse care of him then it would for a nest of Halcions, brought them happily to an Isle, where Polexander and Diceus reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered againe that life which they had more then halfe lost. Truly that succour betided them, whence with reason they could not expect any, and heaven permits it, to teach us, that sooner or later a good action shall have a due recompence. In the very place where Polexander's boat arriv'd, there lay a ship at anchor which had been but ill hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the late tempests; the masts were broken, the rudder torne off, and the body. open in many places: at sight of our Heroe's boat, a great many men very fantastically clad came on the hatches, and some of them getting into a little skiffe, came close to it. They no sooner saw Polexander, and Diceus stretched out, as dead, but their commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made them resolve, either to relieve them if they were alive, or if not, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the last dues on their corps. One lay downe close by our Heroe, and lifting up his head, did not onely wash his face with the sea-water, but holding his mouth close to the Princes, perceiv'd he had yet a little breathing. If his joy w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e great, his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was a great deale more, for instantly he gave him of a drug whose vertue was so powerfull and speedy, that he no sooner (almost) had it in his mouth, but his weak sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses regain'd part of their ordinary vigour. Diceus had no need of that remedy, for his owne strength o'recame his long swouning, and as he was talking, and about to aske the King his master, if he were yet alive, he prevented him; and speaking (without opening his eyes) Is it thy voyce I heare Diceus? (said he weakly) tell me; and come neerer to thy Polexander, who as well as thee, is now no more then a shadow, wandering for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences in eternall obscuritie. Polexander's voyce so astonish'd the man who so charitably assisisted him, that he gave a great exclamation, and divers times repeared the name of Polexander. When he had done, he arose, and earnestly gazing on our Heroe, began to cry out louder then before, and with gestures which shewed the extremitie of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, Come (said he, to his companions) and see, this is certainly Polexander. O what a happy shipwracke have we made! since it hath cast us on a place where we meet with him whom we had vainly sought for in all the world else. But what said I? ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther O infortunate incounter, since we finde this great Prince in so different a state from that wherein our master the Ynca imagin'd wee should see him! Polexander was too weake to reply, and Diceus too languishing to understand them well; they opened their eyes together, but 'twas rather to take their leaves of light then to enjoy it; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it had been so without the extraordinary assistance of those charitable strangers. For five or six dayes together they watch'd the master and his servant, and treated them with so much affection, that forgetting what they ow'd themselves, they thought not of repairing their ship. In that while, Polexander began to be well strengthen'd, and knew who had sav'd his life: But 'twas not without a great deale of wonder; Is it possible (said he to one of them) that you are Garruca? The same, (repli'd that charitable friend) doubt it not; and to bring you newes from your deare Zelmatida I have thrice crossed the Ocean. Polexander imbrac'd him, and rendering many thankes for the travells he had undergone for his sake; Zelmatida then (said he) hath at last carried away the victory
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54727:253"/>
o're what he so long contested? My Lord (repli'd Garruca) knowing the generousnesse of your soule, and her contempt of the worlds greatnesse, I aske not what victorie you meane: but Zelmatida is fully victorious, and though he be not seated in the throne of the Yncas, and the brutish ambition of Atabaliba threatens him with lasting warre and horrible revolutions; yet I may well say, he is fully a conquerour, since the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vertue of Izatida hath worthily recompenc'd the travels of that incomparable Lover. If thou desirest I should live (said Polexander) my deare Garruca, if thou wouldst (in the midst of my afflictions) make me capable of any contentment, I intreat thee to relate the end of thy masters miseries. Without much trouble (quoth Garruca) I obey, since to expresse a happinesse so long sought for so many years, and for which, so long and so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent miseries have been indured, there needs but two or three words. You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be fully satisfi'd when I have said, the Ynca my master is the Princesse Xaira's hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Manage a little better my joy, said Polexander, and doe not thus precipitate my contentment, but let me receive by little and little a potion that may free me from the sense of all my afflictions. Call to minde the Island where Zelmatida and my self parted, and keepe him not twenty or thirty dayes at sea before hee speakes with Izatida: Say they came to Quasmes with all necessary circumstances, satisfie the desire I have of the parents and daughters knowing each other. And lest thou mai'st ancipitate my imagination, bring me ere I be aware to that happy day, wherein, by the losse of Izatida, I may see the fatall Xaira borne againe. I will, (said Garruca) since 'tis your pleasure and command, to give you satisfaction, repli'd Garruca: but first be pleas'd I give you my Kings letters, and let you know how the good Quasmes resents so many favours vvherewithall you have eternally oblig'd himselfe, his sonne, and his daughter. With that Garruca went to his cabin (by Polexanders leave) and return'd with a little boxe made very artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of foure wonderfull great Emeralds: he open'd and presented it to Polexander, who tooke out eight or ten little plates of gold, which being put one on another, shew'd them divers characters, which signified this that followes.</p>

hard (said he to Garruca) if that persons of so eminent a vertue should have lesse solid contentments then those they now injoy. The Deitie whom they love and seeke with so much fervencie, should not be what he ought to be eternally, if after the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of their constancies by so many adversities they had not been crown'd with all kind of gifts and consolations. Garruca being very glad that this discourse led him out of it selfe to that which was the most important of his Embassy, told Polexander that his Kings seem'd to be ordained by Heaven to drive all Idolatrie out of the new world, and do that by their pietie and good examples, what the Spaniards vainly pretended by their cruellties and tyranny. I shal with a great deal of joy (said Polexander) give satisfaction to Quasmes in what he desires from me, and we will not part, till I have not onely given you instructions, but withall Doctors, that shall attend you into the new world, for the perfection of so pious a worke. Thus ended their converse for that time, and Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida's last adventures were put off to the next conveniency. Two or three dayes passed, during which, our Heroe variously perplext with his adverse fortune, was not capable of any diversion? he besought a hundred times in the day for an end of his miseries; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing himselfe to Heaven, I acknowledge (said hee) I doe too stubbornely persist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will of the infinite Wisdome; I search after a happinesse is forbidden me, and forsake what I am commanded to follow: Change my intention if it be absolutely ill; but 'twill be more easie to exterminate the offender then rout out the crime. After this petition he resign'd himselfe wholly to that Providence which at once he invoak'd to his succour and destruction, and promising an indifferency whereof he was incapable, was a few moments as insensible of that excesse of love he bore to Alcidiana.</p>

Indeed Polexander had no sooner submitted his love to be ruled by reason, but he thought he had committed an offence that merited more torments then he had suffered; and by a sacrilegious vow, disingag'd himselfe from another which he acknowledged most equitable. Hereupon, he threw himself againe into his griefe and impatiencie, and rather wish'd to perish, then to faile of that dutie which hee thought was owing to the incomparable beautie of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana. My voiage (said hee to himselfe) is no more in my owne disposition; hee which drew mee out of the haven, hath shut up the entrance against mee for ever. I must yeeld to my Fate of necessity, and (without feare of stormes or hope of calmes) perfect that voyage which through it I have undertaken. I know, that this fearfulnesse which they call Reason, would faine by its specious consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations rob me of my desire, as well as it hath done of my hope. But her counsell is too weak to be hearkned to; and the pearlesse Alcidiana should not be what she is, if Reason or Fortune could oppose her resolutions. Though Polexander began this Soliloquy with the same temper hee shew'd in his other loose talkings, yet at last hee grew into such a passion, that forgetting his wounds and the place where he was, hee spake so loud, that Garruca and Diceus heard the five or six last words. They both thought he slept, and being troubled with some strange dreame, deem'd it fitting to put him out of that vexation. They came therefore to his bed, but finding him awake, and at quiet, they onely ask'd him of his health. 'Tis too good (reply'd Polexander) for such a wretch as I am, and 'twill be long of you (speaking to Garruea) if it be not farre better. For you cannot relate to me the happinesse of the King your Master, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly our perfect amity makes me resent it, and by consequence brings a great deale of ease and comfort to my paine and sadnesse. Garruca, unwilling to be solicited for a debt which he should already have acquitted: Would to heaven (said he to Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that friendship were able to work the like miracles which are attributed to the imagination! I should then see you freed from some part of your affliction, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearing out your daies in the discovery of an Island that flies from you) you should enjoy Alcidiana, out of the very joy you would conceive in seeing my Lord the Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in possession of his Izatida. But though so great a happinesse cannot be expected from the relation I am to make you, yet I will not desist; but beleeve I have done well, if I cannot make you sensible of any pleasure, I may (at least for some short while) make a diversion, or work in you some insensibility of your misfortunes. After this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble, Garruca, a while meditating on what he had to say, (by the expresse command of Polexander) sate downe, and thus began the recitall of his Master's last adventures. Assoone as Zelmatida was recollected from that griefe your separation had wrought in him, and from that excessive joy, caus'd by Izatida's company and her perfect health; he strove to make his happinesse of a long date, and to obtaine from the Princesse, that she would confirme in private those promises shee had made him in your presence. But she stopt my Master in the very beginning of his speech, and forbidding him with a sweet severity to doubt of her word, Doe not imagine (said she) that to comply with any other, or for any bodies sake else I have yielded to what hath past in the Island we came from. I have done it, Zelmatida, because I saw it was your desire, and thought I was bound to it, because I have found you exceeding discreet and very reasonable. Let time then agitate, and without disquiet and unjust longings, aske not the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what was promis'd you, but when you see those things effected which ought to precede it. I should (reply'd Zelmatida) be capable of that transcendent wisedome, since your example gives me daily new lessons, but whether I have not sufficient appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension to conceive them, or too much weaknesse to put them in practice, I confesse, Izatida, I cannot attaine to that perfection, nor absolutely enough put off man, to see what is most glorious and faire in the world, and yet not desire it. Take heed you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover not your selfe (said Izatida) and speak more of it then you would willingly have me know. If those desires of which you speak are tokens of our love, they are so but as the violent fits of a feaver are signes of life. Cure your affection, (if you will take my counsell) purge it of these irregularities, and be certaine, that when wee cover any thing with so much fervency, we rather love our owne content, then the person from whom we expect it. Those judicious corrections prevail'd so much with my Lord the Ynca, that he presently suppress'd all those secret enemies which his sense arm'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his reason; and so unwound himselfe from what was man, and the matter, that his love became altogether intellectuall; and contented with the delights of apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, desired not any more those of enjoying. Izatida thereby knew how true, and extraordinary an Empire she had acquir'd over a spirit so high and so humble. Shee tooke so great a content in it as sweetned the most bitternesse of her fortune, and said often to her selfe, that shee had been ingratefull, had she not inclin'd to the affection of so respectfull and constant a lover. In these pleasing thoughts they both continued during the voyage, and though many tempests cross'd it, yet, I may say, they enjoy'd a continuall calme. Only our mariners felt the incommodities of the sea, who would have refreshed themselves in the Island of Cuba, and already had left their Southerly course to attaine it, when Zelmatida, to whom all delay was insupportable, made them stick to their old steerage, and whilst they had a favourable winde, crosse those large extents which divide the Islands lately discovered by the Spaniards, from the continent of the new world. The end of this voyage was more irksome and tedious then the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, for we were almost as long againe in passing from the Isle of Haity to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Quasmez, as we had been in sailing from Cape Verd to the Ken of that Island. After a great deale of trouble we entred the fairest port can be found again in either the one or the other sea, and gave thanks to heaven for our happy successe in the voyage. Assoone as Zelmatida was landed, he discri'd a company of Indians, who with bowes and arrowes in their hands, dragg'd very rudely three prisoners, and it seem'd they were bringing them to their execution. He went to meet them, and at first afrighting the troupe with the strangenesse of his habit and armes, he resetled them straight by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their language, and declaring his name and parentage. Those poore people, ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with so good a newes, cast out such a cry, and us'd such actions as were as barbarous as themselves; and one among them, thinking to testifie his affection to the Prince with a club, beat out the braines of the yongest of the three prisoners. Zelmatida re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him for his inhumanity; but with that sweetnesse which should be used in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54727:255"/>
correcting those that offend through ignorance; and ask'd the rest where they had taken those slaves. Cacique, (said the eldest) look on them well, and thou wilt know who they are. They have left Montezuma's Army, who makes warre with thy father, and are come hither to learne the passages of our Mountaines, for the utter ruine of thy Estate. My Lord the Y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>a understanding this, was desirous to know more, and to that end took the Mexicans (with the consent of those that had taken them) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently brought them to Izatida. See here (said he) Montezuma's Spies, which have been taken by your fathers Subjects. Izatida was glad of this encounter, and to satisfie her curiosity, ask'd them the state of affaires in Mexico. One of these Spies casting himselfe at the Princesse feet, If (said he) my memory and mine eies deceive me not, you are the fatall Virgin whom Montezuma hath lost; and whose losse (if our Prophets speak true) will be seconded by that of all Mexico. But why call I in doubt so true a verity? Certainly you are Izatida. The Princesse questioning who he was and where he had seen her, the prisoner repli'd, He was a Mexican, of an illustrious family, called Belizco, and had borne armes in all Montezuma's warres, either against Quasmez, the Kings of Tlaxcallan, of Panuco, or other neighbouring nations. For her selfe, he had had the honour to see her often in the Court of Mexico. Izatida, taking him at that word, intreated to know what Montezuma and Hismelita had done since her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and whether any of them which were imploy'd for her destruction, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to Mexico. I shall not (said Telizco) informe you of all you would know; but I can say, that the King and Queen beleeve you are certainly dead, and that beliefe hath griev'd and so much afflicted them, that if their Priests had not staid their fury, they by some horrid death would have prevented those miseries wherewithall your losse threatned them. Montezuma who is farre lesse violent then the Queen his wife, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeves far more in the providence of his gods, dispos'd himself by little and little to what their irrevocable destiny had resolv'd, should become of him. He fear'd the thunder was to fall on his head, but he left not to lift up his eies, nor to respect the place from whence it was to come. Hee spent almost his whole daies and nights in the Temples, and as often as I had the honour to waite on him there, I noted, how (after his sacrifices) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing himselfe to the chiefest of the Deities, he spake thus: Thine eies which pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate even to the heart, have seen with what an intention I took out of the armes of my brother Quasmez, the onely fruit of his marriage, and the sweet consolation of his old yeares. Thy Prophets have told me many a time, that the safety of my people and mine owne should be secured, when I made the son of a Virgin reigne with me, which should be the delight and hope of Quasmez. I therefore took away his daughter, and did it to conforme my selfe to thy behest. If I have offended in it, thou art the Author of my crime. Justifie me then my Deity, before all my subjects; testifie that I am not guiltie of those teares which Izatida hath shed, nor of that cruell death which Hismelita's wicked Counsellours have made her suffer. Hismelita (said he) had thoughts farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from these, she beleev'd that in bearing down the Images of her Gods, she should overthrow their power; and going further, she perswaded her selfe that she should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the miseries she feared, in proclaiming abroad there were no Gods at all. Whilst she strove to beguile her subjects by her impieties, she attempted all kind of meanes to hinder the effecting of her Prophets predictions: she put to death all such as by birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right or love of the Mexicans might ascend the throne; she kept foure or five great. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on foot, to the end, that by busying the Kings her neighbours in defence of their owne countries, they might neither have will nor power to fall on Mexico. But for as much as she saw amongst all those Kings none so much to be feared as the King your father, she hath turned her principall forces against him; and whilst her husband playes the Priest and the woman, she acts the Generall of the Army, and leads her owne troupes. Twice already hath she cometo handy-stroakes with Quasmes, and made a vow at her entrance into his kingdome, never to lay downe her armes till she had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd it. This is a part of what you would know; for that which concernes my self, your subjects have told you the truth. I came with a hundred of my companions to discover the passages of the mountaines, and see if possibly I could slip in some troupes there: last night we were descri'd, and taken in the traps laid for us by the inhabitants
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54727:256"/>
of the mountaines. My companions are slaine, and so had my brother and my selfe, if the generous Zelmatida had not taken us out of the hands of our enemies. Izatida, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and not able to doe them hurt that had an intention to doe it her, intreated Zelmatida to give the two Mexicans their lives, which obtaining, she sent them to be refresh'd and resetled amongst our servants and mariners. Zelmatida in the meane while accepting the glorious occasion that Hismalita's warre presented to his courage, as a new gratification from fortune, intreated Izatida to crosse the mountaines, and undergoe the incommodities of a way which would bring her into the armes of the King her father, You may imagine whether she tooke time to resolve on that jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; certainly if they would have been rul'd by her, they had presently quit the ship; but her safetie was too deare to Zelmatida, to be put in hazard among so many enemies as were ranging in the countrey: he intended therfore to march somewhat strong for the avoiding of mishaps, and therefore landed with the most of his servants. Some twelve or fifteene of them he sent about the villages at hand to make knowne his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and gathered as much force as they could. Every one with a great deale of joy made ready for the journey; M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>care master promis'd to himselfe to doe so many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous actions, as should blot out the memorie of his predecessours; and all wee that were with him, wished for nothing else then to be at blowes with our enemies. Wee had yet left us eight of those horses you gave my master, and we were all so well arm'd, that each of us might without rashnesse undertake a hundred Mexicans. I caus'd our horses to be landed, to refresh and easethem after their ill usage at sea, and make them able within a few dayes to doe us service. Zelmatida in the meane while courteously welcom'd such as at the first newes of his returne quitted their abodes to come to him; and indeed the love which all those poore savages bore him was so great, that the very women followed their husbands to the wars, and the most decrepit old men would not be dispensed withall. In lesse then fifteene dayes the Prince had seven or eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, so resolv'd to fight, as if every particular man had taken armes for his owne interest. He did with these new souldiers, what he had in former time done with the Mexicans: he taught them to keep their rankes to fight, and to relieve one another; and having made them capable of discipline sufficiently reasonable for them, he intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Izatida to begin her journey. Some two hundred of the youngest amongst his Souldiers he selected, and giving the charge of them to Bereamis, who was very well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; mounted, sent them before to accommodate the worst wayes, take notice of the fittest places for lodging, and serve for Avant-Courieers to the armie. At breake of day Bereamis set on; my Lord the Ynca commanded me to march five or six houres after, and himselfe followed me far enough off, to accompanie the Princesse, Mexiqua, which he caus'd to be carried in covered chaires. The first dayes journey was not long; Zelmatida was contented, he was entred the mountaines, and made seen when it came to bed-time, how ingenious lovers are, when there is question of accommodating their Mistresses. He had privately made many little cabbins of wood, which with a great deale of facilitie being to be set up and taken downe might be as easily carried. That which was appointed for Izatida, was pight in a place as pleasant as the sharpnesse of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines would permit it: the out-side was weather-proof against the most boisterous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of that climate, and within so rich and well furnished, that the chamber wherein Bajazet and Zelmatida first saw one another, was but a foile to it. We march'd neere ten dayes along fearfull precipices, though we had to go not above twelve or fifteene of your leagues: At last we came out of those frightfull solitudes, and descride at foot of the mountaines two armies, which joyning at the very time we were in sight of them, made us conjecture they had expected us to have some judge or witnesse of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Zelmatida after he had caus'd the Princesses chamber to be set up, left me (with a thousand men) for her guard; and told me at his departure, that his good or ill fortune depended not on what he was going about, but in that treasure which he intrusted to my courage and affection. Your enemies (I repli'd) will not be so hardy to set on us in places so advantageous on our side; but if by chance they undertake it, assure your self we will perish all, one after another ere they come any thing neere the Princesse. Zel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matida, thereupon mounted on that brave courser (Alzan) which you gave him in the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54727:256"/>
Isle of Teneriffe, and all cover'd with his guilt armour, descended with his troupes from the top of the mountaine into those large plaines which the combatants had chosen where to fight their battle. There was (at his coming) such a generall affright to see him in that equipage, that he was taken for some strange monster by both the armies; but his servants making the name of Zelmatida to resound againe through all the vale, so inspir'd with courage Quasmes troupes, and so absolutely quail'd it in Hismelita's that the one halfe of them fled, and the other let themselves passe the edge of the sword, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to abandon and leave their Queen to the mercy of her enemies. Our souldiers at last inclos'd her, and more then a thousand arrowes aim'd at her, were about to avenge as many innocents which she had oppressed, and to punish her for no fewer crimes. When Zelmatida staid that cruell execution, he tooke off his helmet, and addressing himselfe to the chiefe officers of Quasmes armie, My friends (said he) be not carried away by your first thoughts, nor blemish the glory you have lately acquir'd by the death of a woman, and a woman that begs her life of you. This remonstrance wrought some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but not enough to stop the generall furie and hatred; the Ynca (my master) tooke notice of it, and presently thought, that to save Hismelita there was no way, but to make a shew of ill-treating her: Hereupon he caus'd her to be taken by Bereamis, and command him (aloud) to guard her so well, that she might not escape that punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which her wickednesse had deserved. In the meane time, the battle being fully gotten, and of so many thousand Mexicans not one appearing, who was not either dead or a prisoner; Zelmatida thought on Quasmes, and ask'd for him of some Caciques his tributaries; who told him that having been for six moneths together in the armie, in such incommodities as his age could not indure he was falne ficke, and inforc'd to be carried to a palace some two leagues from the camp. Presently the Prince sent away the young Cacique Procoros, to let him know of his victorie and returne; himselfe in the meane while went to Izatida, to be the messenger of his owne good fortune: in few words he made knowne that dayes successe, and when he related to her the lamentable condition of Hismelita, he perceiv'd that sweet natur'd Princesse to shed teares, and could not without griefe heare the miserie of her enemie. Zelmatida seeing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment, commanded me to take care of the unfortunate woman, and to treat her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatnesse of her condition: I confesse that imployment had not beene very welcome, but that the commands of my Lord the Ynca were alwayes deare unto me. But I was quickly freed from that guard, for the next day receiving order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Hismelita to Quasmes castle; when she was before the King, she perceiv'd Zelma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida and Izatida whom he held by the hands; at which sight, breaking the silence she had hitherto kept, Base cheaters, (cri'd she) traitours, who have abused me with your lying promises; must I then before the end of my dayes feel greater miseries then those your impostures seem'd to threaten me withall? You have resolv'd then that these two plagues so fatall to Mexico, accomplish that cruell destinie for which you brought them into the world? Could neither iron nor poison, nor the furie of man, nor of the elements, deliver me from these subverters of mine Empire? And is my fortune come to that point it ought, that I must live a slave to those tyrants which have pluck'd me from my throne? No, no, fierce and not to be reconciled enemies, unpitifull gods, you shall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph no more o're Hismelita: she defies all your unjust power, she contemnes your thunder, and knowing well, that with the losse of life, we lose the vaine terrour of your names, she will not be so cowardly and base to preserve that which maintaine your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie. Quasmes affrighted at that monster's blasphemie, lifted his eyes and hands to heaven, to turne away the thunder that wicked woman had deserved: Zelmatida ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, intreated her to disbeguile her minde of all such errours, where into her false Prophets had plunged her, and to beleeve that neither Quasmes nor the Princesse had any designe on her estates or her life. Izatida added to those remonstrances her teares and supplications, call'd Hismelita her Lady and mother; and imbracing her, besought her to be consolated and to live. But that eternall Justice which abandons all obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate offenders to furie and despaire, would not have that Queenes impietie remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished: in lieu of being mov'd with the goodnesse of our two lovers, her rage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by it; she thrust Izatida (with all her force) against Quasmes; and (said she) go

thou unluckie maid, goe, and in the armes of thy father injoy my cares and watchings, with all the troubles thy infancie brought on me: with that the desperate woman snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an arrow from one of the guard, stroke her selfe to the heart before any that were by could hinder her. At these words, Polexander interrupting Garruca, You have been so hasty (said he) to be rid of your prisoner, that you have forgotten one of the best peeces of your narration; I meane the first interview of the father and the daughter, and Quas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes joy he tooke in re-seeing Zelmatida after so long an absence. I confesse (repli'd Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruca) I should not deprive you of a contentment which should be infinite, were it equall to that which the good Quasmes resented, to see his so much desired Xaira, and Zelmatida whom he no lesse affected then if he had beene his owne sonne. But my fault is not so great as I imagin'd, for that adventure is too admirably high to be well expressed: your imagination onely must represent it, if you will not lose the principall beauties of it. My relation would blurre it, and I can conceive nothing that might describe to you the joy and astonishment of the father, the gladnesse of the daughter, the rapture of Zelmatida, and the admiration of their subjects: give me leave therefore to speake nothing of it for feare of being too troublesome, and be pleas'd I may abridge my dear Masters adventures. Quasmes, who at the newes of Zelmatida's returne, was falne into many faintings, and seeing him come with his daughter was like to die for joy, could not taste the excesse of his happinesse till many dayes after their arrivall. Hismelita's death troubled him, but his disturbances were accompanied with an extreame consolation, when he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that she had assured him of Izatida's being the same Xaira which she had caus'd to be stolne from him in her cradle: neither had he left any more of those scruples, feares and distrusts which the long losse of his Xaira threw on him, but resenting his happinesse all pure as it was, went to the Temples to give their infinite thankes to the author of it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great number of sacrifices and offerings, he caus'd to be published amongst his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the accomplishment of those Prophesies which had troubled him for so many years; and to make his joy the more absolute, he desir'd to communicate it to her that was the halfe of himselfe. That pious Princesse kept her bed, through a debilitation of all parts of her body, and had not been able to follow Quasmes; he went therefore to her (with his children in his capitall citie) and presenting Izatida to her, was not much troubled to perswade that she was the true Xaira: her bloud, her bowels, and her transports, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd that veritie; and at the very time, the old Prophet Thisnatidez coming in, Doubt not, O Queene, (said he) the Lady whom you see before you is the same whose losse I foretold you, and now confirme her recoverie. Taste in peace those contentments hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven bestowes on you, for a retribution of your good deeds; and recompencing Zelmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da's travels and vertues with a reward worthy himselfe, strive to preserve in your posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie that lawfull authority which the supernaturall favour crown'd you withall. This speech calming all the vertuous Queenes agitations, and confirming Quasmes in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, the businesse was to perfect all things else. The first resolv'd on was to send back Hismelita's body to the King her husband, and in lieu of demanding reparation for the wrongs his Armies had done, to offer him the alliance and friendship of Quasmes, and my Lord the Ynca. Whilst this Embassy was in hand, Zelmatida pressed for the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the marriage; he intreated Quasmes and the Queene, that they would not take from him the quality of a sonne which they had given him from his cradle; and though he acknowledged himselfe unworthy of it, he humbly besought them to ratifie the will of heaven, and yeeld to an alliance which had beene written there already. Thisnatidez came in the interim of these sollicitations, and taking off the sole difficultie on which they stucke; No, no, feare not (said he) you have not recovered your daughter to lose her againe: she shall never be taken from you; and though the Prince to whom heaven hath destinated her, is to reigne in a countrey farre remote from hence; yet 'tis decree'd, that Xaira shall close your eyes; and before you leave this life for a better, make you live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in two Princes, which shall be the wonders of their age, and the last defenders of our dying liberty. These promises accomplished that great worke; Xaira was solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to her loyall Zelmatida, and a little while after, given up to his impatient longings. The very day of his nuptials, six Courriers of Guinaca came ro Quasmes Court, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for Zelmatida, and make knowne to Quasmes the estate of the affaires at Cusco:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54727:257"/>
these messengers meeting with such happinesse as they durst not hope for, assisted at the marriage of their Prince, and with their usuall diligence returned to the King their master. Zelmatida thought on you in the height of his contentments, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me once more to crosse the Ocean, to bring you newes of his happinesse. Thus (Sir) have you all that you would know of me, there remaines nothing else for me to say, but that Time shall never blot out of my Master's memorie, either the favours he hath received from you, or the friendship he hath promised. Polexander, after Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruca had ended his relation, sigh'd often; and then, Thy master (said he) is at last most happie; but I, deare Garruca, am more afflicted then ever, and thinke I should sooner make a way to climbe up into heaven, then finde that which leads to Alcidiana's Island: Yet must I persever, and like our deare Zelmatida, I propose to my selfe no other end but death or victorie. After this discourse, Polexander had many more with Garruca, whereby he was fully informed of divers particulars which that wise favourite had too lightly touched on; afterwards, he instructed him in all such things as the good Quasmes and his children expected from his love and knowledge. When he saw his wounds were halfe well, and that time alone might perfect the rest, he thought it best to returne to the Canaries in Garruca's ship, that he might there give him one, wherein to return to the new world, and put himself in case to attempt againe the enterprise he had so often fail'd in. Garruca understanding his resolution, presently caus'd to be repair'd all that his ship needed, and so set saile assoone as the winde served. Diceus, who was no ill Pilot, judging very neere what courses they were to steere, guided them so luckily, and so well amended the Compasse by which Garruca had beene directed, that the fifth day of their navigation they were in sight of the Canaries. Our Heroe landed in the new Island of Alcidiana, and finding all things there in the same case he had left them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to goe thence assoone as Garruca had taken his leave of him. A few dayes after his arrivall there came newes which alter'd that designe, or at least retarded the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The inhabitants of Gomera and Teneriffe hearing of his returne, gave him notice that Ferdinand and Isabell prepar'd a great armie in Palos de Moquer, and that St. Lucar de Barrameda, to reconquer the Canaries, and wrong the liberties of all those Islands inhabitants. Polexander animated with a just anger against the ambition of those Princes that would not permit libertie to finde any sanctuarie either in the Continent or Islands, made all the Canarians take armes, and having not ships enough to incounter the Spaniards at sea, put himselfe into the great Canarie, as in that, which in his judgement would be first set on. It was so indeed, and Don Pedro de Vero, Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admirall of Castile landed there with above three thousand naturall Spaniards: He had conquer'd it before it had delivered it selfe into the hands of Polexander; but hee found now that he had not to doe with a Doramas, a Guavartem, nor such Barbarians as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time possest it. Our Heroe the second time made the Spaniards know, they were in an errour to call themselves invincible, and the men alone that deserve to be masters of the world. Their ships were all either sunke or burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>; the Vice-admirall had the honour to die by the hand of Polexander, and above five hundred Spaniards which had scap'd the furie of the sword, were taken and sold up and downe the Islands. Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus punished them, to teach their pride, how insupportable slaverie is, and make them feele the heavinesse of that yoke which they would impose on all nations else. After a victorie as glorious for our Heroe as that which he wonne on the famous Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nandez de Sajavedra, hee was not esteem'd for a mortall man among the Canarians. They published every where that he was one of those Gods which they had before time adored, and but for the punishments which he was constrained to appoint against the authors of such pernicious opinions; that people to render him divine honour, had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the Christianitie which of late yeares they had professed, with the Idolatrie which by force they had only quitted. Garruca was witnesse of our Heroe's last won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and after he had obtained from him all that Quasmes and Zelmatida had desired; returned thence replenished with the admiration of his vertues, and inrich'd with his presents. Polexander on his side, commanded new sorts to be made on all the Islands, to take from the Spaniards all desire of returning thither; or at least, the thought of conquering them; and assoone as they were defencible, he not onely put to sea, but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:54727:258"/>
made a vow in going out of that port, never to see the Canaries againe, nor by his will ever set foot on land againe but in the kingdome of Alcidiana. He commanded his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to take the same course they had done before, and they tooke it as much in vain as they had done before. His vessell made above three hundred leagues instead of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and was almost a moneth ceaselesly beating up and downe the same ruts, (if it be lawfull for me to use a tearme so unknowne to Mariners.) Not a day passed but they made him new promises to finde the Inaccessible Island, and at every little cloud which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from the sea, they came with false comfort to him, and assured him they saw the white clifts of that fatall abiding. After the Prince had beene thus often deceived, hee perceived that fortune affected as much as ever all occasions to laugh at him; and that the vain favours which she oblig'd him withall by the lasting calme, were but new proofs of her jealousie: Wilt thou (said he to that imaginary Power) be alwayes so ingenious to torment me, and so dextrous to strike, that not any one of thy blowes can prove mortall? Why covet'st thou not as well my death as my affliction, or why exposest thou me to so many differing persecutions, if thou wouldst not have me die? Cruell and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall! that canst not indure I should be happy, and yet takest not away absolutely my hope of being so; be once at one with thy selfe; hearken to thy sole inhumanitie, since thou altogether takest pleasure in mischiefe; awaken the windes which sleep, raise up the tempests, and rending my vessell against some one of the rockes in these seas, suffer me no longer to contest with thy will. As he had spoke thus, one of his brought him word they descri'd a ship in their course, presently Polexander thought it might be some of Alcidiana's vessels, and on that beliefe commanded to make up to her, or at least not to lose sight of her. When they had receiv'd this order, they clapped on all their sailes, and in lesse then an houre came up and laid her aboard as friends, and were so welcom'd by those that were in her: for instead of taking armes, they fell to clapping their hands, and intimate by their talke that they had met with what they had been a long time seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after. Polexander seeing those strangers so jocund and merry, kept as neere them as he could, and needing not speake very loud to be heard, ask'd whence they were, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were bound. We are Danes (they repli'd) and are in quest of an Island which flies from us, and gets out of sight assoone as 'tis discovered; if you are such as can sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount that Islands inchantment, imploy your skill in our behalfe. Wee are going to Alcidiana from a personage that is very deare unto her, and carrie her the most pleasing newes she can ever receive againe. Polexander, even rapt at so happy an incounter, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the Danes, that he had the same designe, and was in the like perplexity as they: I have a long time (said he) sought that inchanted Isle, or some one of those that have the power of dissolving its inchantments; but hitherto all my search hath been in vaine, and for these two yeares I have wandred as you, and yet cannot discover that fleeting Island. He had no sooner spoken, when a Dane breaking out into an extraordinary admiration, O (said he) how well hath our voiage thriv'd, my companions, if I may beleeve mine eares and eyes: Free me from the trouble I am in (said he to our Heroe) and conceale not your selfe from such, who account this meeting amongst the greatest of their felicities, if you be Polexander. Our Heroe was much surpris'd at so unhop'd for a question; yet he would not conceale himselfe, how great soever his reason was to doe it; and telling the Dane that his name was Polexander, intreated him withall to relate, how Phelismond stood with the King his master. I cannot give you satisfaction to what you demand (answered the Dane) till I am in place where I may speake without witnesses and feare; but if you please that our ships may goe in consort-ship, I will come aboard of yours, and at leasure relating Phelismonds adventures, free you from an errour, which (as generous as you are) certainely throwes on you a great deale of jealousie and disquiet. Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no sooner heard the Danes proposition but he accepted it, and presently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his mariners to joyne indeed with the Danish ship, he tooke into his own that messenger of so great and good novelties. The complements ended, he brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his cabin, and commanding his servants away, was alone with him: I will then (said the Dane) begin to atquit my selfe of what I promis'd in presenting you this letter, and therevvith he put into our Heroe's hand a packet on vvhich vvas vvritten, To Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King of the Canaries. He open'd it, and there found a letter vvhich said thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:54727:258"/>
MY dearest brother (let me call you so, for I finde no tearme like that which can so well expresse the greatnesse of my affection, nor the happinesse I wish you, if you injoy it not,) be pleas'd to know that all those whom I have sent to the Canaries, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the assurance of my love and service, have return'd without informing me any thing concerning your selfe, that could either content or give me satisfaction: they could one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to me your absence, and your subjects sorrow for your losse. I at last perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my selfe that you were return'd to the Inaccessible Island, and that Alcidiana (o're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by your services as well as by your merit) had given you both her crowne and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as the sole reward wherewithall she could remunerate the paines and travels you have indured for her. If your longings have receiv'd so good a satisfaction, the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours I now send to that Princesse, will impart some of those secrecies to you, which they goe to intimate to her; and will protest on my behalfe, as I doe by this letter, that the throne wherein I am seated, hath nothing in it so pleasing as the beliefe I have of your enjoying Alcidiana.</p>
               <p>After Polexander had read this letter, he gaz'd on the person that gave it him, as if he would aske, whether truely Phelismond had sent it; the Dane surely knew the Prince's meaning, and to put him out of trouble, The King my master (said he) hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to make you a relation of all which hath hapned since the day of your separation, and particularly to assure you, that the love he bore to Alcidiana, is absolutely confin'd within the bounds of friendship. I could expect no lesse (repli'd our Heroe) from Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismond: he must yet give me leave to be sorry for his change, and to accuse him for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Ambition before Love, and the Crowne of Denmarke before the service of Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana. The Dane smiling at these upbraidings, Your Majestie (said he) may be pleas'd to give me leave to contradict your opinion, and condemne your accusations as unjust: 'tis true, Phelismond hath taken on him the Crowne of Denmarke, that hee might no more dreame of his enjoying Alcidiana; but it is not so true (I beseech your Majestie to pardon this boldnesse) that his ambition hath beene more prevalent then his love. Hee loves Alcidiana as much as he hath ever done, but loves her not the same way; and is still her affectionate servant, though he be no more her lover. The sense of what you speak (repli'd Polexander) is too mysterious to be deciphered. 'Tis very true (said the Dane) that the veritie I announce to you, is able to astonish your wit and thought, rather then to convince it; and though all its circumstances have betided, yet hath it so little of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary events, that it may passe with you, for one of those wittie intrications of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater, represented for the peoples admiration, to suspend the functions of their soules on the doubtfull expectation of a successe which they could not foresee. You will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope give me leave to exercise a little your patience, and (as if I repeated one of those stage-peeces) clearely make manifest to you, by little and little, Phelismond's adventures.</p>
               <p>The late King of Denmarke in lieu of being displeas'd with that worthy favorite, for so many combates he had undergone, and so many disobediences he had rendred to save your person, conceiv'd so extreame an opinion of that Prince's generousnesse, that hee thought himselfe not able to give him sufficient testimonie of his affection, if he forgave him not the losse of his daughter, and (in his life time) plac'd not the Crowne of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke on his head. To that end, he convocated the Estates of his kingdome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating that in the state their affaires stood, there needed a man to command them; besought them (with teares) to approve of the election he had made of his successour: I know (said he) that the love you beare my daughter (though (may be) she is not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the living) is more deare to you then your owne interests, and may make you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately resist all other election which may seeme to exclude your Princesse from that dignity she might claime by birth-right. But let not that consideration amuse you, the successour I have chosen is such, that in giving him my crowne, I assure it to my daughter, and in giving him you for your Lord, I secure you the conquest of Sweden and Poland, and make you the arbitratours of all the German liberty; I think there is no need for me to name to you that worthy successour. The thoughts of all you here abouts are cast on Phelismond, and seeme to say to one another that 'tis he alone from whom these
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54727:259"/>
wonders are to be expected. 'Tis true my loyall subjects, it is Phelismond; I say Phelis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, who hath intomb'd those discords which laid waste your families, who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd the authoritie royall for the Norway revolt, who hath knock'd in againe the Swedish ambition even into the deserts of Lapland; and finally, who hath made Poland feele, that her Cavalry (as valiant as it is) is not invincible: I know what his enemies can say for his exclusion, The mournfull accident which betided the imprudent Helis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena may be laid to his charge (with that he put his handkerchiefe on his eyes:) but why should the remembrance of so lamentable a historie cast us into our former sorrowes? Let us burie in oblivion (since 'tis the will of heaven) that disastrous accident, and strike it out of the number of whatsoever cases have mis-betided; strike out that unhappy day of Helismena's losse, from amongst those which compose and fill up the ages. On so sad a subject let us impose an eternall silence, and so discreetly conceal our shame, that gliding away by little and little in the traine of years, it may never come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of posterity. When the King had spoke thus, he was going on to the election of Phelismond, but that generous Favourite preventing the Danes remonstrances, cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self at the feet of the King his master; and decyphering himselfe as the most despicable of men, besought him not to place in his throne, the man, who had pluck'd thence the lawfull Inheritrix: Rather (said he) render that Justice, which so many good men peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for, against the ingratefull Phelismond. Let him die, or at least make him a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond and wretched all the rest of his dayes, since he hath dar'd to faile in his obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and respect to your owne bloud. Those words drew teares from the Kings eyes, and so mov'd all the assembly, that even those who came thither most averse for Phelismond, were the first that desir'd the conclusion of his election. He on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary seeing it not likely to be longer hindered, would at least have delai'd it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fell againe at his master's feet, and more and more expressing his generousnesse, Sir (said he) if my good destinie can give me the boldnesse to force from your Majestie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing beyond that which you have pleas'd to bestow on me; accord to my humblest petition, and the just instances of so many illustrious personages, that my election (which you intend) goe no further on, but be defer'd till the returne of such as shall be chosen to goe in quest of the Princesse. All the assembly falling on their knees to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from the King that which Phelismond had propos'd; had the satisfaction to get from him what their respect and loyaltie scarce permitted them to demand. The estates being thus dissolv'd, the businesse was for the chusing of such as were to goe in quest of Helismena. Phelismond would be one, and for all the obstacles the King could lay in his way, he got to sea assoone as the rest, and was neere six moneths in the voiage. 'Tis best to speake of things as they are, he had either an inclination to the Princesse of Denmarke, or with his hope of enjoying Alcidiana, had lost all the love he bore her: but acknowledging himselfe extraordinarily indebted to (both) the fathers and daughters love; he would give to his resentment and to Justice, what he could not to love. He return'd as he went, and reap'd no other fruits of his labour, but the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of having done his dutie. At that word, Polexander interupting the Dane, Be pleas'd (said he) that I renew my accusation, and noting so great a coldnesse in the King your master, persist in my former expostulation. For his sake, I will thinke that 'twas for the sole consideration of the honour and dutie he bore to Helismena; but how will he justifie his small remembrance of Alcidiana? Certainly, were I little lesse his friend then I am, I would goe further, and say, there remain'd not in him the cold ashes of all that great fire which the faire Idea of that incomparable Queene had kindled in his heart. You may without offence speake it, (repli'd the Dane) for 'tis true, from that time forward he was cur'd of his wonderfull love to Alcidiana; yet must you not for all that change, accuse him of inconstancie. He alter'd not, but when he saw that reason, his conscience, the lawes of honour, and the successe of your combate, absolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad him to persevere. And if those powerfull considerations had been too few to sway him to that alteration, he had receiv'd such advertisements from Thamiris, as after them he was not permitted to be any more the passionate servant of Alcidiana. I would faine know (said Polexandervery coldly) of what importance those advertisements (of which you speake) were before I can justifie Phelismond's alteration. They were
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:54727:259"/>
these repli'd the Dane: Some two moneths after my master's returne into Denmarke, Thamiris fell sicke, and as if she had receiv'd some secret notice of the end of her dayes, she assured Phelismond she was to die of that sicknesse. That Prince who had alwayes lov'd her as his mother, left the Court; and giving no care to his flatterers, abode two moneths intire with that Lady. There was no kinde of service (which could be expected from him) wanting; nor ordinary or unusuall remedies, but he made use of to preserve her life. Yet Thamiris receiving them onely to make Phelismond beleeve shee desired not to die, secretly prepared her self for it, with all the love and feare could be expected from Heaven; and seeing her selfe neere her end, was desirous to speake with Phelismond apart: presently, all were commanded to avoid the chamber, and the doores being shut, that good Lady in lieu of speaking, fell (lovingly) on Phelismond's face; as he lay weeping on her boulster. After she had lean'd there a while, she rais'd her selfe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no shew by her speech of her weaknesse; Phelismond (said she) you are like to lose a mother, who hath ever loved you as tenderly, as possibly she could doe who brought you into the world: but first I will tell you who she was, since I alone can informe you of her. Know Phelismond, you are no Dane, but an Englishman at least by your mother, and sprung from that ancient family which at this day reignes in England: you are of the bloud of Yorke, born among the High-landers in Scotland, and brought up in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke. This exceeding newes is to be but the least part of your contentment; I am to tell you another farre greater: You are the sonne of the great Alcidus (King of the Inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible Island) and brother to Alcidiana. Brother to Alcidiana! (said Polexander, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the Dane.) Yes Sir, (repli'd he) Phelismond is Alcidiana's brother; and when Thamiris made knowne that secret, he was not lesse surpris'd then you seeme to be. That I am Alcidiana's brother, (said he to Thamiris) Ah! Madam, pardon me, if I beseech you to come againe to your selfe, and a little suppresse your malady which seemes to hinder your thought of what you have to relate to me. No, no, my sonne (repli'd that good Lady) I talke not idlely, I tell you once againe that you are Alcidiana's brother; and if you will give me leave to end what I have begun, you shall be fully cleared of that which so much amazeth you. Phelismond grew silent for feare of displeasing Thamiris, and rested farre more attentive then he had been, that he might not lose the strange particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of his birth. Thamiris hereupon began againe, and holding Phelismond by the hand, You may know (said she) that amongst other fundamentall Lawes of the Inaccessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Island, there is one, by which it is commanded, whoever reignes there of either sex, to chuse every yeare from among the Princes and other great Lords of the Kingdome, a man of extraordinary vertue, and to constitute him chiefe Priest, and King of the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory; to the end, that in the name of the Monarch and the Subjects, he may goe and render the tribute of love and acknowledgement, which from all times the Countrey, is bound to pay to the Temple of a certaine God which is adored under the figure of the Sunne. Pimantus, father of Alcidus, desirous his sonne should receive that Soveraigne Priest-hood, before he came to his Regality; chose him to goe into the Isle of the Sun to performe the sacrifice of alliance. The young Prince overjoy'd at such an occasion for his seeing other countries and other seas then his own, imbarked himself in the sacred vessell; and taking with him the miraculous birds, by whose flight, as by the needle of the Compasse, they us'd to be guided to the Inaccessible Island; he commanded his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to give over their course for the Isle of the Sunne, and stand for the coast of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. The Priests and other Officers fell at his feet to make him alter so strange a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but he giving no eare to their remonstrances, would be absolutely obeyed. His Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots that had neither knowledge of needle nor art of navigation, left themselves to the wind, and judging by the Sunne whereabout that part of the world should lie which their Prince call'd Africa, were cast by the winde amongst some Islands that were some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred leagues from their owne; where Alcidus found such extreame rude people, that without making any stay he sail'd on, and came to an anchor on the coast of Morocco. Sometime he staid there, but troubled with the heate of the climate, and the barbarous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Inhabitants, he sail'd into Europe. When he came in sight of Spaine, he met with atempest, which holding him above a moneth betwixt life and death, drove him happily (at last) into England. To that Court he came unknown, and growing quickly

weary, left it, to travell through the principall Shires. At last he came to a place where the Dutchesse of Yorke was confin'd by a Tyrant King, with her two daughters: but he being slaine, the successour married one of them to a principall instrument of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Alcidus being by chance in companie, where she made appeare to the utmost, both her sweet demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, her wit and beautie, he became infinitely in love with her, and was no lesse belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of chat Princesse. Their sicknesse being reciprocall, made them equally have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to a remedie. Young Alcidus making use of that age'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Phelismonda (so was your mother call'd) was not deafe to his petition, she let him know she had pity on what he suffered; But (said that amorous Princesse) I advertise you, that the remedie which you seeke for it, is not so much in my power, but it is farre more in your owne. Young Alcidus considering himselfe already as a conquerour, forgot nothing which he thought might any way ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his triumph; he vowed his constancie and saith inviolable; he joyned oathes with promises, and presently complain'd of Phelismonda for her deferring the requiring his putting them in exec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She then laid before him, that being borne the daughter of a great King, sister to another, and by right to pretend to the Crowne of England, she desir'd a husband that might re-establish her in the throne, and not a lover who might absolutely ruine her. Alcidus found nothing rigid in this proposition, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested that his love was pure and innocent; that he looked on Phelismonda with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intent, then to honour her with those Crowns were ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They were cast on the wilde parts of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and as I had bene the sole confident in your mothers love, so was I the sole she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companion of the miseries she refented. A little while after we arriv'd among those people, she found her selfe indispos'd: the alteration of her countenance, her waxing lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, her squeamishnesse, her drooping, and continuall faintings, made me thinke that her indisposition was but an effect of her being with childe. I advertis'd Alcidus of it, who resolv'd (for all that we could say) not to hazard his Lady in the case she was: hee went not from her farre in five moneths, and though he were continually intreated to goe thence, he preferred (generously) his love and faith before any consideration of his estate; and would not put to sea againe, till Phelismonda could indure the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a voiage, which he would not undertake without her. In the meane time, the fatall tearme of your birth came on; but O sad and mournfull day! can I call thee to minde without the losse of that short remainder of life which is left me? The unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Phelismonda felt all the throwes which women undergoe in their labours, yet could not be brought to bed. The remedies we appli'd for her succour did but hasten her end; when she perceiv'd her selfe to faile, she fell gently on the face of her half dead husband, and glewing (as it were) her mouth to his; Preserve at least (said she) the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of our loves, since heaven will have nothing else left thee! and with those words she died. Alcidus presently tearing his haire, and acting the part of a man despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, not onely forsooke the little cotes wherein we had liv'd all the time of your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers going with childe, but instantly imbarked himselfe, and fet saile. I have alwayes thought that his extreame griefe was so prevalent, as to make him intend his owne losse, after that of Phelismonda; and for that cause would not trouble himselfe either with mee, or any of his Lady's women. He was not long gone out of the chamber, but I felt you stirre in your mothers wombe, whereupon I call'd for a Surgeon that was come to assist us, and caus'd him to open one of Phelismonda's sides, from whence he tooke you, and after his well treating, assured me you were likely to live. The desire I had
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54727:260"/>
to preserve all that was left me of my deare Phelismonda, made me suspend the resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her losse. I sent to informe the wilder people (who were somewhat huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd by our conversation) of our misfortune: some of them brought us women but lately up from childebirth, and offered them for your nurses; of which I retain'd three, and by their help, or rather (if you will permit me to say so) through a true maternall love, I overcame the rendernesse and infirmitie of your infancie. Neere eighteene moneths staid I in Scotland, so much incommodated that I resolv'd to get thence; but unwilling to returne into England, I was much troubled in thinking of a place where I might put you in safetie. Fortune, who at that time destin'd you for the Crowne of Denmarke, brought a ship to the place where I had put you to be nursed; there I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked me, and taking you along in spight of all the English Ambushes, came happily to Copenhagen. Loe, (my deare sonne) all that which I have been desirous to have my conscience discharg'd of before I leave you: I thought it not fit (to any purpose) to give you sooner notice of it, for feare lest it might prove a hinderance to your attaining that Throne, to which your vertue hath rais'd you, in stead of those you have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of by fortune. I confesse that many times since the fatall moment wherein you became so much inamoured on your sister's portraict, I have been on the point to declare to you what I have now related; but seeing there was nought (in your love) to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red considering the inchanted abode where Alcidiana is inclosed; and besides, I know not what Spirit suggesting to me new prohibitions; I imagin'd that the decree of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Providence would have all the ventures of your birth concealed still from you. Thamiris thus ended her narration, and afterwards unwilling to heare any more of what concerned the world, died so well, that envie and scandall openly repented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of such falsities as they had invented against her vertue, and contributed as much as they could towards her beatification. Here the Dane stopp'd, and left Polexander in such an admiration, that he was a prettie while without being able to perswade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that the truths he had heard, were any other then dreames and illusions. At last, recollecting himselfe from his wouder, Must I then (said he) beleeve that Phelismond is Alcidiana's brother? You are to credit it, repli'd the Dane, and hold for certaine truth, that so many strange and incredible accidents happened by the guidance of a spirit, which (without blasphemie) cannot be accus'd of ignorance, neglect, nor injustice. These prodigies are infallibly the presages of some extraordinarie event; but till time shall make them knowne, be pleas'd that I relate what ensued the death of the vertuous Thamiris. A few dayes after Phelismond had rendered her her last dues, he return'd to the King his master, who had nothing whole and sound but his understanding: assoone as he saw the tearme was expir'd which Phelismond desired, he assembled the estates, and causing Phelismond to be crown'd with the consent of all his Peeres, impos'd on him all the markes and all the cares of regall authoritie. The joy he tooke in being disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd and unloaden of that glorious and stately slaverie, or rather in satisfying his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by the putting off all soveraigne authoritie, to place himselfe beneath what hee lov'd; retarded the houre of his death, and made him live five or six moneths more then he had done, in such quiet and contentment as hee had never before beene acquainted withall. He imitated those lights which never give so faire a lustre as when they are readie to goe out; for he did in so little a time many actions of courage and justice: he intimated most sensible sorrow for his weaknesse and exactions, and calling to him the chiefe officers of Copenhagen, intreated them to love their new King, as they had done him; and besought their pardon for his defects committed through want of judgement and too much facilitie. Phelismond was so sensibly grieved for the death of so good a master (for he then died) that he found nothing but bitternesse in the beginning of a new authoritie wherein ambitious men finde all height of felicitie. But time that takes away the feeling of sorrowes as well as joyes, restored him to his former temper, and gave him so many severall imployments, that he thought of nothing but how to make himselfe worthie of a dignitie whereof all good Princes acquit themselves with no little difficultie. Assoone as he had any time to himselfe, he bethought him of the Queene his sister, and your Majestie; and giving me in charge his letters, instructions, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, commanded I should doe my utmost to finde you; and at last (if it were possible)
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54727:261"/>
to land in the inchanted Island. I tooke my leave of him, in promising, that I would never returne till I heard newes either of your selfe or Alcidiana; to that end have I been at the Canaries, and receiving no satisfaction there, but that you were away, (if that could be any) I thought good to informe my selfe what was the best course to be held for the Inaccessible Island: those to whom I made that proposition, were ready to laugh at me, and said, that only Chance was the Pilot to that Isle. At last (to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from my importunities) they told me what they knew of that inchanted piece of earth, and this is the tenth day that I have wandred up and downe these seas to finde it, and left my ship to the sole guidance of Chance, to see whether it be as good a Pilot as your mariners assured me. After the Dane had thus ended his discourse, Polexander was put into so deep a musing that he remained a long time scarce knowing where he was, at last he came againe from that amorous Lethargie, and many sighes over-passed, I am (said he) the onely man that cannot tread on my misfortune. Zelmatida saw all things arm'd against him, yet the power of Kings, the elements surie, the distance of one world from another, and in briefe, the blindnesse of his Mistresse, have not been preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent enough to barre him from his felicitie. Phelismond hath had impossible designes, yet one way or other he hath brought them to perfection. Bajazet hath o'recome all difficulties which oppos'd his contentment, and in one day seen himselfe King of many Realmes, and the enjoyer of whom he affected. Even my poore Iphidamantus hath met his rest. Onely against me are eternally shut up all wayes which tend to any feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie; O just heaven! O pitifull providence! how long shall I be so wretched as to have no reason to hope for a better fortune? The Dane shew'd well by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> judicious discourse with Polexander, that Phelismond knew well how to chuse such as he imployed in his affaires; but all that hee could thinke on to quiet, or give any content to our Heroe's minde, serv'd but to surcharge him the more. In the meane time, the day left them, and night augmenting their disquiets, they commanded their mariners to strike saile and lie at hull, left they might lose the Inaccessible Island in the darke, if by chance it might present it selfe to our view. Night had her course as well as day, and retir'd to give the other place: Polexander seeing it breake, made inward vowes to it, and passing even to Idolatrie, which was not criminall, because forc'd, promised the Sun to hold him for his visible Deitie, if he would be propitious to his intentions: but his prayers were too wrongly addressed to have any good successe. That day they made a great deale of way, yet advanc'd his designe no more then if he had stucke still in one place. Night coming on, changed the manner of his impatiencies, and the three dayes insuing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Danes as much out of hope as our Heroe; they resolv'd to returne, and lose no more time in so vain a search. They were even already resolv'd and fitted to take leave of Polexander, when those that were in the scuttle of the ships mast, cri'd out that they saw land, and cast the Prince againe into the same vexations he had at the discoverie of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siphone's Island. He ran with Phelismond's Confident to the highest part of the decks, and perceiving farre off in the sea somewhat that was cloudie, neither the Dane nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus could possibly get him to turne his eyes from it: at last he certainely perceiv'd it to be an Island, but in the very time that his affection would have had him beleeve it to be that of Alcidiana, his memorie and judgement represented the pleasure he tooke in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himselfe to be deceived: neverthelesse, he could not put off so pleasing a defect, and belie his conception, till his eyes inforc'd him to acknowledge his errour. Assoon as he came to an anchor in a roade of the Isle, he caus'd himselfe to be landed with the Dane, and finding there no other then cedars and date-trees, or some more of the like kinde, he returned to his ship more discontented then he was before: yet the same griefe which drew him from the Island made him presently returne againe. He intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Phelismond's Embassadour to pardon his extravagancies, and pitie his sad fortune: the Dane who was not so insensible but that he knew the effects of love followed our Heroe; and to divert him, related the extreame discontent Phelismond was throwne in, when he saw himselfe ingag'd by the ill successe of his combate, to renounce all his love to Alcidiana. Polexander the while walked on a great pace, and staid not till he came to a brooke in the midst of a wood which stopp'd his way; by the cleare streame he lay downe, and began to marke its course so wistly, that he forgat for it, not onely the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54727:261"/>
Dane, but his fortune and himselfe: his melancholy which found its element in that moist and obscure abode, brought on him so sad but so pleasing thoughts, that had he remained long in that case, he might have vaunted how in the extremitie of all his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and displeasures, he had been intertained with incomparable delights and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations. From these musings he was diverted by the Dane, who thinking to oblige him, intreated his returne to the ship, and not to stay longer in a place which did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease his afflictions. Polexander hearkned to him, and as he went back, he spi'd along by the river a little path, so beaten, that it was easily guessed to be often trodden: a great desire tooke him to finde whither that way tended, and without any cause to be given for that curiositie, so firmely stucke to it, that he intreated the Dane to give him time for it's satisfaction. Scarce had he gone fiftie or threescore paces, but the path was lost amongst a great many great palme-trees, and as he was going on to finde it againe, he heard a kinde of hissing like to that of a Snake. The Dane fearing to meet with one of those prodigious Dragons which he had seen pictur'd in maps of Africa, began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat our Heroe againe to returne to his ship. But he, who would have beene glad to have met with some monster able to devoute him, flew in amongst the palme-trees, and casting his eyes on all sides to discover whence that noise should come, in lien of a serpent he spi'd at the foot of a palme, an old woman asleep, who being uneasily laid, made that kinde of hissing through the difficultie of her breathing. When he came within ten paces of her she awoke, and had no sooner opened her eyes, but being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the sight of men so neer, she flung up, in shreeking out, and fled in among the palme-trees; Let's follow her, said Polexander to the Dane, and make knowne that we are no hobgoblins. With that he went on, and when he was got farre among the trees, he saw one of a greater bulke by much then all the rest, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (afarre off) seem'd as it had been open; toward it he went, and coming neere, perceiv'd that (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) there was a cleft large enough for a man to enter into the truncke. Listingly, he put himselfe partly into the tree, and heard a harmonie like to that of a Lute, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well finger'd: he call'd the Dane, and letting him heare a very sad Almain, Surely said he, the partie that inhabits the bodie of this tree, is not so savage as the abiding seemes to perswade us. This he spoke aloud, that the person who plai'd on the Lute might heare him and come forth; and it succeeded as he intended. A Lady of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or twentie yeares, faire, as much as a person extreamely afflicted could be, came out of the hollow palm-tree, and looking on our Heroe &amp; the Dane, spoke not to them but with her teares and languishing regards. The Dane conceiv'd presently that he had before time seen that Ladie; and to cleare it, (in his own language) offered her all that he could for her consolation. That faire discontented Ladie had not time to heare the end of his speech, but lifting her eyes and hands to heaven, and asking her selfe oftentimes whether she had well understood the proffers of the Dane; O heaven! cri'd she, he is my countrey-man; I am so indeed repli'd the Dane, and can now glorie of making a voiage farre more happie then I could promise my selfe. Phelismond may have cause enough to envie my fortune, when he understands that the jewell he hath so long sought after by sea and land, is (as it were) of her owne accord come and rendred her selfe into my hands. Ah flatterer! said the Lady, (weeping) strive not by thy pleasants untruths to sweeten the bitternesse of my destinie. Thou knowest what he is, doe not set any false glosse on him, nor augment my shame and sorrow in making me call to minde the man who yet never thought me so much as worthie of his friendship. The Dane desirous absolutely to quiet the minde of that Ladie; If Phelismond (said he) have been so farre insensible as to behold so many allurements, and not be mov'd with them, 'twas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam because that part which we call the originall of life and sense was not then at his disposall. Alcidiana had depriv'd him both of his heart and eyes; but now, since she hath restor'd them, he resents the power of your beautie, and admires even your least perfections, if I may be permitted to say, more and lesse, of things which are all alike excellent. In a word (Madam) Phelismond laments and wisheth for you; nay all the favours of the King your father will be but so many torments to him, till he have obtain'd from you a pardon for his fore-passed faults, and see you seated in the Throne of your predecessours. Helismena (for 'twas she) could not give credit to alterations
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54727:262"/>
which seem'd to her beyond all hope; but Polexander, after he had done his comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and made himselfe knowne, Madam, said he, having been alwayes (as you know) so much at oddes with Phelismond, I beleeve you will not accuse me of flattering or giving him such praises as he deserves not: and this being granted, I hope you will doe me the honour to give credit to what I shall say, and beleeve, (since 'tis truth) that the generous Phelismond hath preferr'd his serving you, before the gift of a Crowne; and having turn'd the love hee bore to Alcidiana into the friendship of a brother, he now hath not onely any more passion but for your beautie, but he cannot give way to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, unlesse he be so with you. Helismena witnessing to Polexander her joy in seeing him, and to heare his words; Though (said she) what hath already passed, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise me but an unfortunate successe, yet I will suspend my feares, and put off my mistrusts, for feare of offending that veritie which speakes by your mouth. I beleeve, since you say it, that Phelismond hates me not so much as he hath done, but withall I thinke, that being compell'd by your valour to leave to you Alcidiana, he hath at last resolv'd to take such a wife as may establish him in that authoritie, which otherwise he might perhaps not be very well assured of. Polexander, desirous to free Helismena of that imagination, related to her all Phelismond's adventures, and letting her know that Alcidiana was his sister, not onely cur'd her of her jealousie, but dispell'd all other clouds of sorrow. In an instant she pass'd from one extreame to another, and according to the nature of the Northern women, which are full of violent agitations, but of short la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, she thought on nothing but her returne into Denmarke; and with all content to behold him againe, whose sight had been alwayes so deare, though so sad unto her. The Dane then began, and having given the Princesse an account of the cause of his voiage; If your Majestie (said he) will make no longer abide in this Island, I shall be glad to have the honour of conducting you into your kingdom, and will not beleeve I have fail'd my master in ought I owe him, though I put off to another time what I have now in charge, to hasten the contentment he will receive by your returne. Polexander againe addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to the Princesse; If (said he) I were not restrain'd by my adverse fortune, I would propose to you a meanes by which your desires and those of Phelismond should be alike satisfied: I would humbly intreate you to charge me with Phelismonds instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and make me you Embassadour to Alcidiana. Helismena approv'd of this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and commanding the Dane to deliver all to Polexander; I desire you withall (said she) to reconcile me to Alcidiana, and after you have made knowne to her the just cause of my wishing her ill, represent the reason I have to love her during my life. Madam, repli'd Polexander, I will acquit my selfe as I ought, (alas! what can I promise) of the charge wherewithall you intrust me. But that I may not faile for want of instruction, be pleas'd ere I goe, fully to informe me of such things whereof I am ignorant; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive well said Helismena what you would say, without any further intimation. You would know my follies, and I like them so well that I take pleasure to relate them: you shall heare all Sir, but before I begin, I must needs see what is become of my nurse, that while I intertaine you, she may take leave of these palmes and waters which have preserved our lives. Whilst she spoke, she perceived her nurse among the trees much afrighted; she call'd her, and being setled, told her in few words the change of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and commanded she would make ready for their departure. Whilst the nurse put that injunction in execution, Helismena sate downe with Polexander at the foot of the palme-tree which had served her long time for a palace, and began thus; I need not tell you that Phelismond is a most courteous and gentile man, and by consequence very amiable; you have too long convers'd with him to be ignorant of his qualities: judge then whether it were not very hard for me to be almost continually in the company of so winning a personage, and not be mov'd by him: I was indeed, assoone as I became capable of knowing his merit. For besides his sweet aspect, his brave courage, and his pleasant wit, which were as so many enemies who resolv'd the ruine of my libertie; the King my father's example made me resolute to receive the law of so sweet a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. I knew I loved Phelismond by the contentment I tooke in his intertaining me; nowithstanding, I know not what modestie restraining me from declaring my love to him, and besides his owne puritie hindering him from noting it, I liv'd above a yeare
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54727:262"/>
much in love and yet silent: my languishing lookes, my intermitted sighes, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e eyes wearied with my watchings, and tears spoke to him of it sufficiently. But he (who apprehended nought but what spoke of Alcidiana) as often as those true interpreters of my heart made knowne my love, seem'd to understand nothing of all that they intended. At last I resolv'd to speake my selfe, and finding an occasion in the time of a violent sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, caus'd by the excesse of my affection; Phelismond (said I to him, one day when he came to visit me) you grieve for my losse, and yet would you have understood mine eyes and sighes, you might long since have knowne that you are not onely the cause of my sicknesse, but the sicknesse it selfe whereof I die. I have not been lesse sensible then the King my father, and though my feare hath not permitted me to make it known as he hath done, yet assure your selfe, that I have farre more then he resented the imperious charmes by which vertue reignes absolutely over all hearts. I confesse Phelismond I love you, and so much, that for feare of being troublesome to you, I am resolv'd to die. I would have gone on, but my father coming in, I was forc'd to deferre it to any time, and indure the perfecutions of a troupe of ignorant Physitians. Many new diseases they invented, because they would not be silent before the King, and blinde as they were, discern'd not that I was sicke of a disease as old as the world. Phelismond, that was retir'd from me, with a wonderfull astonished countenance, had a great desire (at least if my conjecture be right) to free the King his master from the trouble wherein he saw him. But conceiving he could not draw the King out, without plunging himselfe into the same vexation, hee was pleas'd to say that my malady was a pure effect of a melancholy humour, and that if he would preserve me, he should try by all kinde of diversions to bring me to my former mirthsomnesse. My father who was not able to question whatsoever Phelismond spoke to him, dismissed all the Physitians, and thought that dances, maskes, playes, and other sportive pastimes, were the best remedies which my new physitian prescribed for my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie. But that new Leech soone repented him of his counsell, for the King imagining that Phelismond would be as able to suppresse my malady, as he had judgement to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it; commanded him to be with me as often as he could, and intreating I would cast off that melancholy which might be my ruine, assured me that if I did but contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to part of my health, Phelismond's conversation would be able to perfect all the rest: thus he parted, after he had (unwittingly) given me so true counsell. Phelismond (who hath ever kept that respect to his Master, as not to abuse his favour) staid at my beds-head to shew his obedience; and being excellent at the relation of stories, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to begin one that might divert me, and withall relate his fortune; but presently I perceiv'd how violently he forc'd himselfe to it, and therefore touched with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, I stopp'd him at the very first, to let him know the excesse of my love by that of my compassion: Doe not (said I) Phelismond force your selfe any more; your concent is too deare to me to sacrifice it to my peace; I had rather die then to redeeme my self from the grave with the losse of your happinesse; leave then when you please the miserable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismena, and seare not that either to be revenged or to be cured, she will ever complaine of your crueltie; death is most deare to her, since she is permitted to tell you, that for you she dies. Phelismond unable to resist his sweet nature, nor the pity I wrought in him, shed a torrent of teares before me, call'd himselfe a hundred times ufortunate; lastly, cast himselfe on his knees, and speaking to me with a freedome which gave me some satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: Madam (said he) if I may expect from your Highnesse a favour which I deserve not, be pleas'd I may discover my thoughts to you, and that without coloring, either with feare or respect, or any other specious falsities, the refusall I am bound to make of your love; I may say to you, that being absolutely anothers, I cannot be yours; that Queene whose picture hath ravished all the Court, possesseth what you desire of me, and I should be a traitor, if I promised you an affection which is not in my power to give you. I confesse my ingagements to the King your father, and your incomparable vertues, should plucke out of my soule this stranger passion, and forcing my inclination, make me finde my pleasure in my dutie and what concernes me: but Madam, what opinion would you have of a man that should be capable of so great an infidelity? and what can your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse expect from a heart so remisse and weake as to accommodate his love with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54727:263"/>
or faithlesse enough to conceive as many desires, as there are objects worthie to be coveted? Give me leave then, Madam, to repeate what I lately said, and make a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station which shall be just, though it may seeme insolent, and 'tis, that Alcidiana shall be the sole object of my love; and that I will sooner die as many times (if it be possible) as your lawfull indignation can make you wish it, rather then I will infranchise my selfe from the glorious servitude wherein my inclination and Alcidiana's vertues have so sweetly inthrall'd me. When Phelismond had done, I was so ravished at his constancie and generousnesse, that it was not in my power either to condemne his resolution, or to complaine of the contempt he made of my affection: on the contrary, I approv'd of them both, and seeing that Prince at my feet which seem'd to confesse himselfe guiltie, and ask'd me pardon for his offence; Love Alcidiana (said I) since heaven will have it so; and because 'tis there decree'd too, permit Helismena to love you. Phelismond a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from before my bed-side so pusled, and divided betweene his love and mine, that I doubt not but in himselfe he thought him very unhappie that he could not absolutely become at my disposall and solely mine. This inabilitie was the cause of my recoverie, for I tooke comfort in my misfortune, by knowing that the author of it was no lesse afflicted for it then my selfe; and I thought that in his intimation of his impossibilitie of loving me, he made knowne to me a new kinde of love, whereof till then I was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant. Assoone as I had recovered my strength, and was permitted to leave my chamber, I appear'd in Court with that same cheerfulnesse which had before time got me the name of the delight of Denmarke: for all that, I was secretly fed on by my passion, but I conceal'd it very warily, for feare lest Phelismond should be thereby anew discontented; and though there scarse passed a day wherein I spent not at least two houres in bewailing with teares (apart) the misfortunes of my life, yet in publike I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared so pleasant, that Phelismond himselfe was deceiv'd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it, and beleev'd, time had absolutely cured me. To that extremitie was I brought when you came to fight with Phelismond: his defeature mightily afflicted me, and but for his consideration which retained me, I had wrought my father's choler to higher violence then it ran then. It may be you are yet ignorant of the person who wonne him to violate the faith he had given you, and made him so wilfully bent to your ruine: I would have you know (Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander) that my desire to revenge the affront you had done my love, mademe imploy all my credit and power for your destruction. The King who hath alwayes beene a great observer of his word, was a very long time before he would hearken to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons I alledged against you; but I so pli'd him on all sides, and gave him so many seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall assaults, that he was forc'd to yeeld: hereupon your death was resolv'd on, but when I understood that Phelismond grew inraged at your ill treatment, and had therefore pluck'd off all that which had been appli'd to his wounds, of purpose to undoe himselfe; my desire to preserve him kept me from perfecting your ruine. I dexterously therefore put a new face on all businesse, and had lesse trouble to obtaine your pardon from the King my father, then I had in getting him to signe a warrant for your death. When I was inform'd that Phelismond affected you, I slack'd my hatred, and turned all my choler on Alcidiana; No (said I to my self) I will never indure that any poore pettie Princesse, who for all her Territories hath but a little shelfe or rocke, knowne only by the shipwracke of some unfortunate mariners, should be so overweening as to esteeme of the most excellent of men, no otherwise then as of one incivilis'd, and unworthy ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to breathe or to serve her. Presumptuous Alcidiana (said I, as if she had beene present) thy insolence will ruine thee; and if Phelismond be so farre bewitched by thy charmes as to persevere in his dishonour and Idolatrie, I shall have heart enough to carrie me even to thy inchanted Island, to scratch off that vaine beautie which makes thee insupportable to all the world. Many other injuries did I to your Mistresse, and meditated many extraordinarie avengements; but ere they were to be put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I desired to see how Phelismond stood, after so many trialls of Alcidiana's aversion. The next day after your departure I went to visit him, and finding he was (though in his bed) lesse distemper'd by his wounds then by the disdaines of ingratefull Alcidiana; Shall it (said I, after some words of civilitie) be published to the world, that you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54727:263"/>
of all affronts, out-rages, hatred, and all contempt? Shall that great courage which sees under it all whatsoever is most elevated among the fortune of Kings, belie it selfe in so eminent an occasion, and sticke senselesse on so urgent affronts, whereof co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise it selfe would have much a doe to be insensible? As long as I thought your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was just, though averse to me, I wished rather to be unhappie then to condemne it; but now, since it is not onely a scandall to your selfe but to all those that love you, I cannot (for your reputation sake, and satisfaction of your friends) but find fault with your unreasonable perseverance. Phelismond turning his eyes on me swolne with teares, If (said he) this unfortunate man hath truely any part in your favour, and if that miraculous affection which you have shewed him be not as yet extinguished, resume (if you please) those generous thoughts which it inspired you withall: bewaile my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie, and indammage not that person who merits it least of all men living. 'Tis true Madam, that Alcidiana doth but contemne, nay hate me, and to free her selfe from my presumptuous desires, she hath set my head at a value, and design'd my death as the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est marke of love and fidelitie which she can expect from her admirers. But since 'tis the will of my sad Fate to make me of that number, should I not looke on Phelismond as on a monster whom the Sunne should no more shine on; and to testifie fully the obeisance which I render to all Alcidiana's commands, to account him mine enemie, whom she deemes unworthie of her favour? This extreame constancie of Phelismond (said Helismena) confirm'd mine owne, and made me avow, that he who knew how to love so truely, could not be too much beloved. Yet was I above three moneths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually urging him to retort Alcidiana's neglect with as great a slighting, and at last to give over the imploring of a Power, who was so farre off from assisting him, as she glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in rejecting his invocations. I confesse yet, that sometimes when I thought on Phelismond's wonderfull love, I chid my selfe for so obstinately tempting a minde so persevering, and reprov'd that malice wherewithall I strove to corrupt the vertue of him I lov'd. No, (said I) at last, I will not adde to Phelismond's miseries; but since I truly love him, scorne to imitate the example of her that hates him: My solicitings are but as weapons which I lend to that proud cruell one; I follow (ere I am aware) her mercilesse humour, and as if I had undertaken to please her, would compell Phelismond to do what she desireth. Rather (Helismena) give eare to thy ingenious and just anger; make Phelismond to continue in his doating on Alcidiana, since she enrageth to know that she is beloved; and (to be avenged in a way which may be was never imagined) suffer him whom she despiseth to sue to her eternally. But sillie creature that I am! I perceive not, that in meditating this revenge, I doe my selfe farre more wrong then I could doe with it; and that if Phelismond continue his love to Alcidiana, I make my selfe truely miserable for no other end, but that she might onely seeme to be so. Avenge thy selfe more really, Helismena, and hazard not that small portion of life which is left thee, but in doing an act worthie thy just anger; let thy choler furrow up and make a way to that Island whereto none can arrive, and forcing from the world that insolent Rivall who indeed triumphs more over thee then Phelismond, subvert those obstacles which fortune makes use of to crosse thy contentment. Doe not thinke, Polexander, that these resolutions were of the number of those which are ordinarily in our sex; I meane, such as last no longer time then there was to conceive them: my indignation turn'd not into wind with my words, but I stucke constant to the execution of what I had delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and to trample on all difficulties in the undertaking it. To that end, my nurse and my selfe stole from my fathers Court, by the help of a Captaine of a ship, who thought himselfe wonderfull happie to be ruin'd in my service; and with a companie of glee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some young people, and resolute, we left Copen-hagen; and at two moneths end, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the first of the Azores. From thence we sail'd as if we had stood for the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, because our Pilot assured us that the Inaccessible Island lay betweene the Terceras and the great Canarie. I besought the Pilot to doe some wonder of his art in the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that cursed abode, but the Devils into whose protection the sorcerers have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that piece of earth, were offended with his too exceeding skill; and that they might not receive such an affront as to see their power mastered by that of a man, they

                  </gap>s against the rockes of this Island. All those which strove to save them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were lost; my nurse and my selfe, who alone had neither will nor abilitie, were throwne on shore by the same waves which had drowned our conductors. I will not tell you how long. I have been in this place, for if I would beleeve mine owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I should say I had been whole ages here. This, Polexander, is the instruction you would have from me, to make you my Embassadour to Alcidiana. I perswade my selfe you like this imployment the rather, because the businesse will be of reconciling us, and causing all jealousie and hatred to give place to love and alliance. After shee had thus ended, she gave way for Polexander to use his Rhetoricke. He gave her thanks for the honour'd Embassie whereof she thought him worthie, and intreated her not onely to blot out of her memorie, all wrong imaginations which jealousie had there figur'd, but to permit truth to represent to her, Alcidiana with all her charmes and perfections. Your desires are already accomplished (repli'd Helismena,) I see Alcidiana as faire and alluring as she is; but you can scarce beleeve it, for lovers cannot perswade themselves that any others are so cleere-sighted to take notice of all the graces in their Mistresses. As she had said thus, the Dane came to them, and told her she might depart when she pleas'd: the Princesse loath to deferre a moment, saluted Polexander; and for a last farewell, Brother (said she) I wish your happinesse may betide you in the same instant with mine; and that the name I give you may be a certaine presage of it. Polexander repli'd, that he was borne too unfortunate to have so much as the thought of so great a felicitie, and so brought her to her ship. There he ended his last complements, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to the Dane the letters he had written to his Master, went not from him till he had made him know the greatnesse of his liberalitie. Assoone as he was come back to his owne ship, he began to reflect anew on his misfortune, and confirming himselfe in the opinion he had of his destinie; Assuredly (said he) heaven is drawne dry of all good chance that it kept in store for mankinde; there is nothing left but miseries and languishments, and to see how plentifully they are showr'd on me, with good reason I may beleeve they were all reserv'd for me. From that he fell into a deep musing, and when he was got out of it, he had quite lost sight of Helismena's ship. Presently he commanded to weigh anchor, and putting to sea againe, ignorant of what course hee should steere, spent neere fifteene dayes more bootlesly in searching for that Island, which truely too rightfully merited the title of Inaccessible and Inchanted. The calme which had been so farre obsequious to our Lover's passion, now seem'd to be angrie at its inutilitie, and gave way to a furious tempest: eight dayes together the Prince's ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell was driven up and downe the immense vasts of the Ocean, and sometimes from hell carried up to heaven, and straight from heaven to hell againe; the masts were all shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, the saile-yards broken, the sailes all torne, the rudder stricken off, and they might say, that the storme like an insolent conquerour would triumph o're that miserable ship in all parts of her. The Pilot depriv'd of what he was to guide withall, began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the wretch'd estate of those of his condition; and the mariners being cleane tired with blaspheming, betooke them to their beads, and began to cast their eyes to heaven, against which they had but newly vomited so many injuries. Those which were not yet wearie of living, made vowes to all their Countrey's Saints; and others which were resolv'd to die, fell with a true contrition at their Confessor's feet, and in hope of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond life, comforted themselves for the losse of the first. Some holding up their hands to that succour which they saw not, giddied themselves with their extreame noise and crying; and others having not courage enough to looke death in the face, hid them in the hold of the ship. In the meane time the tempest inraged to be so long time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing with a few broken plankes, and the waves perfecting what they had to doe, tore the ship open at the poope; presently the sea all white with foame, and as proud of the victorie, rush'd in at the breach, got the deckes one after another, and so fill'd her, that on the sudden they perceived her sinking. In that extremitie every one caught hold of what he could, and at one instant did two differing things, despair'd of their safetie, and yet sought all meanes to secure themselves. Polexander, by chance meeting with a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54727:264"/>
broken mast of the ship which floated by him, got on it, and with an incredible constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy expected, when the storme should deprive him of that last refuge. After he had sate a while on it, turning his head, he perceiv'd Diceus at the end, which so overjoy'd him, that he conceiv'd not he was in any danger at all. Be not astonished (said the Prince to him) but waite for the resolution of Heaven in its disposall of us without despaire. The noise of the waves was too high to suffer Diceus to understand his Masters words; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the terrour had so much depriv'd him of the use of the best of part of his senses, that he scarce knew whether he were alive or dead. As the Sunne was ready to goe downe, Polexander descri'd somewhat before him that seem'd white among the greennesse of the waves: Take heart, (cri'd he to his servant) be of courage Diceus, I either see a rocke or a vessell; the winde drives us to it, and if feare kills thee not, my life for thine. He had no sooner spoken, but he found himselfe very neere to what he had discovered, and found it to be a great shelve of rockes inviron'd with the sea: many a time had it been the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and losse of many a mariner, but was then the hope and safety of Polexander. The Prince being driven neere to it, thought that if he quitted not his, mast before the surges threw him against the rockes, he or Diceus (without doubt) ran a hazard to be crush'd in pieces among a great many other small ones which appear'd close by the water: hee call'd therefore to his servant to follow him, and presently betooke himselfe to swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. Diceus recollecting his wits and strength, obeyed his Master, and after some hundred or more stretches or fathomes, overtooke him: 'twas most happie for him to be able to doe so much, for in the very instant when he came up neere to Polexander, his strength and heart failed him. Our Heroe seeing him sinking, swome to him, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how dearly he esteemed the life of that trusty servant, hazarded his own to save him. He tooke him by one arme, and swimming with a great deale of trouble and pain, got be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the rocke. Assoone as he got footing, he drew him on the sand, and made him resume his spirits; when Diceus with scattered looking on his Master, would have ask'd him where he was, but Polexander preventing him, Friend (said he) we are safe, if to be so, we need nothing but to be freed from the furie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> sea: we must indure yet, and let us suffer with a good heart, since heaven hath not permitted us to finde a grave where so many hath met with theirs. Thou mayest tell me Diceus that 'twas our own faults; but we had then violated the most inviolable lawes of nature, and that providence which reserves us to some other end, would have punished us as selfe-murderers, if we had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the meanes of our safety, which its all powerfull hand miraculously offered us. Here he stop'd, and going along the side of a little creek which was hidden in the bosome of the rocke, he found a staire cut like a screw into the maine stone, by which one might ascend the top: up he trod it all musing, and when he was at the highest, he found a little cave. Presently he call'd for Diceus, and entering the grot, he saw two beds of mosse so neatly made, that he could not imagine them to be the simple worke of nature: on the foremost he sate downe, and Diceus on the other; night as well as their former paines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting them to rest, they unclad themselves to dry their garments, and finding the temper of the climate excessive hot, they slept without feare of any cold taking. Polexander's sleep was not long, the night which grew very cold, and his disquiets, awakened him; he clad himselfe without making any noise, that his servant might take the better rest, and walking out, began to meditate on the woefull estate of his fortune. After he had ended this sad meditation, he cast his eyes on the Moone, and besought her (if she could) to number up all his miseries, and to relate them to Alcidiana. At last it grew day, and the winds ceasing with the night, a generall calme ensued in both Elements, which were the subject of their violence. Our Heroe then left the place where hee stood so long musing, and getting to the highest part of the rocke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scri'd some land, but it seem'd so farre off, that hee despair'd of his getting thither by swimming, and by consequence beleeved, that hunger would effect what the tempest had deni'd him. Hee (after his resolve to undergoe that mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end) descended to the cave: at the entrance he cast his eyes on the portall and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived some Letters graven in the stone, his curiosity won him to read what it was, and with an extreame astonishment found that which followes:
<q>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:54727:265"/>
'Twas against this Rocke (after the to be lamented end of the great <hi>Polexander)</hi> that <hi>Amintha</hi> and <hi>Alcippus</hi> (who would live no longer) were cast by a tempest. O yee! who hereafter by the chance of the Sea may hap to be thrown on these shelves; know, That the invincible Monarch of the Canaries, is no more: and that the Traytor <hi>Astramadan,</hi> (who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to vanquish him in an equall Combate) caused him to be murdered by a base whole Nation that were enemies to his and all eminent vertues.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After Polexander had read this Inscription so loud that Diceus might heare him, it made him wonder no lesse then himselfe; they therefore verily thought that Alcippus was dead on that rocke, and Amintha swallowed up by the sea. With which imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Polexander was so inly touched, that the teares came into his eyes, and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the griefe he rooke for the losse of two so worthie to be beloved; Eternall Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (cri'd he) what horrible crimes have I committed, that for their expiation I should run through all the torments that can make a life miserable?

These pious thoughts gave way to those of love; neere all the day he spent in meditating on Alcidiana; and talking to her as he had been in her presence, neither remembred his late shipwracke, nor the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death which in all likelihood was inevitable to him. But Diceus in the meane time, who thought on the preservation of his Master, was gone down to the sea-side to trie if he could get thence any thing that might keep them from starving. Amongst a great deale of caskes, pipes, and fardels which floated about the rocke, by good hap, a vessell of pure water, and a barrell of bisquet were fortunately driven so neere to Diceus, that he tooke hold and drow them to him. Assoone as he had rolled them on the sand, he went and made it knowne to his Master, and (against his will) wonne him to goe downe to the beach, to make use of that which was sent by the particular care of the Power that would preserve him. After he was descended, our Heroe (unwilling to thwart himself in the reliefe that was presented) steep'd some of the bisquet in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and gave himselfe some nurriture, being almost quelled with his former toile, and a fast of neer fortie hours. A little after, the night came on, and hee ascended againe with Diceus into his cave; and rather to intertaine his disquiets then to take any rest, threw himself on his bed of mosse: some four or five hours after he had lain down, he thought he hard some body talke neere him; and therefore call'd Diceus, and ask'd whether he dreamt or wanted any thing. He repli'd, that he neither talk'd in his sleep nor needed ought, but that he was much deceiv'd if he heard not some body speake about the entry into the cave: he had no sooner said so, but an apparition all blacke from head to feet came in, with a branch of a tree which burnt as a torch of wax. Polexander rais'd his head, and ask'd what it fought, but the phantasme in lieu of replying gave a fearfull shreike, and went out of the cave: Diceus seeing it goe away so quickly, thought cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was a Devill; and with that beliefe was almost dead for feare, when he saw it enter againe with five or six more as frightfull and horrid. Polexander could not chuse
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54727:265"/>
but laugh at his servants feare; but hee was not too well setled himselfe when hee saw those phantasmes, come neere to his bed, and that some of them extending their armes towards him, and others taking him by the hands, seem'd to wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They repli'd, hut 'twas in such a manner, that our Heroe could understand nothing by their howlings, (for we must say s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They themselves thought too that they were not understood, and would therefore exprosse themselves by signes; but their signes were more difficult to be comprehended then their former language.

It was true indeed, for after six or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven houres sailing, those Negroes landed in a countrey where the aire was so hot, and the sands so burning, that Polexander and his servant almost, thought they walk'd on kindled char-coales, and were forc'd to. suffer themselves to be guided with their eyes shut. At last they came into a place as delight some as the others which they had passed were insupportable: 'twas a wood of palme-trees, cedar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Assoon as ever Polexander's Convoy appear'd with him, a great companie of men, women and children, as blacke as the former inviron'd them; and every one striving to touch the Prince, they crown'd him with chaplets of palme, and in that manner brought him into the house which exalted it selfe above all the rest. When he came in, he found it not so rich as on the out-side; there was neither marble, not gilded seelings, nor rich ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestries: all the ornament of the halls consisted in mats of palm, in some seats of wood, and certain hangings made of discoloured rushes; where there hung bowes, quivers full of arrowe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, half-pikes without iron heads, and steele bucklers, with prettie handsome swords. After he had gone through three halls, one after another, hee came into a chamber, and in one of the corners, saw lying on a very low bed, a man which seem'd to be blinde; by the Negros demeanure, our Heroe conceiv'd he was their Prince, for one of them kneeling downe, spoke to him a while, and whilst he did so, held his eyes still on the earth. No sooner had he ended his discourse, but the blinde Prince lifting towards heaven, his eyes incapable of light, called Polexander to him, and imbracing him, bedew'd his cheekes with his teares. After this sad reception, he spoke to him much, but our Heroe understanding nought of his language, knew not to whom he should addresse himselfe to learne who had spoken to that Prince of any thing which concerned him, or what he expected from his owne person. Whilst he stood thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, there was a piece of mat lifted up, and instantly appeared some fifteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty women blacke as the men, and amongst them some that were of admirable feature, who all with stretch'd out armes to our Heroe, and teares, besought him to take pitie on their miseries. But he, unweeting how to answer their petitions, or not knowing what to doe in lessening their afflictions, thought of pointing them up to heaven, and striking himselfe on the breast afterwards; as if he would say, that by its assistance, he would quit them of all their troubles. In seeing these signes, all of both sexes, and all at once, gave an acclamation, and hurrying together to the blinde man's bed, seem'd to assure
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:54727:266"/>
him of something of great importance. When this was ended, they conducted our Heroe to the Temple, and causing him to be an assistant to as fantasticall and odde sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, as were the spirits of the Priests; he was left with the chiefe of them, who was not so blacke as the rest. That man, affecting the impertinent gravitie of those of his profession, and intimating by his scatter'd and afrighting lookes that he had some strange chimera's in his braine, strove to speake Arabicke to make himselfe be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. But if Polexander had not divin'd the greatest part of his speech, he had beene no better instructed by the Pastour then he had been by his sheep: all that he could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from that strange gibbrish, was, that he was arriv'd in a Province of the kingdome of Galatia, and that the blinde man whom he had seen was Prince of it; but being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly set on by the ambitious King of Thombut, he had lost his estate, his sonnes, and the chiefe of his subjects, and been constrain'd to fly to the desarts, to avoid the furie of his enemie, and preserve the chastitie of his daughters. That ever since his exile, his eyes had not beene without teares, and with too much weeping he had lost his sight: that every day some of his subjects gave him intelligence that the tyrant of Thombut was levying a puissant Armie to perfect his destruction, and that within a short time he would come and plucke both his wife and daughters out of his armes. Polexander, after he decyphered thus much, was desirous to learne more, and intreated the Priest to tell him, by what meanes they knew on what place the tempest had cast him, and what they pretended of his assistance. The Priest repli'd, that the Sunne, father of the blinde Prince, and the Deitie of all Galatia, had appear'd in his dreame to his sorrowfull sonne, and (after his assuring him that he should yet see his beames againe, and be avenged of the tyrant of Thombut) enjoyned him to send every moneth to the Hermit's rock, till such time as they found in the holy Cave, two men of a strange colour and language. After the chiefe Priest had related the blinde Prince's dreame, he brought Polexander into the most private place of the Temple, and drew from under the Altar a table of brasse, on which in Arabick characters was written a Prophefie, which Polexander read and found it thus.
<q>WHen the Scepter of Galatiashall be forced out of the hands of Abrim Esseron's true Successour, and that the misfortunes of the State shall be lincked with those which are particular to the Royall Families; the Sunne our father shall be compell'd whether he will or no, to denie his light to the dearest of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. But the tears and pietie of that good King shall at last touch that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Power, which hides it selfe in the rayes of that great light. From thence, shall be sent into the world a Prince, that shall be succourer and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour generall of all such as are afflicted, and he shall be made to wander in divers parts of the world, to the end, that many afflicted soules may by his assistance, be delivered from their miseries. The unfortunate King of Galatia shall have his share in that universall happinesse, if he be so prudent as not to neglect it. The Rocke which shall become famous by the miracles of a holy Hermit, is to be the place where the blinde Prince shall finde (with the fight which he hath lost) that invincible arm which shall subdue his enemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though Polexander could not contradict the verities contain'd in the Prophesie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out denying those things which himselfe had either done or suffered; yet he could not imagine, that he was either the Prince whose birth was so certainely foretold, or that his actions merited the honour they received by such extraordinary wayes: yet conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that heaven makes use of the meanest creatures whereby to operate the greatest wonders, he humbled himselfe; and by the doubt of his abilitie, made him more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then he was of those imployments which were reserv'd for his courage. Scarce had he ended his acknowledgement, when divers clamours arose in all parts of the wood, and a little after, a great number of women and children hurrying on the necke of one another into the Temple, made the Arch-priest beleeve, that either the blinde Prince was dead, or his enemies were come to assaile him. Presently our Heroe made out of the Temple, and with the Priest ran to the Kings lodgings: there he understood how
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54727:266"/>
the troupes of the tyrant of Thombut were got into the wood, and that they had either slaine or put to flight all those that oppos'd their entrie. He heartned the blinde Prince and his timorous Court, and putting himselfe in the front of three or foure hundred archers, made signes to them that they should go on courageously and repulse their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The Princesses who had now no other sanctuarie then his valour, brought him part of such armes as he needed; one of them presented him with a sword and target, another caus'd a very brave horse to be brought him, and all falling at his feet, besought him to have compassion on their misfortunes, and not abandon their honours to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous prosecution of the tyrant of Thombut. Polexander, overjoyed that he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wherewithall to resist the enemie, and so piously exercise his courage, went to meet the Thombutians, and surprising them as they were scattered, either to pillage the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, or to murder them, charg'd them so furiously that they were all routed, and after, so followed through the deserts, that not one was left to carrie newes of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate to the King of Thombut. Polexander return'd from the fight, or to say better, from the chase, without the losse of any one that followed him, and entering the Kings lodgings, found him at his devotions with the Chiefe Priest, and the Princesses his daughters. He made known to him by the Priest, that his enemies were retir'd, and that they seem'd by their little resistance, they had no great minde to drive him from the place where he was. His modestie would not permit him to say more; but his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being dispers'd through the palace, so highly extoll'd his valour which had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne their enemies, that they made him be esteem'd for the Deitie whom they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The women and children seeing their husbands and fathers safely return'd, cast themselves on the earth, to render thankes to our Heroe, and invocating him in their private necessities, besought the continuation of his miracles among them. The good King of Galatia let himselfe slip into that opinion, and as there is no errour which so easily infecteth all humane mindes then that which leades us to the adoration of such as have redeemed us from our miseries; he thought he could not without impietie, denie divine honour to such a one as did the actions of a Deitie. This thought so rais'd his abated courage, that in the very instant he left his bed, and lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing on two of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was led to the Temple to give thankes to heaven for Polexander's victorie. Our Heroe admiring the zeale which that afflicted Prince made shew of to a Power, of which he had scarce any knowledge, resolved to instruct him ere he went thence; and in the meane time told him by his Priest, that he should goe on in his pietie, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to himselfe from that Deitie which he invoak'd with so much fervour not onely all the greatnesses and goods he had lost, but all that his imagination could represent unto him. After these promises, he desired instantly to prosecute the execution of such as depended on him, and to performe them effectually, intended to sallie out of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts with five or six thousand Galatiaus, and charge in all parts of the countrey on the troupes of the tyrant of Thombut. The blinde Prince who certainly beleev'd that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander was sent from heaven to establish him in his throne, approved of his resolution, and all those whom love and dutie had obliged to follow the fortune of their King, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them to that warre with all the courage and cheerfulnesse which loyall and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate subjects could testifie in defence of their Prince. Our Heroe drew them forth from their abodes, made them traverse the deserts, entered into Galutia, and in eight dayes gave two little battles, perfected three sieges, out the throats of most part of the garrisons, and drove the rest farre into the territories of Thombut. Those that know not the Provinces I write of, will beleeve I mean to make Polexander passe for an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

There fell above foure thousand
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54727:267"/>
in the fights and sieges, and the rest (as I said) being forc'd to save themselves in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient territorie of the King of Thombut, strucke the inhabitants with such a terrour, that if Polexander had intended to assaile them, without doubt he had conquered them all. But he thought it not to belong to the King of Galatia, nor for the good of his affaires, and therefore contented himselfe with the regaining of that which had beene unjustly usurped. He therefore returned, and brought him out of his sanctuarie, and conducting him to the great towne that beares the name of the kingdome, re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him very solemnly in the ancient throne of his fathers. Some few dayes after came to him the King of Thombut's Embassadours, and after their congratulating his return, told him, that the King their Master had specially sent them, to intreat an abolition of things passed, and impute all which seem'd contrary to his promises and their ancient al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance, to the iniquitie of the times. To this they added, that if the blinde Prince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to preserve the peace, and make his peoples tranquillitie lasting, he should hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to some alliance, whereby the Crownes of Galatia and Thombut being united, their interests might be common, and their affections reciprocall. The King of Galatia deceived by these faire propositions, yeelded to all that the tyrant of Thombut desired from him; and told his Embassadours, that he not onely left to their Master the choice of foure daughters he had, but also from thence forward, would live with him as with his sonne or brother; provided that he restored to him the two Princes his sons, whom he had detained prisoners since the beginning of the warre. The Embassadours dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched letters to their Master, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>and had quickly their answer: in them he granted to the King of Galatia more then he desired, and demanded his second daughter, who was as courageous as the lions among whom she had been bred. The marriage concluded on, the Embassadours returned to Thombut, and within a while after, others came with a great equipage, who solemnely espoused the Princesse of Galatia. Her father, who was a good man, but as weake and blinde in spirit as in body, intreated Polexander to be the new Queenes conductor to Thombut, and to procure from the prison of the King her husband, the two Princes of Galatia. Polexander, who sought for nothing more then an occasion to abandon Africke, that he might get him another ship, wherein he might put forth again for the discoverie of that inchanted Island, which he could not attaine to, easily condescended to the Kings request: but having seriously pondered on the proceedings of the King of Thombut, he wished the good blind Prince that before he let his daughter depart from him, to presse the re-deliverie of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Galatia; and secure the life of the one by the libertie of the others. Ah Sir! repli'd the poore King, (by his Priest) my children will be dead if I intimate the least suspition of that Kings faith; he is of a spirit haughtie and cruell, who would have all men come under his lee, and to satisfie his ambition spares not the very lives of his own children. It may be (repli'd Polexander) his pride may be a little abated, and the fear of falling into your hands, may hinder him from attempting any thing against the lives of your sonnes. The chiefe Priest was of our Heroe's opinion, but speaking (onely) as his Masters Interpreter, he besought Polexander, by mildnesse to worke into that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Prince, and doe a new miracle in the deliverie of the captive Princes. Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der knowing the weaknesse of that poore King, would not disquiet him any more; he therefore with tears took leave of him, &amp; after twelve dayes journey, came to the great Court of Thombut with the Princesse of Galatia. The tyrant gave him such intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as was able to assure a mind the most mistrustfull, and after he had often told him that he would have bought his company with the losse of many kingdoms, besought him (in imbraces) to love Thombut as much as he had done Galatia. Polexander repli'd to these false-hearted pratlings, after his wonted freedome; but he was in a place where 'twas a hainous offence to speake freely, and he was besides so suspected, that had he been so poore spirited as to have soothed with tyrannie, yet had he felt its crueltie. The King of Thombut among his other qualities, having perfectly the art of dissimulation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed all his vices, to make the better use of them when there was occasion: he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the courteous, the humble, and the pitifull man; and speaking of the blinde King's afflictions, was so treacherous as to let fall some teares at their relation. If he had so much command over himselfe to deceive Polexander, he had no lesse to beguile
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54727:267"/>
the Princesse of Galatia. Some few dayes after her arrivall, she was solemnely conducted to the great Temple of Thombut, and from thence to the hall appointed and prepared for her nuptiall solemnities Polexander was engaged to be at that assembly, and as if his good aspect and presence had a design to avenge that Innocence which the tyrant had too much oppressed, it touched to the heart, and corrupted (if I may dare say so) the innocency of his two daughters. They were twins, and might have passed for very amiable persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if that eternall which dwelt on their faces had not hidden their chiefest beauties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides they were the sole creatures whom the tyrant durst trust, for he having filled with bloud all the best houses of his kingdome, imagined that he had as many enemies as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. He slept not but under their guard &amp; their watchings; and (as 'tis related of an old ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Sicily) he would not have any assistance in all his necessities but from from those miserable Princesses. They had not seene Polexander before their father's mariage day, since they were still confin'd, and never had the liberty to converse either with subject or stranger: they had no sooner cast their eyes on the Prince (who since his brother's death might well vaunt himselfe to be the fairest of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll men) but they lost their simplicity, or to say better, the insensibility, in which their father had nourished them. They had no sooner that first touch, but they fell in love, and no sooner fell in love, but they began to be witty: they studied their gestures and their countenances, and I know not what secret motion speaking inwardly, assured them that 'twas as much as their life was worth if their father came to the knowledge of their affection. This within advertisement made them turne away their eyes from that deare object, which they could not sufficiently gaze on, impos'd them silence at their first intertaining one another; smothered their sighes in the place of their conception, and even made them begin to feele how insupportable was their father's tyranny. He in the meane time, that had farre differing thoughts from those of his daughters, rejoyced in himselfe that he was got to the day of his revenge, and growne able in one same time to exercise his fury on many of his enemies: he swom already in the bloud of the Princesse of Galatia, and that of Polexander, and lamented that a night which was to be so joysome unto him, seem'd by its slow coming to envie the contentments it reserved for him. That night, destinated to so many massacres, no sooner came, but the tyrant prepared to make good use of it; he broke up the company assembled for the nuptiall solemnities, and caus'd the Bride to be conducted to a chamber which in all appearance was made ready for her, wherein she might receive the innocent pleasures of marriage; but that place as treacherous as its master, under those deceitfull ornaments, hid the deadly scaffold which was prepared for the execution of that unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>incesse. The Ladies who had brought her thither, innocently left her to the rage of his hangmen, and retired with their husbands to rejoyce at home for that marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which in their judgements was to produce the peace, security, and plenty of former times. Whilst all the towne was in feasting and jollity, and a great number of rascalls (hired by the tyrants complices) ran from street to street, and by their clamours and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order hindered the non-performances of that tragedy which was to be acted in the palace; Polexander was taken and chain'd in his bed, even by those that were wont to waite on him, and led with the woefull Diceus into a prison that was under the King of Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but's chamber. The tyrant had straight wayes notice of it, and instantly hastning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at first sight infinitely out-raged and reviled the Prince, and at last threatned to make him undergoe such tortures and punishment, as were proportionable to his own resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. After these insolencies he departed, and fastning the dore with many chaines and lockes, thought that the keyes could be no where so sure as in the custody of one of his daughters. She who had them was called Philesia, who was not onely more lovely then her sister, but withall more affected Polexander. The tyrant commanded her to keep those keyes more carefully then her eyes, and thinking to overjoy her, in few words declared the designe he had to avenge himselfe with his own hands, on that stranger who had made him lose all Galatia. At those words, Philesia was like to have let the keyes fall out of her hands, and indeed was neere discovering what she had till that time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd, if the same love which had caus'd that dangerous emotion, had not kept it from being perceiv'd. Before the enamour'd Princesse was well recollected, twenty of the most deformed Negro's which Africk puts in the number of her monsters, came into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54727:268"/>
where the tyrant was, and dragging after them the two Princes of Galatia, outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously bastonaded them to make them walke. Assoone as the tyrant had placed them neer their sister, he turned to her, and making his true hatred which he had alwayes borne them to breake out to the utmost; Thou hast then dar'd to beleeve (said he) in famous brood of a heards-man that I would make thee, daughter of my greatest enemy, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds concubine, the partner of my bed? Surely thy hopes have too much injur'd me, and I will therefore have them severely chastis'd. With that he looked on the Princes of Galatia, and commanded them to strangle their sister. Never shall be spectacle (how blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy soever it can be imagined) any way comparable to this that I describe. At the tyrants command Philesia cast her eyes on her brothers, and seeing them insensible at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive outrage, she threw her lookes on them, not languishing and pitifull, but lookes that were furious, and such as upbraided them for their ignominy and cowardise. Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable men (said she) are you not yet accustomed after so long and dishonourable a slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a blinde obedience? Doe what your master commands you, and since you have not the courage to live and die like Princes, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ve at least a testimony to the world that you are good and obedient slaves. The tyrant clapped his hand on her mouth, that she might not goe on, and growing inraged to see all his fury contemned by the constancy of a young mayden: Ah Tygresse! (said he) I alwayes beleeved that thou wert not resolved to receive me into thine armes, for any other end then to strangle me; but I have prevented thy treachery, and therefore thou desirest nothing more then to die. 'Tis true tyrant, repli'd the Princesse, I was resolv'd to kill thee this night with the weapon I conceale from thee; with that she put her hand under a large vaile of tiffany, which served her for an upper garment, and made shew as if she would draw somewhat from under it. The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant (who was extreamly timorous, as usually those are who are as exceedingly cruell) was afrighted at the Princesse's action, and flew on her, either to seise her arm, or to act him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, what he had resolv'd should have beene done by the Princes of Galatia. Philesia, seeing this prodigious example of her father's cruelty, was so strucken with it, that on an instant her intellect lost all its simpliciny, or to say better, its errour; she then perceiv'd things as they were, and disdeceiving her selfe of her former opinions, was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that children are not alwayes of an ill nature, though they disapprove the actions of their parents. The love she bore to Polexander serving her for an excellent Master, had in a moment inspired her with these high notions; in the very instant that she heard speake of his courtesie and valour, she condemned her fathers actions, and misliking them her selfe, look'd on him as an object of hatred, assoon as she thought on our Heroe; but when shee understood from that mercilesse father that hee had resolv'd to murther that Prince, she trembled through her naturall sensibility, trod under foot the names of father and daughter, and said within her selfe, that it was more just to ruine the oppressour, then to suffer the oppressed to perish. This being so, imagine what her thoughts were, and what her joy, when her father delivered the keyes of Polexander's prison into her hands; she gave heaven thankes for it, which she thought was the author of that wonder, and prayed often to have an occasion given her, whereby she might make a happy use of her charge of gaoler: she beleeved her prayers were heard when she saw the tyrant busied in disarming the Lady. Presently she ran out of the chamber, and running to Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's prison, so nimbly handled the lockes and keyes, and so speedily opened the doores, that such a miracle could not but be attributed to the blinde God of love. Her affection advis'd her to deferre her love's deliverance, that she might the more satisfie the desire she had of seeing him; but the same passion letting her know, that she loves not truely who regards her owne contentment as the principall object of her love; she loosned Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's chaines, and told him in Arabicke, that 'twas all she could doe for his preservation. When she had spoke thus she fled, and for feare let fall at the entry of the prison a torch which she had brought. Polexander, that would not goe forth without Diceus, lighted the torch againe that was not well extinguished, and making use of it for his servants li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, presently after put it out to save themselves the better in the darke. Chance (which hath oftentimes better successe then judicious guidance) led Polexander right to the chamber where he had been taken; he knew it by the light of a lamp that hung o're the staire, and calling to minde the good sword which the Princesse of Galatia had given him,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54727:268"/>
went in to see whether any had carried it away. He found it where he had laid it, and vowing not to leave so good a weapon but with his life, descended into one of the courts of the palace; the place was inclos'd onely with a palisadoe, but the height and greatnesse of the piles or stakes made it as safe as if it had been inviron'd with a wall. Polexander ran to the gate with an intent to fight with the guard, if they stopped his going out; but he saw them all dead on the ground, and presently heard a clamour on all sides: he imagined it to be a remainder of the publike rejoycing, and that the people (ignorant of what was done in the palace) celebrated with all kinde of pleasing licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousnesse a feast which they hoped should give a period to their calamities. With this opinion he went out of that court, but when he came into a large place which served for the avant-court to the palace, he descride at very day breake a Negro dragging a Lady by the hairs of her head: that barbarous act made him forget his intention to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and with his sword drawne, made towards that hangman, and with one blow on the head slew him, and made him fall at her feet whom he had so unworthily treated. Assoon as the unfortunate Lady saw her selfe at libertie, Pity me she would have said to Polexander, but knowing him as she had the first word on her tongue: Ah! thou power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full origine of my race (cri'd she) author of light, what see I? Pardon, pardon me my first thoughts, I am guiltie of doubting of thy providence: thou savest me when I accus'd thee of my ruine, and thou left'st me not in the power of the perfidious Atalas, but of purpose to deliver me into the hands of this deare and worthie stranger. Polexander knew not presently who 'twas that spoke thus, but looking on her at leasure, he thought she was one of the Princesses of Thombut, and the very same who had set him at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The first imagination after this, was, that the tyrant had beene informed of his escape, and suspecting his daughter to be the author of it, had condemned her to be so dragged by the haire, that the crueltie of the punishment might answer the enormitie of the offence. This thought bred in him so extreame an horrour of that barbarous Prince, that being suddenly seis'd on with an heroick furie; O thou! (said he) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structest mine armes to fight, and hast rendered me this sword, (with that he lifted it a lost) to make thine anger felt by such as contemne thy clemencie, give me now an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary strength, and be pleased, that to avenge the Majestie which invirons thee, I may exterminate the tyrant that dares wrong it in thy Images. As hee ended this ejaculation, he saw come out of the great gate of the palace, a man all bloudy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd backe by neere twenty others, witnessed by his resistance that he onely gave way to their number. Polexander being mov'd with the Negro's valour, left Diceus with Philesia, and ran whither his great courage carried him. Instantly he flew in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the murtherers, and felling two or three of them so afrighted the rest, that he took from them all desire of perfecting their assassinate. He who had beene so fortunately assisted, cast himselfe at Polexander's feet, and kissing them, Generous stranger (said he) though Galatia should erect Altars to thee, should it be acquitted of that which it owes to thy valor? No truely, and I confesse for it, that having for ever delivered her from the tyrant of Thombut's persecutions, she is bound to invent new honours, to let posteritie know that she hath not blended thee amongst her other gods. Ah Prince of Galatia! (said Polexander) goe not on with these blasphemies, unlesse you have a mind to ruine your selfe; speak with more respect of things divine, and know 'tis thence, and not from me, that you are freed from the hands of your enemies. But tell me who hath reduced you to the state I finde you in; where is the Princesse your sister? What doth the King of Thombut? That tyrant is now no more, repli'd the Prince of Galatia, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as cruell as himselfe hath strucke him out of the world; but alas! he hath had the comfort before he died to satiate his furie by the death of those you inquire after. How! (said Polexander) is the tyrant of Thombut dead? He is so, repli'd the Prince, and with him his two daughters, who truely for their beauties as well as for their vertues, merited a better fortune. But the new tyrant murdered not the father to spare the daughters, and questionlesse you will fall into his traps if you hasten not to escape his fury. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander would have been instructed of all these tragicall events, but he had not time, for a great company of Negroes rushing out of the palace, came (with a great shouting) to fall on him; he resolv'd rather to die then give ground, and therefore slighted the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54727:269"/>
danger, and plunged his sword up to the very hilts in the belly of the ring-leader to that inraged troupe. Fortune at that very instant had minde of our incomparable Heroe, and repenting her putting his vertue to so cruell trials, ingaged her selfe to be thereafter more favourable unto him; and that she might not deferre the execution of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to another time, she made the most part of the inhabitants of Thombut to run to the succour of our Heroe. Rumour, though confusedly, gave them intelligence of all that which had passed in the palace, and upon that newes they had armed themselves for the preservation of their libertie, if they had recovered it, and if not, to get it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the sword. Assoone as they appeared in the place where the Princesse Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia was left, they would have ranged themselves in order both for offence and defence; but the Princesse fearing lest their too much preparation might make them lose the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of assisting Polexander, went to meet them all dishevel'd as she was, and without losse of time in relating what had passed: Run (said she) and make haste my friends to the aide of that man who gave the first blow for the subversion of the tyrannie which inthralled you: he is in fight with the cruell Nigeran, who by the murdering my father thinkes to become master of your liberties, your goods and lives. The Thombutians presently nock'd their arrowes, and entering all headlong into the palace court, so well behav'd themselves for the preservation of their Liberatour, as well as for their liberty, that he who would have oppressed them, (with all his complices) was sacrificed to the memorie of the dead, and the safetie of the living. Polexander, being so miracoulously with-drawne from the danger whereinto his valour had ingaged him, turn'd to the Thombutians, and speaking to them in Arabick; My friends (said he) you are too much redevable to heaven, to deferre to another time the thankes you are bound to render: Get you to your Temple, and offer up the spoiles of the tyrannie you have undergone, as an eternall remembrance, that you acknowledge your deliverance to have only come from thence. Those who understood the Arabicke, interpreted to their companions what Polexander had said; and all of them approving his counsell, resolved to follow it. He put him selfe in the fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, and taking the Prince of Galatia with the one hand and the Princesse of Thombut with the other, would march so, that the people might have compassion on them both, and be wonne more easily to what hee intended to make them execute. When he was come to the Temple, the Priests began their acts of thankesgiving, and assoone as they were ended, he intreated the Assembly not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till they knew how strange the accidents were, which heaven had permitted for the punishment of miscreants, and the comfort of honest men. Philesia hearing this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, stepped forward, and told the multitude that she being a spectatrix of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which had befaine her house, she could better relate them then any else. The Thombutians intreated her to feare nothing, and to make knowne to them all things as they had passed, they pressed up thicke together, that they might lose nought of what she spoke, and got her to stand on a seate which by chance was by her, that shee might be heard the farther off; and a generall silence being impos'd, thus she began: If I did not inforce my resentments, and sacrific'd not my teares and lamentations to the publike felicity, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eare lest you would thinke mee unworthie the compassion my mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune winnes from you. What shall I doe O ye Thombutians? Shall not a daughter be permitted to bewaile the death of her father? But shall a person who is obliged to you for her life be permitted to lament the death of your tyrant? No, Philesia will not confound things so differing; she if you please, will yeeld what she owes to nature, and yet not denie the debt is expected from her to her Countrey. She will rejoyce with you for the extirpation of your enemies, and bewaile to her selfe the miserable death of her father, and the desolation of her family. But why should I (with these thoughts) deferre the recitall of those disasters which have finished yours? Hearken ye inhabitants of Thombut, and judge if that man be not devoid of reason that wishes for a Crowne. Ambition, which hath alwayes handled the minde of the King my father, farre more cruelly then he hath done you, advised him to adjoyne to his owne territories those of the most part of his neighbours. He began with that of Galatia, and the facility of the conquest, gave him a desire to undertake some that were farre more considerable; to that end he rais'd a mighty armie, and was ready to proclaime warre against the King
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54727:269"/>
of Gheneoa, when this visible Deitie (with that she pointed to Polexander) came to succour the King of Galatia; and by the recovery of his Realme, confounded all my fathers pretentions. His ambition seeing it selfe curb'd in the beginning of it's course, put into his thought such fearfull wayes of avenging himselfe, that the onely relating them would be able to make that monster seeme more horrible to you then I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it. My father therefore knowing the weaknesse of the King of Galatia, was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make use of it; he propos'd a peace to him on such conditions, which he thought surely the other would not refuse: it was accepted, and the Princes of Galatia delivered not for a hostage, but for the victime of that accommodation. When my father had that infortunate Princesse in his power, and with her this invincible stranger, (shewing Polexander) crueltie, which alwayes accompanieth ambition, counsell'd him to joyne the pleasure of his revenge to the firme establishment of his authoritie. Though that Devill be mercilesse, yet is it farre more ingenious in the execution of its furie; it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded my father that he should not be sufficiently avenged, if he satisfied himself one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with murthering them; and that temptation prevailed. Thereupon he resolv'd that the Princesse of Galatia should die, but he would have her suffer such a death that might fully glut his furie. That Princesse was no sooner in the chamber where she was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Crowne of Thombut, but she saw her brothers enter, not sumptuous and brave as she had seene them a little before, but as two miserable slaves dragg'd to their execution. Your enemy commanded them to strangle their sister, which bloudy charge disturb'd all sense and reason in them, and their sister upbraided them for their senselesnesse, shewing the stoutnesse of her heart; laugh'd at her husbands threatnings, and made him beleeve that she came to Thombut with no other intent then to murder him. The credulous King flew on her, with an intent to take away the weapon which she made shew to plucke from under her robe; but finding none, he grew the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and with his owne hands cast a bow-string about the necke of that to be deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Princesse. Long might she (if she had listed) have defended her life, but she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that to give it freely, was the last signe of a true courage. The executioners of your enemies cruelties, bound the two ends of the string to the armes of the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and compell'd them with blowes to be themselves their sisters stranglers. Imagine (if it be possible) what their griefes, what their sorrowes, and what their torments were during that of their sister; truely they indured so much of all, that the eldest expired in seeing his sister die; and he whom you see here, had not been alive, if in the height of his anxietie, a long swound had not made him void of all sensibilitie. These dismall beginnings had a sequell worthy of them; the cruell Nigeran whom you banished from Thombut for the enormitie of his offences, forsooke the ordinary place of his retreate, and under favour of the night, slipt into the palace, to execute that which he had often attempted. At his first entrance, he cut the throats of the guard, as they lay buried in sleep and wine; and followed with above a hundred more banished fellowes, flung into the chamber where your enemy feasted with pleasure on the bloudy fruits of his impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and abhorred vengeance. To him he threw an impoyson'd dart, which too well guided (for me most miserable and disinherited orphelin) entred under my father's left breast, and with that blow fell'd him halfe dead on the body of his unfortunate wife. My sister seeing him wounded, ran in, that she might not forsake him in that extremity, but presently being shot with three arrowes, she had the happinesse of neither surviving her father nor her fortune. All the souldiers in the chamber were put to the sword, and justly rewarded for their too wicked obedience. For my selfe, I fled, and strove to save me by the most unfrequented places of the palace; but my flight was bootlesse, for I was found out by Atalas, the most execrable of all Nigeran's companions: many strange injuries he did me, and hurl'd me on the earth, either certainely to have torne out my heart, or to murther me by some most cruell and inhumane way. But by chance finding under my hand an arrow which that monster had let fall, I gave him with it a deep wound in the thigh: assoone as he felt himselfe wounded, he arose, and tearing off part of my haire, dragged me by the rest, crosse the court of the palace. I cannot tell you what he would have done with me, but I can well say that my invincible Protector staid him, and with one blow depriv'd him of the power of doing any more mischiefe.

These my friends are the last night's events; they are so strange and so many, that they would be incredible were they a little remote from us. I desire you not to looke on me now as on her that was lately your Princesse; the dead have made that condition too o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the living to preserve it. I renounce it most willingly, and intreate from you nothing, but that burying in one same tombe the body of my father and the hatred you have borne him; you will be pleased that I may abandon the troublesome titles of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and Mistresse, and partake with you the pleasures which accompany private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Philesia had no sooner ended this oration, which had drawne teares from the eyes of most of the hearers, but there arose a humming noise, such as often happens in a great Assembly, wherein is deliberated the peace and safety of the Weale-publike. At last as those voyces broke out, and besought Philesia to chuse a husband worthy of her, to fill the throne of her ancestors, and by the honourable actions of her government, gaine so much on the hearts of all, that (without injustice) none might absolutely condemn the memory of her father. Alas! (cry'd the Princesse) hurle me not againe into that tempest from whence I am miraculously escaped; suffer me to enjoy (with your selves) the sweets of libertie; let them desire and sue for thee that list, most miserable and glorious condition, which hast nothing but bitternesse and vexation for those that make good use of thee; and art nought but feare and torture to such as misapply it. The mournfull example of the King my father is too recent in my memory, to suffer my selfe to be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with thy deceitfull allurements; and ye my friends, who to heape on me imaginary felicities, would make me lose such as are reall, have sufficiently tri'd that an injunction is no lesse dangerous to those that undergoe it, then to such as put it in execution. Root out therefore that monster that can but work mischiefe, and doe so, that there may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you any condition incompatible with innocence. If the people were astonished to heare the Princesse speak so judiciously, Polexander was far more ravished at it; he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated the Assembly to give him audi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This counsell savouring well to all of the best ranke, the multitude would needs know what 'twas, and assoone as they understood it, they not onely gave their approbation, but in the very instant, proclaimed the Prince of Galatia King of Thombut, and husband to their Queen. Philesia did her utmost that she might not yeeld to the peoples requests, but assoon as Polexander added his to theirs, she could no longer denie them, but descending from her seate, and extending her hand to the Prince of Galatia, I am yours (said she) since my deliverer commands it. The Prince seeing himselfe in an instant brought from a slave to a throne, did what he could to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on so great and so happy a revolution; but (as one should say) taking his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with too much greedinesse, he gave not himselfe leasure to taste it. The people did not so, for these sudden and unexpected changes, gave them cause of pleasure and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rejoycing: they shewed well, that their nature being of it selfe insensible, cannot be roused up but by very urgent spurs, and if it doe not instantly passe from one extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to another, they are not capable of resenting the alterations which betide them. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, finding all things so well disposed, was desirous (before he parted thence) to see them well perfected; in the very instant the officers of Thombut resolv'd with him of what they had to doe, and to that end, went to the palace to take thence the dead, and having left nothing there that might retaine the memory of what passed, so altered the face of the place, that a man might say, they had built their Queene a new palace. Shee was conducted thither with much ceremony, but of all her fortune, nothing so much pleas'd her minde, as the freedome she had to see and intertaine Polexander. Assoone as she was in a place fit to speake in private, she made knowne her affection to him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought him never to forsake her. Polexander taking notice of a great deale of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in that Princesses love, was willing to remedy it with as much sweetnesse; he therefore
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54727:270"/>
told her, she could not blamelesly love him since she was ingaged to another, and that the promise she had made newly to the Prince of Galatia, was a continuall barre for her affecting any other. If it be so (repli'd the Princesse, with a great deale of simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie) I recall the promise I made him, for I can love none but your selfe; and with that she fell a weeping. Polexander, very loath that the Princesses follie should be known abroade, intreated her to strive with her selfe in an important affaire on which depended so much of her reputation; and intimating a great resentment of her affection, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that of all those which had the honour to enjoy her presence, there should be none able to surpasse him in the intention he had to serve her. These words a little pacified or rather sweetned the Princesse discontents; but her sicknesse being not of that kinde which is cured by such slight remedies, the more our new physitian applied them, the worse grew his patient. When he perceived that his being there ruined all that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice would have perfected, he resolv'd to be gone. The very night (therefore) of the Princesses nuptialls, he stole away from the palace, and put himselfe on the Niger in a boate belonging to a merchant of Gheneoa which Diceus had privately retain'd. Let us leave Philesia in quiet, since she is not to be so long, and follow the course of the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the precious charge which floates on it. Though that river runs along a most plaine and eaven champion, yet runs it as swiftly as those flouds which have a far greater declining. The lesser vessels in which the Negro's trafficke, goe thirty five or forty miles a day, and those which use their sailes make as much way more. That wherein Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander imbark'd was of the latter sort, for within five dayes saile he came to the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the kingdome of Gheneoa. 'Tis a great province, and extends it selfe along the Niger above a hundred miles from East to West; it hath Galatia on the North, Melly on the South, Thombut on the East, and the Ocean on the West. The Niger which over-flowes like to Nilus, covers the lands of that Province in the moneths of July, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, and September, and makes them so fertile, that the inhabitants want nothing useful for life. Polexander took great pleasure in seeing the abundance of those places which the ancient Geographers set down for uninhabitable wildernesses; and intertain'd himselfe with his mariner about the customes of that kingdome of Gheneoa, and the fashions or manners and exercises of the Prince. He was informed of many rarities, &amp; by so pleasant a diversion, a little beguiled the continuall discontents, which his little hope of ever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inaccessible Island threw on him: at last he saw the tops of those high Pyramids, which are at the entrie of a famous Temple consecrated by the inhabitants of Gheneoa to the Sun; by little and little the other structures appear'd, and when he came neerer, he distinctly noted the faire scituation of that great village, which sometimes is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and at others, in the midst of the waters. When he came within a mile of it, he descri'd in the open fields a great many men, both horse and foot, which ran against one another as they had been in fight; thereupon hee commanded his boate might be stai'd to see the event of the skirmish, but not well perceiving that which passed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the dust which arose under the men and horses feet, he cau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hee who had escap'd the danger, in lien of flying away whilst the lion was busied, stai'd when he heard his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion cry out: his affection had no sooner made him commit that fault, but his reason caus'd him to repent it; he would saine save himselfe, since he could no more serve him whom the lion had slaine; but he had not time, for the beast in ten or twelve leap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He had torne out the horses intrailes before the Knight could get twenty paces off; and then flew on him, proud of his victories, and presenting him his bloudy pawes, seem'd to call him to the combate. Feare had pusled the man's judgement (even till then when he saw himselfe at the point of losing his life) so far, that he put himselfe in no posture of defending himselfe. Polexander was mov'd at it, and presently with his sword in his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

lion, would see whether it were more difficult to vanquish men then beasts; he wound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his left arme a kinde of a short cloake, which Diceus had bought for him at Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but, and using it as a buckler, stopp'd the fury of his enemy. Those who have related that those beasts beare a respect to the Majesty of Kings, never saw them in an equall estate of hurting one another: the lion with whom Polexander contested, flung on him with a fearfull roaring; but our Heroe making him twice feele the edge of his sword, beli'd the fable that sayes, the rage of that beast is never so great as when hee sees his owne bloud gushing out. When he saw Polexander shield himselfe so well that he could not fasten on him, he drew backe, and flinging presently into the aire with a wonderfull impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, would have thrown himselfe over Polexander, and seis'd on his head in passing; but our Heroe avoyding that attainct, thrust his sword into his belly, and so fortunately met (it glyding upwards) with his heart, that the beast was no sooner pierced, but he fell dead on the sand. During the decision of this combate, the man for whom it was undertaken, was upon his knees, with his hands extended to heaven for his defender's victory; assoone as he saw his prayers were exauc'd, he came to him, and looking on him, was not lesse ravish'd at his brave appearance, then he had beene already at his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation. If thou be not (said he) the Deity whom I adore, thou art at least one of those faire Spirits which incompasse his throne, and (as Ministers of his power) never appeare but for our safegard. What would that Negro have said if he had seen Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before his voyages, his disquiets, and insupportable heat of the South, had not only decai'd the first lustre of his youth, but so sun-burnt him, that he was not to be knowne by such as had not of a long time seen him; yet was he an Angell neer that Devill; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he tooke him for one, and falling at his feet, besought him not to forsake him so soone, but retire to his palace, to repose and unweary himselfe of the paines wherein hee was ingaged for the safety of the others life. Polexander who began to understand the Negro's language, and principally that which was spoken by persons of quality (who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them are called the Surnigay) knew by his speech that he was King of Gheneoa; whereupon he intertain'd him as a Prince, and reply'd (after his accustomed civility) that it it was too great an honour for him to have contributed any thing to the preservation of a life which was so necessary for the weal of so many people; and though Fortune made him wander miserably from Countrey to Countrey, yet he confessed he was indebted to her, since she had presented him an occasion to serve so great a Prince. That King which might be betweene fifty and threescore, fainting by the feeblenesse of his age, as well as through the resentment of the good he had received, let himselfe fall on our Heroe's neck. Deare stranger, said he, since thou art a man as others, subject to sorrowes and afflictions, take part of mine, and stay with me, that by thy company I may receive some comfort af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my late losse. That fierce and cruell beast which thou hast laid stretch'd at my feet, hath devoured the onely hope of my people, and sole delight of my old age; that sonne whom I loved so dearly, is now no more but the woefull remaines of a monsters fury. I have lost him in the flower of his youth; Alas! who shall hereafter oppose the enterprises of mine enemies. Rejoyce ambitious King of Thombut; thy prayers are heard, the rampiers of Gheneoa are demolished, and the buckler of the miserable Apheristidez is torne in pieces. In a word, he whom thou feared'st is now no more. Polexander taking hold of so faire an occasion to divert that Prince's sorrow, told him that he came from Thombut, and as he passed through it, understood that the King thereof had been mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by one called Nigeran. But (said he) in as much as the story of his death is very strange and long, I thinke 'twill be fit to remit the relation to another time. You tell me wonderfull newes (repli'd Apheristidez, (so was that King called) and 'tis fit to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your advice, and stay till we come to the palace for the hearing a matter of so much importance. In the meane while, (if it be possible) let us get hither some of my servants, to have the body of my sonne carried to Gheneoa to be interr'd in the sepulchre of his ancestors. Presently Polexander commanded Diceus to goe into the champion and call in some of the Kings attendants, and he himselfe hastning abroad too, took such paines that he stai'd a Cavalier who was getting to the towne as fast as he could ride; to him he related the accidents which had betided Apheristidez and his sonne, and ingaged him to follow. Backe he came to the King, who dissolv'd into teares, and spent these lame<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

on the torne body of his sonne: Have I (said hee) offered so many victimes for thy birth, and made so many prayers for thy life, that thou shouldest be the prey of an enraged beast? Wert thou by thy glorious actions thus to deserve the favour of that Queene with whom my false Prophets have so long time flattered my hopes? Who will acquit me of the Promise I made to thee, faire Alcidiana? and what other my selfe able to serve thee, shall goe and take on those beloved chaines which fortune and mine age hinder me from wearing? Here he stopped, because in turning he perceiv'd Polexander behinde him. But our Heroe who had heard the name of Alcidiana, was not a little troubled; he grew pale, he trembled, could not speake, and stood as he had beene out of himselfe: at last hee overcame his first motions, and loath that Aphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristidez should perceive his agitation, intreated him to goe into his boat, and take that conveniency of returning to Gheneoa. Apheristidez accepted his offer, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the strand where the boat lay, entered, and commanded the Skipper to steere him straight into the channels of his palace. Our Heroe who had his afflictions as well as that Prince, seated him downe by him, and musing on the name of Alcidiana which he had heard uttered by the King, was so long ere he spake, as his boat was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most descending neere a little Temple but halfe a mile from Gheneoa. That object suddenly dashing on his eyes, awakened his spirit that seemed asleep, though he was in a most violent agitation. He remembred Apheristidez, and to excuse his so long forgetting him, said, that the miseries of his life were so great a burthen, that when he thought never so little on them, he was (as it were) cleane overwhelmed with their excesse. Hardly, (said he) can I make you conceive the greatnesse of my misfortune, if the affliction you lately received, had not taught you how sad and dolefull the losse is of what we love: this being granted, you will be pleased not to thinke it strange, that I have submitted to so powerfull an enemie, and being ingaged in so rude a combate, I have fail'd in such things as reason and duty commanded me. Apheristidez could not heare these excuses without teares, and imbracing our Heroe with a great deale of tendernesse, How unhappy am I (said hee) since I see that from the place whence I expected all my consolation, issues the redoubling of my miseries; and that he who hath pluckedme out of the mouth of the lion, cannot deliver me from the tyrannie of sorrow? Ah deare stranger! perfect that for which you were sent; wipe off my teares, since it is particularly the office of the Ministers of my Deitie; and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of your assistance, confirme me in the opinion I have alwayes had, that there are corporall Angels on earth, as well as there are incorporeall in heaven. Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander, admiring his wisdome, and fairenesse of spirit, spake many things to comfort him; and falling on the affaires of Thombut, related all the accidents which had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and followed the death of that tyrant. Apheristidez, in lieu of answering Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander, lifted his eyes towards the Sunne, And thou hast (said he) reveal'd to me often times that an ill life could have no happy end. After that exclamation, he stucke me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating a while on the prodigies hee had heard, and as he was about to continue his discourse, he saw 'twas time to land, for his boat stopped at the entry into the palace. It was not inriched with marble, nor imbellished with that worke which the Grecians skill invented in former ages for the magnificence of their buildings. All that it had of faire, was it's being invironed with a channell, through which ran a little arme of the river Niger. The forme of it was square, and resembled a cloyster; it was built of chalke and covered with thatch. Polexander entered with Apheristidez, and thought not to finde it better furnished, then that of the Galatian King. But he was astonish'd when he had travers'd a great court full of Negro's, who were handsomely clad in strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked cotton; and when he came into a hall which was for Apheristidez guard, it was hung with carnatian and greene goats skinnes, on which there were small and curious flourishings of gold. But this was nothing in respect of what hee saw in the next hall to it; there was a tapestrie of cloth of gold, and many large turky carpets, which the merchants of Morocco, of Sally, of Argiers, and Tripoly came to trafficke withall in those parts for other merchandises which were more necessary for them. Thence hee entred into a chamber, which might justly be called the golden chamber; all the floare
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:54727:272"/>
was covered with broad lingots of gold, on which were no figures but rayes; the walls were adorned with the same metall and gravings, excepting in the principall face of the roome there stood a statue of massie gold, seated in a throne which represented the Sunne under the countenance of a woman. Assoone as Apheristidez entered here, he began againe his sighes and lamentations, and casting himselfe at the feete of the Idoll, Almazetide is dead, (cri'd hee) and when I shall have followed him, thou shalt not have (O divine Alcidiana) any more of those disinteressed Adorers, who consecrate themselves to thy service for the sole glory of thy name. The words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and increased our Heroe's unrests and impatiencies; yet durst he not shew them, for feare left his curiosity might cause to vanish away that little hope which the name of Alcidiana had raised againe in his minde. That day and many others he let passe without daring to aske Apheristidez who that Alcidiana was, whom he put among the number of the Gods. In the meane time, his winning conversation, his faire personage, and the wonders of his valour, acquir'd so absolute a command in the Kings thoughts, that he forgot (at least in appearance) the losse of his sonne. Now, one day being close alone with him in the golden chamber, some while he kept his eyes fixed on the statue of the feminine Sunne, at last turning them away, spoke thus to Polexander; The tokens you have received of my affection, are as unworthie it selfe, as of that which I owe to the greatnesse of your courage, and the beautie of your mind; yet beleeve not that I can be ingratefull, or so ill an esteemer of occurrences, as not to understand how to give them their just value; my griefes are in part the cause that I have not hitherto performed what I ought, and partly the little need I saw of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ing a businesse which would receive no impairement by a short deferring. But now when I know by divers presages that the true Sunne my father calls me to the fruition of that place, which he hath design'd for me above the starres, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge by two presents alike valuable the love you have shewed me. The first is my crowne, and the second a servitude and chaines, which in truth are of more esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then my Crowne. I will not speake to you of the first, since you might well know since your being here, whether my estate be of worth sufficient to satisfie the hopes of a man of your extraordinary vertue and deserving; it shall be of the other that I will discourse to you. Know therefore that farre off from the mouth of this river which runs through this towne, there is an Island no lesse wonderfull for its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall spring, then for the proprietie it hath by inchantment or nature, to make it selfe invisible to all such as seeke after it. There raignes a Princesse, the miracle of our age, the shame of times past, and the envie of those to come. Her portraicts make it well appeare that she is the lively image of the Sunne her father, or to say better, she is truely a Sunne her selfe. I have endeavoured (as you may see) to represent by the fairest of all metalls, the lustre of that Sunne; but the unskilfull hands which have wrought it, in stead of making the image of it, have onely made knowne how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie the hand of man is to imploy their paines on so faire a subject. In a word, 'tis the Queene Alcidiana, whom to satisfie the most religious passion that shall ever inflame an innocent soule, I have beene willing to adore in private, under the figure of that starre to whom we owe our being and preservation. I may say that my love was borne with that Princesse, and that she knew not the power of her charmes many yeares after I felt them. Heare how that wonder betided; it was not above a yeare after the suffrages and generall votes of all this kingdome, had seated mee on the same throne whence they had expelled my cruell predecessor, when I resolv'd to make a voiage to the chiefe of the Temples dedicated to the Sunne, to give thankes to the Deitie he represents, for the blessings his liberall hand had so largely showred on me. This Temple is in an Island, which stretching towards the Meridionat part of the sea, is seated some fiftie leagues from the mouth of the river Niger. The voiage I made, visited the holy Island, admired the riches and magnificence of the Temple, and by my offerings and sacrifices, strove to make appeare to the Power I worshipped, some little acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of those benefits for which I was redevable. On the very point of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, and imbarking thence for my returne, the Embassadours of Alcidus King of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54727:272"/>
inchanted Isle landed in that holy Island. To the Temple hee came loaden with so great and so rich presents, that the Priests (who were accustomed to receive divers of great value) confessed that Alcidus had outgone the magnificence of all other Kings. Among these offerings, one was a statue of gold, representing a maiden of some nine or ten yeares: O fatall sight to my libertie! I had the curiositie to inquire who that young Ladie was, and Alcidus Embassadours told me she was the divine Alcidiana their Prince's daughter. The relation they made me of the wonderfull beautie and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable wit of that visible Angell so inly touched me, that I returned hither with a wound which is not yet closed up. My love grew to such a height, that it made me forsake my kingdome under a pretext of returning to the Island of the Sunne, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was to saile to that of Alcidiana. A whole yeare was I at sea, and yet could not discover it; then I came backe to that of the Sunne, and saw in the Temple a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traict of that Princesse drawne to the life, which her States had sent thither since the death of her father. Many dayes abode I fixed on that picture, but when I understood that that Princesse was so strictly guarded, that she did not so much as communicate her presence to her most affectionate and considerable subjects; and that her guard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of a great number of strangers whom Chance had throwne on the coasts of her Island, I made a vow to be one of their band, and all my life time to weare the chains of so glorious a servitude. Yet for all my industrie, have I not been able to accomplish my protestation, but imagining by the invincible difficulties I found, that Heaven esteemed me not worthie the service of so admired a Princesse, I betooke me to a course for this kingdome, with an intent to perfect by some other, that which I could not performe in mine owne person. I had a sonne of Alcidiana's age, (with that hee listed his hands to his eyes) and the same whom you saw so cruelly murthered; him I consecrated to Alcidiana, and (with mine owne hand) having put a chaine of gold about his necke in token of his servitude sent to Morocco and Fez, to finde out able masters to instruct him in all that which might equalize him with the great King of the Canaries, the Princes Abdelmelec and Nephizus, or the invincible Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazet. I dare say his actions answered what I expected from him, and but for that not to be exceeded misfortune, which hath robbed me of him in the flower of his youth, I had been now in case to have acquitted (in mine owne thoughts) that which I had promised to Alcidiana: yet doe I not despaire of performing it, if so be my ill Fate hinder you not from beleeving your owne generositie. But why doe I indeavour by my sollicitation to force you to a businesse which can gaine no repute, unlesse the undertaking be extreamely voluntary? Polexander, who had more desire to accept the condition propos'd to him, then Apheristidez had a will he should accept of it, would have interrupted that Prince to let him understand his intentions; but Apheristidez intreating his leave to finish his discourse, I will never give way (said he) that you suddenly put on any resolution for an affaire of so great importance. I give you eight dayes libertie to consider on it; and that tearme expired, you shall make knowne to me (without complaysancy) whether you had rather be King of Gheneoa, then Alcidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's slave. Polexander repli'd, there needed not so long a time to answer to it; there is not more then enough, said Apheristidez, and there withall arising, led Polexander to his most usuall exercises, which were riding and hunting. All the eight dayes after this converse, that Prince gave our Heroe all the most choice contentment could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide the condition of a King of Gheneoa; and laying open to him (as I may say) all his treasure, made knowne the strength of his estate, the riches of his people, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie of governing them, and the advantage he had over all his neighbouring Kings. He did more, he assembled in his palaces all the officers of his Crowne, with the chiefest inhabitants of Gheneoa, and representing to them the valour and eminent vertues of Polexander, wonne them to respect him as his successour. He had besides that wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as in all the time he never spoke to our Heroe of Alcidiana; but assoone as the ninth day came, My sonne (said he) the time is now come wherein you are to let me know your resolution. Time hath not altered it, repli'd Polexander; 'tis still the same it was eight dayes since; I give you thankes for the Crowne you have offered me, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54727:273"/>
accept as a thing more precious, the chaines which tie me to the service of Alcidiana. Is it possible (said Apheristidez) you will make that choice? Yes (my Lord) repli'd the Prince, I elect it as the most honourable fortune can betide me in the world. O said the King! how judicious is your choice, and what infinite happinesse doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise you! deferre not my sonne, deferre not any longer that voiage, goe on to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude you have chosen as to the conquest of all the Universe. But to the end your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition may have better successe then mine, receive a secret which I owe to my pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and troublesome experience; doe not thinke to finde the Inaccessible Island by your Pilots art, nor your long searching. Goe straight to the Isle of the Sunne, and consecrate your selfe to the Deitie. If you follow the instruction which (at leasure) I will give you, without doubt you shall be received into the number of her illustrious slaves: and if Chance which shall be common to you as with them, permit you to see the Embassadours which Alcidiana sends to that holy Isle, to render the tribute of love which she owes to the Author of her race; you shall goe to them in my name, and say, that forcing necessitie, to which all must obey, hindering me from wearing my selfe the fetters of their Queene, I have chosen you to serve her in my place. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt they will receive you, and taking you aboard with them, will conduct you to the blessed abode of that incomparable Princesse. Whilst Apheristidez spoke thus, Polexander in his heart gave infinite thankes to Love and Fortune, and though his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion forbad him, promised them Temples, if they gave good successe to Apheristidez counsell. The King had no sooner ended, but our Heroe casting himselfe at his feet, called him a hundred times his father and benefactor, and besought him (to make his favours perfect) to accelerate all that was necessary for his voiage. Apheristidez pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised him that within six dayes he should put to sea, and indeed caused all his worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men so to speed them, that within that time all his presents were ready. The holy vessells being lanch'd out of the Arcenall, where they were carefully kept, were brought into the channell of the palace. At their arrivall, Apheristidez, who could no longer retard Polexander's departure, long time wept over him; and imbracing him as he had beene his owne sonne, Goe, (said hee) most happie victime, goe and perfume the Altars of a Divinitie, to whom for my offences, I am not permitted to sacrifice my self. And thou visible Deitie, miraculous in thy race, (with that he look'd on the Sunne) reject not the offerings of the least of thine; I know they are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie thine Altars, but thou regardest lesse the richnesse, then the zeale of the Adorers. Receive them then, and by thy good guidance, let this stranger quickly and happily see the issue of his desires and mine. This ejaculation ended, the King was nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After he had thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed him, he imbraced him againe, and in taking his last leave, intreated he might not be forgotten in the solemnitie of the sacrifices. Polexander promised to preserve eternally the memorie of his favours, and so (with Diceus) went to imbarke himself. There were foure great boats on the river, which were appointed for the voiage, and into the fairest of them hee entered with the King of Gheneoa's Embassadours, the Priests which were to present the offerings in his name, and many other men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, who had taken on them the habit of pilgrimes, to goe visit the Temple of that Deitie whom they thought to be the Author of their being.

Now, one day when those Priests and hee seriously disputed of Religion, I would saine have you tell me, said hee, why you conceale from the people the light you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy; and in stead of spiritualizing their beliefe, and make them comprehend the Deity to be a Spirit; why tie you them to a Religion altogether corporeall, to a Religion of stockes and stones, I meane to the adoration of Idolls?

                  </gap>rue: The manner (repli'd they) of all such as would excirpate the worship of the Divinity, is to publish, that it is neither enough pure, nor sufficiently separated from corporeall things. That great Impostor which rules yet in the mindes of halfe the world, and whose Sectaries daily strive to corrupt the purity of our beliefe; introduced the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of his Alcoran, by breaking the many Images of the Divinity, and plucking downe the Altars that were consecrated to them. If the Deitie would that we should adore it in spirit, and that Religion should have nothing materiall and sensible, it would never have created man, but for witnesses and chanters of its glory, (pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Doe not therefore imagine it to be Idolatry, to represent the Divinity by palpable figures; and if I dare-say so, to incorporate that eternall Spirit, to the end to communicate it more easily to men. 'Tis true wee adore the Sunne, though hee be but a creature: but doe you beleeve wee worship him because of himselfe? No such matter.

In the meane time the vessells sail'd on, and at last arrived where the Niger discharges it selfe into the Ocean.

In it Polexander imbarked with the rest, after they had paid the due customes to the King of the Countrey, and entered the Ocean with an East winde, which seemed (so favourable it was) to be sent by the Sun himselfe for the waftage and guidance of his adorers. When they had lost sight of land, they a little altered their course, and leaving the Isles of Cape Verd on the South, steered full North: eight dayes together they had a calme so fit for their voyage, that they made as much way as if the winde had blowne a fresher

gale then it did. The twelfth day, those which were above in the masts descri'd the Isle of the Sunne, and cryed out thrice, The holy Land. At that word, (as pleasing to the Negro's eares, as an excellent consort to a melancholy man) the Priests caused divers perfuming pots of gold to be brought, and throwing into them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes of all sorts, sent to the Sunne a fume which represented the heat of their zeale, and the purity of their intentions. After that sacrifice, they offered ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of praise, and began a Hymne which lasted till the ship was entered the port of the Island of the Sunne. They arrived at the very houre of that starres setting, and seeing him more glorious then at his high Noone-sted, they thought hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced at their comming, and went to adorne himselfe in the night with all the treasures hee inricheth the Orient, to be with the more extraordinary lustre and glory at the solemnity of their Sacrifices.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S soone as the sacred vessell was in the port, the mariners crowned the poope and the masts with branches of palme-trees, and placed among those crownes, an image of the Sunne made of gold, and covered it with precious stones as radiant as carbuncles. The Priests in the meane time ended their Hymne, and deputed one from amongst them, to goe and advertise the Arch-priest and Clergy of the Sunne, of their arrivall, and get leave from them that they might land. The Chiefe Priest having assembled the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Temple, to understand from them their ancient customes, and hearing on what conditions the Embassadours of Kings, and Pilgrims were wont to be received into the Isle; sent to those of Gheneoa, that the next morning at day breake they might come on shore, and prepare themselves for the Ceremonies of the Sacrifice. This answer made all the Africans to spend the whole night in prayer, and in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions worthy the sanctity of the place they were going to visit. Polexander who in himselfe hoped for a great deale of happinesse by that voiage, would not contradict his conductors in any thing they would exact from him; he intimated that he was truely a victime, who having no other will then theirs who brought him to the sacrifice, offered himselfe, not to the Sunne adored in that Island, but to him whose heat he felt though he saw not the light of it. Those who had the charge of purifying and adorning him, brought him into a cabin of the ship appointed for that Ceremony; where the Priests presently incompassed him with divers little silver pans, in which they burnt severall perfumes, and sprinkled on his head and arme some of the sea-water. After that they put him into a bathe of fresh water, perfumed and anointed him againe with excellent Pomata's, and then putting on him a shirt of very fine linnen, tooke him out: two of the chiefest Priests, put on his legs buskins made of a serpents skin, covered with little golden skales; after that, they put on him a long vestment all streaked with threads of the same metall, which being gathered up on the right shoulder, and fastned with but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonings of diamonds, hid his left arme, and the other was at liberty. His head-tire was very handsome and comely, being a bonnet or cap compos'd of a gold tinsell, and covered with many Ostrich feathers, amongst which shin'd out a golden Sunne which serv'd for the band. For the last ornament, they put a coller of gold about his necke, and two others about his legs, with chaines of the same mettall, in signe that hee was consecrated to the Sunne. Assoone as that visible Divinity dispersed his first rayes on the rockes which inviron his Island; all the Pilgrims were commanded to goe on shore, and stay there every one with his offering till they had order to march forward. Fifty of the King of Gheneoa's slaves followed the Pilgrims, some carrying vessels of palme and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54727:275"/>
cedar, others censers of gold and silver, and in all of them, male incense, and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes which Africa borrowes of Arabia. After these slaves went the Kings Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, then followed the Priests, excepting the two principall which came after Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander; his robe was so long, that Diceus was appointed to beare up the traine with the ends of the chaines. Those who saw Polexander so full of Majesty, and making him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the chiefe pompe of his triumph, could not refraine their sighes and teares; and knowing the hazard he ran, prayed for his preservation, and besought their God, that the ball whereon his name was to be ingraven might not fall into the hand of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priest. The good people receiving command to march on, put themselves foure in ranke, and so went to the Temple which was but two miles from the sea. The Hymne which the Priests begun at their parting from the shore, ended not but in the midst of a long passage of cedars, which had been expresly planted to defend the Pilgrims from the excessive heate of the Sunne, and to serve them for a place of retreate at such hours as the Temple was kept shut. Those of Gheneoa, obeying the Master of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, stai'd in that faire walke, and put themselves in file on each side to leave the passage free. Their Clergy meeting with those of the Sunne at the gates of the Temple, made all the places around resound againe with new songs and new anthems. Apheristidez Embassadours cast themselves at the feet of the Arch-priest, and receiving his benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the imposition of his hands, told him they were sent by the King their Master to offer to the Sunne his father in Sacrifice both his heart and his Crowne; and to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to him a victime the most accomplished, that ever his life-giving light had ever produced on the face of the earth, With that they turned them to Polexander, and beckned him to come neere: the African Priests advanced too, and causing him to kneele, tooke the ends of the chaines which Diceus carried, and presented them to the soveraigne Prelate of the Sunne. After that venerable old man had slightly touched Polexander with a golden rod which he held in his hand, he recoyl'd two or three paces to look on him; but he had scarce fix'd his eyes on his person, when a sudden trembling seised the Priest from head to foot, and testified by his agitations, that his Deitie did not communicate himselfe to him with lesse violence then the Grecian Apollo conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s Prophetesses. The God (said he to all the Assembly) whom you come to adore, hath a very private contentment in your arrivall; his splendor which is seene by our soules, in a greater lustre then it appeares to our eyes, makes me feele and know by extraordinary agitations, that your devotions and offerings were never so pleasing unto him. Come then my affected children, and well worthy your father, and pray inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly for us who are his servants, but servants that deserve his anger and reprobation rather then the honour of presenting him with your offerings. After hee had spoke thus, he betooke himselfe againe with his Clergy to the way which led to the Temple; and those of Africa following him through the files of Pilgrims, entered that stately and proud structure. The figure of it was round, though it were inclosed with foure mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble walls, which made a perfect quadrangle; without, were three rankes of columnes, of Porphire, of Jasper, and Serpentine, which were placed rather for ornament then necessitie; though in sight they bore up some arches which on all sides sustained the bulke of the maine edifice. Just in the middle of the Temple was a great Dome, born up by two rowes of white marble columnes, which served but for the basis to a second ranke of pillars all of massie gold: the columnes were inriched with so many diamonds, that when the Sunne shone on them, all those within the Temple were dazeled with the great lustre that reflected from them. The embowed roofe of that Dome as well as of all the Temple, was composed of an infinite number of stones set together with so much art, that imagination could figure to it selfe nothing which the eye met not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the intermixture of those stones, and the variety of their colours. The floore was inriched with an inlaid worke of Agats, Cornalines, and other curious stones: in the center of that pavement which was just under that of the Dome, was an Altar, which seem'd to be made of one sole diamond, cut. For the workman, for a master-piece of his art, had covered the sides of the Altar with steele extreamely polished, and in it had enchaced the diamonds with so much cunning, that to looke on them a little way off, they blended one within another, that it seemed they made but one stone, This Altar
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54727:275"/>
was never besmear'd with any bloody victimes, nor was it made for that purpose. For though the Basis were square, yet it was sphericall on the top, and nothing could be plac'd there but a violl of gold, which intimated by its stopp'd mouth, that the Deity whom they came to adore in that place was to be worshipped in silence. About that Altar, there were twelve others by which (as 'twas held) were represented the twelve signes of the Zodiack, or the twelve moneths of the yeare. On these, the Pilgrims lai'd their offering, and the Priests performe their Sacrifices, but not bloody-ones, because they thought it a sacriledge, rather then an act of adoration, to deprive those creatures of life, to make themselves acceptable to the Divinity which gave it them. On the same Altars likewise the King of Gheneoa's Embassadors laid (as delivered into the hands of their god himselfe) the Presents that were consecrated unto him. The other Pilgrims (every one) acquitted themselves of their duty by gifts answerable to their zeale and ability. The Priests belonging to the Temple, began presently the oraizons which precede the solemne sacrifice which was afterwards celebrated, being onely of Praise, Thanksgiving, and Invocations for the generall good of the whole world. These being ended, the Arch-Priest threw the incense on the holy hearths, and whil'st the smoak mounted with the private praiers of all towards that eternall Temple, which the invisible Sun hath built with his owne hands, the soveraigne Prelate ascended a throne of gold, which was rais'd aside the Altars, and lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, made a long prayer. After which the people ratified it with a great shout or ejaculation, and staying a few minutes longer in meditation, went out of the Temple, and retir'd to such places as were appointed to lodge the Pilgrims. The King of Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neoa's Embassadors, the Priests, and such of quality as came with them, were lodg'd in the Appartment of the Arch-Prelate, and entertain'd with a magnificence worthy the purity of the place. For Polexander, hee was brought into the Quarter of the noble Slaves; and though it was not the custome to allow any of that condition Servants from abroad, yet the Chiefe-Priest gave way for Diceus to waite on Polexander. The Quarter where he was lodg'd was sever'd by a high wall from that of the vulgar slaves, and made well appeare by the beauty of the lodgings, and richnesse of the furniture, how great and powerfull the Master was whose Slaves were so stately and so sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously lodged. Our Heroe was no sooner in his chamber, but he put off aswell all his saddish Ornaments, as his his triumphant; and being laid on a little bed cover'd with branches of Palme-tree, at last (said he) Diceus, I am arriv'd at a place where I have for a long time wished me. Your Majesty (repli'd Diceus) may please to pardon me, if I take the boldnesse to say that your greatest enemies could not wish you worse. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto you have run such hazzards, wherein in all likelihood you might have perish'd. I have beheld you in those places where your liberty was so extreamly ingaged, that I should have been void of Judgement, had I ever thought it in possibility to be recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; yet have you never been so captivated, nor in so great danger of your life as you are among these Idolaters. You may imagine, that by some miracle of good fortune, (which shall betide no man knowes when) you may deliver your selfe out of a prison, which is the more to be fear'd by being held sacred, and meet with a ship which mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously too shall wast you to Alcidiana's Island: But put the case it be so, who can assure you that you have yet two daies more to live, since but to morrow (if it be true what a Priest of this Island lately told me) you shall be put among the number of the victimes appointed for the bloody sacrifice, and next day too, the Arch-Priest may in drawing the lot, light on the ball whereon your Name shall be engraven? Friend, (repli'd Polexander) thy thoughts leave not their old object, but fasten themselves per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually on such things as are no more. But if thou wilt as earnestly take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration what is to come, as that which is pass'd, and be as clear-sighted as I am, thou shalt behold such felicities as will make thee forget all our former miseries. Know, Diceus, know, that my fortune is alter'd, and my long wandrings have found their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods in this Island; and after my long and vaine search after the Inaccessible Island, at last Love, Time, and Fortune, and what is more admirable, Alcidiana her selfe leads me (as it were by the hand) to the place where resides all my quiet and felicity. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that this place is questionlesse the very same, whither the Kings of the Inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54727:276"/>
Island have sent yearly to present to the Sun the sacrifice of their Alliance. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus interrupting the King his Master, and falling at his feet; Alas! Sir, (said he) let your Majesty be pleas'd that I may know how you came to any certaine intelligence of these happy intimations. Love (repli'd Polexander) tells me this truth, and I feele so great an alteration in my selfe, that it is impossible to proceed from any thing but that important Verity. How mightily doe I suspect those Authors, Sir, (repii'd Diceus coldly) and how much doe I feare lest Love deceive you with that Imagination aswell as he hath done in all others? Rest thy self satisfied (answered the Prince) in this, that I am not wont to flatter my selfe with vaine hopes. But that we may contest no longer, doe thou learne among those that are shut up with us, what Princes usually send their Embassadors and offrings hither, and above all, forget not to know (if thou can'st) how long the Arch-Priest hath been in his Office, and by what meanes he came to it. For I have a suspicion, which contributes much to the joy which flashes more in my heart then is to be seen in my countenance. I have such a suspicion too, aswell as your Majesty, (said Diceus) but I see so little likelihood, that I rather hold it for a dreame which I have, as waking as I am, rather then for a rationall imagination. Goe, I tell thee, (repli'd Polexander) and after thine ordinary addresse hath got thee some famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity among my companions, faile not in those two businesses I commanded thee. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander had no sooner ended, but two slaves chain'd with gold as himselfe entred his chamber, and intimating the desire they had to know so worthy a companion of their fortune, spoke to him all that which civility puts into the mindes of men in whom is seen an admirable breeding joyn'd to a birth of most Eminence. Polexander, after his wonted seemlinesse and grace, welcom'd the two famous slaves, and rendring them their complements with interest, astonish'd them with his Eloquence; farre more then he had done with the sweetnesse and Majesty which flew from his face, spight of all the scorching heate of the torrid Zone. The civilities pass'd, they sate down all three on one bed, and whil'st Diceus was enquiring after that which his Master had given him in charge, they entertained themselves with the cruell condition annexed to their servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The eldest, which was not above eight and twenty or thirty yeares old, and who by his olive complexion, made him known to be an African, with a great sigh began thus: I confesse (said hee to Polexander) that Death, which I have so often wished for, doth not only begin to be fearfull to me, but the further I absent my selfe from the cause that makes me desire it, the more doth the horror of its approaching make me repent my too inconsiderate engaging my selfe to the wearing of the chaines I have on me. Is it possible (repli'd Polexander) that Death should be able to terrifie a man, who never fear'd to defie it in those places where it hath alwaies been victorious? In that (repli'd the Slave) I confesse my weaknesse, and would (were it permitted me to break off my chaines) run into the midst of a battle, to receive from the hand of some valiant man, that death which I may meet with here dishonourably, from some wretched Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer. Ah Benzaida! (said he, lifting up his eies) how mortall hath thy beauty been to me? or to speak more truly, how fatall have the furious fits of my jealousie been to us both? Polexander looking earnestly on the Slave, Your words (said he) make mee call to minde the tragicall end of a Lady which bare the same name you but now called on. She was indeed a personage for beauty and generousnesse to be admired, and well worthy the blood of the Kings of Granado. Infortunate man that I am! (cri'd the Slave) 'tis the same Princesse whom I now vainly call upon. Her beauty made me her servant, before the ambition of Spaine had laid waste my deare Countrey. But what remembrest thou, perfidious and abominable Menocenarez? Impose thy sorrowes an eternall silence, and involve (if it be possible) in that darknesse which shall never have end, those horrible treasons by which thy unbridled passion deliver'd thy King and Countrey into the hands of the Usurpers. With that, the Slave was silent, and not able to suppresse his teares, cover'd his face with his hand, that he might weep at more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Polexander, desirous to take him out of that agony, I (said he) have knowne your name in the city of Fez. I have heard Benzaida utter against you all that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a wronged Lady could make her invent, yet rather pity then hate her. For if her love have brought you into this servitude, that which shee bare to the ingratefull
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54727:276"/>
Prince of Morocco, made her turne on her selfe the point of that ponyard which shee had provided to avenge her selfe on that Infidell. 'Twas that traytor (said the Slave) who after he had strook the steele into the heart of Benzaida, (for he was the cause) continually whetted that knife which is prepared to cut my throat. But since you know the generall misfortunes of my Countrey, I will relate the principall causes, and tell you that Ferdinand and Isabella are beholding to my treason more then to their owne power for the conquest of the kingdome of Granado. The unfortunate King (under whose government that brave Province was lost) was one of those timerous Princes, who are so far from any intention of extending the limits of their kingdomes by forcible incroaching on their neighbours Territories, that they scarce have courage to oppose the enterprises of their owne enemies. Two yeares before the truce was broken betwixt the Spanyards and the Moores, my ill fate made me cast mine eyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Benzaida. I saw her faire, for she was then in the prime of her age, and may well say, that in the very instant I began to die of a death which is not yet ended. When I lost my liberty I lost my reason, and not considering that I was but onely on ordinary knight, my ambitious thoughts made me beleeve that my Nation owéd not the Empire and States it possessed, to men of a royall extraction, but to great, invincible, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing courages, such as were Masters of the fortunes of Monarches themselves. I therefore sought out the most fit meanes to get me the favour of Benzaida, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be of an exceeding high spirit, and (particularly) esteemed men of valour, I betook me to the Warres. I dare say, and so will my greatest enemies too, that for eighteen moneths together, I was plac'd as an inexpugnable Fort on the Frontiers of Granado, against the invasions of Ferdinand. My name was spread throughout all Spayne. The Court of Granado was fill'd with it, and the King my Master seeing himselfe secure under mine arme, omitted nothing that might oblige me to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of a service that was so advantageous unto him. The affaires of Castile recalling Ferdinand and Isabella into their owne Territories, our frontiers were left in peace. I then returned to Granado, and the honours I received there, rather beseem'd a King that triumphes, then a Subject whose services had made him usefull. I was not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Princes particular pleasures, but to his Counsels; and I dare say, that if my my love to Benzaida had not troubled my senses and taken away courage, I had put the Granadians in an estate of regaining on the Spanyards all those Kingdomes which they have lost within six hundred yeares. But that furious passion possessing all the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my soule, I was not able to reflect on any thing. My thoughrs, my designes, and my wishes, had onely the enjoying of Benzaida for their object. I betray'd the publique affaires to adjust and fit them to my private contentment, and subverted the Counsells of the Sages, by the authority which my pass'd-actions had gain'd me. In the meane while, I burnt in secret, and durst not make known to Benzaida that she had kindled the fire. But at last the violence of my disease forcing me to forget all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, I imagined that I should not be more unhappy then so many others, who had ventur'd on the like boldnesse. One day therefore, as Benzaida walk'd in the Palace Garden, only accompanied with her maides of honour, I met her, as it were by chance, and feigning to be much surpris'd at the encounter, made a low reverence and retired She smil'd at my astonishment, and calling me, What (said she) if I were a Castillian, you cannot witnesse a greater mislike of me? I repli'd (even trembling) Madam, you may please to pardon me, if I say your Highnesse doth your self a great deale of wrong by so unjust a comparison. I have indeed an extreame aversion to the enemies of your state, but their presence shall never amaze me. For you, Madam, whom I am not to look upon but with respect; I confesse, that as often as I have the honour to see you, my soule is full of dread and astonishment; but of such a religious astonishment and devoute feare, as our Alphaquies command us to feele when we approach things divine and holy. Your words (repli'd Benzaida) more surprise me, then my encounter did you. I never thought that a man train'd up in warre, and who all his life time breath'd nought but blood and battles, was capable of so much and so high a jeering. I answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that brutishnesse whereof your Highnesse accuseth me under such words as may seeme obliging, is not that which hath hitherto made me delight in the acts of warre
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54727:277"/>
A fairer cause compell'd me to so noble effects; and did I not feare to violate the lawes prescrib'd me by my subjection, I would bring your Highnesse to confesse, that till now I have not been happy enough to be well known of her. I will never (said Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida) take you for my Interpreter, since you come no clearer off in your explications. I would have onely said that I thought it very strange, how a man accustom'd to the serious discourse of warre, could be so skill'd in those effeminate termes, wherewithall both delicacy and idlenesse have compass'd the Courtiers language. Your Highnesse then (said I) must hate that which is most to be beloved amongst us, if you condemne a language which Love himself hath invented, to render all things faire and eminent, the testimony they deserve from all mens acknowledgements. This language (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd Benzaida) is as ridiculous as its Author, and though Spaine had nothing strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make you give up your armes, yet I will undertake to have the better, when you dare defend so bad a cause. You have already carried away one part of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (I repli'd) but since I am sure of the other, be pleas'd, Madam, that I leave your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, lest I may be engaged either to ore'come you, or to waive all verity and my self. With that I made her a low Reverence, and went away, that she might have the more time to meditate at pleasure, and may be to comprehend the meaning of what I had spoken. All things hap'ned as I had fore-thought: For the first time that I saw Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaida againe, she darted such looks on me as were answerable to lightning; and when I came neere her, Goe, (said she very softly) goe, bold and rash Man, and if you value your life, beware lest your extravagancy be known to any whosoever. Before I could open my mouth to reply, she retir'd; and to expresse to you well at this instant what I then felt, I must needs say, that from the height of heaven she threw me into the depth of hell. For a moneth together I assai'd all meanes that were to be imagined, for the bringing her to understand the integrity and innocency of my affection; but that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance was in her thought a new fault, and the more I endeavoured to come neere her, the more I augmented her desire of flying me. After all my patience was quite exhausted, and that I knew I was hated for no other cause then the not being a Prince: I resolv'd on the most bold and rash designe that ever entred the thought of a Lover. I intended to make my selfe King of Granado. But well fare thinking, that such an Enterprise could have no successe but by great revolutions, I thought it was best to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin them by drawing the warre into the Kingdome. Presently I sent (unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hand) to solicite the King of Spaines Officers, and represented to them the facility of making themselves Masters of Granado, if so be they would make me of their party. To this advice of mine they gave care, and I was promis'd no lesse then a Crown, if I brought it to passe. To witnesse therefore to the Spanyards, that I promis'd nothing but what I would make good, I went and surpris'd one of their Townes, and by that breath enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Ferdinand to besiege Malago. Whil'st I thus laid the foundation of my imaginary Kingdome, the Granadians accelerating their owne ruine, took armes against one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and during their intestine broyles, gave way for the common enemy to fortifie himselfe. So well had I provided all things, that I had been King of Granado and the possessour of Benzaida, if the Moores had persevered in the revolt I had engaged them. But Boabdilez after he had subdued his enemies, and made himself strongest in Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, compell'd me to follow his fortune, that I might not give over my designe. Some little time before the young Prince of Fez was come to Granado, and obtain'd by his quality that which I could not get by my many and important services, and actions of such fame as might have obscur'd the birth of that barbarous Prince. Assoone as I came to Court, I understood that Benzaida was passionately in love with him; but the insolent Prince, as a proud Conquerour, who mispriseth a victory easily gotten, thought he should humble himself too much in contributing but a cold complacency to that Princesse's affection. Assoone as I heard that unwelcome newes, my love became a furious jealousie; and I presently resolv'd with my selfe the death of my Rivall; but before I could be in a fit place where I might freely be permitted to challenge him, I was commanded by the King to oppose the progresse of the Spanish Army, and retaine in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience those Townes, which since the taking of Baza would have yeelded to the conquering party. I was in all places of importance, and reducing all to their devoyr,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54727:277"/>
return'd to Granado to satisfie my Jealousie; but the Prince of Fez was gone. Hee had repass'd the sea without taking any leave of Boabdilez. Benzaida seem'd to me so sad and disconsolate, that I doubted no more of her passion. For mine owne part, I strove to suppresse my griefe, and smother my first motions, to let her know her fault, or at least to entreat some pity for that offence which her beauty had been the first cause of. She seem'd extrremly enraged when I durst come neer her, and upbraiding me more then ever for my impudence and rashnesse, told me boldly, that my malipertnes should have been chastised long agone. The griefe and vexation to see my selfe so ill treated by the Princesse, made me resolve to combine with Spaine, for the ruine of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that I might have the comfort to see a great many Companions in my misery. Besides, I thought that when Benzaida had lost her Crowne, she would give over her pride, and stand not so obstinatly in desiring none but Kings for her Lovers. I straight sent my Agen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s to Valedolid, and my information putting all Spaine in armes, Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand and Isabella came and besieg'd the city of Granado. But I was not so fortunate as to have the sad contentment to see that Towne in the flame, I had lighted to avenge me of its Princesse. For at the beginning of the Siege Benzaida stole out of the city in a mans habit, with a Moorish Prince called Tyndarache, and sail'd into Africa, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low (shamefully) the perfidious Prince of Fez. Her losse made me take new counsell. I renounc'd all my abominable pretentions, and abandoning my Countrey, went to Morocco, to stab (if I could) in his very throne the Traytor which triumph'd o're all my hopes and travells. But I neither found Benzaida nor her Lover there; and after I had enquir'd of all such as were likely to tell me newes of him, I understood that he was put to sea to follow a faire young Canarian, call'd Ennoramita, with whom he was passionately fallen in love. I imbarck'd me againe in the same vessell that brought me out of Europe into Africa, and was about six moneths searching on all sides for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Ravisher of my happinesse. But all my diligent inquisition being bootlesse, and a tempest shipwracking me on this Isle, I was (whether I would or no) pluck'd out of the sea by two flaves which fish'd by the sea side. To this house they brought me, and then was I presented to the Chief priest. At the very first, I made known to him my intent of mischieving my selfe, but he instructing one how pernicious my resolution would be to my soul, put me clean off from committing homicide on my self. Yet was I above three moneths in overcoming my despair. Continually I griev'd for Benzaida, as ingratefull as she was to me, and when I call'd to minde her love to an Infidell, I grew so enraged, that to hinder off the effects of my fury, they were forc'd to put me into the custody of two Priests. They told me that if I had so eager and violent a desire to die, there was no speedier nor more innocent meanes, then to make my selfe the slave of that God whom they adored, and attend the lot which should give a period to my life and miseries. I was surpris'd with their proposition. But a little while after, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with what bravenesse and jollity one of this Temples slaves came to his death, I made a vow to weare the chaines of the Sun, and to die for his service in that very place where that generous victime had been immolated. When the slave had thus ended the relation of his crime and love, he was (as it were) transported with fury. He arose from between Polexander and his Companion, and speaking to one that heard him not; Thou hast then (cri'd he) O ingratefull Princesse, preferr'd a violent death before the fidelity of a Lover that was not altogether unworthy thy respect? Thou hast, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Benzaida, and unhappy aswell as I, in thine inclinations, lov'd the Traytor which contemn'd thee; and treading on the sweetnesse and timidity of thy sex, wash'd thy hands in thine owne blood? O! what a sad but powerfull example art thou to me, to avenge my selfe in my turne, and at last triumph o're that cruell one, to whom my perpetuall flames were despicable. Yes, Benzaida, I will imitate thee, and if the lot doe not quickly put me into the hands of the Executioners, I will act mine own destiny, and get from the power of my reason, what I could not obtaine from the giddinesse and uncertainty of Chance. With that he stood mute. A too piercing griefe, and extreame violent contention of thought, stopping his spirits in their source, hindred their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating themselves to the parts they animated; and the body being abandon'd of so necessary an assistance, fell (as dead) at Polexanders feet. His fall was not so heavy
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54727:278"/>
as it might have been, if the Prince, seeing him staggering, had not caught hold on him; and being not strong enough to stoppe the fall, yet he hindred the violence of it. With the aide of the other slave he rais'd him up, and laid him on the bed they had sate on whil'st they discoursed together. The unfortunate man quickly recover'd from his fainting, and calling upon death with as much fervency as he had made shew to fear it at the beginning of his discourse, made plainely appeare, how changing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weigh'd the desires are of such who without any reservation give themselves over to the mercy of their own passions. Polexander, who had learn't by his own infirmities not to be too rigorous in censuring another mans, comforted the Moore with all that his brave spirit could furnish him, either to extenuate the enormity of his treachery by the old excuse which men borrow from the power Love, or to justifie it by the example of many other Lovers. This discourse got somewhat on the slave, but not enough to bring him wholly to himselfe. He took leave of our Heroe with his Companion, and retir'd into his lodging; passing there the most dreadfull night that despaire and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish could bring on a man that would not live and yet fear'd to die. Diceus, in the meane while who had been abroad till night, came back to his Master, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance that well witness'd the content of his minde. Yet durst he not make knowne what he had learnt, because some Officers belonging to the Temple came in with him, to advertise Polexander of that whereto his condition bound him. To put him in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of his charge, he was brought to the Temple, and told him, the last slave that was admitted, ought to watch on the Dome of the Temple all that night long, which suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Eve of the great sacrifices, and there from houre to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oure to awaken by a Cry all such as were shut up within the close of the Temple, that they might betake themselves to prayers and prepare for the next mornings Solemnization. Polexander thought that nights work a little too troublesome, yet conceiving 'twas not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd withall, he resolv'd to watch out the night on the top of the Dome. They brought him up to it by a winding staire very artificially contriv'd within the thicknesse of the wall; and when hee was mounted, he came into a little chamber wherein he might as well stand upright as sit. According to the ancient custome, he lighted about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or sixscore lampes, which were about the Dome; amongst which there were twelve, whose matches were so equally measured, that at every houre one of them was to goe out, whereby Polexander might precisely know when he was bound to make his Out-cry. In this exercise he spent the night, and was not taken from that station till he had cri'd out thrice that the God of that Island began to guild the Dome of his Temple. Hee acquitted himselfe so well of his charge to the content of the Priests that he was applauded by all, and conducted to a place where he might take amends for his watching and fasting. Yet hee eate but little, but was presently brought to his lodging, and laid with as much care and delicacy as if he had been in his owne Palace. Five or six houres hee slept, and was call'd up by the same persons who brought him to bed. Diceus was of the number, who getting leave to make ready his Master, was so straitned by those about him, that he had scarce liberty to tell his Prince, he should hope still, and that a great many of his conjectures were true. Assoone as our Heroe had on all his ornaments which he wore the day before, he was brought into the Hall, where all the other slaves were assembled. When every one had taken the ranke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his admittance, the Embassadours and Pilgrims of quality were plac'd on scaffolds. After that, the Chiefe-Prelate presently entred clad in his Pontificiall vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ascending a throne like to that in the Temple, (by the waving of his hand) impos'd silence on all the Company; and when he perceiv'd that all were attentive, hee turn'd himself to the slaves, surnam'd the Noble, and spake thus to them:</p>
               <p>One of you this day must by the losse of a miserable life purchase the honour to die for a God, and the felicity of a condition which is to continue as long as the Power that promiseth it. I would not at the very first have laid before your eyes that dreadfull Image, which might even amaze men voide of all feare, if I knew not that your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage being as great as your zeale, and the oblation you make of your selfe to our Deity being a voluntary offering, I should lessen somewhat of your vertue, if I went about to dispose you for death by long persuasions. And indeed, I should most vainly undertake it,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:54727:278"/>
since I see in your countenances so great a desire to shed your blood for the honour of him to whom you owe it, that I doubt not but there would be a most ardent contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst you who should offer himselfe first, if the precise will of our God had not prescrib'd the order by which he brings you to him. What a brave emulation is this, generous Sacrifices? and how should your magnanimity confirme, in the resolution to die, those who being well perswaded of the future estate of soules, look on their bodies as on cruell tyrants which keep them bound in loathsom and obscure prisons. 'Tis true, you live already an heavenly life, since you goe to your death with a firme belief that the same steele which deprives you of life, puts you in possession of a better. Presently, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven presently, one of you shall receive that worthy guerdon of his faith, and with the same eies wherewithall he sees the lively image of that Deitie which he confesseth by the voice of his blood, he is most assured to see him himselfe in the mid'st of his glory. The Chiefe-Prelate having thus finish'd his Exhortation, foure Priests came out of a Chappel carrying on their shoulders a table cover'd with plates of gold, and on it a large vessell of Crystall of the rock, in which were the names of all the noble Slaves. The expectation of all the Spectators was doubled at sight of that fatall Vessell; and though among the Slaves there were some that could not chuse but look pale on it, yet they all made shew as if they were alike prepared for death. Polexander had not so much as the slightest apprehension, whether because he thought, that Death respecting him in the most dangers and shipwracks, would not be so daring as to set upon him in the haven; or whether he beleev'd his life not to be in the disposall of Chance, but depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded absolutely on that eternall Providence, which assignes a beginning and end to all things. His passion adding many other considerations to these, perswaded him, that in exposing himselfe to death so voluntary for Alcidiana, he gave her such proofes of constancy and fidelity as farre excelled all those he had ever rendred her. But when Reason got the upper hand and came to be heard, she shew'd him all things on the right side they were to be look'd on, and made him see how most vainly he precipitated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to an infallible death, since Alcidiana being not a God to know his intentions, he might beleeve that when she came to heare of his death, (which may be might never happen) she could call it no other then a mischance, or a blow of Despaire. This thought made him not repent of what he had done; but bringing him to bewaile his Fate, I must (said he to himself) faire Princesse, confesse my death is lesse welcome to me then it should be, if it were known to you. Long, long agoe, I was resolv'd to die, since your just anger thought it not fit that I should live, and that Fortune deni'd me the happinesse of your sight. But I could wish to die in some place where your faire eies might be the witnesses of my death, that so nothing might hinder you from beleeving that I died for you onely. When by some exceeding good hap, it may so betide that the newes of my last houre shall come to your knowledge; what can I promise my self by it, if you be ignorant of the cause? The remembrance of me will be no lesse odious to you then was my life, and may be you will account the death I have suffer'd as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for my disobedience in swerving from what she had commanded me. I dare speak it, Alcidiana, and it is most true, I have had sufficient tokens of the care heaven hath had to perswade me that my ill Face proceeds onely from your indignation; and that I could well have o'repass'd my miseries, if the sentence you have pronounc'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me had not made them eternall. Here he stop'd, and thinking on what he had said, condemn'd it, as subverting that extreame generousnesse which had been alwaies annexed to his passion. He even grew angry with his owne wisedome, and beginning againe with much sorrow, How cowardly and perfidious am I (said he) to have more consideration of my self then of that incomparable beauty for whom I suffer? In lieu of giving thanks for the miseries she would have me undergoe, and run to my death, since I can give her no other testimony of my humblest servitude; I would articulate with her, finde waies of moderating her sentence, not performe her commands but conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally chuse mine owne punishment, and in short not present my selfe to the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, till I were assured of the Crowne. Farre, farre from me be this selfe-love. I here (faire Alcidiana) quit it for ever. I desire death, since you command it. I neither look for comfort nor recompence, but goe instantly to present me to the steele that
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:54727:279"/>
must end me, with as much content as if it were in your owne hands. Polexander, transported with these imaginations, went out of his station, and had he not been with-held by Diceus, (as the day before) he had given the whole Assembly cause to think strangely of that unexpected passion. In the meane time, the Chief Priest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded those that carried the Lot vessell to approach, and holding his hand over it, Thou light (said he) which the Sun cannot obscure, Intelligence which govern'st all others, guide my hand and give thy selfe that victime which is most pleasing to thee. By our last sacrifice we have confess'd thee to be the Author of our lives, by this which we are now making ready for thee, we intend to acknowledge thee to be the Author of death; and as by the one we confesse thee All-good, by the other we avow thee All-powerfull. With that he put his hand into the Vessell, and drew thence a ball of Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Presently he read the name of him that was to die, and all the Priests together instantly began to cry out thrice, Be favourable to thy sacrifice, O milde Deity, which takest not away the lives of thy Creatures, but to render it more perfect and happy. That done, foure other Priests presented themselves at the foot of the throne, carried a Vessell of gold made like one of the ancient Urnes. The Chief-Prelate threw the ball into it which hee held, and presently the Master of the Ceremonies caus'd all the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants to march. The slaves by two and two went before the Priests; and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Prelate (seated in a chaire which was borne on the shoulders of eight Slaves) held still his hand on the mouth of the Vessell wherein was the ball of death. They went all into the Temple, without making there any offering or prayers, and came out of it by a gate open'd to the West. That gate led to the long walk of Cedars of which I have spoken, and beyond that to a rock which advanc'd it selfe farre into the sea. There was discover'd a dismall Preparation. On the left hand was seen an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar built of marble as red as blood, and on the right, a funerall pile, at whose soure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, eight little children held divers silver fire-pans full of burning coales. The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims incompass'd the place. The Clergy and the Embassadours of Gheneoa were rank'd before them. The Priests joyn'd with them, and made a second circle. The Noble Slaves made a third, and the Chief-Prelate, staying in the midst of all, with those which carried the Vessell of Death, at last took it with his Assistants and put it on the Red Altar. These Ceremonies were perform'd with a very deep silence, and as in an act of sorrow, every one witness'd his astonishment and feare. At last the Soveraigne Priest drew out the ball that was to cleare the doubts of so many terrified mindes; and presently they cri'd thrice, that the Officers of death should come forth of their darke dungeons. Instantly foure doores which were in the foure sides of the bloody Altar opened, and foure men came out having their eies banded with black Cypres, to shew that with a blinde obedience wee are to goe where we are call'd by the voice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The Arch-Priest deliver'd into their hands the ball which he had taken out of the Urne, and presently he and all his Clergy fell with their faces flat on the earth. The foure Executioners of Justice which those Slaves call'd divine, read the Name that was written on the ball; and going behinde the Slaves (who by a particular prohibition were enjoyn'd not to turne their heads) they seiz'd on that miserable Granadian, who the preceding evening, as if he had fore-seen his death, had (before Polexander) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen'd himselfe of all the sinnes wherewith he was tormented by the remorse of Conscience. The Executioners presently blind folded him, and making use of no other thing to binde him but the chaines he was wont to weare, led him to the Altar. Strait they cri'd out, that all were to fall flat with their faces to the earth; and that done, there arose from among the Priests a lamentable voice, which filling their minds with horrour, Reme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ber (it said) O powerfull Deity, that thou hast not made man to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy him. That being spoken, they heard it no more, till the pile being kindled an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other voice, but lesse mournfull then the first, cri'd out thrice thus: Let, O mercifull Divinity, by thy All-powerfulnesse be enlightned again this life which is newly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished for thy glory. When this prayer was ended, the High-Priest arose, and all the Assistants doing the like, without any prayer they went about the pile, and with no more Ceremony return'd towards the Temple. The gates were found shut, confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the ancient Ceremonies, and then the Chief-Prelate, turning towards all the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54727:279"/>
Assembly, Let every one (said he) retire, and obtaine by his private oraizons what is not to be gotten by the blood of Sacrifices. After hee had pronounc'd those words thrice, he entred the Temple by a little doore which was then presently opened. The Priests departed to their Quarters, the slaves to theirs, the Embassadours to the High-Priests palace, and the Pilgrims to their particular lodgings. The Noble Slaves that day eate together in common, and after their repast went to walk together in a garden which was appointed for that purpose. Polexander took him by the hand who came to visit him with Menscenarez, and separating themselves from the rest, led him into a long and close alley, and witness'd there his grief for the death of their common friend. The Slave stopping to answer Polexander, I bewaile not (said he) Menscenarez, but I lament my selfe for the losse I have had. For him, he hath met with what he wished for, the end of his torments; and the Deity which they worship in this Island, making to appeare at need the succour which he promis'd to such as are in misery, hath taken home to himselfe our friend from a place where his affliction had infallibly made an end of him by a more dismall blow, then that which he lately receiv'd. The newes you told him yesterday, threw him back into his former designe of dying, and the last night calling on Benzaida, and bewailing her death; I will follow thee, ingratefull, but amiable Princesse (said he) from time to time, and will let thee know by my death that I knew how to love, and by consequence how to die aswell as thee. Acknowledge then his death is a particular gratification of the Deity which he hath so faithfully served; and that we are more to be lamented then he, since we are bound to attend yet may be five or six yeares till the lot free us from our chaines and the remembrance of our mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes. Polexander admir'd at the slaves understanding, and looking on him more curs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>usly then he had done, saw in his face something of I know not what, which made him desirous to know who, and from whence hee was. Hee therefore ask'd how long, and by what accident he came into that Island of the Sun. My too much daring (said he) hurried me hither; and that which is to mee the most insupportable of all the torments I indure, in my conscience I know I have deserved them. I would have gone beyond that which was permitted me. My good fortune made me proud, and that pride made me forget my self. Wretched bird of darknesse that I am, I feard not to flutter out of my obscurity, but expos'd my weake eies to the beames of a more radiant Sun then is worshipped in this Island. In a word, I would have committed a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eriledge, and from an adoration permitted, gone on to a love that was forbidden me. It is now almost three yeares since my impiety was discovered, and almost as long time have I undergone the punishment enjoin'd me for it. I was at last brought into this Isle, and without the hearing my justifications they consecrated me to the service of the Sun. Polexander, being not to his wish well satisfied, intreated the Slave, to make known the place of his birth, and if he might aske him with modesty, to let him understand more cleerly then he had done, the cause of his Exile and Captivity. It would bee very hard for mee though I indevour'd it (reply'd the Slave) to refuse any thing you shall request of me. Your desires have a certaine charme which compels all mindes, and they get with a great deale of violence, what they intreat with farre more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Let us therefore, I beseech you, retire to some place where none may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt us; and I will there amaze you with the recitall of a passion which may serve for an example to all young Spirits, which through a ridiculous presumption perswade themselves that all things they affect, should be permitted them. Polexander putting himself to be guided by the Slave, travers'd a great many Alleies, and at last came to a place where the murmure of many fountains, and the shade of divers Palme trees and Cedars made a retreat fit for the converse of melancholy lovers. They sate downe both farre enough from the fountains that they might not be troubled with their noise; and Polexander intreating his companion not to deferre the Contentment he had promised him, wonne him to beginne his discourse in these termes. Certainly they knew well what a passion that is which we call Love, when they represented it by an Infant that had his Eies banded. They would, surely, thereby intimate, that 'twas a two-fold blindenesse; since 'tis true, that Infancy is as it were a blindfolding which hinders the Soules operation with knowledge, and permits it not either to consider the end of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54727:280"/>
what it proposeth, nor the meanes shee is to take in acquiring it. I have not this Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy from the learning of any Tutors, but from my long and cruell experience. Yet before I acquaint you with it, I thinke it fit to make knovvn who I am and where I was borne. In this Sea, which incompasseth the Isle wherein wee are, and not farre from hence, where the ancient Idolaters had placed their Elizian fields, is an Island; which is no otherwise known to other Nations, but by its not being knovvn to them at all. Some have given it the name of Inaccessible, others of the Inchanted Island, but all agree that it hides it selfe from all that goe about to discover it, and sometimes shewes it selfe to those that never look after it. Polexander, at that word stopping the slave, and intimating an impatiency truely amorous; How (said he) were you born Alcidiana's subject? Yes, (repli'd the slave sighing) and could have boasted to have been of the number of her most happy subjects, if my temerity had not made me lose all those advantages which the goodnesse of that Princesse afforded mee. Who e're you be then that know the famous name of Alcidiana, be pleased to understand that till I was ten or twelve yeeres of age, I was so happy as to be called by her by no other name then that of brother. The reason was this. There is in that Inacces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Island, a Family, which by a priviledge almost as ancient as the State, seem'd to be destin'd for the furnishing of Nurses to all the Kings children; and indeed 'tis recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that for two thousand yeares, the most of our Princes and Princesses have been nursed by the Ladyes of that house. Out of that family came I; and that you may know 'tis not mean, let me tell you, that this important imployment hath made it so illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious that it gives place to none but the Princes of the blood, and it hath so farre got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the love of the people, that they certainly believe, if they have able, valiant and vertuous Kings, they owe it to our excellent nurturing as much at least as to their birth. When Alcidiana was borne, she was delivered into the hands of my mother, which was not long before brought to bed of me. She was her Nurse, with all the care and tendernesse that could answer the generall expectation which all the Kingdom had in the life of that Princesse. 'Tis true, there was this difference betwixt her breeding and that of other Princes, that none were permitted to see her: because all that could prognosticate things to come, had foretold that under the raigne of that Princesse, the Crowne would be transferred into the power of strangers, and that the Princesse her selfe, to save her Country, should be compel'd to marry a slave, that was come from among the Negroes. At those words Polexander had much adoe to suppresse the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary motions he felt within him. But imagining he was oblieged, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of that prophecy, to conceale himself more then ever, he forc'd his transports, and redoubled his attention, that he might not lose any thing of the slaves discourse, which the young man thus prosecuted: Alcidiana was therefore shut up in the palace of Calliroé, with her Nurse and Officers. My mother, who was young, and had no other child but my selfe, would never give way to let me be from her, so that I was confin'd with Alcidiana, and by little and little made me so necessary for the pastimes of her childhood, that they were forc'd to keep me still with her. At the age of foure yeeres, that Princesse (as my mother hath often related) had so great lights of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and was so admirable in all her actions and discourse, that it seem'd heaven had exempted her from all the infirmities of childhood; and in her birth been indow'd with all such treasures as others acquire with much paine and a great many yeeres. In this extream infancy, I felt my self with a great deal of pleasure won to the adoration of this rising Sun; and though my minde was not yet capable of any of its operations, yet it turn'd it selfe towards the beauties of Alcidiana, just as the Adamant, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated, by a hidden quality turnes it selfe to the starre which it loves and which drawes it. I was the beloved brother of that Princesse, if we were to play, if we were to dance, I must alwaies necessarily make one. Alcidiana could not well passe the time without m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, and I dare say, she lov'd me so dearly that there never was man more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py then I, without knowing it. But that felicity lasted not long, for after I attain'd the age of nine yeeres, they beganne to make me know who I was, and what was Alcidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na. Her Governesses too, instructed her in the difference that heaven had set betwixt our degrees, and withall taught her to converse with me farre otherwise then she had
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54727:280"/>
liv'd thitherto. All freedome which I formerly enjoied was debar'd me. I saw my selfe reduc'd to serve on the knee, her whom I before treated with as much familiarity as she had been my Sister. It was not so much permitted me as to touch that fair hand which before time I could kisse as often as she tooke any thing from mine. Alcidiana was a great while ere she could practice these rigorous instructions; but by little and little she grew so learned in the Art of Imperiall commanding, and disdainfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the unfortunate Pisander as well as all other men, that as young as I was, I took notice of the alteration, and almost dy'd for sorrow. My mother who took no delight but in what I did, seeing me suddainly fall into a dangerous sicknesse, used all kinde of remedies for my recovery. But perceiving that I wax'd every day worse and worse, and that I complain'd of nothing else but Alcidiana's change, she was so impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent out of her affection as to intreat the Princesse to lessen a little her severity, and beare with my innocence. The love which Alcidiana bore to that second mother, was so powerfull as to winne her to suppresse her thoughts, and to visit me as I lay in my bed. The sight of her gave me my health as it had taken it from mee; and the hope of living with that Princesse as I had done, made me soon leave my chamber. For a whole yeare after my recovery, there pass'd not a day wherein I saw not Alcidiana. Every morning I brought her flowers, either to make her nosegaycs or guirlands. At the time of Devotion I waited on her to the Temple, and I remember how approaching the nearest to her that I could when she praied, I innocently besought the Divinity which she had adored, not to grant her petition, unlesse by a particular vow she bound her selfe not to treat mee ever as a man indifferent to her. The afternoones if she went forth to walke, or if she pass'd the time at any sport, I strove to fit her with new services, or at least to make shew of my diligence. At night when she was making unready, not only her Governesses, but the King her father himselfe, had not the power to make me forsake her mirrour. I look'd on her with an earnestnesse that beseem'd not mine age; and oftentimes the power of mine inclination making me speake such things as I understood not my selfe, I amaz'd with the violence of my passion, those that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselves with heeding that sport or rather prodigy of nature. At the first Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidus took pleasure in it, but fearing, lest my affection might increase with my yeares; and that what was then called a childish extravagancy, might at last grow to be a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resolution; he commanded that by little and little I should be put away from the Princesse, that with the absenting from her company I might lose the memory of her person. My mother therefore, had command to put me out of the palace of Calliroé; and she strove to do it so dextrously that I should take no notice of it. But 'twas im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for her; I foresaw the evill was intended me, and a little before I was forc'd from that sweet aboad, I went to Alcidiana's chamber, and casting my selfe at her feet; (after I had a long time wept there) Faire Princesse (said I) I must leave you, and (to obey mine enemies) lose all occasions to serve you. Be a little touch'd with the paines I indure, and by some word witnesse to me, at least that you have no hand in my ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. But alas! I shall see you no more Alcidiana, for how short soever my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers voyage be, I am sure to dye in it. Whether the Princesse did it out of innocence, or whether it were to jeere at me, once she said, she would not have me dye. I will not (said I innocently) if you command me to live, but the hope of revisiting you, shall preserve my life till my returne. In this manner I parted as much an Infant as a Lover, but my journey was a journey of five or six yeares; for I was sent to the University of Sophila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma and stirr'd not thence till I had perfected all my studies. In the mean while, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther book nor time could blot the Image of Alcidiana out of my memory. I came from the Academy not onely with some qualities which were not absolutely ill, but full (withall) of that fire which the age of seventeen or eighteen kindles in our veines. Then did Alcidiana appear to my imagination, as charming and beautifull, as she was in her Inaccessible Palace. I return'd to the Court, but not so as I went thence. Time and bookes had taught me, that there needed a great deale of dissimulation and much suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an affection of the quality that mine was. I thought, that if it came to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, it might either make me an offender, or at least esteem'd for one giddy headed and by consequence, for feare of shame, or punishment, I should doe my utmost inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:54727:281"/>
to conceale it. About that time Alcidus dyed, and left his Kingdome to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of a Princesse but sixteen yeares old. But at that age, her admirable wit and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had made her capable of the highest sciences, and the philosopher Rhadiotez had made her understand all the secrets of Policy, aswell as all the mysteries of philosophy. And indeed she was no sooner in the Throne but she astonish'd her Subject with her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable government; but for her owne misfortune, and to the griefe of all that might adore that Princesse, she invented a businesse which her predecessors had never put in practice, dividing her Court in two: She made a publicke and a private one. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke was compos'd of the greatest part of her Kingdomes Grandy's, of the Officers of her Crowne and Counsellours of State. The other which was particularly her owne, consisted of young Ladyes and women, and some ordinary men appointed to serve the Princesse. Before that reformation, the children of the best houses in the Kingdome were bred up neare the person of the Soveraigne, aswell to waite on him in his chamber, as to guard him with that affection and fidelity which is seldo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e found in mean and mercenary minds. During Alcidus raigne that custome was a little changed, because that Prince, who was the first there that had travel'd into strange Countries, for the memory of it, would have his Guard part strangers and part of his Subjects. And a little before his death, he chose a hundred strangers to be neer to Alcidiana; and to adde more glory to that novelty, appointed them all to weare great chaines of gold, and to be called the Princesses Slaves. That band continued as long as the King lived. But assoon as Alcidiana came to the Crowne, she casheer'd that magnificent Guard, and shutting her selfe up in her palace with her Ladies, caus'd to be proclaim'd every where, that a King could never be better guarded then by the affection of his Subjects. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless there betided an accident which made her change that opinion, and call back again to her, those whom her too scrupulous vertue had discharged. One of the greatest Lords in the Island (called Siziphus) desperately ambitious, and passionately in love with the Princesse, imagined with himself that there was none surely who durst against him contest for the injoying her. After he had a yeare or two revolv'd this thought in his minde, he conceiv'd the time was come to declare himselfe. To that end, he became extreamely expensive. He increas'd his retinue by a great many gentlemen. He got to him by presents and pensions, part of the Gentry; and by notable prosusions, I mean richnes, and pompe of shewes, and spectacles, and by publick seastings, he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Loyalty, and made himself master of the peoples Love. To that, he added turneies, and sports, in honour of Alcidiana. In a word, he made his intention sopalpable to the world, that there was none but knew it save the Queen. Hereupon the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Estates ensuing, he won the most part of the Deputies, and got them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to the Queen that they had need of a King. This proposition was made with all the respect that happy and loving Subjects owe their Prince. Notwithstanding, it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Alcidiana; and when she saw herself extraordinarily press'd to it: Well (said shee to the Deputies) since you are weary of being under the government of a woman, name me who 'tis, whom you desire should be your King. Many humble excuses were by them oppos'd to that command; and the chiefe replied, that none but her owne high and discerning Spirit could make a choice of so great importance. No, no, (said the Queen) if the question were of my contentment, I would reserve to my selfe that Election, but since it lies in yours, you your selves must make the choice. A young Magistrate, (thereupon) one that had been corrupted by Siziphus with the hope of a great fortune and some liberality, came forward, and putting one knee to the ground, Madam (said he) all your Subjects most humbly (by mee) beseech your Majesty, to perfect their happinesse by promoting the Prince Siziphus to be their King. At that proposition Alcidiana blush'd, and yet constraining herselfe, lest shee might make knowne her choler: If Siziphus be the generall Vote of my Subjects (said she with a voice which sufficiently expres'd her scorne) I perceive they would very easily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to wayve the government of Alcidiana. This Answer taught the Deputies the fault of their companion. But to reaccommodate it, they all fell at the Queens feet, and having besought her pardon for their exceeding boldnesse, assured her that the late made proposition was rather intended to make her thinke on marriage, then to oblige
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54727:281"/>
her to take a husband; and that Siziphus had not been nominated to her, but that they thought he might be acceptable, aswell in regard of his eminent vertues, as for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority he had acquir'd in the State. If he have so, (repli'd presently Alcidiana) he hath stoine it from me. I never meant he should have any other command in my Kingdom, save that which his Birthright gives him over his Vassals. But I see well how matters goe. My overmuch mildnesse is abused. I will (since I am forc'd to it) become more severe, and know how to keep you all in your duties. This Parliament having so ill successe, and Siziphus seeing himselfe so absolutely refus'd, thought, he must not fit downe with that affront, but practice to obtaine by violence, what was not by faire meanes to be purchased. He bargaines therefore, he bribes, he promiseth, he gives, and by his immense Presents corrupting even the women which very seldome came out of the Queenes chamber, guided his plot so cunningly, that hee doubted not of the successe. When all this was in hand I return'd to the Court, and became so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant in love with the Queen, that I spent whole dayes and nights in gazing on the walls within whose cincture that miracle was inclosed. I had not been there long ere I understood of Siziphus designe; and love making me look on him as a dangerous Rivall, I resolv'd to hinder his Suit, and with the first occasion to bring him to defend himself in a Duell. Now one night as I walk'd in the great garden of the Palace which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Queens chamber windowes, I had a glimpse of one that march'd a great pace. I drew sortly neare, and heard these words: MAKE HAST, AND LET EVERY MAN OBSERVE WHAT IS AGREED UPON. These words making me suspect somewhat, I slid along by a back way which was contriv'd by the Alley, and followed those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd persons. They were seaven or eight, and seem'd by their talke, to be going to some place where they were not to meet with any great resistance. When they were come into the Castle ditch, I saw (can you beleeve it?) some-body let fall a private Bridge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which the Queen was wont to goe out of her lodgings into the Garden. Then I knew that the Princesse was betraid by her owne domesticall Servants; And my Love making me instantly take on a resolution worthy its cause; I step'd from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Pallissado, (where I had staid) with my sword drawne, and laying one of the Rascalls at my feet, in two leaps I got on the Bridge, with an intent to be cut in peeces ere I would suffer any whatsoever he were to enter the Palace. Siziphus (for 'twas hee,) seeing himselfe (so unlook'd for) cross'd, flew in upon me, and with that strength which made him almost invincible, bore a thrust at me which in all likelyhood was to pierce me through and through. But I put it by, in sliding my foot; and seeing the Traitor ingag'd on the Bridge, I press'd on to him, and got within the point of his weapon. The addresse which I owe to Nature and Exercise, made me so hardy as to graple with that Gyant. I seiz'd on him, and ere he could take fast hold of me, put him to his leape, and turn'd him headlong into the ditch. Presently I cri'd out, there were theeves, attempting the Queenes lodgings. At which alarme, all the Palace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woke, and the most part of the Queenes Officers came armed into the Garden. In the meane time I followed Siziphus Complices, and though the many Alleyes, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders, and little thickets in the Garden, afforded them faire meanes to escape, yet I met with one of them, and having taken him, left Alcidiana's Officers the paines of seeking out the rest. Till all that great disorder could be appeas'd, it grew to be broad day. The Queen being well inform'd of this attempt, assembled all those of whom her publick Court was chiefly compos'd, and commanded Siziphus to be produced, who had been taken out of the Castle ditch. At the same time I came into the councell, and presented to the Queen the man I had taken. The Princess commanding mee to speake what I knew: The obligations (said I) which binde me to your Majesty, being written by the very hand of heaven (whereof you are the lively image) have made me believe that it was impossible to infringe them, without the perpetrating a crime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all Example. This Consideration (blinding my thoughts from all others, and dreading not the acquiring of any enemies, how powerfull or redoubtable soever, when your Majesties service is in agitation) makes me speake boldly what Siziphus himselfe dares not deny, if he be not as cowardly as guilty. From that very houre wherein his impudency (or rather trechery) was so justly and publickly chastis'd, he complotted to
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54727:282"/>
force away your Majesty; and to that end, trying all meanes, he saw so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression to what he intended, that there remain'd nothing for the execution, but to make a free entry into your Palace. Many waies he tri'd, to overcom that obstacle, and wrought so powerfully that he thought he had suppres'd it. These wonderfull prodigalities, as sufficient poisons to corrupt the best inclinations, and allurements violent inough to disturbe reason, seduced (even within the walls of your sacred Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace) such personages, who for vertue and fidelity were till then impregnable. I cannot tell your Madam who are the Complices in so great a treason. I will onely say, after I had discovered Siziphus intention, and knew the time when 'twas to be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, I came the last night into your Majesties gardens, to the end that suprising him in his crime, I might not be oblieged to proofes which are many times difficult, and are almost never convincing. All things happened as I had fore-thought. I saw Siziphus come to his appointed place, and saw that at a certain Signall he made; the little bridge of your lodging was let downe. But Siziphus could not make use of that faire but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable occasion, because, I throwing my selfe first on the bridge, disputed the passage with him. We came to blowes, and his wicked Action, depriving him of his wonted strength, or rather the horrour of his Treason robbing him of his judgement, I tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him from the bridge into the Moa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e, then gave the alarme, and seeing the danger pass'd, ran after Siziphus Confederates. This here (Madam) is one of them which I took, who hath already confess'd to me that his Masters intent was to carry you hence, and after he had married (either by consent or force) to place your Crowne on his head. When I had thus spoke I held my peace; and the high Chancelour of the Kingdome commanding Siziphus to answer to those accusations: that ambitious Man was so base as to deny an Act whereof he was convicted by his being taken in it, and by the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Complices. The Queen commanding that Justice should be done, arose, and told in withdrawing, that my Service should not be unrewarded. Within foure or five dayes Siziphus Processe was drawne, because his Crime being so openly proved, there needed no observation of ordinary length and forme. To give satisfaction to the Law for his Attempt, he was condemn'd to dye by the hand of the Hangman. After this Judgement was pronounc'd, he was brought to the place of Execution; but Alcidiana desirous to let her people know how farre her Clemency could extend, gave Siziphus his pardon; and to perfect it fully, in lieu of confining him to perpetuall imprisonment, she gave him his liberty, and with it, all his meanes that were confiscated. Yet this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary mercy could not alter or make any change in Siziphus ill nature, but hee converted into a private hatred the love hee bore Alcidiana; and that hatred being cherish'd by his ambition, he recommenc'd his former practises. But they had such ill successe, that in their prosecution, he most dishonourably lost his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ise; for I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by those whom Alcidiana sent the last Spring into this Island, that a stranger Prince call'd Polexander, accusing Siziphus for intending to attempt againe on Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana's liberty, had inforc'd his Justification by Armes. The Combate was long and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; but at last Siziphus seeing himselfe sore wounded, and at the feet of his Enemy, confess'd the second Conspiracie as basely as he had deni'd the first; but his Confession could not save his life, for he died in the place. Now let us returne to that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes my selfe. Assoon as Siziphus was set at libertie all the Citizens came thronging to the Queens Palace, and remonstrating, that the audaciousness of any that was am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious might make her fall into the like accidents, besought her Majesty to take a Guard, and to take more care then she had done, of a life on which depended the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and lives of all her Subjects. At last she yeelded to their just petition, and restor'd againe the brave Band of her Slaves. By that meanes, my good fortune fell to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my hopes. The Queen did me the honour to nominate me Captaine of her Gard, and in that quality, I and my companions were lodged in the first inclosure of her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. My command gave me admittance every where and ingaged me to see the Queen almost every day, to render her an account of what was done abroad. Imagine, if you can possibly, to what a height this opportunity wrought my passion. When the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse had made a match with her Ladies to spend the day in the Gardens, I saw her clad like a Nimph: When her minde to hunt made her leave her beloved Solitude, I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54727:282"/>
her to the woods, and seeing her in the habit of Diana, I thought her more faire then that Goddesse is described. At those words Polexander sigh'd aloud, because he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that Alcidiana was so clad the first time he had the honour to see her. The Slave taking no notice of it, continued his story thus: Sometimes, when publick affaires ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the Queen to give audience, or to sit in her throne of Justice, I admir'd the maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie she shew'd in her royall robes. Another time when she was dress'd for a Revells, I compar'd the whitenesse of her pearles with that of her neck, and the lustre of her Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds with that of her eyes. And ravish'd at the difference I saw between them, You (said I) that are called Nature's Master-pieces, and her utmost endeavours, humble your pride, and acknowledge (ye pearle) that your whitenesse is sallow'd by that of her neck. And ye little stars, which shine but in darknesse, be no more so bold to appeare in presence of your Sun. My deare companion in my fetters, how much eloquence do I want, to describe to you the parts which compos'd that incomparable Lady? Why have I not colours lively enough, and pencils sufficiently neat to delineate to you that Princesse as faire as I see her even in her absence? Think on all that is admirable, both in proportion and colours; adde sweetnesse to majestie, beautie to favour, and in briefe, the charmes of the spirit to the allurements of the bodie, and of all those wonders make a judicious composition, and you shall infallibly meet with the resemblance of Alcidiana. But rash man that I am, for daring to flie too high, and exposing my self too neere the heat of that great Star, my hopes lesse solid then wings set together with waxe, have precipitated me into this aboad of banishment and death. I was not above two or three moneths in that happinesse I related, but I found my selfe too weake to support it. You daily see men, who by their vigour or courage contest long time with a disease before they are laid downe by it; and though they feele extreme pangs, yet goe abroad in company, and act the same things as others which have no touch of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but on the sudden their strength failes them, their fever redoubleth, and of a disease which might have easily been cured, if it had not been too long neglected, there growes one so violent and obstinate against all remedies, that it can have no end but by death: Such was the lamentable estate whereto I saw my selfe brought by the excesse of my good fortune. After I had long dissembled my love, after I had promised my selfe to hide it so well, that Alcidiana should not discover it; nay, even after I dar'd to call to the combate all that Princesses attractions, and had vaunted that my discretion should be stronger then they: at last I was inforc'd (spight of my heart) to give way to the violence of my affection. I must sigh, and sigh, and in such places where it must be taken notice of. From sighing, I must passe on to languishing looks, and from looks to complaints. In the night time I made the voices of Musicians (to the sound of their Lutes) speake that which I was forbidden. But all this was nothing to the evill Angell that had resolv'd to ruine mee. He so tormented mee, that as often as Alcidiana (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd for) came within my sight, I could not possibly keep my selfe from swounding. This mischiefe betided me once when I was in the Queens privie-chamber. I felt my fit coming on, but not being able to withdraw quick enough, I fell as dead at her feet. Imagine how she was affrighted. She commanded to carry mee forth, and by vertue of some remedies they brought mee againe. But I was so sensibly touch'd with it, that with sorrow and anguish I fell into a sicknesse, wherein my recoverie was so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair'd of, that Alcidiana, to comfort my mother, who was a sick as I, was so noble and good, that she took the paines to visit mee, and to let mee know, that my death would not be an indifferent thing to her. I think verely, that the power of her sweet eyes triumph'd or'e the violence of my disease: For the fever presently left mee, but there rested such a feeblenesse, that I usually swounded, sometimes thrice, sometimes foure times in the day. In the meane time I pray'd continually that I might not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of that weaknesse, because my amorous swoundings being taken for the reliques of my sicknesse, I had the content of seeing the Queen, and could swoune before her, and yet she not suspect the cause. One evening as I meditated in the great garden on the estate (I cannot tell whether I may say happy or unhappy) of my life, on a sudden Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana came into the arbour where I was, and being surpriz'd with mine incounter, witnessed no lesse anger then if shee had heard all that my reaving had put into my
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54727:283"/>
mind. What doth this melancholy man here (said shee?) and presently calling for a Lady nam'd Amintha, which alwaies attended her, See (said she) Pisander, would you not say by his disfigured countenance, and his melancholy humour, that he is no more already then his shadow? Amintha, who truly merits to be call'd the example of all courtefie and goodnesse, repli'd, according to her admirable wit; But Madam (said she) since the wise should make benefit of all things, I humbly beseech your Majesty to draw from the losse of Pisander a meanes of preserving your selfe. The love of studie, and the pleasure he tastes in these meditations, hath made him fall into this deep me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.

I make profession of a lesse austere doctrine; and thou shalt know it, my deare Amintha, that though I love Philosophy well, yet I love Alcidiana better. I advise Pisander to doe so too. You would be caught (repli'd the good Amintha with a great laughter) if Pisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der followed your counsell. You are not so wise as you were wont to be (said the Queen, who was the best Mistresse that ever was borne.)

Hee was not in case to hearken to her, for from the beginning of her discourse he was fallen into his usuall fainting. Amintha perceiv'd it, and ran to help me.

Pisander (answered Amintha) you should take a little more care for your health then you doe, and not suffer your selfe to be thus over-growne with melancholy, which will bring you to your grave, if you doe not quickly ston the course of it. My malady (said I) is now incurable. I have done my utmost to overcome it, and from ordinary remedies, I have betaken me to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, but both have been alike to me unprofitable. Nor indeed doe I expect any else then death; and the worst that can be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

With that shee went out of the arbour, and left me in as much griefe as my sad destiny could make me sensible of. What will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of thee Pisander, said I then to my selfe?

Seest thou not that all discretion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes thy designe, that thy flames are criminall, that thou wilt be held for a foole, if they be discovered, and that thy daring is such, as far off for being any way glorious to thee, it will make thy death and thy memory alike ridiculous? Thou art at one extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and Alcidiana at the other; and these extremes are so farre distant, that he who shall undertake to joyne heaven and earth together, would not be thought so very a foole then the miserable Pisander, if hee perswade himselfe that hee shall be rais'd to Alcidiana, or that she will descend to him. Let judgement then effect what love can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Be a victor by flying. since thou canst not be so by contesting. Desire no more, since 'tis impossible for thee to obtaine what thou desirest; and spend not thy whole life in reavings and dreames, which make thee run after phantasmes which thou shalt never attaine to. After I had thus discours'd with my selfe, and brought mee to be a little capable of reason, me thought I saw Love, who full of indignation and fury, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd me for my disloyaltie and infamous resolutions. What (said he) doest thou so ill acknowledge the favours which thou owest to my bountie? and dar'st thou so cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly betray him, who plucking thee out of the centre of the earth, hath on his owne wings carried thee as high as heaven? To what greater glorie aspirest thou? or to what height wouldst thou have mee lift thee, if thou be not content to be in heaven? But I heare thy murmures, and I know thy thoughts. Thou tell'st mee, thou lovest in vaine,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54727:283"/>
that thou shalt never win Alcidiana to the least thought of pitie: That thou shalt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish all thy whole life, and yet shee shall not so much as know 'tis for her; and when thou dyest, thy death, as the death of one of the meanest of her subjects, shall not make her bestow a teare on thee. Answer mee, disloyall Pisander: When thou began'st to love this Princesse, did thy common sense faile thee so much as to promise thee thou shouldst be belov'd again? No, no, repent thy selfe of thy repentance, perfect thy ruine for Alcidiana: and remember, that the glorious thought which gave thee the boldnesse to adore Alcidiana, is of more esteeme then the possession of all that is fairest in the whole world. These last counsells made all the former to vanish, and my passion (flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by these pleasing imaginations) taking new root, not onely strengthned mee in strengthning it selfe, but serv'd for a speciall remedie to all my languishments. The Court, seeing me suddenly got from death to life, knew not to what to attribute ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cause of my sicknesse, or that of my health. Even Amintha was deceiv'd in it, and admiring so sudden a recovery, perswaded her selfe, that my maladie was no other then the melancholy vapours of the spleen. A little while after my full amendment, Arziland King of the Isle of Madera, being by a tempest cast on our coast, came to the Court; and having seen the Queen, began to be so foolishly amorous, that he threatned to put all her Island to fire and sword, if she declared not her acceptance of his love. I thought then that I could not better imploy my life, then in freeing the Queen from that Monster; and that the service I might render her in that occasion, would be of a greater importance then the former I had done her in the attempt of Siziphus. I sent therefore to defie the Giant; but thinking for certaine that I should be flaine in the combate, I resolv'd to provide my selfe a faire funerall, and to make knowne at least in dying the love I had conceal'd all my life time. I put on a gilded armour, which by the rayes upon it, did not ill represent the Sun. My Helmet cast forth beames too, and I had for my crest the Phenix which Alcidiana took for the bodie of her Embleme. Upon my buckler, which was as shining as mine armour, I had caus'd an Eagle to be painted in the region where the thunder is ingendred. Yet in spight of all lightning and thunder claps, hee flew thorow it, and fixedly gaz'd on the Sun. For the word to this Device there was this, (which spake my thoughts plaine enough:) I HOPE TOO MUCH TO FEARE. Cover'd with these armes, I went and met with Arziland, and was so fortunate, that after a combate of eight or ten houres, I cut off the Giants right hand. When he saw himselfe without armes, and unable for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, hee confess'd hee was overcome, and loathing to survive his shame, would have kill'd himselfe. But Alcidiana, who preserv'd him to serve for a redoubtable example to all such rash ones as hee, caus'd him to be put in strong hold; and commanded that speciall care should be had of his life. In the meane time, I, who had received divers great wounds, fell as I had been dead in the place of combate; and if the Queen had not shew'd that my life was so extremely deare unto her, without doubt, the day of my victorie had been the day of my death. My wounds were so great, that I kept my bed almost six moneths, and was foure or five more ere I went out of my chamber. Alcidiana the third time took the paines to come and visit me, and gave me such signes of favour, that my love in its greatest extravagancies could never promise to it selfe. Arziland the while being gotten into case sufficient to be able to suffer the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereto the Queens justice had condemn'd him, was taken out of prison, and lead to the place where he was to lose his life. Though in the Inaccessible Island wee adore but one God, yet there are Temples in severall places, which from all antiquitie are dedicated to particular Deities. In one there is worshipped a God, which they term the God of Revenge. The Annalls of our Kingdome tell us, that that Temple was built by a Queen, who having been long time earnestly sued to by a man unworthy her bed, and after the receiving a great many wrongs and outrages from him, at last took him in a day of battell. When the barbarous man saw himselfe in the power of a personage whom he had so ill treated, he never crav'd her pardon, but besought her that she would not delay too long the time of his punishment. That Princesse, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from her Priests, that their God had reserv'd vengeance to himselfe, built to him a Temple during the imprisonment of her enemy, under the name of the God of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54727:284"/>
and causing the prisoner to be brought thither, commanded he should be sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd on the altar of that Deitie, as a victime which was reserv'd for him. Arziland, who had committed the same fault, receiv'd the same punishment. For Alcidiana thought she could not doe better then to imitate the example of her Ancestor. And to give the more terrour to such Princes as loved her, she sent to proclaime in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand places a Declaration, by which shee held for irreconcilable enemies all those that had the boldnesse to take on them the name of her lovers. After Arziland had receiv'd his punishment, and a Herald of the Queens sent into Europe, she betook her selfe to her former manner of living; and shutting her selfe up in her palace, there relish'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine her wonted innocent contentments. I, the while, who knew very well the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence I had commi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ted in discovering my love, was tortured with a perpetuall remorse, and not possibly imagining that after so visible signes of my passion, Alcidiana should be still ignorant of it, I drew out my malady to a longer date, and could not put on any resolution to suffer my selfe to be cured. But the tokens of goodnesse which I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most daily receiv'd from that Princesse, the titles of honour which she added to those I had already, and the excessive presents she sent not onely to my mother, but to all those of my bloud, made me beleeve at first, that she understood nought of my designe; but since that, my vanitie and good fortune so dazled mee, that I perswaded my selfe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana knew of my love, and that shee was glad to see the continuance of it. On this opinion. which hath been the cause of all my miseries, I hastened my cure, and repair'd againe to the Palace with all diligence. The Queen her selfe welcom'd me with such extraordinary demonstrations of favour, that I grew confirm'd in that foolish beliefe which my vanitie had wrought in me. So my last errours waxing worse then my first, and particularly that of not being hated by the Queen, working in me such thoughts as you may imagine, I grew so insolent, that there scarce pass'd an houre in the day wherein I did not violate some one of the lawes of the private Court, and gloried in the neglect of that respect which I owed to the most generous Mistresse in the world. I came into her privie chamber before shee was clad. There I was when they dress'd her head, and oftentimes taking out of her womens hands such things as shee used for that attire, I was so indiscreet, as to offer to doe their office. The Queen wink'd at all these impertinencies, and when I told some tales which truly were faulty enough to have made me been banish'd for ever from her presence, she drown'd all in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my service; and that shee might not be ingaged to reprove mee, feign'd shee heard nothing. Sometime her Lady of Honour, and the Lady which dress'd her, being offended at it, intreated her to doe them justice for my freedome; but she still coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited the ignorant, and as if shee had been somewhere else, not onely ask't them what I had spoken, but blaming the nicenesse of their eares, told them, that shee was too well assured of my discretion to think their complaints were just. This indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which I should have consider'd as the utmost Alcidiana could doe to constraine her selfe, being expounded to mine advantage, absolutely depriv'd me of that little judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the excesse of my happinesse had left me. Alcidiana (said I to my selfe) is too cleer-sighted not to take notice of a thing which is remarkable to the least witted of her women. Infallibly she knowes mine intention, but she feignes her selfe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that she may not be ingaged to make mee such a prohibition as (may be) would not have pleased her. Her condition is subject to most rigorous necessities. She must sacrifice her will and contentment to the will and liking of others; and to preserve to her selfe a strange authoritie, put off that command which nature had given her over her selfe. O the qualitie of Kings so generally envied, and (truly) so little deserving it! how well doe the Godd avenge them on thy selfe, for the slavery wherein thou plungest thy subjects! Thou first feelest the miseries thou makest them suffer, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posest not so heavie and cruell a yoke on others as that thou wearest thy selfe. But what, said I? Ye ridiculous considerations get from me, and ye troublesome relicks of my melancholy hide your selves in some extreme obscuritie, and there dwell with fooles and miserable wretches. But for you, ye deare and pleasant thoughts of mirth, riches, and command, lay open to me all the charmes which are linked with the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Alcidiana. Tell me, that as her beautie is without parallel, so the blisse of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54727:284"/>
her is beyond all comparison. Make mee see that such a happinesse is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with many more. That in acquiring the fairest wife in the world, I wi hall gaine the richest crowne of the Universe; and from the qualitie of a private man, which is alwaies troublesome, how elevated soever it be, I ascend to that of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, which is all of flowers, how thorny soever some fooles imagine it. After I had entertain'd my selfe with these Chymera's, and even emptied my thoughts, to be no more powerfully deceiv'd, I went to Alcidiana. The discourse I had with her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from such thoughts as I have related, made her blush out of shame and anger; and (in spight of all her goodnesse) to looke on mee as on another Siziphus. Two or three moneths before my disgrace, the vertuous Amintha, (who onely witnessed shee was truly my friend) advis'd me to take heed to my selfe, and not settle on a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was to be shaken. Alcidiana (said shee) begins to distasse your words and actions. I am afraid (hath she lately said) lest Pisander lose himselfe, and hearkens af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such, who may be will make benefit of his ruine. I know well he offends through ignorance, and not having so well studied the malice of Courtiers as he ought, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the traps they have laid under those flowers wherewithall they have covert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly o're-spread his walkings. Tell him therefore, that a man may be shipwrack'd in favour as well as in the sea. That his loyaltie and discretion have rais'd him to the height he is, and they onely must keep him there. Imagine, whether this advice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from so good an hand, was not able to make me wiser? But 'twould not doe; on the contrary, being even drunk with a good conceit of my selfe, I imagined Alcidiana <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ad not given in charge these advertisements to Amintha, but the more cunningly to let mee know, that shee was not ignorant of my love. On this foundation I began to build, and rais'd up more and more an edifice, which at last fell on mine owne he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. One day, when the Queen was adorn'd for a solemne action, I could not but tell her, that she never was more lovely; and (I went on) not to lye Madam, what e're hee be that hath the courage to aspire higher then is permitted him, he should not fixe on any then—How! (said the Queen, interrupting me) 'tis too much Pisander. Thinke who I am, and do not force me to come out of my voluntarie ignorance. Hereupon I thought, that the Queen satisfi'd with her owne words, would no more remember mine. But I grew much amaz'd when (two dayes after) taking no notice of any diminution of her favour, I saw my selfe utterly and suddenly cast downe by a grace, which any one lesse cleer-sighted then I, would have taken for an augmentation of his good fortune. The Queen, assembling her Councell, and calling together the chiefe Officers of her Crown, made to them a long enumeration of all the services I had done her, amplified (with an admirable eloquence) the attempts of Siziphus and Arziland, and call'd mee oftentimes her Deliverer and Protector. The conclusion of her speech was, that shee was ashamed she had not yet acquitted her selfe of so notable debts; and that she ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd her selfe guiltie of negligence, not to say of ingratitude. But (said shee) time, which had more care to free me then my selfe, affords mee wherewithall to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the services of Pisander. The command hee hath neere my person, is farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his merit; and his valour seemes to complaine, that I have so long time retain'd it in obscuritie, and (as it were) fetter'd amongst my Slaves. I therefore give him the command of Generall of my Army, which place is void by the death of Diomedes. After she had ended this crafty speech, she took from the hands of her Chancellour the provisions for that charge; and calling mee to the foot of her throne, Goe now (said she) and make appeare the knowledge you have in warre, by preserving that peace which my subjects have so many yeares enjoyed. With that shee tooke a sword, which her high Chamberlaine presented, and commanding me to take it: See (said she) the Signall of the absolute power I have over my subjects. Doe not use it, but in case of extremitie; and to oblige you to keep it in its sheath, know, I had rather see it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run with rust, then bloody. I desire the love of my people, and feare their feare. Doe so then that they may live under me as children, not like slaves. I was about to refuse the charge, imagining '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>was but in stead of an honourable banishment. Yet I accepted it, for feare I should make my designe too palpable. Thus was I put from Alcidiana's Palace: and as soon as I was in that which was assign'd to my place, and freed from all
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54727:285"/>
such troublesome visitants as came to mee either out of ignorance or malice, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with mee for so unwelcome and dismall a dignitie: I was often tempted to have transpiere'd my selfe with the sword the Princesse had given mee, and to send it her back againe (all besmear'd with my bloud) with this message, that I had made use of it according to her intention. But I withheld, because a little remainder of hope advis'd mee to live, and not to abandon the pursuit of a thing which was rather strai'd then lost. This idle motion I gave eare to, that I might languish as you see mee in a slaverie that can have no end, but by the hand of the Hangman. Now the charge of the Generall is such, that it gives not time to him that enjoyes it, to have a day of rest; and therefore engaged me to leave the Court, and travell from towne to towne, from province to province to doe justice, heare complaints, pacifie quarrells, hinder all partialities, and free the feeble from the oppression of the mighty. After I had spent a whole yeare in affaires which were beneficiall to all but my selfe, I return'd to the Court; and at my day assign'd, render'd (in the presence of the Queen) an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of my government, and the state of the Kingdome. The Queen made shew of a very good satisfaction from mee; and her Chancellour did mee the honour to say, That of all those who had preceded me in the charge, there was no one who had more worthily acquitted himselfe. After I had receiv'd these approbations and applauses, I fell on my knees before the Queen, and besought her, that in recompence of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which so much pleas'd her, shee would dispense with my continuing in them. That favour she deni'd mee, with such strong reasons and termes so obliging, that the knowledge I had of her secret indignation could not hinder me from beleeving, that one day I might recover the favour she had taken from me. But time disbeguil'd me, and the band which was over mine eyes being taken away by a hand that was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to all errour, I knew the vainnesse of my hopes, and the just cause Alcidiana had to punish my boldnesse. I thereupon recollected mee from the extremitie whither am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and youth had carried mee, and by little and little retir'd to that which I had forsaken. But the fault I had committed was irreparable. The letters I writ, the powerfull meanes I used, nor the validitie of my services, could never open again that gate which I my selfe had shut upon me. Alcidiana even forbad her deare Amintha to speake to her of my returne; and to take from her subjects the knowledge of my disfavour, she put all her Slaves out of her Palace, lodged them in the towne, and by a publick Proclamation, forbad the entrance of her private retirement to all save her women, and under-officers. Yet did not these prohibitions serve for any thing against my passion. The difficulties increas'd my desire; and when I perceiv'd I had no more to hope for, my love took new vigour, and my former malady falling on mee suddenly, begot such accidents as those I have related. Lonelinesse, reaving, melancholy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, were as so many furies, who breaking out of hell for my punishment, and the generall miserie of all Alcidiana's subjects, with my reason, depriv'd mee of all huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. In lieu of rendring justice to the oppressed, I used them as I was handled; and punish'd them for those violences which other had done them. In vaine had the poore recourse to my power. I added to their miseries, to have the more companions; and when any one complain'd of mine injustice, See (said I to my selfe) if I suffer it not more, ere I make thee undergoe it. When I was told, that the Townes had sent their Deputies to the Queen to complaine of my outrages, Shee shall then (said I) be at last compell'd to be sensible of mine affliction, by the recitall of that of her subjects. But now the Princesse, unable any longer to dissemble her resentment, or shut her eares against the complaints of her people: and besides, knowing I serv'd her ill, onely out of an intent to lose my command, she let me see that she knew very well how to governe, in writing to mee a letter, which must eternally remaine graven in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie; and 'twas thus:</p>

                     <hi>ALCIDIANA,</hi> by the favour of Heaven, queen of the happy Island, to <hi>Pisander</hi> her Lievtenant-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and her subject.</head>
                  <p>I Understand (to my griefe) that the second yeare of thy government is far differing from the first. Not long since I receiv'd the benedictions of great and small; and all the Townes, in emulation of one another, sent to render me their thankfulnesse, for giving them so just and so favourable a Protectour. But now their Deputies come all together to demand justice for thy oppressions. What e're the cause be of thy alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, know Pisander, I will have thee continue in that charge whereof I thought thee worthy; and on the next complaint is made of thee, I will abandon thee to such lawes as are made against those that are guiltie of high treason.</p>
                  <p>After the reading of this Letter, I saw that my plot would not take; yet I perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my selfe, I might get by one way what I could not by the other: and to make tryall of it, I resolved to let the Queen know, that I no other way disobey'd her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but in my not being able to execute them. Under this pretext, I took the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to answer her letter thus:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Pisander</hi> to the queen his soveraigne Lady.</head>
                  <p>IF Kings, as the Gods, could in conferring charges bestow withall such faculties as are necessarie for their due execution, I doubt not, Madam, but your Majestie in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring mee with the prime command in your estate, would have provided mee with the utmost of sufficiencie. But since such a gift is not to be expected but from Heaven, I humbly beseech your Majestie, not to exact from me that which is neither in your power nor mine. I confesse, that the complaints have not been heretofore so many and great as they are now. But impute it not Madam to mine integritie, to my care, or my capacitie. You know well, that the vulgar naturally love novelties, that changes to them are in lieu of remedies; and that they beleeve they goe from good to bad, when they passe from an ill which they know, to another which they know not. Let your Majestie be pleas'd to joyne this consideration with that of the to be bewail'd estate wherein I am. That you would vouchsafe to look on me as on a man, who in lieu of being able to governe others, hath need to be govern'd himselfe. That you would know, if I offend, 'tis out of the disorder of my mind, not of my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. In a word, that Pisander is not wicked, but hee is sick; and his maladie being a stroke from Heaven, he must necessarily finish his miserable dayes by that anger which the complaints and accusations of your subjects have rais'd against him.</p>
                  <p>This Letter was sent, but it was not receiv'd. Alcidiana fearing, lest after the losse of my respect in mine actions and discourse, I might as well neglect it in my Letters, threw it into the fire, and told him who presented it to her, that she demanded obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and not replies. When I heard how cruelly I had been treated, Ah! pitilesse Queen (said I) thou hast then rais'd mee to this height onely, that I might receive a fall which should be infallibly mortall. I am content to perish, since thou wilt have it so; but if thou be not altogether without judgement, thou wilt at least confesse, that I receiv'd my death from her hand whose life I preserved. My griefe stai'd not on the vanitie of lamentations, but proceeded to actions; and blotting out of my mind all other thought then that of dying, won me to send back to the Queen all her cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious markes of dignitie. Presently I gave over all mine Office, and shutting my selfe up in an Hermits lodge, there abode twelve or fifteen dayes, not suffering any of my friends to come neere mee, nor enduring the presence of any of my houshold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servants.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54727:286"/>
I wept, I complain'd, I ask'd vengeance from Heaven for Alcidiana's ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, whereas (indeed) I should have begg'd her pardon for my disobedience; and when I thought that my messengers were got to the Princesse, I took poste, and came to Court. I truly doubted, that if the Queen had notice of my coming, I should not onely be barr'd from her presence, but ran a hazzard to lose the hope of ever seeing her more. To avoid that diaster, I abode conceal'd till day in the place where shee was wont to give audience to people of all sorts. As soon as I was certaine of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the throne of Justice, and that she dream't not at all of my coming, I slid closely into the Hall of audience. O deare companion in my bonds! what Miracle? what Sun? what Divinitie saw I in seeing Alcidiana? When shee was seated in her Throne, and her Ushers had impos'd silence, I strook through the throng of those that came to implore justice, and throwing my selfe at her feet, presently discover'd who I was: yet feigning to take no notice of the peoples astonishment, (occasion'd by their seeing me there) and principally the Princesses; I come (said I) Madam, to put mee into the hands of your justice as a malefactour, (who being able to save himselfe, and yet not of proofe to indure the cruell stings of conscience) comes out of deserts and retreats of securitie, to deliver himselfe into the hands of his Judges. 'Tis true, Madam, 'tis to be punish'd, and not to request a pardon, that I throw my selfe at your Majesties feet. I doe not intreat you to remember my services, nor to cast your eyes on a wretch, who is more rigorously punish'd then his faults seem to deserve: I confesse, I have disobey'd your commands, abused those honours you bestow'd on mee, and to speake them all in full and to the height, I have oppress'd the innocent whom I was bound to protect and make happy. Avenge then your neglected authoritie, degrade me from those honours I am unworthy of, and hearken to the voice of your people which cries for vengeance on my tyrannie. The greatest of my sorrowes, next to the losse of your favours is, that I have but one poore miserable life to expiate so many of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and give satisfaction to the number I have oppressed. Here I stai'd, and with mine eyes cast to the earth, attended what Alcidiana would pronounce against me. But in lieu of answering me, she turn'd to her high Chamberlaine, and making no shew of being any way moved, I deliver (said she) this mad man into your custodie; take him hence, and see him forth coming on your life. The Chamberlaine, who was my friend, took me to his owne house, and though hee made shew of a great deale of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for my dis-favour, yet he fail'd not to have such on eye over mee, that was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for me to have escaped, if I had had any such intention. The third night after my confinement, I was privately brought to the Queens Palace by the Chamberlain. At the doore Amintha receiv'd me, and intreating my conductor to stay, brought mee into a chamber where Alcidiana was. Assoon as I saw her, I fell at her feet, and perceiving I was ready to swoune, Madam (said I) let mee dye quickly, and suffer mee not to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish any longer. With that I fell downe, not knowing any bodie for neere a quarter of an houre. When Amintha recovering mee, I rose againe on my knees before the Queen, and letting her know, that what I requested came from mine heart: I beseech you Madam (said I, then weeping) to be no more cruell to me, then you are to the rest of your subjects, and suffer your selfe to be mov'd at mine indurements. These words forcing from her soule all the indignation my extravagancies had be got there, she for a while held her eyes fix'd on me, and after a long thoughtfulnesse, Wretch (said she) with what torture should not I punish thy disobedience? But I must not doe so. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by thy speeches thou offendest not willingly, but that before thou wert re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to cast off the respect thou owedst me, thou hadst lost thy judgement. Speak, unfortunate man, what is become of that discretion, which went for a Proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the people, and made the most judicious to say, that at last wisdome and youth were met together? Doest thou not see to what precipices thou daily run'st of thine owne contriving? Art thou not afraid, lest my patience grow wearie, and that my pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being exhausted, I should to that justice which I owe to my selfe, as well as to my subjects? But this is what is wished (thou say'st) and truly, I perceive well by thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that thou art fall'n into such a frenzie, as makes thee delight in what is most dreadfull. The love I owe to her that gave thee birth, and the services thou hast done
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54727:286"/>
me, preserve a sufficient will to dispose me to the forgetting thy crimes, and to take pitie on thy folly. Yes, Pisander, I will be so mercifull; and would have thee know, that I would willingly give a part of my Kingdome, if by that losse I could settle thee againe in the estate I wish thee. Whilst the Queen spake, mine eyes were not drie. I strove to stay my teares, but 'twas in vaine. There was no remedie but they must flow forth, and in spight of my desire to answer the Queen, I must abide a while silent. When my sighes and suffocatings, as well as my teares, gave mee leave to answer the Queen, Madam (said I) mine indiscretion is so great, that hitherto it hath not given in any intervall. But your Majesties wisdome hath suspended that tyrannicall power, and gives mee the use of reason. Be pleas'd, Madam, that I imploy well these good motions, and in expression of my gratitude, that I confesse I am amaz'd at the new proofes of your clemencie. Truly, Madam, when I consider the height of my guilt, I cannot give credit to mine eares, nor be perswaded there can be found on the face of the whole earth a goodnesse so neere approaching to the Divinitie, who in stead of punishing offences, proposeth a reward to the guiltie, on condition they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. You will have care of my life, Madam, and yet it is an unhappy source from whence have flow'd all the discontents your Majestie hath met with since you came into the world. The Gods love you. Nature hath out-gone her selfe to make you the chiefest of her miracles. Strangers admire you, which never had the felicitie of seeing you. Your people find no other difference betwixt the Deitie which they adore and you, save that the first is invisible, and you are seen among them. Even things inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate seem to take a soule when the businesse is of pleasing you. In short, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which conspires not to make you as happy as faire. The detestable Pisander onely opposeth that generall Law; and by an attempt, worthy of thunder, hath dared to contest with heaven and earth, with Gods and men, fortune and vertue. Take, Madam, take Pisander out of the world, and you shall find nothing after to molest you. The Queen, not induring the continuation of this speech: But (said shee) at least let me know what thou pretendest. Madam (said I) I pretend to die, since it is forbidden me to have any other intentions. The desire of death (repli'd Alcidiana) is a pleasing errour, which is hardly forc'd from a soule that gives no eare to reason; yet must thou strive to overcome this frenzie. Labour at it, Pisander, if thou wilt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd by Alcidiana, and take her word for it, thou wilt get the upper hand. I had a great mind to contradict this counsell, but Alcidiana arose, and gave mee no time to answer. Amintha (who without doubt knew the Queens intention) no sooner saw her retired, but shee took mee by the hand, and causing mee to sit downe by her: You see, Pisander (said shee) there's no more time to flatter or feed your selfe with idle hopes, which vanitie usually puffes up young men withall. The Queen loves you; and you cannot doubt of it, after so many proofes given you. But shee loves you so, as a good Mistresse should love an excellent servant, and a Queen extremely just, a most usefull and loyall subject. Beyond that you are to expect nothing. And I make known to you now, as a person who much values you, and takes part in all your interests, that if you had a thousand lives, and that they were all absolutely needfull for the Queens preservation, shee would see them all lost rather then to give any longer way to the continuance of your follies. And beleeve me, Pisander, it should even make you dye for shame, or at least, if you have not been wise enough to hinder the beginning, yet to be so in stopping the progression. Doe not seeme to be wise to no purpose, nor strive to conceale from me what you have in your heart. Is it not true, that you are in love with the Queen? 'Tis an offence which you esteem too glorious, that there should need the torture to draw the confession of it from you. You are not the first foole of your kind. Others farre beneath you have had the like extravagancies. But doe not you think with your selfe, that as those Darers have made themselves the laughter of all the Court, and the scorne of judicious people, that in the end you will make your selfe ridiculous, and be taken for a man fit for a bable, or to be shut up in the Hospitall of the <hi>Incurabili?</hi> In your owne conscience can you be so vaine, or rather mad to beleeve, that the Queen can fall in love with you? or to make amends for that which she hath shewne you, you would oblige her to take her Nurses son for her
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54727:287"/>
husband? When Amintha had no more to say, I thus repli'd: My birth (as you know, Amintha) is so eminent, that I see none (the person of the Queen excepted) who is above me; and I dare say without boasting, that shee shall either never marry, or be constrain'd to link with such a man, whose extraction shall not be able to parallel with mine: Not that I will place a thing (to me) of so small esteem in rank with those that may merit the favour of Alcidiana. There are requisite to it qualities of courage and wit, as rare as are her vertues and beautie. There must be a long perseverance, a faith inviolable; there must be respects and extraordinarie submissions: in briefe, there must (by long services) be a testimoniall. that the enjoying of so inestimable a jewell is the onely end of all thoughts and actions. Amintha at those words interrupting me: You (said shee) imagine these things to be of great value, but I assure you they are worth nothing, if they be not approv'd of by such for whose sake they are done. Now the Queen not onely gave no approbation to your errours, but from time to time let you understand by her wonted discretion, that you thereby irreparably offended her. From this veritie draw a necessarie conclusion, and you shall find, that even that on which you build your merits and pretensions, destroyes both the one and the other. If it behove me to consider my actions (I repli'd) as you look on them, I confesse, I never did Alcidiana any service, nor am to expect any thing from her. But I have a way of reasoning which confutes yours; and to tell you sincerely, what you but now deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of mee, 'tis, that I will rather forgoe my life then that passion which Alcidiana condemnes, and in spight of her rigour, disdaine, and threatnings, will never give over the prosecution of that which I esteem as my chiefest happinesse. Thou art lost, Pisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cri'd that judicious Lady. Would Heaven might please to divert my presaging, and restore to thee that reason which thine ill Angell hath depriv'd thee of. After these words Amintha arose, and remitting mee into the hands of the Chamberlaine, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him very severely to observe strictly what the Queen had given him in charge. I quickly understood what that new command was. As soon as I was return'd to my prison, I was shut into a chamber whose windowes were all grated with iron; none of my friends or servants were permitted to see mee: and thus was I kept neere three moneths, speaking and thinking such things as you may well imagine. At the end of that time, the great Chamberlaine came and brought me newes of my libertie, and told me, that the Queen had chosen mee to goe to render in her name the tribute to the Sun her father, and to celebrate in this Isle the sacrifice of their Alliance. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of that honour, as of an evident assurance that the Queen had resolv'd to ruine mee. My despaire too broke out more then ever; and if eight or ten men, who flew in upon me, had not taken away all power of offending, I had well let them know, that any man may die when he list. The Queen, hearing of my furie, sent some (devoutly consecrated) to visit me, whose eloquence and sanctitie of life did daily miracles. They came, and neglected nothing that might free me of my frenzie; and perform'd it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many long resistances. Then I betook me to my former calme, and confirming to them in cold bloud what I had spoken in my fits: Yes, fathers (said I) I will die, but let not this resolution make you beleeve, that I have any remainder at all of despaire left within mee. I sweare to you by that Eternall name which we are not suffered to abuse, that I will not precipitate the end of my dayes; and that, whether it be in war or otherwise, I will strive to meet it in such a way as may be said, I ran not headlong to it. A few dayes after this declaration, all things were ready for my voyage. I had notice of it; and Amintha coming to mitigate my afflictions, I intreated her to be a meanes to the Queen that I might take my leave of her. She made mee answer, that could not be done. At least then (said I) deliver her a letter from mee. I cannot doe that neither (repli'd shee) for I am <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o expresly forbidden it. Well, Amintha then (cri'd I) I must then die, and die without pitie. Let Alcidiana have her will. As soon as Amintha had left me, I went to ship, and with the first good wind setting saile, in eighteen dayes arriv'd in this Island. The high Priest, predecessour to this here now, receiv'd me with the same ceremonies you saw practis'd at your arrivall. The pomp of our sacrifices deserves well my describing it to you, but my mind is not able to busie it selfe with such unprofitable intertainments. Give mee leave therefore (without
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54727:287"/>
medling that way) to end the storie of my misfortunes, and leave the afflicting your thoughts with the representation of so many sad and deplorable accidents. You may please to know then, that after the unbloudy sacrifice had been performed, and they were to celebrate one like that you saw perform'd this day, I went to the chiefe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and besought him to put mee in the place of him whom the lot should that day condemne to die. The Priest at first knew not how to take a speech that seem'd so out of all reason; but perceiving that I constantly persisted in my petition: My son (said he) you are not the first to whom the hatred of living hath given the like desire. 'Tis not long since a Prince (whom I will not name) came expresly into this Isle to find that death, which his feare to offend heaven permitted him not to bestow on himselfe. To free him from that ungodly fantasie, I used all my best and the same reasons wherewithall I am bound now to contest with yours. Know therefore, that homicide is not committed onely by our hands, it is committed too by our wills; and hee is no lesse a murderer of himselfe that seeks the occasion of his owne death, then if he had indeed strook the poniard into his own breast: inasmuch as sin consists not but in a determinate will to doe the ill, or to procure it. This being so, my sonne, struggle generously with that temptation which would hurry you to your ruine; and be assur'd, that 'tis all one thing to cover what you desire, and to turne your owne weapons on your selfe. But if you have just cause to hate life, and that the miseries which are link'd to humane condition, in stead of exercising your patience, have abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely o'recome it, have recourse to that innocent and harmlesse remedie which Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion offers to free you from the tyrannie of fortune and your passions. Consecrate your selfe to the Eternall Providence which we adore in this Island under the figure of the Sunne, and expect without murmuring or disquiet what it hath ordain'd, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your life, that so you may find your peace in your obedience, and merit in making your selfe happy. Father (I repli'd) how much impatience soever I meet withall in searching out a better condition then mine owne, and however dreadfull the tortures may be, which the continuation of my life prepares for mee, yet will I follow your advice, and to assure you that I will never wave it, even now I make a vow to put my selfe among the number of the Slaves of the Sun. The chiefe Prelate, after hee had accepted my vow, told me, it must be publish'd in consecrating my selfe before all men to that great Sun, whereof the Sun was but an imperfect image. Those ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were put off to the next day, and then I tooke on these fetters which I weare so joyfully, that if my judgement faile mee not, I doe not beleeve the happinesse of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Alcidiana would have been more pleasing to mee. As soon as Lynceus (so is the Pilots name which serves in the sacred Vessell), saw mee in my new slaverie, hee took leave of the Priest, and return'd towards the Inaccessible Island. Polexander be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no longer able to containe himselfe, ask'd (straight) Pisander at what time Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana's Vessell did use to arrive at the Isle of the Sun. If you live but two moneths longer (repli'd Pisander) you shall see that glorious Vessell here, laden with offerings wonderfull for their raritie, and with victimes almost as spotlesse as is the Princesse which sends them to the God of puritie. 'Tis to be confess'd (said Polexander) that you have been wonderfull generous, in being able to preserve a respect to such a personage, which seems to have gone out of her selfe, of purpose, to forget what shee truly owed you. Whatsoever Alcidiana doth (repli'd Pisander) shee cannot be accused for doing ill. Her vertues are so extreme, that she can make good what is not so in it selfe; and ingratitude would become a vertue, if of necessitie Alcidiana should become ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. With this height of praise ended the conversation of the two Slaves; the one of Alcidiana, the other of the Sun. Polexander would gladly have continued the discourse, but fearing he should not be master enough of his emotions, hee preferr'd a solid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment before that which could not be but imaginary, and praising in himselfe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander, return'd to his lodging. The desire he had to disburthen himselfe to Diceus of these important secrets he laetly learn't, caus'd him (as soon as hee was retir'd) to take leave of Pisander, and shut himselfe in private with his trusty servant. Friend (said he) my conjectures are become reall truths. We are in the fatall Island, from which there is a certaine passage to the Inaccessible Isle. 'Twas from hence Lynceus return'd,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54727:288"/>
when I descri'd him neere to the Canaries; and to this place hee or some other is to come within two moneths to celebrate the famous sacrifice of Alliance, whereof wee have so often heard spoken. I know it from so good a hand, that 'twere meere folly to doubt of it; and that thou may'st be as confident as I am, hearken from whom it comes to me. Thereupon he epitomiz'd to him the storie of Pisander; and though he were his Rivall, yet he forgot nothing of what was due to so perfect a lover. Diceus, after a many exclamations and excessive expressions of his exceeding joy, imbrac'd the King his Master: Your Majestie (said hee) may be assured, that our joyes, as well as griefes, never come alone. For as before your arrivall in this Island, there was no day pass'd which brought you not some new misfortune, you may now likewise beleeve, that from henceforward you shall meet with as many felicities as you see the Sun's rising. This very day presents you many together. For besides that which you have enjoy'd in Pisanders relation, I bring you another, which is not to be accounted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those of small importance. You have heretofore thought, that the chiefe Priest did much resemble Alcippus, and I tell you for truth, 'tis even hee himselfe. I learn't it from one of his servants, and should have knowne it from his owne mouth, if I had not fear'd to discover you in disclosing my selfe to Alcippus. O Diceus (said Polexander) how increasest thou my happinesse! and how perfect is it, since with the hope of seeing Alcidiana, I re-gaine the best part of my selfe. But Diceus, if thou truly lovest mee, doe not deferre the contentment thou mayest give mee. Find out some meanes to get into the Arch-priests lodgings, invent some occasion to speak with him, and work it so, that hee may know I am here. Diceus, who was wont to serve the King his Master, with as much promptnesse as fidelitie, left him as soon as he had wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him into the Hall where the noble Slaves were wont to eat together; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretext of carrying some Letters to the Embassadors of the King of Gheneoa, who were upon going thence, slid into the Arch-priests lodgings. He found him at supper, and when he saw the place void of strangers which had supp'd with him, intreated the Prelate for a private audience. The Arch-priest looking wistly on him, bid him speak what he desired; but Diceus, falling at his feet, feigning a discontented man, My Lord (said he) that which hath given me the boldnesse to present my selfe before you is not onely long to be dilated, but of such importance, that I cannot (without being author of an extreme misfortune) impart it to any save your selfe. Your charitie, which is indifferently extended to all persons afflicted, will not (I hope) deny me one moment of your leasure to give eare to my miseries. The Arch-Prelate; thinking hee should know Diceus voice, and desirous to cleere himselfe of such troubles as he had felt at the first sight of Polexander, commanded Diceus to arise; and taking him (by the hand) into his withdrawing-chamber (whence he commanded two or three of his Slaves, who usually attended there) shut the doore himselfe, and then sitting downe on a Couch, Speak boldly (said hee to Diceus) here's none but my selfe can heare you. Diceus, knowing Alcippus as well by his voice as countenance, My Lord (said he) my name is Diceus, and I serve King Polexander. At which words the chiefe Priest, as transported, arose, and taking a light, stood long gazing on Diceus, At last, hee clapp'd the taper againe on the table, and casting his armes about Diceus neck, By what miracle (said he) art thou risen from the dead? or rather (deare Diceus) by what prodigie can'st thou live, and see thy deare Master wrap't up in dust? The King lives, repli'd Diceus; and though time, travell, and the torrid Zone have so changed him, that he is scarce to be knowne, yet I thought your affection would never let him slip out of your memory. 'Tis that same Illustrious Slave whom the King of Gheneoa desires to consecrate to that Sun he adores in heaven, and to the other he honours on earth. I doe not wonder now (repli'd Alcippus) at those emotions I felt at the first sight of that Slave. My soule, more cleer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fighted then mine eyes, knew him, all disguis'd as he was, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary agitations, made me resent the happinesse which (unknowne) was betided me. And doth then (my deare Diceus) the King our Master live? and hath that good Angell, which hath rescu'd him out of so many dangers, been of power to raise him againe? There needed no such great miracle (repli'd Diceus.) It must be so (said Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippus) or else all that happen'd in the Isle of Astramadan was meerly inchantment
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54727:288"/>
and illusion. I saw Diceus, I saw the place where the King fell downe dead among that great company of murderers which the traitor Astramadan had arm'd for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. I saw his bodie wounded in an hundred places, and his face disfigured with many a fearfull gash. I saw his armour strew'd about him all bloudy, and back'd to pieces. In a word, I saw all that could assure me he was dead. Nor did I see him alone. The cruell Tysiphone was a beholder, and after shee had satiated her fury on others, turn'd it on her selfe, that shee might not survive him, whom of all men had made her capable of love. Amintha saw him too, and the griefe shee took for his death would have lasted to this day, if the waves had not swallowed it up together with her bodie. But Diceus, I lose too much time to let thee know my errours. Tell me therefore by what miracle our good Master lives, or rather let me see him, let me speak with him, and be permitted once more to imbrace his knees. Diceus took him at his word, and would have led him to Polexander's lodging. But Alcippus staying him, Wee must (said hee) carrie our selves in this businesse with a great deale of discretion; and for mine owne part, I will leave them no place from dis-beguiling themselves, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken mee for another, have put into my hands the soveraigne authoritie of this Island. After he said thus much, he open'd a little doore, which was directly opposite to that by which they entred, and giving Diceus a little key, told him withall what use he should make of it. Diceus presently left him, and after he had gone through a long gallerie, came into a chamber adorn'd and shining with gold and azure. From thence he went out through a doore which hee open'd with the key the Arch-priest had given him, and then coming into a Cloister, he knew where he was. Presently he hastned to his Masters lodging, and finding him accompanied with those that were wont to wait on him, intreated him, since hee had been much troubled all day, that he would watch no longer. Polexander ghessing well at Diceus intention went to bed. And as soon as hee was laid, his attendants withdrew, and Diceus (who usually lay at his Masters beds feet) shutting first the doores, made him a full repetition of his discourse with Alcippus. But (said hee) to the end you may advise together of the meanes you are to use to get out of this Isle, and attaine to that of Alcidiana, 'tis fit you keep your selfe still disguis'd, and that you and Alcippus meet not together but in private. Some two houres hence I will conduct you by passages not much frequented, to a chamber, the key whereof he hath given me, and where hee will be as soon as the last prayers are ended. In the meane time sleep. For my part, I will watch, for feare you faile in your assignation. Ah! friend (repli'd Polexander) I should have but little curiositie, or to say better, but a small portion of reason, if being on the point of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my happinesse certaine, I were able to close mine eyes. No, no, Diceus, I will not sleep. Tell me therefore once againe all that Alcippus said to thee, and omitting the death of the extravagant Tysiphone, recount particularly what thou hast heard concerning Amintha. Diceus obey'd the command, but 'twas not so well done, but that he left the King his Master doubtfull what was become of that Lady. When hee had ended this relation, I have (said hee to Polexander) some advice to give you, on which depends all the successe of your labours and inquiries. 'Tis, that you expresly command Alcippus to compresse his affection, and keep more then ever that gravitie which he put on with the Priesthood. By this meanes he shall secure your life, for he may secretly take out the ball whereon your name is written, since he keeps the vessell whereinto all the fatall balls are throwne: and besides, when Alcidiana's Embassadors arrive, under the qualitie of Arch-Prelate, and Interpreter of the Deitie's will, he may invent some specious pretext, that may oblige the Embassadors to waft you to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible Island. But when will that fatall moment betide (cri'd Polexander, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with the power of his imagination) wherein I may see againe that blessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, which hath conceal'd and kept it selfe so long away from mine inquisition? O fairest Alcidiana! be pleas'd to let me taste the happinesse which my hope gives mee of re-visiting you; and that losing with my despaire the memorie of my afflictions, I may inure my selfe by little and little to those raptures, and almost incomprehensible blessednesse, which are inseparably annex'd to the condition of such as serve you. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander would have stuck as ravish'd with these sweet meditations, if Diceus had not
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54727:289"/>
interrupted them, and told him, 'twas time to goe meet Alcippus. Polexander there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in all haste clad himselfe, follow'd his guide, went through the Cloister, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen of any bodie came to the chamber where he was to meet Alcippus. He fail'd not; and presently that worthy Favourite, casting himselfe at the feet of the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Let Heaven (said hee) doe now what it will with mee, I aske it no more, since I have the happinesse of seeing my good Master againe. O errour! which hast made me shed so many teares, I thank thee for so happily deceiving me. Polexander taking up Alcippus, Remember (said he) who you are, and in what place; goe not on in these superfluous testimonies both for your selfe and to me, but without losing in needlesse demonstrations of love, this time which may be better spent, give mee an accompt of all you have done since your departure from the Island of Astramadan, and chiefly let me know what is become of Amintha. But I feare much, that you can relate to mee nothing of her that can be welcome newes; for if I call to mind well what you writ in a Cave which is at the point of a rock which they call the Hermits rock, you were separated from her by the wrack of your ship. What sayes your Majestie (repli'd Alcippus) and what Demon could bring you to that rock? I was brought thither (said the King) by an adventure the most strange and happy in the world: for my ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sunk, I had perish'd but for that rock, which to mee was a very favourable haven. There I spent two dayes and two nights, and read my Epitaph which you had ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But put mee out of trouble, and tell mee, how you were forc'd to forsake Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha. Alcippus beginning his relation at Tysiphone's taking a resolution to follow Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander to the Isle of Astramadan, and having continued it with all that which had passed in that Isle: As soon (said he) as we saw that desperate woman dead, Amintha and my selfe return'd to your Vessell, and being not able to speak, so much had your losse quell'd us, that we spent the rest of the day not knowing what to resolve on. At last Amintha starting up, and speaking suddenly, No (said shee) I will not leave the bodie of Polexander to the mercie of his murderers. With that shee went forth, and never telling mee what shee intended to doe, commanded some of your Mariners to carry her back on shore. I went into the Shallop with her, but we had not row'd scarce halfe a mile, when we saw all the beach cover'd with armed men. Our Mariners there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at fell hard to their oares, and having told us, that there was no reason for us to put our selves into the hands of those barbarous people, got back againe to your ship. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently there came out of the haven two Vessels of the enemy, and had had we not with all speed gotten into open sea, infallibly wee had run the hazzard of losing life or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. The wind (which favour'd us much) meeting a ship so good of saile as was yours, had quickly made our pursuers lose sight of us. Two dayes and two nights we sail'd we knew not whither. The third day we discover'd an Island, and there our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners cast anchor, to take some refreshment, and from thence to steere right for the Canaries. Amintha in all the voyage had no other thought then of your death, and from time to time speaking loud enough to be heard, Ah! too superstitious Queen, (said she) how lately wilt thou repent thy selfe, for preferring false beseemlinesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loyall affection? Well, thou art now rid of this cause of thy disquiet; but I feare for thy peace, lest those disturbances be redoubled when thou comest to understand in what manner thou art delivered from them. Thus was she talking, when I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd her that we were arriv'd at an unknowne Island. You may doe what you please, said she. For mine owne part, I am resolv'd to think on nothing but how I may grieve enough for the losse we have sustain'd. Seeing her so constant to her affliction, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that if there remain'd in you any knowledge or feeling after death, you would accuse mee for the most ingratefull amongst men, if I had not a particular care of a person to whom your memorie was so infinitely deare. I resolv'd therefore to bring her to the Canaries, and put her in possession of all the treasure you had left there, that so shee might end her life in the same splendour shee was borne, and have no cause to repent her of the affection shee had borne you. As soon as our Mariners had provided themselves of all that was necessary, they set saile againe, and leaving the South be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, bore up full North. From the very first day were we beaten by a furious tempest, and throwne so farre out of our course, that our Pilot confess'd that he knew
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54727:289"/>
none of those places where the wind drove us. This storme lasted foure dayes, and the fifth day, some Sailers advertising me that the ship would not be long above water, I caus'd a Shallop to be launch'd to save Amintha, and straight went into her cabin, where finding her at her ordinary exercise of weeping and lamenting for you, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought her even by your selfe that she think on her safetie. If Polexander (said shee) were alive, or rather if he could make you know his thoughts, you would soon see and confesse, that he disapproves of that petition which you make me. He lov'd mee too well, to suffer mee linger too long in miserie; and that which you desire from mee hath no other end, but the continuation of my afflictions. The King my Master (I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd) commanded me to serve you as himselfe; and if he were in that extremitie you are now, my dutie and affection would oblige mee to doe for his preservation that which I now doe for yours. Therefore (Madam) contest no more against what is just, and be not guilty of your owne death. At last, shee yeelded to mine intreaties, and coming to the ships side, I know not how (said she) without astonishment, you should imagine me to be more safe in a little shallop, then in this great ship. I told her the reason, but whilst she disputed with mee, a gust of wind blew mee over-boord, and by an incredible good fortune, in falling over, I met with the rope wherewithall the shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop was fastned to the ship. In that extremitie I lost not my judgement, but cast my selfe into the shallop. Surely the rope was not good, for it presently broke, and the wind in a moment had carried me so far from the ship, that I lost sight of her, whether it were (as I beleeve) that she was sunk, or, as it is not impossible, that the tempest had driven her a contrary course to mine. All the rest of the day was I sometimes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and sometimes in hell; and when it came neere to Sun-setting, my shallop rent it selfe in peeces against the Hermits rock. When having no other hope then in mine armes, I strove to get to one of the points; and I swome so happily, that without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my selfe (among so great a number of rocks which lay even with the water) I got to a little tongue of land, or rather of sand, which thrust it selfe a pretty way into the sea. There I met with the Hermit which surely gave name to that rock, and found him busied in digging a pit in the sand. Hee was no way at all surpriz'd at mine arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall. But on the contrary, leaving his work, and coming to me with open armes, Thou art welcome (said he) my son, and cast from thy memorie all things which thou canst imagine may afflict thee; for either mine art absolutely is false, or thou do'st not only go on in a progression of happiness, but in a way of saving the life of that person whom thou holdst most dear of all those in the world. With that he imbrac'd me; and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again, For your sake (said he) I must leave off my work till another time. Father (said I) if it be a work that is of necessitie to be done, give me your spade, and I will ease you of the paine of perfecting this grave. So you shall (said he, smiling) but there's no haste. Hee that is to take up his last habitation in this grave, will be coming yet some few dayes. This talk, so unconformable to ordinary discourse, made mee think the Hermit had lost his judgement with his yeares, or that I had not understanding enough to conceive the sense of his mysterious talking. The good man then took me by the hand, and told me, I needed to rest my selfe. Ascending therefore (himselfe first) by a little way cut out of the rock, wee came to the entry of the same grotto, where you found the letters ingraven by mine hand. The good Hermit made mee unclothe my selfe, and having given me some cotton clothes to wipe mee, threw a robe about my shoulders like his owne. And as soon as I was clad, Son (said hee) our bodies are not as some imagine them, enemies, to be used with all kind of rigour. They are ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells worthy the treasure they inclose, and you must beleeve they are very deare to the Power which created them, since he hath left there as in gage the greatest of all his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. This being so, wee are to have a particular care of them, and to conferre what they require, since it most certaine, that they desire nothing but what is necessary. To verifie this document, hee presented mee a corken cup, full of cleare water, and dri'd dates in an earthen platter. I eat and drank more to obey him then for any need I had, and after we had watched very late, I took possession of one of the two beds of mosse which you saw in the Cave. At day-break the old man awak'd me, and bringing me to the top of the grot, and turning my face to the Sun, which appear'd not yet, but
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54727:290"/>
by the severall colours where withall he painted the clouds: My son (said he) let us ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thankes to that Deitie which inhabits in that light, which wee may call another Deitie, since by his perpetuall course and wonderfull revolutions, he preserves our being, and drawes us out of darknesse. After he had spoke thus, he fell to his prayers, and I to mine, without observing a superstition, which in mine opinion, favour'd somewhat of Idolatrie. When wee had ended our Oraisons, wee went downe to the sea, which was much calm'd during the night, and there the good Hermit having throwne some sho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell-fulls of sand out of the grave which hee had begun; I resemble (said hee) that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall Bird, which delights in building her owne tomb, because shee knowes, that the last moment of her life is the first of her resurrection. It may be you heeded it not, my son, therefore I am the more willing to tell you, that 'twas for my selfe I digg'd this grave. 'Tis long agone since Heaven promis'd mee your arrivall, and assured mee, that a man of extraordinary vertue, driven by a tempest, should come and close the eyes of my feeble age, and succeed in a place which I have preferr'd before the government of men, and the rule of one of the greatest Empires of Asia. The knowledge I had of mens ingratitude, and of the injustice where withall they are wont to requite the pains, watchings and cares of those great Genius's, on whom most Kings disburthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the government of their Estates, made me forsake a glorious slaverie, a torture that had the face and magnificence of a tyrant, and in a word, a misfortune envied by all ignorant fooles. I rather chose to spend my dayes in a secure solitude, and in speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which from the top of this rock, carrying me up to heaven, have made me decypher those great golden characters, whereby we understand all that passeth on earth. I have read in the book what is to come, such things as other men are ignorant of. I know the revolution of Empires. I have seen Kings, who after their conquests have been constrain'd to crouch under the weight of irons, and weare out their miserable dayes in a shamefull slaverie. I have seen such slaves, as have been condemn'd to the most base and infamous drudgeries, to break their chaines, and force to submit to their Empire those who had been accustomed to bring others in subjection. But to what purpose should I entertaine you with these generall notions? Let it suffice me to let you know, that the end of my dayes is at hand, and that you are a while to possesse that place which I have neere these threescore yeares enjoyed. By that meanes you shall attaine to the greatest dignitie this day on earth; and shall see the accomplishment of those things which you have most desired. Assure your selfe on my word, and presse me not to unfold my selfe more plainly. After the wise Hermit had spoke thus to mee, hee wash'd his face and hands with sea-water, and ascending againe into his grot, made a small repast of foure or five dry dates, and a cup of water. I took as much as he, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to heare him discourse: Father (said I) if those ambitious soules, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb the peace of all Nations, to glut their insatiable appetites, could once compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that a man might be happy with a few dates and water, would not be even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate to see how miserably wretched they are in the possessing of such treasures as they run to teare out of the very entrailes of unknowne worlds? Oh! how truly doe I know it now to be true which hath been so often told me, that he only is rich, not who possesseth much, but that can be contented with little! My son (repli'd the Hermit) that Eternall providence, which could compose a harmony out of things seeming the most discordant, would, that from the varietie of parts in the Universe, should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the beautie of all. The ambitious have their share in the imbellishment. If they throw downe on one side, they build on the other; if they ruine their Competitors, they enrich their Confederates: and their designes, which have never an end, are as so many engines, whereof that Providence makes use to move the massie bodie of the world, and hinder, by frequent shoggings and agitations, that it fall not into a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall lethargie. Peace and immutabilitie is plac'd in heaven; action and change are the lots of the earth. So see wee that the soules which inhabit heaven live in a perpetuall tranquillitie, and find themselves so full satisfi'd with their condition, that they know not so much as the use of desiring. We on the contrary, who lead an unquiet and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous life, continually run after novelties. Our friendship and hatred follow, and destroy one another. Every houre workes us to severall and differing wishes; and our
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54727:290"/>
minds, which seek for a beatitude which they will never meet withall, and yet eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally hope for, are perswaded, that there is no other way left them to attaine to it, but by incessantly passing from one condition to another. If heaven had treated us as it hath done the Demons, and placed us presently in the aboad of true felicitie, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> would have given us quiet minds, and understanding capable of obedience. But thinking it fit onely to propose to us that happinesse, as a goale, whereto it was impossible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine without much straining, and a haven not to be anchored in, but through many tempests: it hath made us stirring, lively, impatient, and ambitious, to the end, that these severall thoughts might be as so many spurs to egge us on to that race; and as so many mufflers, which blinding our eyes from all dangers, might make us incapable of weighing them, and by consequence, void of all feare. What doth not that insolent, dangerous, and rash fever of the soule, which we call Valour, produce? To what extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities doth not that other ingage us (with delight) which we call Love? Have not all ages seen, (and doth not ours yet behold) men, who to satisfie their owne passion, and if I dare call it so, heavenly madnesse, expose themselves to hazzards, and condemne their bodies to such punishments, as the greatest and cruellest tyrants of the world would not without horrour have made them undergoe? yet they indure it with a great deale of alacr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ie, they suffer it with a benediction; and because their thought finds there its element, they deem to find there, and no where else their felicitie. It seems, the Understanding loseth something of its own in its errours; and that Reason, which should be a light for the guidance of man, is altogether extinguish'd, or shines not, but as those wandring fires which lead passengers out of their way, and in stead of being the meanes to avoid all precipices, have no other light but such as may dazle their eyes, for feare they should eschew them. But (my son) you ought to know, that the good which proceeds from this folly, recompenceth with usurie the ill it procureth. If you aske me, Who incited the first of men to defend the weak, and to become the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Monsters and Tyrants? I will answer you, 'twas Love. Love inflames the soule farre more then bloud, fills it with the desire of honour; and purging it of all it had contracted of base and terrestriall by the contagion of the body, purifies and lifts it to that supreme perfection whereto it is destinated. Was it not Love who drew out of the Island (where may be he had languish'd all his life) that Prince who fills all the world with the renown of his actions? Is it not he, that hath led him through all parts of the world to avenge the oppressed, to punish the oppressors, to bring vertue into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that had been long neglected, and to banish thence vice, which had gotten tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and sectaries? How many Kings hath he re-establish'd in their thrones? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny usurpers hath he expell'd? Consider well his life, and you will acknowledge, that if it had not been accompanied with troubles, with desires, and (to say all in a word) with Love, it had been no more profitable, nor much more illustrious, then that of the most cowardly and obscurest man breathing. All that you relate to mee, father (said I) is most true, (knowing well he meant your Majestie) but what availes it now that great personage to have runne so many dangers, and to have so often expos'd his life for the safety of others? He is dead, as one of the vulgar, and of so lamentable a death, that it is hardly spoken of. You will say that his fame, which lives in the memories of most men, is an entire and perfect recompence for all the travells he under-went. Oh! father, did he now live, hee would truly let you know the vanitie of that reward; and make you confesse, that Love and Honour are certainly two of those Inchanters which promise pearles and diamonds, but give us onely a few oaken leaves and acornes. My sonne, repli'd the Hermit, Ignorance is alwaies unjust, but it is not alwaies criminall, and is not so principally, when it is accompanied with a deale of affection. Yours is of that nature, and therefore I condemne it not. But know, that the man whom you bewaile, is not in case to deserve it. Neither Love nor Death shall ever rob him of the felicities are due to him. I dare say, he enjoyes them already; and though his troubles have been great, his recompence shall be farre more. But let us break off this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, since I have not so long time to live that I should bestow any part of it on any other save my selfe. In this sort having ended our conversation, the holy man intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to goe and finish the grave he had begun, and leave him a while alone, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:54727:291"/>
himselfe seriously for the great voyage he was to make. I obay'd him, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove an houre in digging. That done, I ascended againe up to the Cave, and found the good Hermit laid on his bed of mosse. I came neere, to give him an accompt of my labour, but he was not in case to receive it. He lifted his eyes and hands towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and seem'd to be so transported thither already, that he remembred no more any thing that was earthly. I took him by the hand, all amaz'd to see him in that estate; and demanded what he ailed, and what I might doe to comfort him. But he answer'd not. I then thought him to be extremely sick, and to get him out of his swoune, began to stirre him. By little and little his judgement return'd, and presently knowing mee, Oh! my son (said he) out of what a trouble have you brought me? I saw the habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blessed all open. My soule ravish'd to quit this clog of earth which hinders her flying thither, did her utmost endeavour to be absolutely disburthened of it. But as she complain'd for seeing all her industry bootlesse, a voice call'd mee by my name: Beware (said it) that thou break not those ligaments which hold thy bodie bound to thy soule. Thou wantest one thing, without which it is forbidden thee to enter into this place of all delights. The voice flying into aire, I call'd a long time to intreat it to instruct me what it was I wanted for my felicity. But I re-claim'd in vaine. It would not deliver me out of the torment whereinto it had throwne me; and I was in such an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of mind as is not to be imagined, when your calling brought mee out of so strange a dreame, or rather so wonderfull a transportation of the spirit. No sooner had the holy man recounted to mee his vision, but I imagined that heaven desirous to bestow on him that reward it hath promised to all good men, had wrought a miracle in the moment of his departure, that so by the knowledge of that verity which had never been spoken to him, he might attaine the beatitude propos'd for the salary of its beliefe. Hereupon I told him, it was reveal'd me from heaven what was wanting for his gaining that true happinesse, and afterwards, as fully as I could in so short a time, made knowne the mysteries and fundamentalls of what we beleeve. After which that learned man, who all his life time had made profession of the most solid and rationall parts of Philosophy, witnessed so great a submission, and gave so great a credence to such mysteries, as being infinitely elevated above all reason, must needs justle with his, and cleane overcoming it, hee demanded to be perfected by lavation, which I perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and had no sooner done, but he (with an hearty ejaculation and instant prayer) sunk downe by mee, and testifi'd, that the death of a good man is a true peace, and a pleasing sleep. I confesse, I wept at so great a losse, and you were not the onely man whom I was bound to bewaile. I watch'd him till next day, and as soon as the Sun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose, carried him to the place chosen by himselfe for his interment. His funerals ended, I resolv'd to take possession of his Hermitage for the remainder of my life. But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not where to draw the water, or get the dates whereon hee liv'd, I determin'd to dye with that absolute resignation and religious constancy which the holy man had taught me. Yet was I not reduc'd to that extremity, for eight dayes after the Hermits death, I saw a little Barque arrive at my rock guided by two Negro's. They descri'd me on the top of the rock, and the distance hindring them from any certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they surely took mee for my predecessour. By their shouts they made shew of their joy, and brought on shore eight or ten barrells of fresh water, and some six little chests of dates. As soon as those things were unshipp'd, the Black-Moores cri'd out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as 'twere to take their leaves, and so return'd, without any curiositie of visiting me. After I had long meditated on somewhat that was not very likely, I imagin'd, that the late Hermit being not desirous to be seen by any man, had given order to such as were to furnish him with his ordinary pittance, to land what they brought at the foot of the rock, and so to returne without troubling him in his solitude. How ere it was, I remain'd there three moneths, living according to the incouragement which the life and death of the holy Hermit gave me and receiv'd such things as were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for me from the hands of the same Negro's. And I grew then so well accustom'd to that manner of life, that the most pleasing things of the world pass'd not through my memory, but as objects of commiseration and contempt, and I thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but how to dye well, when a great ship, whose sailes were of purple and gold,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:54727:291"/>
shew'd her selfe one morning some miles off my rock. I confesse to you, that object did not almost a jot move mee, and I wished often, that they who were in that proud Vessell, fearing to fall on my rock, would turne their sailes another way. But I had not my desire satisfied. On the contrary, the tall ship came with full sailes within a mile of my rock, and casting anchor there, for feare of the shelves and the crags, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd five or six men which descended into a great boat, and then with an extreme swiftnesse came right to the rock. There they landed, and presently came up to my Cave. My haire was so exceedingly growne since my living there, that I had not much lesse then I have now: and besides, being growne gray, as you know it did begin to be so from mine age of five and twenty, I seem'd to be above threescore and ten, though I was not five and forty. Those men, certainly taking me for my Predecessour, cast themselves at my feet, imbrac'd my knees, aske mee pardon for troubling my retired quiet by their coming, and having protested, that they had not done it but by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse command from heaven, besought mee to accept the dignitie of its Arch-priest, which it selfe came (if they might say so) to offer him by their mouthes. I answer'd them, that men had their understanding too dull to conceive that which came from above; for it hapned often, that the Oracles and the advertisements from thence were ill expounded, and by such a mistake, men did cleane contrary to what was expected from their obedience. Assure your selves therefore, that you are fallen into that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, and you have not well understood the words of your Deity. Have recourse to him againe, and beseech him, that hee will vouchsafe to be the Interpreter of his owne Oracles, and leave me to finish on this rock the pennance which I owe for the sins of my youth. The most remarkable of the company, speaking then for all: You strive in vaine (said hee) to resist the voice of Heaven which calls you. Those inconveniencies which you propose to make us alter our intention, are so many reasons to confirme us in it. Humility is the true signe of the soules sanctity; and yours, which strives to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen you even to nothing, in lieu of making us quit the opinion wee have of your life, reacheth us, that it is more miraculous then we have heard it related. To this answer I repli'd with a little earnestnesse, to shew my heart spoke by my tongue. But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring at last, that the holy man had often charged mee, not to resist such occasions as Heaven should proffer for my retirement from my solitude, I yeelded to the requests of those strangers. Yet before I went so farre, I am (said I) ready to obey, since the command, which is brought by you, deprives me of mine owne free-will, and forbids my thinking on any other thing then the service of heaven. Tell me therefore to what imployment I am destin'd. He who spoke last, beginning againe, after all his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were risen up, You must be pleas'd, said he, (to give you a full light into all you desire to know) that I begin my discourse from the establishment of those ceremonies whereof Heaven hath appointed you the chiefe Orderer and Dispenser. Know, that some seventy leagues from this rock there lies an Island, which is not frequented but by such as adore the Creatour of all, under the image of the fairest of his creatures, I would say under the figure of the Sun. Six of the greatest Kings that rule on the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that of the Kingdome of Manicongo, the mighty Monarch of the Abissines, and the Prince (favour'd by Heaven) which raignes in the Inaccessible Island, are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall which have continued in the adoration of that Deitie. Every yeare they send to the famous Temple, which their Predecessors built, offerings truly worthy their royall piety; and acknowledging, though they be Kings, that they are nothing but a little dust in the sight of the supreme Majestie, present to that Excellence part of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, as so many severall tributes, which subjects owe to their Soveraigne. Within this seven or eight hundred years that those Princes have continually inrich'd our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is so replenish'd with gold and jewells, that if it were not preserv'd by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar miracle, it had long ere this time been the prey of Pirates, or of such Kings which search and rifle land and sea to satiate their prodigious avarice. Nor are wee onely to feare such strange Pilferers, but we are to doubt of those who by our suffrages are call'd to the soveraigne Priesthood, and by consequence, to the ordering of those dangerous riches. Those who liv'd before us have been so happy in the election of their chiefe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, that if we except one, who would have turn'd his Priesthood into tyrannie, and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54727:292"/>
worne a Crowne in stead of a Mitre, there hath not been knowne any, who with a great deale of innocencie dispenc'd not the treasures of our Deitie. It is now five moneths since the great Uranias, who had fitten on the Sacerdotall throne neer thirty yeares, left us with the grief of his losse, the sorrow for not being able to find him a successour. Many of our Clergy were propos'd; but the ignorance of some, and the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse of others excluded them: and wee did not beleeve, that the dignity of Arch-priest had the vertue of conferring learning and honesty on such as had none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. In the meane time, for want of a head, the members began to languish, and we saw plainly, that if disorders were not stopp'd by a speedy election, the Temple would be profan'd, and the treasure abandon'd to the covetousnes of an Usurper. Hereupon we entred the second time into the place appointed for so important a choice, and came out againe without agreeing on it. In this necessity we had recourse to extraordinary helps. We made publick processions, we redoubled our oraisons, wee added ashes and sackcloth to our prayers, our fastings and sacrifices, and begg'd from heaven to chuse it selfe an agreeable Sacrificator. After we had spent a full moneth (day and night) in these actions of pietie, Benycirac, the eldest of the Priests, forcing himselfe from the incommodities which detain'd him in his bed, came one day to us in the Temple, and I sweare (said he) by the sanctity of this place, and what we worship here, that I will speak nothing but what hath been reveal'd to me from above. The last night, whilst I prayed, and with teares besought for an end of our contestations, in the nominating us an Head, I heard a voice which said, Leave afflicting thy selfe, I have heard thy petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and those of thy companions. Your requests are heard, and if you persevere, you shall quickly have a Soveraigne, the most pious man that ever ascended the throne of the chiefe Priesthood. Right against this Realme, which is round ingirt, either by the sea, or the river Niger, ariseth in the midst of the waves a high rock, which for this many years hath been the aboad of the most religious man which my rayes inlightens. 'Tis hee that must succeed Uranias. But hasten, lest you lose the occasion. As soone as Benycirac had told us his revelation, we began the unbloudy sacrifice, to begge for some visible signe, whereby wee might be confirm'd in what the Priest had propos'd to us. What we desir'd we obtain'd, and presently concluding that wee were to come hither, wee cas'd the sacred Vessell to be made ready. My selfe and my companions were chosen to make all knowne to you. We have had a very happy voyage, and should be ingratefull, if we doe not render continuall thanks for our good successe, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse, that it is an assured presage of our felicitie in your Priesthood. Therefore wee come to beseech you by your owne zeale, and the honour of him that sent us, to accept of the charge whereof you are thought worthy, and to restore to our Temple and Altars the respect which Ambition and Impiety would have robb'd them of. Let us on then (said I) my brethren and friends, and forgetting (all of us) our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, labour for the glory of our great Master. That very day I took leave of mine Hermitage, and the blessed Ghost of the holy Hermit, and imbarquing my selfe in the Vessell of the Sun, happily arriv'd in this Island. Here was I receiv'd by all the Clergy as some great Saint, and install'd with a great deale of ceremony in the dignity of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Sacrificator. Since I exercis'd this charge, I have seen the catalogue of all the Princes and Nations which have used to visit the Temple of the Sun, and noting that the Princes of the Inaccessible Island came hither to celebrate the sacrifice of Alliance, whereof we have spoken; I not onely more lamented then ever your losse, but I let my selfe fall into mutterings and speeches injurious to that Providence. But it hath (out of pitie and infinite wisdome) subverted them, and rendring me that blisse which I thought utterly lost, ingaged me to convert my griefes and lamentations into thanksgivings. Alter Alcippus had thus ended his discourse, he humbly besought his Master to let him know how he fell into the hands of the King of Gheneoa. Diceus (said Polexander) will at leasure informe you of all that. The businesse is now, to take order how I must hereafter demeane my selfe in this Island. Alcippus having confirm'd him in all that Pisander had related touching the arrivall of Alcidiana's ship, and made known the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility of sending to that Princesse for his being inroll'd in the number of her Slaves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated he would not discover himselfe to any, but expect with patience the houre of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54727:292"/>
his good fortune. Polexander approving Alcippus advice, retir'd to his chamber as privately as he came thence. When he was laid, instead of sleeping, he began to muse on the contentment he was to receive at his up-rising. But, as if his memorie had been jealous of his satisfaction, though it was but imaginary, it represented to him Alcidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's anger, farre greater and more mortall then it was; and bringing him to meditate on that bloudy Declaration she had publish'd against his life, made him conceive, that he could not without disobeying her dare to set foot on the Inaccessible Island. With that thought, crying out, as if hee had indeed committed some execrable crime. Let me perish (said hee) since Alcidiana commands it; nor let me by any subterfuge dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the necessitie of dying, since the Lawes of this Temple ingage mee to it. Throw in againe, Alcippus, throw in againe the ball to the vessell of death, and doe not betray thy conscience for the sparing of a life which I cannot lose too soone, since Alcidiana will not have it last any longer. But may be thou wilt say, You but little know that Princesses intention. Those things which she hath made publick, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from those she retaines in private. Her thoughts are not altogether answerable to her words. You must interpret Alcidiana; by Alcidiana; and beleeve, that she hath not pronounc'd the sentence of death against you for any other end, then that she might have cause to make you sensible of her pitie. Amintha and Pallante have said, that you cannot doubt of Alcidiana's goodnesse, without obliging her to doubt of your fidelity. 'Tis true, Alcippus, I have infallible testimonies of that Princesses favour. If her Edicts affright me, her thoughts re-assure me; if I see my death in the one, I meet my life in the other. Let us therefore cast off all kind of settled will, and resting in a generall indifferencie (as to our selves) goe, and heare from the mouth of our Judge, whether we must live or die. With this resolution Polexander fell asleep, and it caus'd it so soundly, that the Sun was got far above the Hemisphere before he awak'd. Diceus, who durst not make any noise, was as long in bed too. But assoon as hee heard his Master stirre he arose, and came and drew his curtaine. Friend (said the Prince) wee doe ill observe the diligence prescrib'd us. If our superiours come to know what we are doing, and find us yet in bed, I doubt we shall receive sharp reprehensions from them. Your Majesty may give them leave to talk, repli'd Diceus, and laugh at the severity of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, under which you are so little while to live. Thou sayest true, said Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der smiling. Therefore help me up, and expose me not to a displeasure which I may avoid. Hee was no sooner clad, but the usuall cry obliged him to goe to the common Hall. There he found the King of Gheneoa's Embassadors, which came to take their leave, and to aske him in the name of their Master, whether hee were fully resolv'd to persevere in the service of the Sunne and Alcidiana. After Polexander had imbrac'd them all one after another, Relate (said he) to the King your Master, that I am more obliged to him then he can imagine, and ere it be long, I will send to give him thanks proportionable to the favours I have received. The Embassadors tooke their leaves with teares in their eyes, and went presently to imbark themselves with all the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims. Assoon as the guards of the Isle saw they were out of sight, the chiefe Priest with his Clergie and all the Slaves went to the Temple, to make their accustomed prayers for the good successe of the Pilgrims voyage. That day Alcippus had a long discourse with Polexander, and ingaged Diceus to related to him in particular the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures which had betided their Master since hee was left for dead in the Island of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stramadan. Diceus forgot nothing in his relation, but gave Alcippus so many new causes of astonishment, that he could not chuse but cry out, O great Prince! by whose valour we see renewed againe the true age of the ancient Hero's; what thanks and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars doest thou owe to the Power that hath rais'd thee so high above all other Princes? For a whole moneth intire, Polexander, Alcippus, and Diceus, did nothing every night but entertaine themselves with their adventures, and prepare for the happy day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Alcidiana's ship was to be descri'd on the coasts of the Island of the Sun. The very day they expected her, there was a great Vessell by them discover'd, which came steer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the course from Alcidiana's Island. The guards gave notice of it to the chiefe Priest, and after the wonted ceremonies done, they caus'd the ship to enter the Port. Those who were within her, confusedly got to shore, and thereby made the guard
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54727:293"/>
suspect somewhat. Yet their habit of Pilgrims re-assuring them, they brought them to the entry to the Temple. But by chance one of the Priests being there (and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their wilde and curst looks, that they hid some wicked designe under their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout habit) had the curiositie to come neerer, and view them better. But his prying cost him his life, for those disguis'd theeves perceiving they were discover'd, inhumane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdered the Priest, and presently casting off their robes, shew'd their armour. They were at least two hundred desperate fellowes, that resolv'd to dye, or to rob the Temple of its treasure. They fell furiously on the guard that would have stopp'd them, and left not one alive. The lesser Slaves of the Temple running to their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, fought a long while; but seeing themselves forc'd to give back, retir'd under the Portico of the Temple, with a resolution to dye ere they would forsake it. The fight was bloudy and furious. About an hundred of the theeves were slain in that skirmish, but above three hundred Slaves bore them company; and the rest dis-heartened, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd the protection of the holy places and sacred treasure to the ravaging and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of those bloudy minded villaines. Presently then, the Arch-priest caus'd the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Slaves of the Sun to arme themselves, and desirous to make knowne Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's valour, commanded him aloud to goe and expose his life for the defence of their Altars. Our Heroe seeing himselfe remitted to his former true profession, went out of the Temple, and falling in among the theeves, made them feele the power of his arme. As many blowes as he strook, so many men laid he dead at his feet. The most obstinate to fight recoil'd before him; and finding themselves brought to stand on their defence, lost all the great hopes they had long conceived. The Prince seeing them stagger, pierc'd in among the troop, and so drove them furiously to the Sea side. Some were drown'd, others flying into their ship, were there burnt by the wilde-fire was throwne into her. This tumult being ended, the High-priest and his Clergie searched among the dead bodies to know whom they had lost. They found about five hundred, and amongst them, twenty of the noble Slaves, who following Polexander, had a great share in the glory of that day. The generous Pisander, who fought still at our Heroe's side, was slaine by the Captaine of the theeves, and by so glorious a death, sacrific'd his life to his Goddesse as well as to his Deitie, I would say to the Queen Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana, as well as to the Sun. Polexander much bewail'd the losse of so brave a man, and publickly testifi'd, that the Island was depriv'd of her principall defender. But all those who had either fought by our Heroe, or been lookers on, cri'd out, that to him alone belong'd that title; and that his invincible courage had (solely) preserv'd the Temple, the Priests, and the treasure of the Sun. Alcippus himselfe went and pluck'd a branch of Palme-tree, and making a crowne of it, plac'd it on Polexanders head. He call'd him the second Tutelar God of the Island, the Victorious, the Invincible, the Protector of their Altars; and bringing him into the Temple, as it were in triumph, there, with all his Clergie, rendred thanks to the Sunne, and hung over the Altar high our Heroe's bloudy sword.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lcippus, who was not lesse sensible and generous then hee was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to be to the King his Master, had no greater desire then to be able to contribute any thing to the honour of his Prince. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore so faire an occasion offer'd him by his incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble valour, hee made an Oration to his Clergie, and so elevated what Polexander had done for the common good, that they were like to have taken him for that God himselfe whose Slave he was. He afterwards told them, that the Eternall Providence had lead them to the brink of the precipice, to advertise them, that they were not to sleep in their sound securitie, nor trust so much to supernaturall aide, as to neglect humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. 'Tis for us, my brothers (said he) to make good use of the advertisement hath been given us; and to serve our selves of that succour which heaven hath afforded us in the very instant that our danger betided. The sacred Temple had bin prophaned, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars had lost their veneration, the treasure had become the prey of sacrilegious theeves, our holy Character had been violated; in a word, the aboad of a Deity, was like to be turn'd into a retraict for theeves, if the invincible Araxez (Polexander had taken that name in Gheneoa) whom the favour of heaven hath miraculously sent us, had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his victorious arme for the preservation of our Altars, our Treasure &amp; Character. Let us bind him to our defence by some title that may be honorable unto him; and by a kind necessity force him to continue to us, that, which he hath begun out of his own generous inclination. Thus ended Alcippus his proposition; and all his Clergy find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not only equitable but advantageous, intreated him to instruct them by what meanes they might bring what he propos'd to a good issue. The Chief-Priest after he had excus'd himself withall necessary modesty to make him the more considerable, and perceiving that his excuses did but increase the desires of the Assembly: My opinion is (said he) that wee should free from the Chaines and the Lot, the victorious Araxez, and infranchising him in the name of our Deity from the Servitude wherein he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to declare him Protector of the Island, and Prince of the Clergie. Atthis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position all the Priests clapped their hands in token of their consent and gladnesse, and unwilling the businesse should be defer'd to another time, they arose to fetch Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander. Assoon as they had brought him into the Hall of Assemblies, they caus'd him to sit down in a chaire which was a little below the throne of the Arch-Prelate; and Alcippus began again and renewed their thanks, and then told him in his usuall elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that his brethren, and himself, were not those alone that were bound to him for their safety. This Temple (said hee) seemes to shake on its foundation to testifie the resentment of what you have done for its preservation; our Altars share in that obligation, and if your piety could permit it, I would say that even the Deitie wee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, thinks he owes to your valour the Soveraignty of this Island, and the possession of his treasure. In recompence of an action where the interests of heaven are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt

with those of earth, this Assembly which cannot erre, frees you from the chaines you wore, and for an eternall remembrance, orders them to be hung by the sword wherewith you delivered us from the fetters of a prophane Slavery. With that he took the chaines from Polexander, and two of the ordinary Slaves of the Temple, by command ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ried them to be hung by the sword. This Ceremony ended, Alcippus taking Polexander by the hand, told him he was free, and that his virtue had made him Prince of that sacred and soveraign company. Polexander refusing so glorious a title, There would not only (said he) be a great deale of pride, but even very impiety, should I accept of a title which brings along with it the power of disposing of things sacred and to rule over the Presbyterie. This were to erect Idols in the place consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and with a polluted hand to snatch the Censor out of the hands of those appointed for that Office. I accept of my liberty since 'tis in your power to give it me, but I do it conditionally that it may be submitted to your lawfull authority, and especially destin'd to the service of a company which with Justice may be term'd, the Society of visible Angels. All the Priests, who questionlesse were very glad to preserve to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves an authority which made them so considerable, were ravish'd at Araxes mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They unanimously told him he was the more worthy to governe, since he had so generously refus'd it. The Assembly thus dissolv'd; Polexander was brought to a lodging, which was not lesse magnificent then that of the Arch-Prelate, and if not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for Prince, at least for one who had refus'd to be so. Many Slaves were given to serve him. The Guard of the Temple and the Island, were bound to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him for their Chief, and to do nothing but by his appointment. They took out of the treasury divers peeces of gold and silver which came from Aethiopia, to clothe him. But Polexander, whether it were out of feare of not acomplishing the Prophesies, or that he would intimate to the Priests he intended not to neglect their favour, tooke new signes of Servitude, and alwayes wore about his neck a Coller on which these words were ingraven.
<q>THE SLAVE OF THE SUN, AND HIS PRIESTS SERVANT.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The first occasion wherein the feigned Araxes made shew of his principality was at the arrivall of the Embassadors of the Kings of Senega. He sent all the illustrious Slaves of the Sun to meet them, and went himselfe with the Arch Priest and his Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the end of the Entrie into the Palme-Walke, to receive them with the more ceremony. Hee was afraid at first that he might be known by some of the Embassad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; but his dexterity in disguising his countenance, and speech, succeeded so well, that Almaid himselfe (who was the chief of that Embassy) never took him for Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander. All complements of welcoming being ended, Araxes, and the Arch-Prelate, tooke Almaid betwixt them, and so lead him to the Gate of the Temple. As they were about to enter, Almaid stopped, and told them that the ordinary revolutions of great Kingdoms, had in theirs prophan'd, that which in former times had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them held for sacred, and made that holy, which foregoing ages esteem'd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane. The chiefe Prelate fearing, lest the continuation of this discourse might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scandalize or raise some doubts in the weaker understndings, and by consequence lessen his Societies authority, intreated the Embassador to speake with respect in matters of Relgion. Almaid accepting this advice, with as much discretion as it had been given: I come not here (said he to the High-Priest) to propose my thoughts, nor make a declaration of my beliefe. They are the Kings my Masters which speake by my mouth, and who seeing themselves inlightned with a supernaturall light, thinke they are bound to renounce all such Ceremonies which are contrary to those which Heaven hath revealed to them. Know therefere that almost assoon as Zabaim and Almanzaira had placed in their throne, the King their Sonne, and the Princesse his wife, they cast all their thoughts on heaven. Almanzaira's incomparable piety, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by that of the young Queene, altered the face of the whole Court; and Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baim who by a hearty and private penitence strove to obtain pardon for his long errors,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:54727:294"/>
merited at last to be called to the knowledge of the true Deity. Those Idols which he had placed in the rank of Gods, lost their Temples, and their Altars. The Sun whom you adore here, had no place but amongst the creatures the least accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Almanzaira and Cydaria having well established this new religion, could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that Zabaim and Almanzor should be longer held in their strange Ceremonies. They therefore besought them to break of all commerce they had with the adorers of Idols; and those Princes not able to deny their just requests, chose my compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and my selfe, to make a voyage hither, to disavow in their name their ancient beliefe, and make profession of the new. After the Embassador had thus ended his speech, the most part of the Auditors stood either vext, or amaz'd: Onely Polexander and Alcippus were overjoyed to see so great an introduction to what they had resolv'd to execute before their separation. Neverthelesse the chief prelate thinking it not fit to precipitate a businesse of so great importance, dissembled his joy, and feigning all the anger which a just zeale might stirre up in him on such an occasion: If (said he to the Embassadors) the honour of that Deity which wee adore depended on the servile acknowledgments it receives from the Creature, it might possibly lose somewhat now, by our Kings fearfull Apostasy. But he is himselfe his own glory and reward. Hee made man for their own happinesse, not for his benefit; and his beatitude is so perfect, that nothing can be added or taken from him, by the increase or diminution of his adorers. After he had spoke thus, he commanded that the book of the Kings profession should be brought, and having publikly torne out that of Zabaim, gave it to Almaid, and then retir'd with his Clergy without any complement to the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. Almaid took leave of the feigned Araxes, and all the assistants, and intreating them to believe as he did presently went towards the Sea; and Polexander accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him thither to hear something of Cydaria, understood, that she absolutely governed the King her husband. That she was the comfort of Zabaim, and Almanzaira, the hope of all her subjects, and for the height of all happinesse they thought her with child of a sonne, whom the people blinded in their affections nam'd already, their chief delight and safety. Polexander had that day on his finger a very faire diamond which Cyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria had given him at parting. Hee intreated Almaid to present it the Princesse from him, and assure her, that her zeale was not disprov'd of by the principall of the Isle of the Sun. Almaid tooke it without further inquiry, and imbarquing with a favourable winde, steer'd on to fill the Court of Senega with severall consolations. Leave wee him in his happy voyage, and let us now receive into the port of the Suns Island, that fatall ship after which wee have been so long wandering. One day, when all the Clergy were assembled about some important solemnity, the new guard (who by the death of their predecessors grew jealous of all) came to the Palace of the feigned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes, as they had done at Almaids arrivall, and told him they had descry'd off at Sea a Ship whose bulke shone like gold, and the sayles glitter'd through the sun beames as if they had been on fire. Our Heroë presently thought she belong'd to Alcidiana, and to begin his happinesse by the sight of so deare an object, ran with Diceus to the top of a rock whence he might easily ken her: straight he perceiv'd the purple and gold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryodered sayles, which truely appear'd as waving flames betwixt the azure of the skie and the water. Withall he mark'd Alcidiana's golden Pavillion which was fix'd to the maine mast, and saw shine in a thousand severall places that Queen of birds, which was not only the device but the symbol of Alcidiana. The Ship with her artillery saluted the Port, and that on shore answering, a great company ran to the sea side to see the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall of that rich and stately Ship. Polexander covertly retir'd to his palace, and there expected when the Clergies officers came to advertise what he was to do. In the mean time the strength of his imagination, or to say better, the violence of his love so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, that he felt himselfe suddenly strucken with some strange fit, and fell on his bed as pale and cold as he had been giving up the ghost. Diceus seeing him in that case, How! (said he) what will become of you when you shall present your selfe before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana, since you are not able to indure the presence of her Embassadors? Friend, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd Polexander) I thought thou wouldst not have ingag'd me to become Master of my former thoughts. Yet I must (neverthelesse) in good time prevent such disorders
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:54727:295"/>
as they may cause, and by long preparations accustome my mind to take in most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream contentments and yet not seem sensible of them. This discourse having as it were blunted the edge of our Heroës imagination, his senses return'd to their usuall functions; and then he thought himselfe able enough to constrain his deportment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Alcidiana's Embassadors. Assoon as they landed they were entertain'd by such as had that charge; and Polexander being called to the Temple by the dignity he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd there, put on his ceremoniall habit to meet those famous Embassadors. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himselfe better then he thought he should have done, of a charge so thorny and nice for him; and by the extraordinary and obliging civility, wherewithall he us'd to winne all hearts, instantly acquir'd the love of all those strangers. The next day every one rose very early to be at the ceremonies of the sacrifice of Allyance. At day-break the priests came to the Temple, and sun-rising the high-priest appear'd with his clergie, in the most eminent place of the great Portico, there to receive the Embassadors. That done, the same things were perform'd to them as had been to the Embassadors of the King of Gheneoa in bringing them into the Temple. The chief priest then taking his place, the feigned Araxes his, and the priests theirs; the Embassadors bare headed and kneeling at the foot of the high Altar did that homage to the Sun, to which the Kings of the Inaccessible Island had oblieged themselves. After that, those who bore the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, came in one after another. The six first carried so many great vessels of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall of the rock full of perfumes. Eight following, bore on their shoulders a table of gold, on which was imboss'd the shape of the Inaccessible Island. The ninth had in his hands a table of brass, whereon was ingraven the termes wherewithall the person who represented the King of the Inaccessible Island renew'd and confirm'd his allyance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the hands of the chiefprelate. The tenth carryed a heart of silver, on which were seen drops of bloud naturally figured. After these offerings, march'd forty or fifty slaves (chain'd with chaines of gold) which plac'd on the twelve lesser Altars somewhat of the most rarest things in their kind, which nature produc'd or art gave to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Inaccessible Island. Those oblations ended, they celebrated the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy sacrifice: It began with thanksgivings, was continued by burning of severall perfumes, and ended in supplications and prayers. The chief priest presented them to the living Deity after the wonted manner, and after a benediction on all the assistants, every one retir'd to his quarter. All the remainder of the day the Temple stood open, that the inferiour Pilgrims might performe their devotions and offer their offerings. At night the archprelate sent for Alcidiana's Embassadors, to entertain them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ancient custome. Polexander supp'd with them; and the recitall of what he had done for the safety of the Island, was (to his discontent) the whole discourse of their feast. The Embassadors look'd on him as if they could not have their fill, and the more they regarded him, the more increased their admiration. The houre of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement arriving, all the company sever'd. As the chief prelate was going to bed, the famous pilot Lynceus came into his chamber, and besought him for a private audience: presently the archpriest commanded away his servants; Speak (then said he) and feare nothing. Before I make known (reply'd Lynceus) the cause that obligeth me to hinder your repose; you must (if you please) ingage your faith, that for no cause nor necessity whatsoever you shall reveale the secret which the Queen my Mistris hath commanded mee to intrust you withall. Impose (if you please) this tye on your selfe, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out retaining any reservation that may dispense with you for your oath, swear by the Deity in whom you believe, that you will rather suffer death then betray the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of a Princesse, who for the discharge of her conscience will intrust you with a matter that doth not permit her to injoy any rest. Alcippus who had a great desire to know this important secret; and who by I know not what inspiration was perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it concern'd Polexander: The Queen (said he to Lynceus) is most judicious, in being desirous in matters of great consequence to observe all that wisedom can advise her. But she would not require these oathes or security from me, if she knew that one of the principall injunctions in my charge is to keep as a pledge deposited by heaven such secrets of conscience as are made known to me. No, no, Lynceus, let not Alcidiana feare it. Neither hope, nor feare, nor love, nor hatred, nor death, nor life, shall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:54727:295"/>
ever be able to make me violate a law on which depends the eternity of my blisse or wretchednesse. I sweare by the sacred power of the chief priesthood, and by the faith I owe to heaven, that no person whatsoever shall ever know from me that which you have commanded to discover. Lynceus, made confident by so inviolable an oath: My Lord (said he) the Queen though she never did act contrary to the rules of verue, nor could not so much as inure an ill thought without stifling of it in the birth, yet hath her conscience troubled, and feeles I know not what remorse which both accuseth and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments her. But to the end you may give her Majesty such remedies as are fitting for her disease, 'tis necessary that I make knowne to you the originall of it. Some three yeares since, the famous King of the Canaries was by a tempest cast on our coasts. That Prince, whom without flattery wee may call the wonder of this age, had not been long in our Court, but by his admirable indowments he grew so extreamly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendable that he became the love and admiration of all. Alcidiana confesseth to you, that that Heroës virtue, join'd to the service he had done her against her rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous subjects, insensibly wonne her to wish him well. She did that at the beginning by way of acknowledgment, which she did afterwards for her owne satisfaction. In a word she lov'd him; but perceiving her love began to goe beyond the limits she had prescrib'd it, and what she indevour'd to conceale would in spight of her divulge it selfe; sometimes by her disturbances, otherwhiles by her deep musing, then again by complaysancies which she deem'd unworthy her virtue, and in briefe by the alteration of her complection, she resolv'd to indure it no longer. To make it sure, she thought the best way was to get Polexander away. While she was contriving it, an occasion was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the stealing away of Amintha by a Spanish Pirate. So soon as the newes came to Polexander, he got to sea, &amp; made after Amintha's ravisher: Many dayes he pursued him and as many nights, but in vain, for a tempest drove him one way, &amp; the pirate another. In the mean while the love that Prince bore to the Queen my Mistris, scarce permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to live out of her fight, he left poor Amintha to the mercy of the ravisher; and preferring slavery before all the Empire which his vertue had given, he thought on no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but of entring into Alcidiana's chaines. A thousand times he strove to get to the Inaccessible Island, &amp; as often the quality of that Isle beguild his hopes, &amp; made him run almost through all the Ocean, and yet found it not again. After he had spent neare two years in such bootless voyages, and undergone all the incommodities which accompany long navigations, he arriv'd at the Isle of two Tyrants. There he slew Amintha's ravisher, and set that Lady again at liberty; but his generousnesse ingaging him to avenge the Queen Tysiphone, for the outrages she had receiv'd from the gyant Astramadan, he was murdered by that tyrants subjects; and Amintha after she had long time bewail'd the death of that famous Prince, was forc'd to get to sea to avoid the violence of those of that Isle. Almost assoon as she was under saile a tempest arose, and by a strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent being separated from the faithfull and generous Alcippus Polexanders favorite, she was at last fortunatly cast on the coasts of the Inaccessible Island; where being known of all, she was brought to the Court, and welcom'd by Alcidiana with so much joy, as if after the lamenting her for dead, she had been newly rais'd to life againe. But the Queenes contentment was disturb'd by that which Amintha related touching the death of Polexander. And since that time our Princesse hath not given over the afflicting her selfe with continuall plaints and lamentations. Her conscience or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her affection continually upbraides her for the death of the Canaryes King, and makes her believe that she is truly guilty of it. Every night his Ghost all goary either appeares or seems to appeare to her, and displaying his wounds; See (saith he to her) to what a case the desire of seeing and serving you hath brought mee. But how deare is my misfortune to me since you pity it; with what pleasure doe I spend my bloud, since it drawes teares from you, and how beneficiall is my death to me, since it hath acquir'd me a place in your memory? I should never have done if I would relate what Polexanders ghost spoke mightily to Alcidiana. However my Lord, these visions wrought an alteration in her health, troubled her repose, and brought her to such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that if they leave her not, I shall soon see my Country full of afflictio, &amp; such calamities as must follow the death of Alcidiana. Loe here (my Lord) all that which

my Mistris commanded me to communicate unto you; and since she can expect from n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e other then heaven the tranquillity she hath lost, she beseecheth you to offer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the expiation of her offence, if shee be guilty of Polexanders death. Yet what e're betide she beseecheth you to remember him in your devotions, and to beg from heaven for a cessation of these visions which persecute her; and since she shew'd not her selfe insensible of Polexanders love, but that shee might not be so in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of her honour; that it would not permit her innocency to be look'd on as a crime. After Lynceus had spoke, Alcippus reply'd thus: The Deity whom we adore is too cleer-sighted to find any blots in so pure a life as that of Alcidiana. Assure her from him that shee is not guilty of Polexanders death, and that her disquiets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from some other sourse then that pricking remorse wherwithall the Eternall Justice begins to inflict vengeance in this life on offenders. 'Tis her love (Lynceus) that brings on these dreames, and is the cause of all the agitations which molest her: I advise her to quiet her minde: Yet I forbid her not to love the memory of Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, since 'tis all she can love of him now. But I would have her love to be peacefull and quiet; and if it be true, that my minde is somtime inlightned by the beames which come from above; I assure her, that heaven in retribution of her virtues, preserves for her such contentments as it communicates not to many Princes. Lynceus fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with this answer, took leave of the Arch-priest, and so well imprinted in his memory all that was said to him, that he truely related it to the Queen his Mistris. Alcippus, on the other side, perceiving it lay in his power to render our Heroe perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy, was almost ready to disclose to him what he had newly discovered; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retain'd by the sanctity of his oath, and the Majesty he had call'd to witnesse; He thought in becoming perjur'd, he should in lieu of advancing Polexanders happinesse, infallibly ruine it by his execrable untruth. He therefore protested again to discover to him nothing of Alcidiana's secret, and went to bed so well pleas'd with his vow, that from that very night he tasted such contentments as ever since made him tread under foot all those that are earthly. The next morning he went to the Temple, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating himselfe wholly to heaven, promis'd solemnly to have it ador'd with all the purity had ever been taught to man. That very day the bloudy sacrifice was to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and Polexander as Prince of the Clergie, was bound to supply the place of the Arch-prelate at that dismall Ceremony. He then be thought him it was time to put in execution what he had resolv'd with Alcippus; and to imploy all his eloquence and credit for the abolishing of that horrible custome of humane sacrifices. Assoon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they advertis'd him that the Priests of the Sun and Alcidiana's Embassadors were assembled in the Temple, he went thither with all the Slaves, and beseeching the company to give him audience, thus bespoke them: If I were yet bound to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of those criminall Lawes which make Religion to become a Sacriledge, and blend piety and homicide together, I would impose silence on my just sorrow, and patiently indure the injustice of your Ceremonies since I could not condemne them, but by making you call in doubt either my zeale, my obedience, or courage. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infranchis'd from so cruell a slavery, and disburthen'd of those chaines which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my life to the blind necessity of Chance; I will tell you boldly, that your Predecessors have made an execrable mixture of Religion and Impiety, of heaven and hell, of divine worship and that of the divells. You adore you say a Deity, which is nothing but Spirit, Light, and Puritie; and yet as if he were a tyrant which took pleasure in bathing himselfe in humane bloud, or some furious beast that feeds only on the flesh of men, you cut the throats of your brethren at the feet of his Altars, and if it were in your power, you would make him drink their bloud all hot and reaking. I know at other times he hath commanded the immolation of beasts on his Altars; but I know it was ordered to affright a brutish people, and to tell them, by so many mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres, that if they were not exact observers of his Lawes, he would leave them as a victime to the vengefull sword of their enemies. I have not time enough nor suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent learning to unfold to you another mystery of that bloud. Let it suffice that I tell you 'twas a figure of an immolation which was to be but once perform'd. And as for the sacrificing of men, I protest and assure you 'tis an invention of hell, and the relick
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54727:296"/>
of that Idolatry which had almost infected the whole world. Advise with the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of your fathers, have recourse to the establishment of Religion in this place; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on these sad and fearfull Ceremonies, which you never put in practice but with horror and condemning them, and you shall find that you have offended in thinking to doe well: cut off then from the number of your mysteries, these abominable super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions, and from hence-forward, adore a Power which is all Innocence and purity, with Ceremonies as innocent and pure. Assoone as Polexander had ended his remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, all the Assemblie cast their eyes on the Arch-priest, and expected what he would say, either in condemning or approving the fained Araxes Speech: and he full of that zeale which had consecrated him to the Altars, tooke heaven to witnesse, that he had not entred into that holy place, but with a firme resolution to die, or to make them renounce the abomination of their bloudy Sacrifices. Yes, my companions, (said he) I am of Araxes opinion, and to confirm it, I tell you, Heaven hath expected but one the like Sacrifice for the satisfaction of it's Justice: the Devill, who takes pleasure to imitate the workes of the Divinitie, or rather by his execrable malice, endeavour'd to annihilate all religious mysteries, hath wonne us to slaughter one another; that he might confound in these detestable Sacrifices, the maine one which concernes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us (at once) of all our knowledge, and hope which depends on it. My deare companions therefore, (and this Assemblie) if it be not by a blind and brutish custome, but a true devotion, which makes you apply your selves to Heaven, intreat from thence an inlightning of your blindnesse, and in bestowing on you that knowledge which you want, it would please to let you understand in what manner you should yeeld your adoration. All the Assemblie without further deliberation cri'd out against the bloudie Sacrifices, and the whole Clergie presently being shut up to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult advisedly upon a matter of so much importance, set downe among their constitutions, that it was neither fit to sacrifice men nor beasts. To this resolution, Alcidiana's Embassadors gave their consent; and did it the more willingly, since in the Inaccessible Island the bloudy Sacrifices were so seldom practised, that in a whole age there were but two or three seen. Every one rejoyc'd at this alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but the illustrious Slaves (as the most interessed) made their joy to be taken most notice of; for though there was but one of them to die that day, yet they thought themselves all to be redeemed from death, since there was none among them who from the Lot was exempted: yet were they not absolutely disingaged from the vowes of their servitude, but in stead of being bound to expose themselves to a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary death, they were onely to passe the rest of their lives in the service of the Altars. The next day, Alcidiana's Embassadors having ended their Ceremonies, the Arch-Priest made them their farewell feast; and after he had assured them, that he would take paines to his utmost, for the reformation of abuses, and establishment of a right worship, he intreated them to make knowne his intention to their Queene, and win her for the discharge of her conscience, to make the like reformation within her Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories. After that, he brought them into his withdrawing chamber, and suddenly composing out of divers true accidents a mysterious Fable, thus bespoke them; My Lords (said he) I must discharge my trust, and satisfie the passionate desires of a Prince, which holds your Princesse for a visible Divnitie; I beleeve, there is none of you all but knowes him, as well by the magnificence of his Offerings, wherewithall he hath inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Temple of the Sunne, as by Princely presents he hath often sent to the Queene your Mistresse. Before he passed from his condition to a better, and ere time had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him in that darknesse where he lies interr'd, he sent, for the last time his Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to this Island, and after he had satisfied his zeale, he would likewise content his passion; he therefore be sought me by his letters and Embassadors, that assoone as you arrived here, I should deliver into your hands the last presents he had appointed for Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana; I am intrusted with these treasures, and to acquit me of my word given to that Prince, I intend presently to put them into your charge. That which is most to be valued amongst them, is our Prince Araxes, who, as the wonder of his age, and the glory of men, hath beene consecrated to heaven, and destin'd for Alcidiana. You may say, that having received his libertie, for the great service done to this Island, it
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54727:297"/>
were Injustice in your Queene, to put him againe in the company of Slaves; but let not that thought hinder it, Araxes so passionately loves that Prince, who deem'd him worthy the service of Alcidiana, that he preferres the will of that King before his libertie and life: the Queene may doe as she please, either give him her chaines, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchise him. The Embassadors overjoyed, that they had so great a Present for their Que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e, urg'd the Arch-Priest to dispatch them, that they might set saile while the weather was faire. The Prelate, who had plotted with Polexander about all that he had spoken to the Embassadors, sent for him, with all the other Presents; and he came, not in the habit of a vulgar Slave, but like a triumphing King: foure Black-moore Slaves carried the ends of his chaines, and did not ill imitate the grave and majestick gate of their Master. Alcippus seeing he was about to lose him once more, could not suppresse the emotions of his good nature, but (weeping) imbrac'd him, and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Embassadors, that his tears were out of compassion; Goe, said he to Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander, whither thy Fate calls thee; let not the Servitude which thou hast preferr'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Crowne, make thee lose ought of that great Spirit which is able to conquer the whole world; and whether Fortune use thee better then she hath done, or continues her aversnesse to thee, remember, that Araxes was borne to trample on her. Alcippus imbrac'd him againe, to bid him the last farewell; and though he was absolutely off from his ancient affection, yet could he never quit himselfe of that which he bore to the King his Master; he accompanied him to the Port, under colour of honouring Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana's Embassadors, and seeing him imbark'd with Diceus, was constrain'd to return, for feare of further tempting his weaknesse and humanity. Assoone as a little gale from the shore, had put the sacred Vessell out of the Haven, Diceus, (who had Lynx his eyes) and in all places where ere he came, discover'd what was most hidden, perceiv'd in the Pilots cabbin, two birds as white as swans, and marking (unnoted) how they fed them, imagined that 'twas by that sleight Alcidiana's Pilots were us'd to returne to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible Island. Assoone therefore, as the ship was out at sea, the birds flew out of Linceus his cabbin at a window, and presently appearing over the ship, were saluted with many shouts of joy by the Mariners and Pilgrims: those birds flying in a middle height, were alwayes a bow-shoot before the ship, and serving Linceus in stead of Star or Compasse, shewed him what way he was to steere. Whilst they did so well their dutie, and the winde (as if who should doe best) was extreamely favourable, Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana's Embassadors entertain'd themselves with the fained Araxes, and desirous to know his adventures, cunningly besought him to relate, how the Prince, who so dearly lov'd him, could resolve to sacrifice him to the Sunne, or make him to consume his dayes in Alcidiana's fetters? Because that judicious King (said Polexander) could no way better testifie his affection to me, then in dividing his fortune with me, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathing me to those Divinities, on whom he had bestowed himselfe. But (repli'd the Embassadors) he depriv'd himselfe of the contentment of seeing you: Hee was (answered our Heroe) sequestred from a greater blisse, since he had not the happinesse of being inlightned by the faire eyes of Alcidiana. He should then have hazarded somewhat (said the Embassadors) for so great a felicity; He hath adventur'd all (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd the King) to attaine it; but whilst the violent and sweet tyrannie of Alcidiana's charmes drew him one way, the invincible power of a necessity, as irrevocable, as cruell, thrust him another; and I may say without exaggeration, that never poore malefactor indured more violent tortures, that hath beene torne in sunder with wilde horses; and he is dead of them, and now his unfortunate ghost which hath found no rest, no not in his grave, wanders the world. All the day long it hides it selfe in the obscurity of deep caves, and gloomie forests, and in the night, with long groanes and uncessant laments, accuseth Heaven, complaines on Love, accuseth Fortune, and it self; but it complaines most on the strange and uncouth destiny of the Inaccessible Island, and sometimes wishing what it alwayes fear'd: O happy cause (said it) of my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes! why art thou not absolutely subjected to the necessity of thy condition? And wherefore doth the Demon which presides in tempests, change the order of things, and dare violate what nature hath forbidden? Be at last what it is resolv'd thou must be: become altogether Inaccessible, and concealing thy selfe for ever from our eyes,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:54727:297"/>
cease to feed us with longings, since thou depriv'st us of all hopes. I should be too long (said our voluntarie Slave) if I related to you all that the amorous Phantasme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, either to demonstrate Fortune's Injustice, or to publish the Justice of his Love. Let it suffice, that you know, the Prince of whom I speake desired onely to live and die for Alcidiana; and dead as he is, overcomes by the vertue of his affection, fate, time, death and oblivion. Alcidiana's Embassadors, who were in a manner as tied by the eares to Araxes tongue, no sooner perceiv'd themselves freed from so sweet a captivitie, but they found fault with that troublesome favour, and intreated Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander not to continue it to them: You (said they) have given us both admiration and delight, in speaking to us of the King your Master; finish (if you please) what you have begun, and to perfect our contentment (if you like it) speake of your selfe. I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (said the feign'd Araxes) that you can imagine may please you in the relation of my adventures, I was borne unfortunate, brought up among a many miseries. I have lived sometimes in exile, sometimes in prison, alwayes in affliction; this in few words is the whole historie of my life. If the remembrance of so many miseries (repli'd the Embassadors) is not more insupportable to you then the sufferings themselves, make us a just narration of so mysterious an abridgement, and condemne not a curiositie which onely proceeds from the esteem which our charmed minds as well as our senses inforce us, (but mildly) to have of a personage which is scarce knowne to n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. I will obey you (said Polexander) and presently addressing himselfe, related to them, (without making himselfe knowne) the most of the adventures we have recited; by that discourse, which seem'd short to the Embassadors, though it lasted almost five houres, he satisfi'd them, and were it permitted me to debunch the modestie of Prose, and carrie it to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Poe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sie, I would say, that the soules of the Embassadors lay a long time drown'd in that delicious bev'rage, wherein Polexander's Eloquence had throwne them. All this while, Alcidiana's ship, steering the course which her winged guides directed, got farre from the Island of the Sunne, and by a very fresh gale, sensibly had triall of that Deitie's assistance to whom it was consecrated. Diceus, being extraordinarie curious, and a great enemie to all Superstition, could not indure that they should call the birds which guided the ship, Angels sent from Heaven, and particular favorites of the God of Light; he talked, sometimes with the Priests, sometimes with the Mariners, otherwhile with Linceus, to be clear'd of his doubts, and to overthrow the miracle which was presuppos'd in the flight of the two birds: his inquisit i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>enesse had all the successe he could expect by it; the first evening he perceiv'd the cunning; for he mark'd how the birds obeying to Linceus voice, suddenly stopp'd their flight, and incontinently after, soaring very high, they made an impetuous stoop on the ship. He imagin'd by their returne, that the art of man, and not the power of a God, had made them capable of a subjection which went for a miracle; and had some of the generousnesse of those famous birds which forget their nature and libertie for the pleasure of men; or from the docilitie of those which are the ordinarie postes from Alexandria or Cairo, and from Aleppo to Tripoly in Syria. Being confirm'd in this opinion, by the going off and returning of those birds, he admir'd the cunning and wit of the Inhabitants of the Inaccessible Island, and no more doubted of what he had so often heard spoken, that Common-wealth's being compos'd of a small number of able, and an infinite multitude of impertinent men; the wiser sort as lesse powerfull, had been constrain'd to have recourse to miracles, and to imploy strengths more redoubtable then their owne, to keep in obedience, such as being naturally the stronger, were in all likelihood to become their masters. These meditations tooke up for foure dayes Dicens thoughts; the fifth at sun-set, he came to the King his master, and told him; that he heard from Linceus, they were the next day to discover the Inaccessible Island, and if the wind did not faile then at even, they should land about two or three houres within night. Our Heroe, receiving this newes with as much feare as hope, Courage (said he to his servant) we are now on the point of deciding the great difference that is betwixt us and Fortune; we can no more recoile, but must either now have the victorie yeelded us, or she absolutely take it to her selfe. He began not this speech to make an end of it straight, but as he was about to continue it, he that stood as sentinell in the top of the mast, put all the ship in confusion by his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:54727:298"/>
fearfull out-cryes; he call'd to the Mariners to take care of the ship, and to eschew two great fires, which being in their course, seem'd to beare up right upon them. At this newes every one awoke, and Polexander amongst the rest coming out of his cabin, went up on the poup, and was one of the first which descry'd that wonderfull blazing; presently, he thought it could not proceed from any other cause, then the setting some ships on fire, and beleev'd it so much the more certainly, because a little while after, he saw the fire divide it selfe in two, and assoone joyne againe: His generous soule f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll of compassion, made him thinke on the safetie of those wretches which were like to be burnt in the midst of the waters; and to effectuate that charitable thought, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought Alcidiana's Embassadors not to be pitilesse and cruell spectators in an occasion, where they might make knowne their goodnesse and courage. Linceus was call'd to give his opinion, he would gladly have afforded that which he ought to those of his own condition, but knowing whereto his charge oblig'd him; Humane consideration (said he) demands one thing, and Alcidiana's service requires another. If I were Master of this ship, I would hazard her, rather then see poore miserable wretches perish before me, whose cryes even coming to our eares, seeme to implore our assistance: but I have command to bring backe againe this ship into the Port of Eliza, and have none to goe succour these which are in this disaster. 'Tis true (said Polexander, approving what Linceus had said) 'tis not fit to hazard so many persons of qualitie as are in this vessell, to satisfie a zeale which as just as it is, yet may (possibly) not be reasonable; let's doe better, some eight or ten of us may get into the shallop, and rowing neere the burning ships, may at least testifie, that we are not insensible of other mens calamities. This proposition was presently approv'd of, and almost assoon put in execution; Polexander was not satisfi'd with the good counsell he gave, but he would have his share in the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which accompanied it; and though Alcidiana's Embassadors did their utmost to divert him, they could get nothing, but the satisfaction of following him: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put themselves all into one barque, and commanding their sailers to get the wind, they drew neer the burning vessels, and saw two, which like furnaces halfe quench'd, threw out no fire but what was wrapt up in a thick smoake. On all sides they might heare fearfull groanes and clamours, and when Polexander had commanded the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners to betake them to their oares, he thought he heard others, which strucke the sea very neere him; he made them row towards the noise, and presently descry'd a little shallops in which there were onely two women; the one laid all along, seem'd rather dead then alive, and the other strove with oares to get off from the burning vessels: but through too much feare, and too little experience, she did cleane contrary to her inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when Polexander staid her shallop, she was falling againe into those flames from which she had escap'd. When she saw her boat stopp'd, she cry'd out, taking our Heroe for another; at first he spoke not to her, to the end he might know by what she would say, to whom he was to addresse himselfe: instantly hee heard the woman make use of a language particular to the Kingdome of Thombut and Galatia, and the understanding it, gave some (I know not what) emotion which amaz'd him. But he was farre more, when she, who lay as dead, opened her mouth, and after many long and frequent sighes, in these termes made knowne her lamentable fortune: Thou hast, O too amiable, and cruell stranger, pluck'd me out of the executioners hands! Thou hast led me from slaverie to a throne; and when I had lost all hope of Government, plac'd more then one Crowne on my head: but to what end were all these obligations and benefits, except to make me more miserable, in denying the chiefest, which was thy companie and affection; that height of greatnesse whereto thou hadst rais'd me, onely made me more capable of a greater down-fall; if thy intention was so, thou shouldst rest satisfi'd, since my obedience hath been made apparent to thee by mine own ruine, and precipitating my selfe into such downe-falls as thou hadst digg'd for me, have wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed to the world, that when there was question of giving thee contentment, there was nothing too hard for me; for this, the unfortunate Philesia is pleas'd to die, and the more contented, since she consecrates to thee, with her life, that first puritie, which neither the Prince of Galatia's solicitations, nor the violence of pirates, have beene of force to deprive her of. Those last words struck Polexander almost to the heart, for
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54727:298"/>
he felt in himselfe that he was the cause of those just lamentations. He call'd to mind the love which the Princesse of Thombut had made knowne to him, the same day he gave her in marriage to the Prince of Galatia; and conjecturing from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Our Heroe commanded two of his mariners to enter the shallop of that too-constant loving Lady, and gave them order to bring it to their ship, that he might render to her corps its due honours, and preserve the companion of her misfortunes. No sooner had he given this direction, but he was blowne by a gust of winde very neere to the greater burning ship, and perceiving (by the flashing of flames, which by times flew o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the name of Alcidiana, which he uttered before he cast himselfe over-board, made the Prince take him so much into his consideration, that he neglected no meanes for his recoverie; but being not in fit place to performe it, he commanded to haste to his ship, and assoone as he was aboard, intreated the Embassadors to looke well on the man, and see whether they could know him: they were not long about it, for they no sooner call'd for a light, but they knew him to be the famous slave of Alcidiana, nam'd Pallantus, who formerly met with Polexander in the Pirates Island, and publish'd to him his sentence of death. Presently our Heroe fell on him, though hee was without motion and knowledge, and imbracing him, O dear companion of my chaines (said he softly) 'tis not without a mysterie, that Heaven who had separated us without hope of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing one another, hath brought us together by so wonderfull an adventure. After that, he commanded him to be carried into a chamber neer to his own, there he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress'd, and Dice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Polexander too, leaving Dice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

back to the Embassadors, assuring them of Pallantus amendment, and seeing day break, brought them to the most eminent place of the Ship, to be the first that should descry the Inaccessible Island. They were no sooner on the poop but Lynceus let flye his winged Guides. Their direction was that day to no purpose, for a furious tempest mixt with thunder and horrible darknesse, having as it were mixt the Sea and Heaven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and taken from Lynceus not only the fight of the birds, but the meanes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning his ship, he was hurried away by the impetuousnesse of the storme. Polexander accus'd not the windes for that unexpected tempest, but his own fate; He confes'd himselfe to be the Author of that disorder, and had he not been detain'd by some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, hee would (as some one before) have told the Mariners, that the only way to regain a calme was to sacrifice him to the indignation of the billowes. Above eight houres had this storme lasted, and the horizon no way clear but by the flashes of lightning, when some cri'd out they were all lost, for the wind drove them on inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table rocks. The feare was greater then the danger, for good fortune drove the distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vessell into the mouth of a river which ran out among the rocks. But she was no sooner out of one tempest then she was set on by another. Two great Ships of warre which lay in the River, some two or three miles above the mouth, no sooner disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd ours but they weigh'd anchor, and having observ'd the Sea Ceremonies, let them know by many Canon shot, they were not to passe any further. Polexander noting the vessells, and knowing them by their flags to be Spaniards, imagin'd, the storm had cast them on some Island that belong'd to the Crown of Castile. Losing then all hope of arriving at that of Alcidiana; Let's then dye at last (said he to himselfe) but not so neither without avenging us on fortune by executing it on a Nation that is so deare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her.

Polexander who was resolv'd to dye in this occasion, grapled presently with the greatest ship, and spight of sword and fire, made those tyrants of the sea to feel that valour they had already so often tryed. 'Tis hard for my pen to expresse the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse with which the assailants and assailed hurried themselves to their common ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. Here falls a Spaniard shot through and through with a musker. There layes drown'd in his owne bloud an Islander, his head cleft by a Spanyard. The iron neither flew nor fell in vain. One stood Victor a moment, which was straight vanquish'd for ever, &amp; another escap'd a thousand bullets to fall (but honorably for him) under the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious sword of Polexander. At last that new Alcides forcing through all obstacles, leapt into the Spanish ship, with some twentie or thirtie of Alcidiana's valiantest subjects, and slew or made to flie all that were in case to resist them. The Spanyards preferring a glorious end before a shamefull slavery were sacrific'd to the honour of Alcidiana; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d others that could not detest life, how infamous and unfortunate soever, had recours to the mercie of the Victor, and abandon'd their honour with their armes. Polexander made them be taken by such as had follow'd him, and promising to treat them as priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of warre, made himselfe Master of their ship. In her he left to command the youngest of the Embassadors; and hastned to the succour of the Sacred Vessell which was full of Spanyards and expos'd to their fury. If what he had already done might passe for miraculous, that which he did to avenge Alcidiana, who was wronged in her ship, might be esteem'd as true miracles. To throw himselfe into that vessell, fight with those that had wonne it, and make them lose it againe with their lives, were things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt which there was almost no distance. The regaining the ship did not satisfie him, he would perfect his victorie, and laid not downe his armes till he had ended all was to be done. So noble and important an action putting againe Alcidiana's Embassadors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their former admiration, they tooke our Heroe for somewhat more then a man, and whisperingly ask'd each other, if he were nor the very Power whose slave he named himselfe. In the meane time, the violence of the vvindes, as vvell as of their armes ceasing, Polexander and his follovvers had found themselves in an admirable calme, had
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54727:299"/>
they not been ignorant of the coast whereon the tempest had hurled them. In parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, our Heroe, that could promise to himselfe nothing but disastrous, upbraided for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for his victorie, and accus'd her of a deadly malice for saving him from the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall blowes of his enemies: but whilst he was on his unjust revilings, Linceus came and told him, that since he came to himself, and had re-call'd to his memorie what the storm and fearfull lightning had as it were blotted thence; he descry'd that the tempest had happily advanc'd the end of their voyage. Be pleas'd to know, said he, that the River werein we are, is one of the greatest in all the Inaccessible Island; it is called Arzilea, and gives name to a very faire citie some thirty miles hence. Imagine, if you can, what Polexander's joy, or rather extasie was, at the recitall of this good fortune; he was a while as out of himselfe, and when he had recollected his spirits, dissipated by his excessive rapture, hee would have cast himselfe on his knees to aske pardon of Heaven for his murmuring, and yeeld thankes for the favours he had received thence: but that humane wisdome which tyrannizeth over our thoughts, and will not so much as permit all that is just, staid our Heroe's zeale; he was therefore compell'd to let his heart speake for his mouth, and by private thankesgivings, and unheard vowes, to satisfie for that which was passed, and ingage himselfe for what was to come. Alcidiana's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors came presently in to rejoyce with him, not onely for their arrivall in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible Island, but that they were got thither by the wonders of his valour. Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander answer'd them with his usuall civilitie, and intreating them not to give the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of an action to him, wherein they had a greater share then he, told them, 'twere fit to learn from some one of their prisoners, what designe they had on the territories of Alcidiana, or at least by what accident they got thither. Presently he sent for the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the greater ship, and when he came, intreated him to suppresse the sorrow which appear'd in his countenance, and not expect from his vanquishers any treatment unworthy of him. The Spaniard putting on againe that gravity which nature hath bestowed on all the Nation; My defeate (said to Polexander) nor my captivity shall never be able to make faile in what I owe my selfe; I grieve not for my selfe; the thought of my Kings service, and the hinderances which the enemie of our Belief daily raiseth to retard the holy intention of our armes, are the powerfull and onely cause of my sorrow: the dishonour throwne on us by your valour, is (to me) a certaine presage of our enterprises ill successe; and though you are mine enemie, I am forc'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that if the Queene of this Island whom we have besieg'd in her capitall city, have many defenders like you, shee may a long time yet keep her Crowne from paying that tribute which Spaine may rightfully exact from all the Kings of the earth. What say you, reply'd Polexander, interrupting the Spaniard? Have you then an Army in this Island? Is the Queene besieg'd, and have you dar'd to thinke to make her one of your tributaries? What I have said is true, answered the Spaniard. The Prince of Medina Sidonia, putting out of the ports of Spaine with a powerfull Armado to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the Canaries, in lieu of getting thither, was by a tempest throwne (a month since) on the coasts of this Island; at first, he thought it desert and not inhabited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was unknowne to our mariners; but since, perceiving the fertilitie, richnesse, and beautie of it, and understanding by some prisoners we tooke how well it was peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, he neglected the conquest of the Canaries, and thought he should gaine his King a new world if he could conquer this Island. Casting therefore aside all other designs, he thrust his Fleet into a great river which invirons the capitall city, and laying waste divers neighbouring villages to give the more terror to others, and be an advertisment to them not to be obstinate in a defence that would prove so dismall and deadly: these happy beginnings were so seconded, as they seem'd to assure us of a most fortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; for a few dayes before our arrivall, a Prince of this Island (call'd Tantalus) had tooke armes against the Queen, and to avenge himself (as he told us) of the contempt he receiv'd in his wooing her, and the instant supplications of all her Subjects, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to get that by force which he could not obtaine either by the greatnesse of his birth, or his many services. The Prince of Sidonia after divers conferences with him, made a League betwixt them, by which they equally ingag'd themselves for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of this Island, under conditions very pleasing to Tautalus, and not disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54727:300"/>
to our Kings. They shall be (reply'd Polexander) as little pleasing to the one as advantageous to the other: it is easie to make those audacious deliberations, but they are not with that facilitie executed. By this answer the Prince confirming the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the Spaniard had of him, sent him away with the other prisoners, and presently calling together all that were in the holy ship, as well Priests and Officers, as Souldiers, he thus bespoake them: If you had time to deliberate, it would be most fitting that you should weigh with all the best of your wisdome, such things as my zeale would make you undertake; but in the extremitie whereto matters are reduced, to hearken to that circumspect and timerous providence, which will leave nothing to fortune, were to betray your Queene and countrey. You must suffer your selves to be lead by the motions of my rashnesse; you must dare more then wise men should; and at least, have the honour of not surviving your Princesse and libertie: as for my selfe, unfortunate slave that I am, bred in the depth of Africk, I doe here vow to die with my sword in my hand for the service of Alcidiana: and when by a prodigy (which is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) it shall happen, that a just cause shall be abandon'd, and you compell'd to be false to your Soveraigne and your selves; I alone will ingage my selfe to oppose the Spanish usurpation. After Polexander had ended, the eldest of the Priests, casting up his eyes, Thanked be Heaven, said he, since I see approach the accomplishment of such things as it deign'd to reveale unto us. That Priest by such exclamations troubled all his auditors, but presently addressing his discourse unto them; What my friends! (said he) it seemeth you have let slip from your memorie the Prophesie, which for this eighteen or twenty yeares hath been the terror of all this Kingdome: if you can call to mind the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings it contain'd, you cannot doubt of its truth, since you this day see the rebellion of our brethren, becoming a slave to the ambition of strangers, violates all the lawes of duty and discretion, layes waste the whole countrey with fire and sword, and for the height of all impietie, shakes our very Altars in going about to overthrow the throne of our Soveraigne. These strange revolutions amaze you, and truly not without cause; but quiet your selves, and be setled; hope from the propitious care of heaven, those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours which the offences of your lives permit you not to aske: if the thunder roare, 'tis rather to threaten then to beat you to dust; nay, the storme was no sooner form'd, but the calme appear'd, and the wound no sooner given, but you have wherewithall to close it. In a word, if your Isle be abandon'd to the mercy of strangers by the treason of your fellow Subjects, see here this fatall Slave come from the depth of Africa, (with that he shew'd them Polexander) for whose valour Heaven hath reserv'd the ruine of your enemies, and the re-establishment of your former fortunes. The reverend and discreet Priest thus ended his speech and by the praises he had given Polexander, put him into as much disorder, as if he had been convicted of having intelligence with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, or had attempted against the honour of Alcidiana. In the meane time, the Queenes Embassadors and her other subjects who were alike fill'd with the threatnings and promises of the Prophesie we spoke on, fell all at Polexander's feet, and imbracing his knees, besought him by the powerfull name of that Deitie which ingaged him to their defence, and by the interests of honour, to take in hand the exterminating sword of Tyrants, and to hasten to the succour of their distressed and even perishing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. You cannot doubt of my willingnesse (reply'd our Heroe) since first I am dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the safetie of this kingdome; but if you wish our armes should be prosperous, leave off the irritating that supernaturall assistance (from whence you are to expect so much happinesse) by your irrationall imaginations. I am indeed a slave, come out of the inmost of Africa, yet doe not imagine me to be the man is promised you by such solemne Prophesies. Polexander could goe no further; all that heard him, cry'd aloud that if they durst call in question so cleare a veritie, they should make themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the felicity it propos'd for the Salary of their beliefe. What hinders us then, cry'd the Embassadors? and since we all equally see our safety, what deterres us, that we doe not all hand in hand run to imbrace it? Polexander, unwilling to contest any longer, told those that urg'd him, he would absolutely put off that power which they desir'd to conferre againe on himselfe, and confining him to his condition of a slave, he was ready to obey whatsoever should be commanded. Hereupon, the Priests
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:54727:300"/>
and Embassadors made knowne what was fit to be done, to hearten the people to their owne defence, to keep backe such as were not yet in rebellion, and to withdraw those who either through ambition or ignorance were ingaged in it. To effect it, 'twas thought fit to send first into the city of Arzilea, and from thence through all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, to advertise the people, that the time of the Prophesie's accomplishment was come, and to perfect it, the slave, which it foretold, was arriv'd in the Island, and had begun the important businesse for the common good, by the defeat of part of the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. These who were chosen for that Commission, presently departed, with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be heard from, assoone as they had had audience of the Arzileans: Whilst they were in their voyage, the rest prepar'd all things fitting in the three ships, that our pretended slave might enter into Arzilea in such a pomp, as might be able to asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the vulgar, and by consequence of power, to perswade them to what was needfull they should beleeve. The rest of the day and part of the night, was imploy'd in those preparations; and it was almost done, when one of them that had been sent to Arzilea, return'd, and made knowne, with how much longing the Arzileans desir'd to be clear'd of their doubts and suspitions. Assoone therefore as the flood entring the river had made it navigable for great vessels, Polexander and his companie set saile: the fourth part of the mariners belonging to Alcidiana's ship, which had beene put into the two Spaniards, having taken from them the little remainder of their ancient braverie, made them attend the victor. Alcidiana's stately vessell, besides her purple sailes, her flagge of azure and gold, and an infinite number of lesse and longer streamers, which on all sides waved with the winde, were inrich'd with trophies so much the more magnificent, since the Spaniard themselves contributed to it. They had laid a great many corslets, pikes, muskets, halberds, and other armes on the ships prow: many ensignes co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ch'd by the arms skim'd along the water, and foure Spaniards, their hands bound behinde their backes, and their legs fetter'd, made appeare by their severall countenances, that one same disaster produceth as many different thoughts and sensibilities, as the minds are of such who are touched by it. Assoone as the three ships were within kenne of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilea, the artillery of the sacred vessell made the lesse curious to run out of their houses, and fill all the key of the port: others came hurrying out of the city gates, and stood rank'd on both sides of the river; the two prizes, bearing but halfe their sailes, did not ill imitate (at least in the ridiculous opinion of the multitude) the dejected countenance of slaves, which sorrowfully follow the triumphant chariot of the conquerour. For mine owne part, I will say, without feare of being accus'd for too daring an amplifier, that the ship which bore Polexander was touch'd with some sense of honour, and that her first pride (being augmented by the Princes incomparable merit, with whom shee seem'd to triumph) did no lesse fill her sailes then the winde which drove her. This glorious and unexpected spectacle, carrying (in an instant) the Arzileans from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie to another, quite blotted out of their memories all that they had promis'd to Tantalus, and call'd them back to her obedience, whom the day before they had us'd as an enemie. Publikely they accurs'd Tantalus revolt, ask'd vengeance for the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards attempt, and thinking their revilings and imprecations were powerfull enough to drive them out of the Island, never gave over vomiting enough against them when they were in sight. Assoone as Polexander came into the Port, he landed with all his companie; and the Priests inviting him to give thankes for his happy successe, they march'd through the multitude to the chiefe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Temple in the city: there the Hymnes of thankesgiving were sung, and many prayers made for Alcidiana's prosperitie. All the people ratifi'd it by their acclamations and appla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

At the very first, he promis'd them on the behalfe of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven which had sent him, the strangers ruine; and the perpetuitie of that happy estate wherein they had liv'd so many ages. These assurances being seconded by many others, made even those men to take arms that were no more (through age) able to bear them. In the meane time, at the newes of our Heroe's arrivall, the Provinces changed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; the rebellious party visibly lost their former courage, and the disinteressed
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54727:301"/>
wonne by the example of such as either affected the kingdome or libertie, came in great troops to augment Polexander's Armie. If slownesse be necessary to the deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Five dayes he march'd, and met no opposition; the sixth, hee saw himselfe compell'd to force a passage, where the rebels lay advantageously intrench'd: the businesse was of passing a river not fordable, and to force the intrenchments that flanck'd it; to that end, he assembled all the chiefe Commanders in the armie, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising with them, (not to deliberate whether the enterprise was to be undertaken, but in what manner they should fall on) he won the least adventurous to follow a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which indeed had in it somewhat (though I cannot name it) of too much rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. The cavalry serv'd for a bridge to the foot-men, to passe the river, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour which Polexander threw into the rebels Armie by the death of their Chiestaine, open'd a large breach into their intrenchments. They were above ten thousand, but there fell not of them above five hundred, for at the sight of Polexander's troops, their hearts failing them, they fled, and saving themselves without armes or baggage, got away from the just indignation of their compatriots. Though this victorie was not very bloudy, yet was it of great consequence; for as much as the runawayes returning into their owne Provinces, spread abroad with the newnesse of their defeate, the terror which had can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>'d it: Every one then began to disavow the part hee had followed; the name of Tantalus was execrable; they proclaim'd all those enemies to the Princesse and the State, which rais'd any forces without Alcidiana's Commission; and for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of their levitie, all of them stil'd this pretended slave (which was scarce knowne to them) their Defender and visible Deitie. In the meane time, Polexander quelling the Queenes enemies, came into the territorie of Eliza: The Spaniards who had newes of his victories, left him the Countrey free, and thinking they could not be beaten out of such places as they had fortified, resolv'd to continue the siege of Eliza, to gaine a part at least, if they could not vanquish all, and inrich their fleet with the riches of so populous and brave a city. The scituation of that place may be termed one of the miracles of nature; the river (whence it hath its name) falls from some high mountaines which lie on the West, and after it hath run through many fertile plaines, and grown great by the accesse of divers other currents, makes a lake of about seven leagues long, and not lesse then a league broad, where it is narrowest: some two hundred paces, above the mouth by which this river runs out of the lake, and betakes him to his course againe, there is a rock of a most strange and odd figure, from what part soever you descry it: For besides its not rising above twenty or thirty foot above water, it perfectly represents the forme of a man laid all along, with his legs open and shrunck up, his arms alost, his neck unmeasurably long, and his head farre greater. This forme, doth not onely make the city very pleasant and commodious, but so regularly fortified, that all which the later ages have invented in the art of fortification, was found there exactly put in practise by the sole industrie of nature. The hands and feet of that humane figure, were foure great bastions which defended one another, and in all likelihood made the place impregnable: notwithstanding by the treachery of some of Tantalus confederates, the Spaniards were gotten masters of some of the principall parts, and making use of them against nature's intention, imploy'd them for the ruine of their whole body. I would say, there was no more but the last towne where Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana was blocked up, which held good against the Spaniards, and was no more shaken by their faire promises, then by their continuall assaults. The very day Polexander came before the towne, he went to take notice of it in spight of the enemies cannon, and having chosen a fit place to encamp himselfe, the night following began to lodge his Army: the place was opposite to a tongue of land which divided the two townes, and was shadow'd by many little hills, which besides the commodities of water and wood wherewithall they furnish'd the camp, serv'd for defences to safeguard them from all surprises and assaults. After Polexander had spent foure or five dayes in skirmishes, if
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:54727:301"/>
not unprofitable, at least very little advantageous, and seen that he could not draw the Spaniard to a land battell, perceiv'd he lost time, and that if he had not ships, he must have the misery of beholding Alcidiana and her towne lost before his eyes. To avoid that disaster, he sent to demolish all the houses of a Bourg which had felt the Spaniards furie, and of the timber which had escap'd the fire, caus'd some thirty ferry-boats to be made, and sixscore others which were able to take in foure rowers, and twelve souldiers a piece. Whilst a great many Carpenters and Shipwrights were busied about the building these vessels, Polexander hazarded some of his followers that were most skil'd in swimming, to get into the besieged city, and give notice to the Queene of Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus death, and of her subjects resolution, to lay downe their lives for her preservation. But the barques which the Spaniards had laid in guard all round the city, drowning some of them, and forcing the rest to swim backe againe, were the cause, that what should have given hope and comfort to the Queene, increas'd her despaire, and fully overwhelm'd her with melancholy. Assoone as the ferries and boats were finished, Polexander advertis'd the principall Commanders in the Army of an enterprise he had on the Fort, which the Spaniards had built in the midst of that tongue of earth which we call'd the neck of our figure: after he had made knowne to them the importance of that designe, and the reasons he had to undertake it, I know (said he) 'tis a great deale of hazard, but before we came out of Arzilea, I intimated fully to you, that if we would preserve this State, we were to take such wayes by which others have usually bin ruin'd; I meane, in rejecting the counsell of wisdome, and abandoning our selves to all manner of rashnes. One of the most eminent and considerable in the Assembly reply'd, When my companions and my selfe resolv'd either to loose our lives with you or to save our Country and Soveraign, wee despoil'd our selves of our selves, and marching on the faith of prophesie, beleeved, that he whom heaven had expresly sent for our good, could not advise any thing amisse. Wee are still of the same opinion, and though the proposition you make us, seemes out of all likelyhood, yet only because you coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell it, we believe there is nothing more facile. Polexander rejoycing that his souldiers errours were so advantageous to him, would confirme them in it, to the end he might meet with no opposition in all he should command them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dertake. He therefore assur'd them from their Deity, that the Spanyards should be beaten, and their Fort wonne in spight of all their resistance. After this counsell he presently chose out such as he meant to make use of in this exploit; and giving order for the manner and time of the assault, planted eight Culverins in a place whence they might extreamly incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the enemies ships. Whilst his Ordinance play'd, and made them change place and design, the night came on; and with it so violent a winde and mightie a rain, that they both seem'd to be of confederacie with our Heroe, for the depriving the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of all meanes of preventing their misfortune. All the time the ill weather gave him the commoditie of sure labouring, he launch'd all his ferryes and boates into the Lake. The first, he arm'd with fortie small field Peeces, and fill'd the others with men arm'd at proof, who had all made a vow even to devoure the Fort but they would carry it. Polexander, assur'd the successe of their enterprise, promised them the visible as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of the God of Warre, and putting himselfe in the front of all; Companions (said he) do not thinke it is to excite your valour by mine example; or to dispute with you the honour of this action, that I fall first on: I know your courage needs not to be solicited, and my pride would deserve punishment, if it wonne me to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Make it appear, that the power which you adore promiseth nothing untrue, and fighting on his word, you run certainty to the victorie. Alcidiana's foure Embassadors entred all into Polexanders boate, and seeking no other glorie then to have that Prince witnesse of their actions, told him with a great deale of jollity, that the occasion presented it selfe in which they should have the honour to be applauded of him dead or alive. The feigned Araxes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:54727:302"/>
she shall be forc'd her selfe to confesse that you have been their exterminators. The most part of the night being spent in this discourse, and in ranking the greater and lesser boats in the order they were to floate; Polexander commanded them to put on under favour of the winde and darknesse. Both which, made the voyage so private, that but for the noise the souldiers made at their landing, the Spanyards had been vanquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they had been prepar'd to defend themselves. But before they well knew whence the noise came, they were set on. Polexander, all at once assail'd all parts of the Fort, and made so happy use of the bavins and ladders he had caus'd to be brought, that the place was wonne, and all the Spanyards put to the edge of the sword. Our Heroe, there lost two or three hundred of his men, and was himselfe shot in the leg, but so favorably, that it took not from him the libertie of walking above ten or twelve dayes at most. At the beginning of the assault he had planted eight field Peeces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Fort and the Town, and so level'd all those that were in the greater boats, that they swept along the tongue of the land, and made every one who shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on that passage to run the hazard of his life. And when the Spanyards would have assisted their companions, they were so ill dealt withall by the Canon, that they were forc'd to stay within their walles, and to send their barques to beat off their enemies barges. 'Twas in this Combat that Polexander made them believe he was not (as other men) subject to the dammage of wounds: For as lame as he was, he fell in amongst the Spanish barkes, burnt some ten or twelve of them, sunk above fiftie, and beat the rest before him under the bastions of the gotten town. Whilst he was performing these admirable exploits, one of Alcidiana's Embassadors ravish'd that he had so good newes to carry to his Princesse, left the fight, and went straight to the gates of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per towne: all the night they had been there in a great alarme, and the Queen's guards, with the most of the inhabitants, were still in armes, at the gates, on the walls, and market place. Nor would the Clergie alledge their priviledges to be exempted from that service, but on the contrary, were the first weapon'd, and by their example drew to the common defence, such as were accustom'd to free themselves from all travell and danger of warre. When the Queen's Embassador came neere that gate (which they call'd the East) he was staid by the sentinels; assoone as he had told his name, they straight went and made it knowne to Radiotez the chiefe Priest, who, not able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this unexpected newes, ran to the gate, and causing the wicket to be opened, took in the Embassador; and then had as much adoe to perswade himselfe 'twas the same man, though he knew him very well, and ask'd him often if it were possible he was not deceiv'd. If you take me for Amintas, repli'd the Embassador, you are not mistaken: but if the sight of me hath astonish'd you, that which I have to relate will doe it farre more. Bring me quickly to the Queene, and know now the while, that we have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Spaniards Fort, that neither the strangers nor rebels can endamage us more; and that hence forward, you shall not be imployed but in giving thankes to that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Bounty, which hath shew'd it selfe so punctuall in sending us the succour long since promised. The Chiefe-prelate strove by all meanes to get Amintas to speake more clearly, but perceiving he was resolv'd to speake no further till he came to the Queene, he brought him to the palace, where he found the Princesse prepar'd for all manner of accidents; and resolv'd, rather to die an honourable death, then to be expos'd to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence of her enemies. At the sight of Amintas she startled againe, and her longing furnishing her with many demands at once, she would even have been glad that Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas could have prevented her questions. When he had leave to speake, Madam (said he) I bring your Majestie so great and so happy newes, that I will not thinke you have lost any thing of that good opinion you have heretofore had of my fidelitie, though you doubt of those truths I am to make knowne to you; yet I beseech you to give credit to what I shall relate, and to beleeve your selfe so deare to the Deitie you have so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously ador'd, as not to doubt of the assistance it hath miraculously sent you. That Slave (said he) which the Prophesies promis'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:54727:302"/>
your indignation. After this victòrious Slave had slaine him, hee cut his troops in pieces, and came to this towne with above twentie thousand of your subjects; this very night hath he surpris'd the fort which the Spaniards had built to cut off from you all hope of relieving. Whilst Amintas spoke, Alcidiana often chang'd colour, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time felt her selfe as cold as ice, and then againe as hot as fire; her dis-rest at last, not permitting any longer silence, Of what Slave talke you? said she, sharply to her Embassador. Who is that stranger? whence comes he? where found ye him? and how long have you been the Interpreter of our Prophesies? Amintas, beleeving he had wherewithall to please the Queen; I will (said he) fully satisfie all your Majesties que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, and tell you before hand, that they have not well understood the mysterie of our predictions, who casting a dread on the hearts of our late King your father and your selfe, for the Slave that was to come out of the deserts of Africa, to whose valour you are to owe your estate, every private man his safetie, and the whole Island its entire deliverance. But that I may omit nothing can be expected in what I am to say, I will begin (if your Majestie please) with our arriving in the Island of the Sunne. Alcidiana then bending to the backe of her chaire, and leaning her head on her left hand, seem'd to be very attentive, when Amintas began thus: After our landing in the Isle of the Sunne, and the accomplishing the Ceremonies of the sacrifice of Alliance, wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded (as the custome was) the celebration of the bloudy sacrifice; but the Chiefe-prelate, and the Prince of the Clergie, let us understand by two learn'd and eloquent speeches, that in lieu of making our selves acceptable to the invisible Sun by our humane immolations, we became the enemies of his glory, and profaners of his puritie. We gave credit to it without contesting against their Doctrine, unanimously consented to that reformation, and obliged our selves, not onely to give you notice of it, but to winne you to a speedy abolishment of all bloudy sacrifices. The day of our departure arriving, the Chiefe-priest tooke us into his private chamber, and after he had many times intreated us not to let slip a word he should say, thus bespoke us; I must (my Lords) discharge my trust, and give satisfaction to the passionate desires of a Prince which holds Alcidiana for a visible Divinitie: I think there is none of you all but knows him, as well by the magnificence of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> offerings, wherewithall he hath inrich'd the Temple of the Sunne, as by the royall presents which he hath often sent to the Queen your Mistris: before he pass'd from this condition to a better, and time had involv'd him in that obscuritie where he now lies buried, he sent (and 'twas the last time) his Embassadors hither; and after he had contented his zeale, desir'd likewise to give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his passion. To that end, he besought me by his letters and Embassadors, that presently on your arrivall here, I should deliver into your hands the last presents he had appointed for Alcidiana: I am the guardian of his treasure, and to acquit my selfe of my promise made to that Prince, I intend at this time to give it you in charge. That which is most to be admir'd amongst his gifts, is our Prince Araxes, who as the wonder of his age, and the glory of men, hath been consecrated to heaven, and destin'd for Alcidiana. You may tell me, that since for this great service to this Island he hath been infranchis'd, it would be a great deale of Injustice to your Queene, if she should put him againe amongst her slaves: but let not that thought hinder her; Araxes so pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately loves the Prince who hath deem'd him worthy the service of Alcidiana, that he preferres that Kings command before his libertie and life: the Queene may treate him as she pleaseth with respect to his merit, and either put him into her chaines, or give him his libertie. When the Chiefe-prelate had made us this declaration, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into our hands the slave Araxes: But what slave (Madam) thinke you he is? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly some Deitie hidden in the shape of a man, who hath left heaven for the general good of the world: the King of Gheneoa held him so, since the happy day wherein by his valour he was pluck'd out of the lions pawes; and as such a one, gave to him the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Crowne, or your fetters. But that great heart, prizing the advantage of a Kingdome beneath the honour of your service, voluntarily cast by the scepter of Ghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neoa, and out of an excesse of noblenesse came to sacrifice himselfe to the Sun, and to receive from the hands of his Priest the markes of his slaverie. The first act he did at his arrival in the sacred Island, was his defending the treasure, the Altars, and the Priests,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54727:303"/>
from the rapine and inhumanitie of a great many pirates. That miracle of valour seem'd to us incredible when it was related; but that which the victorious Araxes hath done since he imbark'd himselfe, hath throughly cured us of our incredulitie: But for him (Madam) we and the sacred vessell had been lost: But for him, the Spaniards had divided your estate with your rebellious subjects; and if I dare say it, without him you had certainly been the prey of a barbarous Nation. Shall I say againe that hee hath sav'd your Island, that he hath call'd backe respect and obedience into the hearts of your most ingratefull subjects; and that the execrable Tantalus hath through his valour receiv'd the reward of his rebellion? Doubt it not, Madam, this is the slave which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath chosen for the re-establishment of your authoritie, and the happinesse of your Empire. But let not your Majestie wholly relie on what I have spoken, looke over the predictions of the ancient Hermit; advise with the venerable Rhadiotez; in the mean time, I bring you for the height of all good newes, that of taking the Spaniards fort, and the hope of a victorie which will justly give this Island the title of most happy. After Amintas had spoken, he expected from the Queen some favourable answer; but she arising extreamly vexed, Returne (said she) and adore that Slave whom you would give me for my deliverer; and tell him, that Alcidiana is not reduc'd to the shamefull necessitie of borrowing another hand then her owne, to free her from her enemies. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this rough treating her Embassador she retir'd, and being in private with one of her Ladies and the venerable Rhadiotez; What think you (said she) of Amintas relation? The Chiefe-prelate (though he knew well with what intention she made that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet unwilling to witnesse his complaisancie in a businesse of so great a weight, or to betray his countrey in soothing the passion of the Princesse) reply'd, If Amintas (Madam) were the sole man of his opinion, or if the onely vanitie which accompanies youth, had furnish'd him with the interpretation by which it seemes he hath offended your Majestie, I should be the first to condemn his boldnesse, and even find a grèat deal of indulgence in the manner of your treating him: but since he is of the same opinion with all your subjects, and speakes not of the slave (which is expected by all) but in the termes of the Prophesie; we must even wilfully pluck out our eyes that wee may not see he speakes as he ought, and that the African Slave is the very same that is promis'd you, as the fatall stay of your tottering Throne. I see well (Madam) you looke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly at this veritie, and you are jealous of it, because it is not conformable to your minde: but let not your Majestie be too ingenious to wrong your selfe; give care as well to your great judgement, as to the height of your heart; suspend a while all kind of resolutions; and constituting your selfe the soveraigne arbitrator betwixt Fortune and your owne person, judge definitively, but with full knowledge of the cause, which of the two shall goe off victorious. You cannot be better instructed, then by that which should decide the difference: command therefore, that the originall of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie may be produc'd, which hath been alwayes very carefully kept amongst the most precious things in your treasurie; weigh well all the words, interpret them, and if you thinke it fitting, the most favourably for your satisfaction; and if you finde in it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explication then Amintas his, then mine, then what all your subjects give it; you shall then have cause to condemne us all, and persevere in your first intention. Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana hereat sighing, in lieu of replying, made shew of the violence of her disturbances; but having calm'd them a little, she commanded the Lady that was with her, to cause the little coffer to be brought wherein the Prophesie was kept; and she that was in more pain then her Mistresse, went presently, and a good while after return'd with that fatall piece. Rhadiotez open'd the box, and Alcidiana with some trouble took out the plate of brasse on which the prediction was engraven: she laid it on the table and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Rhadiotez to stand on the one side, and her confident on the other, with order of much attention, read what followes.</p>

WHen this Kingdome shall be raised to the supreme point of all prosperitie, by a precipitated death, it shall be expos'd to the rage of mindes most ambitious. The deaths of the first rebels shall no way terrifie the second. Bloudy examples shall but stirre up the treason; and that unfortunate age shall produce such monsters, who to satiate their brutishnesse, will lay waste their countrey with fire and sword, and shall be so base as to enter into confederary with meere strangers.

But behold, I see a Slave come out of the bottome of Africa, who already having vanquish'd many nations, arrives here to exterminate both the rebels and usurpers.

                  <p>In all likelihood, Alcidiana at the reading of this Prophesie might have receiv'd some contentment; but she renew'd her sighings, and unable any longer to refraine from tears, even let them fall down on the Prophesie in such an excesse, as if she had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leev'd she could with the Characters have drown'd all the misfortunes they seem'd to threaten her. Rhadiotez seeing her discontent, spoke all he thought fitting to quiet her afflicted minde; but Alcidiana not induring his discourse, Retire father (said she) and assure your selfe, that I have not so little profited in your schoole, but that I know well how we must die when we can live no longer, but with dishonour. I was borne free, and you propose to me something worse then death, when you propound I am not to live but by making my selfe the slave of a Slave. Rhadiotez willing to give the Princesse time to advise with her selfe, and more seriously to meditate on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, return'd to his palace; and Alcidiana seeing her self then at libertie, began again her lamentations, and turning to her confident, Come Amintha (said she) am I not now at last arriv'd at that utmost point of misfortune, which long since, my visions, my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, and melancholy foretold me? O cruell Fate! certainly thou too tyrrannically abusest that soveraigne power which is given thee from above on us poore mortalls: What wilt thou shall become of me? But doe what thou list; my good or ill shall not depend on thee: the command I have over my selfe is no lesse absolute then thine; I will keep it in spight of all thy violence; and since death hath depriv'd me of all that could make me in love with life; 'tis in vaine by the object of greatnesse and felicities to bustle with my resolution and tempt my courage. Cast thine eyes on me, deare and worthy subject of my sorrow, turne thine eyes on me, and upbraid me of falshood, if thou read'st in my soule any motion that counsels me to forsake thee for another. The Princesse's confident seeing her teares and sighes had taken away her power of speech; Polexander (said she to her) is worthy of these testimonies of love you bestow on his memorie; and, Madam, he having lov'd you, what said I, lov'd? having ador'd you as he hath done, I doubt not, but amidst all the pleasures which inviron him, hee resents your displeasures, and seeing you afflicted, is even pensive and sad in the very source of all happinesse. Ah deare Amintha, cry'd the Queene, how doe thy words pierce me, and mournfully re-imprint in my memorie, the remembrance of my folly and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude! She could not speake further, for word was brought her, the multitude was round about the palace, and threatned to breake the gates if they were not let in. All conspires against us Amintha (said she to her confident,) but let us resist to the last, and at least shew that faire soule which lookes on us from heaven, that we abandon not his

party though it be to the weakest. With that she went out on a great Terrasse which ran along the first court of her palace, and commanded the gates to be opened. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently the people rush'd in headlong, but at sight of the Princesse whom they never look'd on without respect and wonder, they rain'd in their fury and fell all on their knees. Alcidiana, seeing them in such a reverence, commanded them to stand up and declare the cause of the tumult: the multitude after their wonted manner, speaking in confusion, began to cry out, that the Deliverer which had beene promis'd the State even from Heaven, was at the towne gate, and they besought the Queen's permission to goe meet him, to see him, and petition him for an end of their present calamities. Alcidiana, unable to indure the continuation of their discourse; How, my subjects (said she all inraged) you doe not thinke of me then otherwise then as of an enemie, or at least as of one without power? What, doe you expect from a wretched stranger, what you hope not from my vigilancie, from my forces, nor your owne courage? who is the seducer that hath impoison'd your minds with a prediction as idle as it is intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? You see at hand the safetie my care hath acquir'd you, and yet you tread under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot what is sensible to run after Chimera's and meer leasings. Assure your selves, the date of your misfortune is pass'd; the revolt is buried in the graves of the authors, and the strangers are no more in case to annoy us: have a little patience, and you shall soone see them shamefully quit our coasts, and carrie nothing of their crimes with them, but their griefe for committing them. The people repli'd, she promis'd no happinesse but what was most certaine; but that she might not be unworthy of it, 'twas fitting the person should be honour'd who had wrought it. That reply absolutely angring the Queene, she withdrew without giving the people any contentment, and shutting her selfe up in her closet with Amintha onely; O ingratefull people (cry'd she) that have neither thought of me nor my predecessors! Reeds, shaken with all winds, minds ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring novelties, you are then wearie of my Government, and without the knowledge of what is beneficiall or hurtfull to you, desire a Slave for your King; and that Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana, who would not bestow her chaines on Polexander, should offer her Crowne to Araxes! Here she was silent, and after a little musing, threw her selfe (weeping) on her confident's neck; And my poore Amintha (said she) see I pray thee with what eagernesse my misfortune pursues me, and thinke what I should resolve on to avoid the accomplishment of our dismall Prophesie: Doest thou imagine that Alcidiana hath so base a spirit as to preferre before death, a Slave who without doubt is come from among that barbarous nation which wretchedly inhabits the in-land deserts of Africa? No, no, let Fortune arme the whole universe, to force me to that necessitie; I will see my kingdome all of a flame, if my bloud cannot quench the fire, rather then undergoe the reproach of doing an act unworthy of Alcidiana. Amintha, desirous to intertaine the Queen in this just aversion; There is nothing (said she) but your Majestie is bound to suffer rather then the dangerous beliefe which is slid in among your subjects. Weak minds (as your Majestie knowes) are susceptible of all: we need but propose things to them beyond their understanding, to fill them with foolish admirations, and from those idle wondrings, carry them to beliefes more ridiculous and extravagant. If once your subjects strongly conceive that their fafetie depends on this Slave, and that you ought to be the sacrifice to be offer'd for their good; your forbiddings, how severe soever, shall never plucke that opinion out of them: I feare, lest at the upshot they come to violate the respect they owe you, and to avoid the falling into such misfortunes as threaten them, they cast your sacred person into the greatest that can betide you: pluck out this errour before it have taken too deep root, and suffer not this African Inchanter to bewitch the minds of your people, and forbid on paine of death, any man whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to have the least communication with him. I would willingly follow your advice (reply'd the Queene) but the love I beare to my subjects forbids me: What shall I do miserable wretch that I am? the sorrow for what is pass'd, the horror of the present, and the feare of what is to come, present themselves to my thoughts all at once, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny monsters resolutely bent to be drunken with my bloud. I confesse Amintha, my Philosophy yeelds to my fortune, and my constancy leaving me, I float incertainly in my selfe, and know not what to resolve on: thinke on it for me (deare Amintha) and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:54727:304"/>
as a charitable Physitian imploy your judgement and remedies for the comforting of a Patient whose sicknesse is all in extremities. If your Majestie (reply'd Amintha) gets not from your selfe the remedie that may give ease to your maladie, doe not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that any which may come from without you, can render you your health. I am capable of all (repli'd Alcidiana sighing) excepting two things, which I finde alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; the one of comforting me for the losse I have suffered by mine owne indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and the other of assuring my peace in hazarding that of my subjects. As shee had spoke thus, the Ladies which kept the dores of her sever'd lodgings, came and told <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> that Rhadiotez demanded audience, not onely for Amintas and his associates, but for Araxes deputies, to give her Majestie an account of his actions, and to know her resolution for that which remain'd unperfected. At this newes Alcidiana was extreamly perplexed; her anger forbad the hearing of her owne Embassadors, whom she thought had been wonne by Araxes, and those, whom the Slave had taken the boldnesse to send to her; on the other side, the love of her people overcoming all her resentments, represented to her, that to offend a person chosen for the safetie of the State, was to make a publike declaration that shee had sworne the destruction of it. After she had beene long without resolving what part she was to take, her affection carried her at last on that of her hatred; and shee told her Ushers, that within two hours she would be in the Hall of publike audience. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, all the Officers had order to performe their severall charges, and the Ladies which made up her private Court, dressing themselves all in haste, assembled in the chamber where they were wont to attend at the like Ceremonies. Alcidiana, cover'd with a large vaile, (as if she would let them know, that during her subjects misery, she resolv'd to be in mourning) came out of her chamber, and so went with all her Ladies into that Hall (shining with gold and jewels) which we have already made admirable to our Readers. Assoone as she was plac'd in her Throne, the Officers of her Guard, went for the Embassadors: Rhadiotez and the high Chamberlaine, brought them to the audience, and coming to the foot of the Throne, one of Aminta's associates made an ample narration of all that which pass'd in their voyage to the Island of the Sunne, and offer'd her all the King of Gheneoa's presents. I erre, for the best was not there, since the victorious Araxes, kept backe by his wound, and the necessitie of affaires, was still in the Fort: and indeed, the Embassador making known that present was missing, turn'd to those whom Araxes had chosen for his owne particular, and giving them the place, Your Majestie (said he) may be pleas'd to understand from these what hath been done since our returne. Alcidiana, giving them leave to speake, one amongst them particularly recounted all that which Araxes had perform'd from the very day hee had devoted himselfe to the Queen's service; and ending his relation with the wound hee receiv'd at the taking of the Fort, presented her a Letter. Alcidiana was surpris'd at it, and blushing for anger, sate awhile so extreamly confused, that 'twas well perceiv'd, she deliberated with her selfe, whether she should receive or refuse the Letter: at last, the good Genius who had resolv'd Polexander's happinesse, forc'd the Queen's will, and wonne her (spight of her selfe) to extend her hand to receive that which she had look'd upon with horror. Yet had she no sooner touch'd the paper but she repented it, and to discharge her selfe of a burthen, which (as light as it was) seem'd to her insupportable, gave it to the chiefe of her Secretaries; Read (said she) this aloud, that my subjects may know, the love onely which I beare to them, makes me forget what I owe to my selfe. The superscription of the Letter was thus:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The Slave ARAXES to his Soveraign Princesse.</head>
                  <p>After he had read it, he open'd the Letter, and read what followeth:</p>
                  <p>THis is not the first time (Madam) that a Slave urg'd by an extream zeal for the glory of his Master; hath dar'd more then was permitted him by the Lawes of servitude: I confesse I am bold, but my boldnesse is justified by that Soveraign Law, which from the houre of my birth impos'd on me the necessity of not living but for your service.
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:54727:305"/>
It commands me now to persevere, and not to laydowne armes till the name of your sacred Majestie be avenged for the wrongs of a barbarous nation, and your kingdome freed from all its enemies. Those that have been witnesses of my actions, will relate to your Majestie particularly what hath passed; I should feare to goe beyond that which is permitted me, if I tooke the boldnesse to propose what is to be done for the good of your service. You may vouchsafe (if you please) to send me your commands, and let me know what you have resolv'd touching the Spaniards; in the meane while, I submisly beseech you to beleeve that the Slave Araxes would repute himselfe unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the glorious chaines he weares, if he had not courage enough to promise his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princesse, that within few dayes he will compell the Spaniards dishonourably to abandon such places where of their excessive pride had promis'd them the conquest.</p>
                  <p>After the reading of this Letter, there grew a deep silence through all the Hall; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana look'd on Amintha, she againe on the Queene: So sometimes did Polexander write to me, said the Queene to her selfe: so (said Amintha presently) would Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander have written to the Queen had he beene now alive. At last, the Princesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting her spirits, and repuls'd all other motions but those of her indignation; I should be an enemie to my people (said she to the Embassadors) if I thank'd him not that sent you, for all he hath done for this State; let him be assur'd, I will treat him as the King of Gheneoa's heire, and not as a Slave; and for the continuance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous successe in armes, I will goe adde our Prayers and Sacrifices to those troopes which I have appointed shall joyne with him. Every one being somewhat satisfi'd with this answer, the Embassadors withdrew; and the Queen presently freeing her self from all her attendants except Amintha, shut her selfe into her closet with that Lady. She was neither so indiscreet, nor so much an enemie to her selfe, to wish the feign'd Araxes ill for his coming so fortunately to deliver her from the furie of strangers: but the threatnings of the prediction fill'd her with horror, and when she came to think, that she was intended for the reward of the Slave's brave actions, her great heart ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd her to nothing but tragicall resolutions. Though she extreamly lov'd her people, yet could she not consent that they should grow happy at the cost of all her peace and contentment: I refuse not (said she) to purchase the ruine of their enemies with the price of my bloud; but from a Queene as I was born, to become the companion of a Slave, 'tis a condition, that no subjects how irrationall soever, should exact from their Soveraigne. Amintha, seeing her in this perplexitie, and being not much more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier then she, rashly blam'd Fortune, for that which she should heartily have thank'd her: Ah! (said she) giddy-headed fancie, to whose will heaven seemes to have remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the guidance of my fortunes; why takest thou pleasure in blending the good with ill, to beset roses with thornes, to ravish from us what we affect, and to work our safetie by the mediation of our enemies? Was not Polexander more worthy to serve Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana, and to preserve her countrey, then a Slave bred in the sandy deserts of Africa? Who ingaged thee to murther the one in an Island almost unknowne, and to plucke the other out of his miserable lonelinesse, to triumph at once both over the pride of Spaine, and Alcidiana's libertie? The Princesse, here imposing her silence, We complain (said she) too much on Fortune, since it is in our owne power to deliver us from her tyrannie. Let's make use of our libertie whilst we have it, and not attend till it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by a Slave or a Spaniard: Let's die, Madam, repli'd Amintha, but let's not die till we know certainly 'twill not be permitted us to live any longer. What knowes your Majestie, but that this Slave may be indow'd with more wisdome then so many others whom Fortune hath rais'd out of the mire, and carried even to the skies? 'Tis possible, he will neither lose his judgement nor the remembrance of what he hath been, and unwilling to soil the fairnesse of his life with the impudent desire of enjoying you, content himselfe with the title of your peoples Deliverer. Alcidiana being a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived at this, We shall (said she) shortly see (Amintha) what heaven hath resolv'd; in the meane while, (if it be possible) let's take a little rest, and not altogether despaire of our fortune. Herewith she betooke her to her bed, and Amintha withdrawing, left her a prey to all her troublesome thoughts. She vex'd her selfe as she was wont, as
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54727:305"/>
long as her eyes were open; the unfortunate Image of Polexander which appear'd so often to her troubled imagination, presented it selfe at her bed's feet, shew'd her his wounds, made knowne his love, and recounted all the accidents it had surpass'd, to make his fidelitie triumph over time, fortune, and her insensibilitie. With these thoughts she fell asleep, but she had scarce begunne her first slumber, when the same phantasme, shewing it selfe under all shapes that a dreame could present her, sometimes appear'd wounded, sometimes whole; now miserable, then happy; now a Slave, then a King: and Alcidiana thought her selfe a hundred times a prisoner, and as often deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; as many times Araxes wife, and as many, Polexander's. The night thus passing away she awoke, and awaking, recommenc'd her ordinary exercises, to complaine on Fortune, to lament Polexander's death, and to bewaile the miseries of her people. Amintha hearing she was awake, came into her chamber, and plac'd her selfe at the beds-head to speake more privately. The Princesse who was yet affrighted with her dreames, turn'd towards her her eyes yet swolne with watching and teares, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as pale as if she had been ready to swound: Amintha (said she) I have spent a night which I can neither call good nor bad; poor Polexander's ghost hath continually haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me: but I cannot represent to thee the horror and contentment which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the apparition. I saw Polexander cover'd with wounds, loaden with chaines, wandering among fearfull solitudes; I heard him calll me to his aide, and having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in his mouth then the name of Alcidiana, intimated, that onely on my will depended either the continuance or end of his miseries. In that extremitie my love made me forget what I was; I ran to that miserable man's aide, and thought I could assuredly have redeem'd him from his disasters, when with a great clap of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I saw the Slave Araxes fall at my feet amongst a great deale of bloud, and a number of dead careases: saine would I have fled, but I could not possibly. The Slave in the meane while lay at my feet, and having told me part of what I have seene in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall prediction, made use of all that eloquence hath both of cunning and beautie, to make me confident of his respect and loyaltie. He swore, that he had not taken the boldnesse to serve me, but that it was a necessitie impos'd on him by the decrees of heaven, and those of my beautie. You beleeve (Amintha) this discourse did not greatly please me; I look'd on the Slave with mine eyes full of disdaine, and straight turning away my head; Goe Wretch, said I, and know that Alcidiana is not capable of change. I wish it so, reply'd the Slave; No sooner had he spoken the word, but Polexander ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to me, as brave and comely as the first time I saw him, and forcing his enemie to vanish, tooke me by the hand, and as 'twere in spight of me, lead me to the great Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this city. Is not this dreame (altogether) very pleasing, and very terrible? and if the one way it displeaseth, doth it not on the other promise a great deale of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment? Yes truly (repli'd Amintha) and I hope that at last the Chaos and intricacy of your fortunes disclosing themselves, and Heaven laying open what it hath conceal'd of that which is come; those things which we feare most, will have a happy successe. It may questioulesse be fortunate (repli'd the Queen) but not as you beleeve: Death only shall produce that felicitie, and by its mediation I shall gaine, what I could not obtain by any other meanes. If you search into, and meditate deeply on my dreame, you shall finde, that Polexander faire and lovely as he appear'd to me, is that Polexander which is above in heaven; and seeing me at the point to be sacrific'd to this ambitious Slave, pluck'd me out of his hands, and lead me to the Temple where my Ancestors are interred. But O happy soule! which in the fulnesse of thy beatitude hast a care of the unfortunate Alcidiana; assure thy selfe, she will willingly goe to the place whither thou wilt conduct her; and though that youth, and the love of our selves, seeme to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the intent she hath of dying; yet in spight of those obstacles and resistances, she will let thee see, that thy consideration is more powerfull over her, then the most choicefull life can be showne her on earth. After this speech, the Princesse making shew of the greatnesse of her courage, seem'd lesse dejected, and lesse troubled then at first: she wept no more, her palenesse gave place to the cincture of the rose, which made her admir'd of all that beheld her, and her constancy treading under-foot all her disquiets, restor'd her (at least in shew) to that state of contentment wherein she had
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:54727:306"/>
pass'd the two first yeares of her government. She presently arose, and spending a part of the morning, either in dressing her selfe, or in reading the intelligence she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from divers parts, went afterward to the private oratory of her palace, to offer her life and crowne in sacrifice to the Deitie which had given her them both. A while after she went to her repast, and as she arose thence, Amintha told her, that Pallantus (cured of his wounds) was return'd from Arzilea, and humbly petition'd, he might have the honour to give her Majestie an account of his voyage: she granted it, and sent him word, she would speake with him towards the evening in the Phoenix garden. After dinner she went to councell; Rhadiotez as Chiefe-prelate was president, and as such propounding what was most important for the state of the present affaires, made the coming of Araxes, and the taking of the Spaniards Fort to passe for a miracle. But (said he) we must not neglect our good fortune, and by not knowing how to make good use of our advantages, suffer our enemies to render them unprofitable to us: whilst they are terrifi'd, 'tis fitting to keep them so as long as we can, and give them no leasure to recover from their astonishment. 'Tis true, Araxes is wounded, and as if his wound were the death of all our Souldiers, those in the fort, nay even these in this towne, are strucken with such a consternation and dismay, that we can hardly get them to their armes: but the best in this misfortune, is, that Araxes is but very slightly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and this morning going to visit him, he had left his bed, if I had not intreated him in the Queen's name, not to hinder his recoverie in neglecting his wound. Besides the people murmure, because their Deliverer is not taken into the towne, but in contempt of the expresse will of Heaven, he is treated as an enemie, or at least as an indifferent person, whom they already looke on as their Prince and Redeemer. Alcidiana, at that word interrupting Rhadiotez, Had I not resolv'd (said shee) to suppresse all my resentments, and to be avenged on my selfe for my subjects ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; I would complaine of their murmurings, of the connivence of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and the consent which all you that are here seeme to give to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies. What? will my subjects have mee goe meete the African Slave, and descending from my Throne to place him in it, despoile my selfe of mine owne qualitie to put on his? 'Tis not if there were question of their safetie, that I would make difficulty of dividing my Crowne, since I will never make any of abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute bestowing my life: but because I thinke my selfe not yet brought to that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie; if the misfortune of our affaires shall ingage me to it, be assur'd I shall demeane my selfe with all the love that a good Prince ought to have for his subjects; and will make appeare even by my death, that there is nothing so deare to me as the welfare of my subjects. This speech drawing teares from the eyes of all the auditors, they stood a while silent; at last Rhadiotez began, and intreating the Queene to live for the good of her people, and not intimate her love by such tragicall resolutions, lead her by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the businesses of warre. They settled principally on those of the sea; many spoke of preparing ships, and to have a fleet alwayes ready: but Rhadiotez alledging that the Fundamentall Lawes of the kingdome absolutely for bad navigation, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly permitted three sailing ships in the whole Island; it was concluded on the powerfull considerations of the Chiefe-prelate, that the ancient Ordinances should be kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably, and some other wayes to be used for the expulsion of the Spaniards. This Councell ended, the Queen retir'd to her chamber with Amintha and some other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and at Even went downe into the Phoenix garden. Assoone as she was gotten into a grove of Orange-trees, wherein there were alleys of five or six hundred paces long, and fountaines of falling waters from twenty to twenty paces, she call'd for Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus. The Lientenant over her Slaves went to receive him at one of the garden gates, and after he had imbrac'd him as the best of his friends, brought him to the Princesse. Assoone as she saw him afarre off, the bloud flew into her face, and straight growing pale againe, she was constrain'd to sit downe to conceale how much she was stirr'd. Pallantus loaden, or to speake more properly, adorn'd with his illustrious chaines, put one knee to the earth, and kiss'd the hemme of the Queen's garment. The Princesse to divert her transport, I understood of your returne (said she) and the accident which caus'd it; but those that made the recitall to me, were so ignorant of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:54727:306"/>
the particulars, that I shall be glad to heare them from your self. With that she arose, and after she had commanded all others to keep off, and call'd Amintha on her right hand, and Pallantus on the left, she walked some few paces without speaking a word; but then on the sudden coming out of her musings, she leant on Amintha, and calling Pallantus neerer who kept a little behind, Relate to me (said she) all that hath betided you since you left this Island, and forget nothing that may serve for a diversion to our spirits wearied with the time and its misfortunes. Pallantus, obeying the Queene, thus began the relation of his voyage: The very day on which your Majestie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me to depart, I imbark'd in that vessell which (to my honour) you bestowed on me, and was so fortunate, that the fifth day after, I landed in the Island of the Sunne: I satisfi'd your zeale by the celebration of those sacrifices which you commanded me; and acquitting my selfe of the vow I had made for the prosperitie of your raigne, I left that sacred Island to visit the principall Courts of Africa and Europe, and to cause that wondrous portraict to be there ador'd, which without doubt participates somwhat with the miracles of its originall. But a tempest tooke me in that long traverse of sea which is betweene the Island of the Sunne, and the kingdome of Senega; divers dayes was I in danger to be cast away, at last, committing my selfe to Fortune, I was desirous to see what shee was able to doe.' Shee was not ingratefull for my confidence, but brought me happily in to that Island, made famous even to the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the earth, by the valour of Bajazet; that Prince's reputation obliged me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him the treasure I was intrusted withall: but he had no sooner seen your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties picture, then he cry'd out, that art was gone beyond all that nature could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly produce. Iblam'd his incredulity, and told him, that art had been but a most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect imitator of nature: My exclamation (reply'd Bajazet) is an effect of my asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, not of my misbeliefe. I make no question but Alcidiana is far fairer then this picture shewes her, and if to confirme me in this opinion, you had need of another witnesse then your selfe; there is a Prince in this Island that would not denie you his testimonie. A Prince (said I) and what Prince? Never any but Polexander had the happinesse of seeing Alcidiana. May be 'tis of him I speak, reply'd Bajazet; with that Polexander came and imbrac'd me, and kissing the chains I wore: Thou feest (said he) O happy Pallantus! the deplorable Polexander, whom fortune not onely declares un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of re-seeing thy divine Princesse, but also of bearing the markes of her servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I answered him in such a fashion, that he perceiv'd well hee had offended you; and that the punishment of absence, was but a part of those to which you had co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd him. Hereat, not able almost to refraine from teares, Tell me (said he) deare Pallantus the most cruellest of my destinie, and let me know what punishment Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana's just anger reserves for my temeritie. I thereupon intimated the just causes your Majestie had to make him feele the effects of your choler, and after that declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shewed him the other, which you had made against his life: with a great deale of respect he read it, kiss'd it often, and made shew to me of a great deale of joy for his ill fortune, because it was your pleasure. I would presently have departed, but Baja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zet having run a hazard of being slaine by one of his pirates, I thought my selfe bound before I set saile, to see the successe of his wound: assoone as I was confident of his life, I tooke leave of Polexander and the Princes which accompanied him; he left me not till I was imbark'd, and when he saw he must needs leave me, Know (said he) my dear Pallantus, that my miserie is increased by the hopes which thou hast given me, and if ever thy good fortune bring thee backe againe to that blessed place where thy divine Princesse raignes; tell her, that thou hast left the wretched Polexander on the point of finishing by some new kind of death, the incredible torments which his absence inflicts upon him. 'Tis not that which you promis'd me (I reply'd) nor doe you expect that I speake of you to our great Queene, if you persevere not in the resolution of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ffering for her. I will doe it then (said Polexander) since 'tis for her glory, and husbanding my life in the extremity of my affliction, will not put in any hazard, but whilst I am forc'd to it by the desire of re-seeing the incomparable Alcidiana. After he had thus spoke, he imbrac'd me againe, and return'd where he was expected; in the meane time (dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by a favourable gale) I sail'd along the coasts of Africa, and cast anchor in the port
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54727:307"/>
of Morocco. The Princes which raign'd there, entertained me with all manner of civilitie, which the name and picture of your Majestie imperiously exacts from the most barbarous minds. From thence I sail'd into Spaine, and came to Lisbone to make your portraict admir'd by all the Court of Portugall. After I had gotten you a great many adorers there, I tooke my course Northerly: I saw France, England, Scotland, and upon some newes brought me, as I was going out of that great gulf, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Scottish sea, I sail'd into Denmarke, where I saw that famous Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lismond, whom your Majesties picture and indignation, have rais'd to the highest point of honour. At that word, Alcidiana interrupting him, said coldly, I think some body hath heretofore spoken to me of that rash man, but never made mention of him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relating to me the advantages which Polexander got on him. 'Tis true Madam, (reply'd Pallantus) Polexander had the better of him in the combate he undertooke for your quarrell: but if that generous Prince may be beleeved, 'twas not his valour, but your Majesties anger, which conquered Phelismond. And indeed, since that time, that Prince by a thousand glorious actions hath made knowne to the world, that he sprung from the bravest bloud which ever formed Kings. It hath been told me, said the Queene, 'twas one of unknowne birth, on whom Fortune and the King of Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark's fantasticall humour, were desirous to practice all that they were able to produce. 'Tis truth Madam (answered Pallantus) that at first the King of Denmarke divided his authoritie with him, and not content to see him the second person in his kingdome, even before his death plac'd the Crowne on his head. But why deferre I so long time the giving your Majestie a contentment whereof you must be extreamly sensible? Be pleas'd Madam, to know, that Phelismond is your brother, Sonne of the great Alcidus your father, and of a Princesse, who but for her Uncles tyrannie, and the usurpation of an English Earle, had been seated on the Throne of England. At these unexpected and incredible newes, Alcidiana stood still, and earnestly regarding Pallantus, To what end (said she) tell you me these fables? What you say, cannot be, and put case it is so, how are you sure of it? I am so certaine of it reply'd Pallantus, that if this be not, there is nothing true in all the events which carry any thing of extraordinary with them. Thereupon he related the loves of Alcidus and Phelismonda, their flight into Scotland, the death of the wife, the affliction of the husband, the birth of Phelismond, the retreat of Thamiris into Denmark; and generally, all that we have written touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adventures of that admirable Favorite, and the love of the Danish Princesse. Next, he recounted, how Polexander being driven into a desolate Island, there met with that Princesse, and learnt from her the cause why she had abandon'd her fathers Kingdome. At last (said he) Helismena hearing of Phelismond's change, imbarked her selfe with the Embassadors that Prince had sent towards your Majestie, and had the happinesse that after two moneths saile, she safely came to Copenhagen. Assoone as Phelismond heard of it, he came not as a King, but as the Guardian of the royaltie to receive Helismena, and render her all the honour a subject owes to his Soveraigne. He declared, that he sate not in the Throne, but to preserve for her the place which her birth and the peoples votes had given her; and in case she were assail'd, to defend her against all aspirers and usurpers. Helismena answered these civilities, not with words, but with teares, sighes, swoundings: she was (without perceiving it) carried to the castle, and the Prince your brother despoiling himselfe absolutely of all tokens of royaltie, made divers declarations, to let the Danes understand, that he pretended to no other part in their State, then what an affectionate compatriot might lay claime to. But his generousnesse won nothing on the minde of Helismena, nor the opinion of the people; the more Phelismond strove to make himselfe a private man, the more was he settled in the regall authoritie. The Queene who liv'd not but by the sight of that amiable Prince, even besought him on her knees, to comply somewhat with the excesse of her love, and accept with her Crowne, the utmost proofes she could give him of her affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. At last, Phelismond yeelded to Helismena's intreaties, and assuring her he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted not the title of King, but to gaine to himselfe the meanes of serving her, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, with the consent and joy of all Denmarke. A few dayes after the wedding, I arriv'd at Copenhagen, and making my selfe knowne for one of your Majesties Slaves,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:54727:307"/>
I receiv'd such entertainment both from the King and Queen, that the greatest Kings of the world would have had cause to rest satisfied with it. So indeed, Madam, was it to prime Princesse of the universe that these honors were done; and I was considered as a person your Majesty design'd to make use of, to make you ador'd by all the world. The King and Queen of Denmark, keeping me there neere two moneths, I besought them for my convey. They granted it me, but very loathly, and loading me with Presents and Letters, intreated me to indeare them in the honour of your favour. Those were the terms they both used, to intimate to me the desire they had to be beloved of you. I left your picture with the Queen, sore against my will, for I intended never to leave it: but her intreaties, earnest s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ing, and if I dare speake all, pleasing violence, carried it at last, in spight of my obstinacie. Assoone as I was under saile, I comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my pilot to touch at no place whatsoever, till we came to the Island of the Sunne, because I hop'd to find Linceus there, and by his meanes returne to your Majestie: but being gotten on this side the Canaries we met with a storme, which put us by our course, and when it was over, we were set on by two great men of warre. Long was our fight, and furious; my cannon suncke one of the enemies ships; the other came up close to mine and fir'd her, but some of my souldiers did the like to theirs. Upon this reciprocall firing we separated; the winde then and the combustible matter in our ships increasing the flame spight of all our labour to quench it, we saw one another pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing by a new and fearfull kind of combat. I had given my selfe for dead (Madam) when the vincible Araxes came to my succour; and knowing I belong'd to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, had such care of me, as it put among the number of the greatest testimonials he will ever shew you of his zeale. How now Pallantus! (said Alcidiana) you are then bewitch'd aswell as the rest, and by the attribute of Invincible which you have cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given the African Slave, you would have me beleeve, that there is no way to save my selfe but by his valour? Your Majestie may give me leave, if you please (reply'd Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus) to explaine my words, and to say, that my intention was not to tie your safetie to Araxes valour. But considering what he hath already done, and what he is resolv'd to doe, assoone as his wound will permit him to leave his chamber; let me take the boldnesse to tell your Majesty, that without doubt, you will owe to the great courage of that African, the ruine of your enemies, and the re-establishment of your authority. I am not of your opinion (reply'd the Queene angerly,) goe, and if you be yet Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantus, have better thoughts. Pallantus much astonish'd, retir'd; and the Queene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Amintha by the hand, continued her walke: they were in the garden till 'twas farre within night, and Polexander was the onely subject of their discourse. Alcidiana at last, having her minde farre more wearied then her body, withdrew; and kept her bed foure daye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, to frame absolutely an intention of dying, in case shee saw her selfe constrain'd to take Araxes for her husband. On the evening of the fourth day Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diotez came to the palace, and making knowne he had businesse of importance to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the Queene, was brought to her bed-side: he told her, that Araxes being resolv'd to execute some great enterprise, it was thought fit to have publike Oraizons, and to get to the Temple to celebrate such sacrifices as were appointed on the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. That he came to beseech her Majestie to approve of the Clergy's deliberation, and since she was obliged to be at that Ceremonie, as having with the royall Character that of the Soveraigne sacrificature, it would please her to make ready betime, and give that testimonie of love to the necessitie of her State. Alcidiana gave consent to his request, and calling for her dressing Ladies, told them what she would weare the next day. At breake of day she arose, and tooke on a robe of black silke, open before and on the sleeves, and to be clos'd with diamond buttons; her head dressing was not extraordinary; she put on a vaile of blacke tiffiny, border'd with pearles, and fast'ned with a little Crown of diamonds, which ended in a point on the top of her head. As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as she was attir'd, she went to the Temple of Wisdome, and parting thence with a most royall pomp, went to another, which her predecessors had caus'd to be built, and call'd it the Temple of divine assistance. The Ceremonie was long and faire, and all the people meeting there, shewed by their earnestnesse and offerings, that the time of calamity is truly the time of Heaven. Though the Priest-hood had for a while
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:54727:308"/>
been separated from the royaltie, yet was it not so absolutely, but there remain'd some functions to the Kings. Therefore assoon as the Chief-Prelate had ended the accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med praiers, he presented a golden Censor to the Queen, and marching before her, went to the High Altar. Alcidiana kneeled down on the steps, and having a composition of perfumes on the burning coales, made a long praier for the diverting of heavens mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for the continuance of its favour to her Subjects, and subverting and driving thence their publique and bloody enemies, And lastly for the preservation of him which it had sent for their defence. After she had ended her praier, all the people confirm'd it by their acclamations and applauses, and so went out of the Temple blessing the Queen, and waited on her to the Palace, with such testimonies of affection as were farre beyond all that had preceeded. As she entred the second Court of her palace, Diceus who had plotted that action with his Master, presented himselfe, and humbly besought her to have pity on a Canarian who had lately escap'd out of the Spanish fleet. Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana was so troubled and diverted, that shee took no heed to what the man said. But Amintha who attended her, thought she should know the Supplicant, and staid to look on him. Ah madam! (said Diceus) if the memorie of a personage whom you have somtimes affected, be yet deare to you, have compassion on that miserable estate whereto his losse hath reduc'd me. Amintha knowing Diceus by his voice better then by his countenance, and unable to suppresse that violent passion which she alwaies had in any thing concerning Polexander. How, Diceus, (cri'd shee) art thou yet alive? Arise and follow me. Alcidiana at Amyntha's noise turned her head, and saw the Lady talking to Diceus, but not imagining whom he might be, kept on her way and retir'd to her chamber; where she presently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>eil on a Couch, and commanding all to withdraw, fell to her usuall reveries. An houre after she awoak and call'd Amintha. They told her she was gone. Let her be fetch'd hither (said she) and after that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement fell again into her former imaginations. Amintha came presently after, and approaching the Queen, your Majestie (said she) may be knowes not the man who this morning fell at your feet. The Queen answering that shee had not taken notice of him, 'Twas (said Amintha) that faithfull servant of Polexander who was only with him when he was murthered by Astramadans Subjects. He was about to tell me in what manner hee escaped after his Masters death, and by what accident hee arriv'd in this Island, when your Majestie vouchsafed the honour to send for mee. At these words, Alcidiana coming as it were out of a deep sleep, How (said she) is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus here? O you thou lov'st me, Amyntha, let me see him. The recitall he will make me of his Masters death will serve me for a great diversion. A sad and dismall diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, replid' Amyntha. I doe not think Diceus can relate any thing more particularly to you then I have done. 'Tis all one (said the Queen) I shall be glad to see him, and hear the reproaches he will throw on me for the death of his Master. Hee hath been too well bred (repli'd Amintha) to take such libertie as shall not please you. I am in such an humour (said the Queen) that whatsoever he shall say, will not be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please me. Therefore without losing more time, let me see him. With that, Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha making a low reverence went out of the chamber, and calling for a Squire, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go call Diceus. The Squire obey'd the command, and Diceus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after entring the Queenes chamber, Amintha brought him where she lay, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana trembled at his sight, and finding her selfe more troubled th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Diceus continuing on his kneees though the Queen bad him arise; Madam, said he, my Master dy'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your Majestie thought his life was not worth the preserving. Neither his life nor death depended on my will repli'd the Queen. The will of your Majestie (said Diceus) hath alwayes had more power over him, then that soveraign law on which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the destinie of all other men. It seemes then by what thou saiest (answered the Queen) that thou wouldst make me guiltie of thy Masters death. Heaven (said Diceus) who can make us immortall, was never accus'd (but by blasphemers) for confining the course of our life to so short a date: Nor hath the King my Master, (who alwaies look'd on you (though not as a Deity, (yet as its living image) otherwise then with a benediction, receiv'd the sentence of death you pronounc'd against him. And the last time

he did me the honour to speake to me; Diceus (said he) let my death come when it will, I will take it for a speciall favour from heaven, since 'tis the onely thing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ll the voyages he undertook, to have the happinesse of continuing to you the testimonialls of his most humble Servitude. I should condemne my Declaration (answered the Queen) though it were justly done, if it hastened the death of your Master. But 'twas his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and not Alcidiana that slew him. Hee thought himselfe immortall as he was invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; and judging of his enemies by himselfe, imagin'd there was none base enough to commit a murther. Hee had too much loved life, (said Diceus) or to speake better, he had been as he was, the superstitious observer of your commands, if he had thought on the preservation of a life which he knew pleas'd you not. He is dead Madam, and died the more happily since he was perswaded in dying, he should give you a strong and unquestionable proofe of the greatnesse of his love and obedience. These last words touch'd Alcidiana to the heart, so that spight of her selfe she sigh'd; and feeling her teares in her eies, turn'd her head towards Amintha, that her too lively resentment might not be perceiv'd. Assoon as her amorous teares were wip'd off, she beganne again, and would know of Diceus by what meanes he sav'd himselfe after the death of his Master. I will not relate to your Majestie (said he) for what cause the King my Master came to the Isle of Astramadan. Amintha was by when he was ingag'd to sight with him; and I doubt not but she hath entertain'd your Majestie with it. I will therefore content my selfe with the narration of the most strange and diversified Combate that ever was seen since weapons have been us'd. He related how Polexander had sent to defie Astramadan, with how many Knights he had to do, till he came to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>die stroakes with the Gyant; in brief, all that which we have descri'd at large here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. But when he came to that part wherein we spoke of Tisiphone's arrivall, and the firing of Astramadans City; I had (said he to the Queen) the honour that day to serve my Master in the place of his Squire; and to doe somewhat worthy my new quality; assoon as the Tyrants Guard assail'd the King, I fell in amongst them, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>s so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, that I was beat down, cover'd with wounds before that multitude of murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had overthrowne the greatest valour of the world: I was a great while ere I came to my selfe again; but at last recollecting my spirits, and seeing all our enemies laid all o're the field, I crawl'd to finde out the bodie of my Master. Me thought I heard him groan, and got to him, and disingaging him from under a many bodies, took off his cask and the rest of his armes: Assoon as he had taken aire, his senses came to him, but he was so weak, and so wounded, that he could not possibly rise. Presently I took some earth which was very soft, being all soak'd with blood, and stopping his greatest wounds with it, brought him to a little more strength. With much pain he arose; so did I; and helping one another, got out of that unfortunate place by the meanes of the tumult and fire. But how (said Amintha interrupting him) did not Polexander dye in the place of Combate? No Madam (repli'd Diceus) he escap'd that great danger, and should not be a languishing and wandring Ghost as he is now, if he had not receiv'd more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous wounds then those were given him in that detestable occasion. When I had lead him out of the town, and brought him to the Sea side; Whither shall we go, said he? Let's make an end of a thing that is so well forwarded; and since it is forbidden me by Alcidiana her selfe for ever to pretend to the happinesse of seeing her again; let us Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceus, let us shut up those eyes, which can serve mee in no stead but to make me see what a miserable man I am. 'Twas then (repli'd Alcidiana hastily) that Polexander died? Could he dye better Madam, (repli'd Diceus) then to dye not by the wounds <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

'Tis enough (said Alcidiana:) and in saying so, she would not conceale from Diceus the teares which griefe forc'd from her eyes. And he, unwilling to lose so faire an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:54727:309"/>
to further his Masters affaires: O! too pretious teares to be lost (cri'd he) why have you not already rais'd again Polexander? Wheresoever his faire soule straies, she feeles your virtue, and I doubt it not but she will returne and joine againe with his bodie, if she could know for truth that 'twas their separation which had drawne you from the eyes of Alcidiana. Believe it Diceus, (said the Queen heartily sobbing) and assure thy selfe, that if the moi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y of my life could recall Polexanders, I would give it with all my heart. That Prince (Madam, repli'd Diceus) shall rise again since you will have it so; or rather he will dye once more, if he know 'tis for his sake that your Majestie is so much discontented. Alcidiana, unable to give any interpretation to Diceus last words, then what in all likelyhood they ought to have took them for a true, exaggeration of that love which Polexander yet preserv'd for her even in his Sepulchre. She then dismissed Diceus and told him she desir'd he would serve her. After he had given her humble thankes, and spent the rest of the day in the Palace or with Amintha, he secretly got out of the Towne assoon as it was night, and hastened to the King his Master. To him he related the happie successe of his journey, and made him so plainly see how much Alcidiana lov'd him, that Polexander fear'd to offend the Princesse, if he persever'd in in the ill opinion he had of his fortune. But presently feare, blotting out of his Soule that which hope had trac'd there: Thou deceiv'st us both, said he to Diceus. The love thou bear'st me hath assuredly made thee give a too favorable construction to the Queenes words. Didst thou not look on her angry eyes, as if they had been pitifull; or take that melancholy which appeares in the face of such as we importune, for the compassion thou wouldst faine perswade me to? Art thou certaine she wept? Didst thou surely heare her sigh? Canst thou secure me that my life shall not discontent her? Thou answerest not Diceus! Art thou (to my greater misfortune) better informed now, then when thou gavest me so great assurances? Sir (repli'd his faithfull Servant) your thoughts will never leave being ingenious in persecuting you: They eternally doubt the truth of all good which betides you; and the onely appearances of ill passe with them for most certain realties. Yes Sir, Alcidiana loves you, and I believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she repents the rigour she hath shewne you; because she bewailes your death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she respects any thing that puts her in mind of you; and finally, because Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha hath often sworne to me, that the verie moment she heard newes of your death, shee made a vow to end her life in a rigorous kind of widow-hood. Ah! 'tis too much (Diceus) repli'd our Heroe, I now believe my selfe to be happie; but I must by some important service make my selfe worthie of being so. Presently he resolv'd to disturb that rest which his indisposition had lent his enemies, to hinder their going on, and by a generall assault to let them know that the winning of Eliza was very ill assur'd them. At breake of day, he was abroad in the Fort, and calling all the officers of the Armie together, to make them capable of a thing which till then he could not propose to any; Told them, there was newes come to him touching the Spaniards; and that they only expected to be assaulted, to gaine an honest pretext for forsaking the Towne, and to put themselves under saile. All the hardie Islanders beleev'd what he had spoken; and by what had pass'd judging of the future, thought that Araxes as inspired from the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which had sent him, could undertake nothing but what he was assur'd of the succes. Every one therefore preparing himselfe for so daring an action, they sent Rhadiotez newes of it. He presently hastened to the Palace to informe the Queen, but perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be in an extraordinarie insensibility for what so much concern'd her, he thought it fit to treat her as some sicke person, whose violent disease and the distaste of remedies had depriv'd of all desire of life. Hee caus'd all the best troopes in the Town to march forth, sent Artillerie to the Fort, and having almost all the day executed the charge of Generall of an Armie, imploy'd all the rest in the functions of his Priesthood. Orders was given for prayers, and the Temples were open all night long. Mothers carried thither their children, as innocent offerings they pretended to heaven to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease its anger, and to obtaine out of pitie an end of their calamities. Polexander, in the mean while unwilling the enemie should know his designe, beate them all night with the Canon. The Peeces in the Barges, and on the Caus-way, shot continually, and hid by the thicknesse of the smoake those Troopes which march'd towards the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:54727:309"/>
Towne. At breake of day, two thousand men came before it. Twelve peeces of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which had been planted in the night began to beate their defences, and two Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tards were stucke by the incredible resolution of twentie determinate Soldiers on a gate that opened to the ditch. They did their effect, and presently those that were to fall on, got into the ditch with ladders, and though the most of them were lost; yet the rest wonne the gate, and there planted Alcidiana's rising Phenix. The feigned A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raxes sent fresh supplies to preserve what the first had gained, and himselfe leading the way, lodg'd them in the forc'd gate. But when he saw beyond it an intrenchment har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be carried then the ditch; he re-intrench'd himselfe against the Town, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way better, then to keep what he had so well advanced. Presently he commanded the ditch to be fill'd with Bavines, to throw a bridge over, and to bring on ten or twelve Peeces to beate off the enemie. The fight lasted as long as day, and above twelve hundred men fell on the place. Whil'st this was doing in the lower town, there happened great disorders in the upper. A murmure and noise whose Author could not be knowne, gave an alarme to all the Inhabitants. All cri'd out that the Spaniards had receiv'd a mightie supply; that Araxes had the worst in his assault; that he had not won the Towne; and that all these miseries had their source from the Queenes retarding the execution of the Prophesie, and the expresse command of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. These murmures were seconded by menaces, and colour'd with so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reasons, that the Magistrates and Rhadiotez himselfe were forc'd to allow of the sedition. The Queene (said these Mutineers) who is certain in all extremitie, that a composition will bring her out of all that danger in which wee shall be inveloped, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects our prayers, and remonstrances; sees with a dry eye, the teares of so many Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents which implore her goodnesse, and seemes to have destin'd for her ransome, our goods, our lives, and the honour of our wives. If the remedie which we propound to her for the common safety, were a remedie invented by our selves, she might have reason to contemne it, either as dangerous, or unprofitable. But being prescrib'd by heaven, and writ by the hand of the Author and preserver of all things; can she refuse it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an expresse testimoniall either of an extreame neglect of the Divinity, or as great a hatred against her Subjects? Rhadiotez, to appease them, promis'd to go to the Queene, and to let her know they were loyally intentioned. Wee will go with you, (cry'd the seditious) and if reason be not able enough to perswade the Queene, wee will bring number, and force to assist her. Rhadiotez, did all he could, to go without so many followers; yet thinking it not fitting to incense any further the furious mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he put himselfe in the front, and sent word of it to the Queene. When shee heard the newes, she was almost beside herselfe; but the extremitie of scorne and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, depriving her of sense and reason, she stood a while as immoveable. Amintha who was by her, intreated, she would force herselfe, and not give her enemies the contentment, to see that she contributed to her ruine as much as themselves; but that she would at last take on her a resolution worthie her birth and virtue. It is taken (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd the Queene with a setled countenance) it is taken Amintha. I will dye; and though my People be unthankfull, yet I will save them in expiring, As she spoke these words Rhadiotez entred her chamber, and though he had spoke nothing, yet did he sufficiently make knowne by his pace and countenance that he brought very ill newes. What father (said the Queene without any dismay) you come to tell me of my subjects rebellion, and to advise me to submit to what they demand. No such matter, (repli'd the Prelate) but I come from them to make an humble petition to your Majestie, and to beseech you by that goodnesse which is so naturall to you, and by that Soveraigne power which reignes in heaven, to take pity on a great number of weake and unarmed persons, who see themselves readie to be given in prey to the utmost furie of their mercilesse enemies. O! Let your Majestie be therefore pleased to harken to the cryes of so many mothers, and children, so many virgins, and widowes, old men, and fearfull; and to stop their complaints, imitate those good Princes, which have ountarily forgot themselves to thinke of nothing else but the preservation of their Subjects. From the eternall Justice we all hope that your Majestie shall not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer by doing a good Act; and that the Prophesie which promiseth you so many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:54727:310"/>
if you can subdue your selfe, shall not be lesse true in this particular then in all the rest. With much adoe, Alcidiana (not making shew of her perplexitie) repli'd. Tell me then, what is't my subjects would have of me? That which the voice of heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, (answered straight Rhadiotez.) Yes Father said the Queene, I will doe all that is commanded me, Long since the cryes of my people have gone through my cares to my heart. I am sensible of every ones particular miserie, and may say, that I alone suffer all that the fathers, and husbands suffer in severall. If to stoppe the current of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> common calamities, there needed but the parting with my crowne, I would be the first should take it off my head; and if (to it) there be required the losse of my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie or life, I am readie to undergoe the one, and to lay down the other. After she had spoke thus, she gave Rhadiotez time to render her thankes in the name of her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Hee be sought her, as he had petition'd already, to preserve her-selfe for them, not to shew the subject her affection by deliberations, which would be no otherwise then sad and mournfull unto them; and to believe, that on her life, and peace, neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily depended their lives and tranquillity. See then (father, said the Queene) what is fitting for me to doe: But if any remainder of respect keeps me yet considerable, let me not be obliged to any thing that is unworthy of me. In the mean time return to those that sent you, relate my resolution, and wish them without clamour, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult to advise for their own safety. After this the good Prelate retir'd to the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and surious multitude; and making knowne what he had done with the Queen, got them to retreat, and expect till the next day the execution of the Princesse will. By his good words the mutineers (being thus calm'd) promis'd aloud, that if they were not forc'd to it by an extream necessity, they would not presse at all the accomplishment of the Prophesie. Night now shutting up every one within his owne doores, the upper Towne was all hush'd, but the lower was in an uproare. Polexander had lead many troopes into the enemies intrenchments, and had forc'd them as he had done the rest, if his soldiers gall'd with the Canon had not been forc'd to shelter themselves behinde the Gabions. Each partie was all night in armes, and continued their vollyes and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes till breake of day: When the Spaniards seeing themselves threatned by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the Inhabitants in the lower towne, and fearing to be involved, resolv'd to drive Polexander from what he had fallen into. To that end, they planted on the top of their intrenchment five Cannons, which for three houres together never left shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Foure Towers and a great Pavillion which made up the Entry Polexander had wonne, were beaten to dust; the place where he was lodg'd laid open, and many of his men buried under the ruines, or maimed with the slattering of the stones, or the walls r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ptures. The Spaniards were paid well backe againe: For our Heroe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ageously planting his Canon, beat their houses about their cares, and ten Pieces charg'd with chayne-shot, being planted along the intrenchment, cut off all those that undertook to fall on Alcidiana's troopes. That whole day almost passing thus, a little before night they descry'd above an hundred saile on the Lake. The Inhabitants of the upper towne imagining them to be the supply which their enemies expected, were strucken with their former terrour, and ran out of their houses with terrible outcries, and extreame confusion. Some betooke them to their armes, others flew away from them. In this moment, the streets were so full, that men were readie to be stifled, and in the turne of a hand after they were all emptie, and no creature to be seen. The Market places, and Temples, filled withold men, women, and children, resounded with lamentations, and every where wandred the image of death, and despaire. See what 'tis (said they) to wrong the blessings of heaven, and to neglect the meanes of our safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Every man would have witness'd his respect and obsequiousnesse to the Queen, and every one confess'd that their respect and complaisancy had loft them. If yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the Queene had been forc'd to doe that which now they must be obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell her, she might have been already freed from this violence, and the publik secur'd of the successe of a businesse which now may chance to have but an ill issue, because it was so long deserr'd. Whil'st one part of the people was talking thus, and the other gotten to the Palace gates, calling for the Queene, and threatning to take her thence, Rhadiotez and Amintha were with the Princesse, intreating her to beare with the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:54727:310"/>
infirmities of her subjects; to pardon their rashnesse, their indiscretion, their revolt; and to weigh, to how many other violences the extremitie of feare is able to hurrie weake minds. Alcidiana, appearing full of an extraordinarie Majestie: I intend not (said she) to deferre the contenting my people. Goe you father (said shee to Rhadio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez) and tell them, that precisely at midnight I will depart my Palace and goe to the Temple of Wisdome. The good man, loath to debate more particularly with the Queene, for feare of offending her, caus'd the Palace gates to be opened, suffred all to enter that would, and publishing by a Herauld his Princesses will, went to prepare himselfe for an action, which his judgement aswell as his loyaltie assur'd him would be as glorious for his Queene, as advantageous for her Subjects; shee had not the same thoughts: For being retir'd into her closet, (onely with Amintha) sh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a little Cabinet, and taking out a Poniard; See (said she without any emotion) that which shall disingage my word, and deliver me from all prepar'd Slavery. Yes Amintha, I will dye, but not till by the accompishment of the Prophesie, I have laid an eternall foundation for my peoples felicity. Thinke not to stay mine arme either by your teares, or remonstrances. If you have truly lov'd me, you will approve my reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of being stil Mistris of my selfe. And if Polexanders memory doe any way touch you, you may be glad to see mee labour so couragiously for the preservation of that which hath been so dear unto him. Let us prepare our selves therefore seriously for the most important, and considerable of our actions. Let us on bravely to the end of our miseries. Leave wee not our fetters sadly, but believe that the life which wee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hereafter, is too glorious and of more blisse then to make any account of that which wee are likely to loose here. And thou deare Soule, which art readie to bee remitted to thy halfe-selfe, descend from thy everlasting abode, meet with Alcidiana, be present at the Sacrifices shee is at the point to offer, and judge by the last act of her life the intention of all those that have preceeded. After these words, she went to her Ladies, and carrying in her countenance a gaity, and extraordinarie calme, told them (smiling) that at last the day was come wherein shee was to submit her selfe to the power of a man. Let therefore (said shee) every one prepare her selfe for this solemnity; but with moderation, for too much magnificence, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, will not be approv'd of such wretches as shalbe witnesses of this fatall action. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she declar'd by these words, in what manner she would have her Ladies, and Maides to be dress'd for the Ceremony, she attir'd herselfe as she was wont to be on the dayes consecrated to the memorie of the Kings her predecessors. Assoon as shee was free from this necessary amusement, she commanded that all those that were to attend her should be readie before midnight; and to that end dismissing all that were in her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, shee entred her closet with Amintha. That Lady extreamly afflicted for the Queenes resolution, began to look on her with such eyes as spoke enough that which her mouth durst not utter; and falling (at last) at her Mistris feet, was even there like to have taken her last gaspe. Alcidiana seeing her in that extremitie, rais'd her up; and after a many times kissing her: What (said she) is become of that brave spirit which hath so courageously brought you through rape, exile, imprisonment, and more insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable miseries? Whither is that Constancy fled, which hath withdrawne me many and many a time from those precipices which mine owne weakenesse hath hewen out? Whence is it, that Amintha is no more what she was, and why indeavours shee to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me from what she hath so often advis'd me? Is not a speedy death farre better then a languishing life? And where shall the miserable find comfort, but in shortnesse of their tortures? No, no Amintha, the resolution I have taken, is not such as you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it. It hath nothing of sad and dismall but in appearance. The interior is brave, pleasant, alluring, and delightfull. 'Tis true, I quit my Crowne, and quit it in the eighteenth yeare of my life; but to consider things aright, what is a Crowne? What is Youth? And if you will, what is Beauty? Surely nothing but so many extream subtile, and almost inevitable snares to draw us into mischiefe. I have liv'd long enough A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha, since (if selfe love deceive me not) I thinke I have reasonably well imploy'd all the moments of my life. But (if I may be permitted to speake more) I say, I have liv'd too long, since I have surviv'd Polexander. Amintha finding by the excesse of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54727:311"/>
resentment, that speech which the same excesse had taken from her: Then (said shee) you are resolv'd to dye. That beautie, which heaven admires as its Master-piece, must even in its birth be the prey of steel and death: and that wonderfull wit which hath confounded the wisdome of the Ancient, and the subtilty of Philosophers, must now turne its weapons on it selfe; and meeting with nothing that can vanquish it, denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a warre against it selfe, because it would not be still invincible. Come Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, come, and relieve Alcidiana, if there yet remaine any thing of thee. Imploy that power which men attribute to Soules freed from their bodies, in averting a blow whereat Nature it self trembles; and if the fear of being anothers then thine, puts the steele into thy Princesses hand, free the world from the cause of that apprehension. Alcidiana smiling at Amintha's exclamations, you (said she) shall be heard, for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander loves us too well to abandon us in this extremitie. The Princesse spoke truth unawares, for at the same instant when Amintha invok'd him to the ayde of Alcidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana he was mightily labouring the ruine of her enemies. Hee had discovered an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Aqueduct under the ditch, by which in all likelyhood the water of a fountain in the upper towne was convey'd to the lower. But time had ruin'd part of the Vault, and buried the knowledge of it under the same earth which cover'd it. A Pioneer first discover'd this meanes to get into the towne, and secretly gave notice of it to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, who presently going to se the Vault, made it be search'd, and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it went through the enemies intrenchments, attended patiently till the night were well come on to convey some companies that way, and so more easily worke his ends of the Spaniards. That which made him the more to hasten it, was the arrivall of the Fleet on the Lake, on the side of the upper towne. They had cast anchor a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore night, and ranged themselves along the shore, no man knowing whether they were friends, or foes. The Inhabitants of Eliza who had never seen the like there, certainly beleev'd they were Spanish ships; and on that belief grounding their absolute ruine, hastened as much as in them lay the marriage of Alcidiana with Araxes, as the onely refuge they were to flye to in their calamities, and the last remedy they could get for them. Rhadiotez, whom they had not forsaken, and from whom at every moment they demanded with threatnings, the accomplishment of his promises, was compell'd to find out Araxes at the beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ning of the night. He related to him at large the particulars of the fatall Prophesie, the Mutiny, and all the Elizians desires, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the Queenes last resolution. Polexander had not so ill a servant of Diceus, nor so little intelligence of that which pass'd at Court, but he knew alreadie part of what Rhadiotez had told him. Yet he made semblance to know nothing of it, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the incertainty of most predictions, condemn'd the Elizians proceedings, and above all, intreated the Chief-priest to go to the Queene, and beseech her in his name that shee would not so farre forget herselfe, as to share her Crowne, and life, with the most unknowne and miserable of men. Rhadiotez admir'd the virtue of our feigned Slave, and fixing on his last words told him, that his moderation, and the respect hee bore the Queene merited an infinite applause; and if time would give him leave, he would goe and fully make it knowne to the Queene, and free her from the remaines of aversion and feare. But (said he) the multitude, more urgent then time, will not admit of this delay. They are in armes at the gates of the towne, and the Palace, and if at the stroke of midnight they see you not in the Temple of wisdome; prepare your selfe for the most horrible spectacle, that the furie of a desperate multitude is able to bebloudy the Chronicle of their owne times withall, or affright all ensuing ages. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander answering the Prelate, that this disaster was to be prevented, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe he was readie to obey; dismiss'd him with an assurance that he would march on with the first command he reciv'd from him or the Queene. Assoon as Rhadiotez was gone, Polexander retir'd with Diceus, related to him the state of his affaires, and shewing him a timidity which onely love could justifie, seem'd no lesse irrationall then the very multitude which he but newly condemned. But Diceus o're-throwing all his scruples, and nullifying all his difficulties, advis'd him to be present in all pompe at the glorious assignation, and by a happy deceit, terminate for ever his owne misfortunes and the Queenes discontents. Thou knowest Diceus (repli'd Polexnder) through how
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:54727:311"/>
many tempests, and shipwracks I have sought for the haven thou shewest me, and would even have bought the sight of it with my bloud and life. Thou knowest whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in these twenty dayes that I have been in the Inaccessible Island, my desires and actions have tended to any other end, then the advancing the happie moment wherein I was to be inlightned by that incomparable starre which hath so long time not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to shine on me. Yet me thinkes, I know not what feare, which seems just to me, congeale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> my bloud, slackens my longings, disavowes my former wishes, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing me to my selfe of subtilty, and treasons, threatens me with some new misfortune if I dare present my selfe before Alcidiana. 'Tis a suggestion (said Diceus) which the ill Angell of your quiet, throwes into you. Reject it boldly, and without losing time (which should be better imploy'd) in unprofitable deliberations, prepare your selfe to receive this night the Crowne of your travells; and perseverance. Polexander, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished by a perswasion which so pleasingly flattered his inclination, resolv'd to obey his servant. But before he would leave the lower towne, he reinforc'd his guards, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> places he had wonne, dispos'd of all things in such sort that hee doubted not but at his returne to put his great designe in execution; and left the command of the troups to Alcidiana's Lievtenant Generall. The orders given, he went to the Fort, and shutting himself into his chamber, was there clad, according to Diceus intention more then his owne. A very rich suite he put on, with the chaines given him by the King of Ghenoa, and was forc'd to weare the long p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ple cloak, imbrodered with gold, and pearles which hee had presented him from the Priests of the Sun, as their Prince and Defender. But he had no sooner put it on, but his Guard came and told him that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two thousand men were in armes on the Counter-scarfe of the Moate, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated a great desire to see him. Let's goe to them (said he) turning to Diceus, and make our prayers to Love, and Fortune, for our good successe. With that he went out of the Fort to meet the Inhabitants of Eliza: Hee chid them, but very wisely, for the violence they offered their Princesse, and in the very instant assuring them, that in foure and twentie houres the Island should be rid of the Spaniards; made them breake out into such loud and reiterated showtes of joy, that they were heard in the Temple whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alcidiana was to come. Assoon as she heard it strike midnight she arose from a bed whereon she had all alone entertain'd her-selfe, and forbidding Amintha the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of her teares, and lamentations: 'Tis at this time (said she to her) that it shall be seen whether Alcidiana, and Philosophie, have not too much presum'd of themselves. In the mean while, advertise Diceus of my resolution, that he may be in the Temple, for I desire he should be present at the last act of my life, and that the same eyes which were witnesses of Polexanders death, may be so of Alcidiana's. Amintha repli'd, that for two dayes she had been so perplext, that she did not so much as think of him whom she spoke of. I thought so, said the generous Queene, and therefore I would quicken your memorie of him. Cause the man to be found out, and forsake him not when I shall be no more in case to assist him. At those words Amintha began to weep again; but Alcidiana intimating she desired other proofs of her affection, absolutely forbad her to be sorrowfull, and presently taking up her poniard, put it under her robe, with such an indifferencie, and coldnesse, as were worthy to be consider'd as somthing more heroick then all the height of magnanimity. Amintha was ravish'd with wonder at it, and from thence only conjecturing of unlikely prosperities, suddenly lost the terrour of what was to be executed, and even solicited the Queen to hasten to the Temple of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome as fast as she could. The Princesse noted this alteration without making shew of it, and coming out of her Closet found all her Ladies ready; but all rather drest for a funerall then a marriage. Alcidiana would not make known that she took any notice of it, and went into her chambers of Ceremonie, where all the chief officers of her house and Rhadiotez were assembl'd. They presented themselves before her with such counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as made it well seen there was nothing of good to be expected of that voyage. Every man appear'd thoughtfull, and melancholy, and though Alcidiana excited every one by her gayety, none was able to suppresse his sorrow. Assoon as the Queene had given the word, they began to march, and the people who waited for her at the Palace ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>es, receiv'd her with acclamations, and applanses, which had I know not what more
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:54727:312"/>
of sadnesse, then their wonted congratulations, and rejoicings. The Queene went on foot from the Palace to the Temple, and assoon as she was entred, retir'd into a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, from whence shee usually came when shee was obliged to take the Censor, and perform some act of Soveraign Sacrificer. The Temple shone again with gold and lights, and the Scaffold on which stood the Princesses throns, was inviron'd with so many cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall Candlesticks, that when she was seated on it, the Spectators took her for a Goddesse, which was not so well hid, but that she let sparkle through the vaile she had on, some rayes of her Divinity. Presently after Polexander, clad as I have describ'd, came to the temple. Diceus bore up the train of his royal robe, and four black slaves part of his chains. No sooner had the peoples showt given notice of his coming, but the crowd separated, and the Queens guard made away from the principal gate of the Temple, to the Queens throne. From as far off as she saw him she cast down her eies, and leaning on one of the arms of her chair, began in good ernest to contest with flesh and bloud, and call'd to her aid all the faculties of her soul. In the mean while, not only the people, but the Court cast their eies on the pretended slave, and as he advanc'd, a kind of humming noise witness'd the admiration, or impatience of the Spectators. The Ladies above all had their eies fix'd on him, and even those which look'd on with an aversion, could not chuse but speak of him with astonishment. They all confess'd, they never saw a more admirable personage, and said, it was incredible that Africa, nay, Africa the most monstrous, could produce so compleat a creature. His stature, countenance, sweetnesse, majestie, his head, his eyes; in briefe, all that they saw of him bely'd the common report, and made strange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions in the passions of most of the Ladies. Amintha her selfe, who had made a vow not to look on Araxes, had not power to refraine, but assoon as she heard the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall admiration, desir'd to have part in the contentment, and cast her eyes on the feigned Slave with so much curiosity, that infallibly she had knowne him, but for the infinite number of lights, which reflecting their lustre on all parts, depriv'd her of the meanes of well regarding him. The old Stenelica calling to mind her last love, and the pleasure shee took in his being pleasant with her, no sooner saw him, but shee knew who 'twas. Her eyes, though weakned by her cares, getting heat from her heart, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions from love, those spirits of fire which inlighten the sight, were more penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, then those of younger bodies. 'Tis Polexander, (said shee to her selfe) 'tis he; and I believe it so certainly, that could I come neare the Queene, I would tell her of the treason is wrought against her. Whil'st that Lady thought thus, our Heroë came to the foot of the Princesse Scaffold, and there stood firme. Alcidiana for feare of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, kept her eyes fix'd on the people, and commanding them silence: At last (said she) all things are come to the point you have wished them. I intreat that Eternall Providence under whose beliefe you are come hither, that you may have rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the Oracle, and that by virtue of the Act whereto your only interests ingage me, you may be avenged of these strangers cruelties, free this Isle for ever from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts, and desolations of warre, and so powerfully reestablish the rule of Peace, and Justice, that your posterity may hold the present miseries but for fables, or at least for prodigies. What hinders then the accomplishment of the Prophesie? Why doth not the Arch-priest performe his charge? And who hinders the African Slave from receiving the reward which heaven hath allotted him for the redemption, and safety of you all. At that word, all the assistants began to cry out, that the State was preserved, the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers defeated, Alcidiana was victorious, and common happinesse secur'd. Rhadiotez attended with all his officers, came near the feigned Araxes, and intreated he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend the Queens Scaffold with him. Our Heroe did so, but assoone as hee was mounted, he humbly besought her to give him Audience. And assoon as she had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, he plac'd himselfe so, that he had his face alike turn'd to her, and to the people, on one knee he kneel'd, on the last degree to the throne, and addressing himselfe to the Princesse, thus bespoke her. I doe not wonder (Madam) that this Assembly shewes so little resentment of the good it receives from the excesse of your goodnesse: It is so great, that farre from being sensible of it, they are not capable of the conception; and I, who strive to imprint it in others, finde i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> so farre beyond beliefe, that I can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give credit to it my selfe. Truly, that which your Majestie hath resolv'd on for the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:54727:312"/>
preservation of your estate, is infinitly above all the examples of love, and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and succeeding times will look on it, as a fiction invented by this age, to over-whelme with shame, or despaire, all such as are to lend a hand to the helme of the worlds government. That the glorious Alcidiana should tread under foot (I must say so) her birth, her greatnesse, her renowne, her beauty; that to divert and hinder the affliction of her people, she should voluntarily make her self the most miserable of all women, and give her selfe up to the mercie of one of those monsters bred in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts of Africa; 'Tis an abasement; (Madam) 'tis an humilation; 'Tis such a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nothinging of your selfe, that your Majestie would doe farre lesse for your people, if you laid downe your life for their preservation. The notice I take of this wonder, confounds my ambition, in lieu of satisfying it; and forbids me to aspire to what in all the world is to be most ardently long'd for. But suppose this rigorous and powerfull necessity, which compells you to lessen your selfe to nothing, should use all its severity, and command to make me goe beyond that which is permitted me; I should be farre (Madam) from conforming my selfe either to the votes of the people, the seeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of your Majestie, or the very decree of Fate. Should I act it, I were Ignoble, a Traitor, and a Villaine. For I am neither Araxes, a slave, nor an African. I am Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam the unfortunate and rash Stranger—at that word Polexander was forc'd to stop, for in the instant such a horrible cry arose at the gate of the Temple, that our Heroe thought the Spaniards had surpris'd the upper towne, and came with fire and sword to destroy it. The Ceremonies were interrupted by it, the hopes of all the Assembly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confounded, the Temple fill'd with howlings, and confusion, and in a thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd, not onely of the people, but the Priests and the Queene her selfe. Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, having throwne off his long robe, broke his chaines, and drawne his sword, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Temple, and presently saw a fire, which flying over the lower towne walls, seem'd as if it would wholely consume it. Presently he made to the Fort, and from thence to the seeming-inflamed towne; but he perceiv'd the flame came from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, and straight knew 'twas part of the Spanish fleet, which were set on fire by some fire ships thrust in amongst them. Straight he sent Diceus to carry this good newes to the Queene, and to assure her that he was going to finish what fortune had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne. It held more then he promis'd her; for by the helpe of a great tmult which he heard in the lower towne, hee got slide some troopes into the enemies intrenchments, and finding them forsaken, instead of making use of the Aqueduct, he entred the town, by the way which was offred him. In the instant he had newes that the Inhabitants had taken arms against their tyrants. To sencod their resolution, he caus'd to resound again every where the word Libertie, and the name of Alcidiana; and strove to cut the enemies their passage for regaining their ships. They were intrench'd on a tongue of land, which thrust it selfe out beyond the fortifications of the towne, and whil'st one part of them made good their ground, the rest stole along the tongue of land, and hastened to their ships. Polexander perceiv'd their drift, and very loath the Strangers should vaunt they had uncorrected laid waste part of the Inaccessible Island, imbark'd two thousand men in his owne vessells, and got with them the back part of the reintrenchment. 'Twas there, where I may say the skirmish was hottest. Night added her horror to warre, and seem'd to bring on more furie to the Combatants. Day broke in the height of the skirmish; and Polexander then meeting the Prince of Sidonia, vow'd to dye, or to make him beg his life, and then send him Alcidiana's prisoner. His vow was more then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd, for the Prince of Sidonia knowing him, and desirous to be avenged for the affront he had receiv'd by his valour, came towards him with all the resolution that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred can breath into haughty courages. The Duell was long, and the victorie some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time doubtfull; but fortune now reconcil'd to Polexander, made her flye on his side, and the Prince of Sidonia lost his life, with all that he had wonne in the Inaccessible Island. His Armie sped no better: Those that scap'd the sword were made slaves, and before noon, of all that great naval Armie there was nought to be seen but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their burnt vessells. Our Heroe had but newly left the Prince of Sidon a when he met with Pallantus. He fell on his neck, and relating to him in few words all that he knew not, of his fortune: What (said he) will the Queene thinke of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise?
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:54727:313"/>
And can she perswade her selfe there is any sincerity in the Soule of him who hath made shew of so much artifice in his actions, in his discourse, nay in his very habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Ah! Pallantus, if thou worke not my peace, if thou winne not Amintha to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the defence of my affection, I see my self more miserable then ever. Go there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (dear Pallantus) and labour for my peace. 'Tis possible it may betide, that in consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the victorie the Queen hath had on her enemies, she may lend an eare to my Justifications. Make use of your eloquence on so faire an occasion; but above all, make known at large, that Fortune and Love have been the sole Authors of my disguise; and that I never heard any speak of that fatall Prophesie, which gave Alcidiana to an Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Slave, when the King of Ghenoa's amity, and mine own inclination made me take on the marks and title of a Slave. If Polexander would have talk'd till the morning, I think Pallantus would not have interrupted him, for he was so transported from his self, that he scarce knew who spoke, or where he was. At last our Heroe made him recollect his Spirits. He came again, and held long time his eyes fix'd on Polexander, as if he had suspected his eares, and willingly would know, whether the one would confirme the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which the other would have perswaded him. Though he saw himself fully satisfi'd, yet he persever'd in his doubts, and look'd for Polexander in Polexander. What (said he) you live then, and are not the Slave born in the depths of Africa, for whose valour heaven reserv'd the safety of this Kingdome. Yes, (said our Heroe) I live, and am a slave come out of Africa. But I am not so happy, nor so valiant to believe, that the safety of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome such as this is, should be reserv'd for me. You are (repli'd Pallantus) both too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and valiant then needs to accomplish so great a businesse, but I place not on that the height of your felicity. I fix it on this, that Providence it self (who from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had destin'd you to the government of this Kingdom) hath lead you to it, by wayes so faire, and ordinarie. I suffer not my self to be dazeled by my friends flatteries, (repli'd Polexander) I know mine owne value, and what I ought to hope for; and if you will give me leave to declare my mind freely, I shall tell you (dear Pallantus) that the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est pretention I have is, that my service may at last obtain me (from Alcidiana) the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to weare her chains, and to watch for her amongst her Slaves. This converse had lasted longer but for Diceus coming in. Assoon as Polexander saw him, he step'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ask'd (with a trembling voice) if he had had the honour to see the Queen. I newly came from her (reply'd Diceus) and bring such newes as may much amaze you. Pallantus thinking Diceus would not speak before him made a semblance to withdraw, but our Heroe staying him by the arme; You (said he) shall wrong me if you imagine that that I am distrustfull of your discretion. Do you not know that you have undertaken to justifie me to the Queen, and how can you do it, unlesse you know how she is dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and what thoughts Diceus hath put in her? Tell us (said he to his servant) what you have done. Diceus dissembling his joy, Before (said he) I acquit my self of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you impos'd on me, I thought it fitting to visit Amintha. I went to her lodging, and met her as she was entring. No sooner had she an eye on me, but she came forward, and feigning to be all in choler: What Diceus (said she) you have been capable of this treason? and Polexander could conceale from me a thing wherein I might so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally serve him? Surely you have both done very fairly. Now see for some body that may repair the faults you have committed. Madam (said I) if the King my Master have been in an error, do not (if you please) impute it, either to the diminution of his affection, nor any other cause as culpable. Fortune is guilty of all, and if you will have me name her Complices, I must say all Alcidiana's Subjects. No sooner had the King my Master set foot on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> Island, but they took him for a certain African Slave, foretold of by some prophesie, and on that foundation building all that a popular extravagance can produce, they won him to take armes, and march to the relief of this City. The very day he got the Spaniards Fort, he was wounded as you have heard, and but for my ordinary curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he had not known either of your re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> hither, or whether you were alive or no. I can assure you it for truth, because I have seen him many a time lament you for dead, and he no sooner knew from Alcippus by what unhappie accident you had been as it were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of his armes, but falling as it were dead on me, Let heaven (said he) hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward doe what it pleaseth, since Amintha is lost, and since with her I lose all the hope
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:54727:313"/>
of my reseeing Alcidiana; I have nothing else to be depriv'd of. Amintha was so inly touch'd with these words (said Diceus) that the teares stood in her eyes. A while she stood and could not speake to me. At last, being recollected, Come, said, she into my Closet, and let's indeavour to recompose such things as Polexander's ill fortune hath disordered. Assoon as we were in private, Before all things else (said Amintha) you must relate to me all that your Master hath done (I may say) since his resurrection. I repli'd, Madam I recounted to you before Alcidiana, how he dyed; I will now tell you the manner of his reviving, and the brave adventures which have befalne him in his second life. After that, I related to her your Majesties death, and resurrection, as I took it; and forgot nothing of what had betided you both by Sea, and Land. I will not tell you how often Amintha wept during my recitall, nor how often she made me say over againe the same things, that she might make them credible to her. When I had done; Diceus (said she) 'tis to be confess'd that the generousnesse, and constancie of the King thy Master were impossible to be rewarded, if heaven had destin'd them a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence lesse then Alcidiana. But note with me, how that Eternall Spirit which so wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly presides o're the fates of men, hath by secret, insensible, and unconceivable wayes, brought Polexander to that high point of honour, and felicity, where his virtues are to be crowned. Indeed, that Providence would not by common meanes worke the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of two such extraordinary personages as Alcidiana and Polexander. It hath done well to hide that admirable effect of Justice in thick clouds, and to inviron it with seeming invincible difficulties, to the end that the one becoming dissipated, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther surmounted, that admirable worke of its powerfull hand, might amaze all mindes with joy, and admiration. Or, if thou wilt have me say so, to the end the Deity making appear what it is by so visible a miracle, might deeply reingrave its love, and fear in all such hearts from whence it was alike effaced. Our Prophets threatned Alcidiana either to be taken away by strangers, or to be the wife of a Slave com'd out of the deserts of Africa; and denounc'd, how without that fatall marriage her estate ran hazard to be lost, with her selfe. Whil'st all things were preparing here to bring to light the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that Prophesi, Heaven laboured in the depth of Africa for the Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the rest. It sent tempests, discover'd rocks, and ordained Shipwracks, to the end that a great King losing all the signes of Dignity should become effectively a Slave, and under that miserable condition wander long time through the deserts of Africa. But thou seest not Diceus the mysterie of this inducement. Heaven made not Polexander a Slave but to witnesse its decrees are unchangeable; and withall, to provide for him a way right, and open, whereby it might be easie for him to arrive to that happie port, whither neither his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>avells, his watchings, nor industrious searches had ever been able to have brought him, All these things have I represented to the Queen, and have so well perswaded her to them, that she hath in part lost the displeasure she had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against Polexander. She believes now that if he err'd, 'twas by the inevitable or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of heaven; and humbling herselfe before that absolute Power, O Eternall Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, cri'd shee! I admire thee, and am confounded in these Events, I have no more election, nor will. Doe at last what thou hast resolv'd for thy glory. But what think'st thou Diceus to what this Princess was driven when Polexander (after he had sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made himselfe knowne) vanish'd from her as a flash of lightning? I will not say that she changed the faire intention she bore him to an excesse of hatred, since after that which shee spoke to thee her selfe, it is possible she never had it. Yet I may well tell thee that never any great affection was contested withall by so many different ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as that which Alcidiana bears to Polexander. Assoon as she was retir'd where she might with seemlinesse speake her thoughts: What Amintha (said she) hold you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie with mine enemies? Have you betrayed mine innocencie, and will you suffer a stranger to triumph o're Alcidiana's honour? By one onely word you might have stop'd those extravagancies my credulity wrought me into. You might without failing in any fidelity to your friend, have drawne me from those errours which have hurried me to unreasonable resolutions, and have prepar'd me by degrees for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of that suppos'd Slave. But you have unworthily left me to the frensie of my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and mine owne. Amintha, Amintha! how shall these faults be excus'd? But I
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:54727:314"/>
know their cause. Polexander's contentment is more dear to you then mine. You desir'd to build his fortune on the ruine of mine honour, and never car'd what, became of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana, so that Polexander attained his desires. In a word, you have wish'd that he himselfe might be witnesse to those follies whereto his affection might sway me, that so he might glory and boast of my being inamour'd on him. This contentment he hath had, Amintha; and I thinke there is nothing now left for mee to act, either for his or your satisfaction. But as I labour'd both for you and him, 'tis fit I have my turne, and now doe somewhat for my selfe. Since I have so often assur'd you of my love to Polexander, I will not now say that Prince is indifferent to me. I confesse A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha I have lov'd him, and I love him still; but since I am deceived in my affection, I will stay the course of it, and do in hatred to my selfe, what I had resolved to perfect for the love of that Stranger. Doe not doubt it. I will accomplish all the Prophesie. The slave that came out of the utmost of Africa shall be Alcidiana's husband. But she will ever regard him according to what he seems, and not what he is; and will well finde a meanes to deprive him of the applauding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for his cunning, or reaping the fruit he expects by his infamous victory. The Queen at these words being inforc'd to stoppe, (so much had griefe and indignation transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her) I presently fell at her feet, and most earnestly beseeching her to heare my justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, swore to her by all that is most sacred in heaven, that I was innocent of the treason whereof shee accused mee, and that the King thy Master had first beguil'd me, to the end I might be the more fit to deceive her. Though I have much ado to beleeve you, repli'd the Queen, yet I will perswade my selfe that Polexander is onely guilty. But since hee is a priviledg'd Offender, an Offender sustain'd by heaven, an Offender maintain'd by the same Justice which useth to cut off others; I renounce the intention I had of prosecuting his crime. Let him live, Amintha, since heaven ordaines it, and my people require it, and let another die for him. It shall be the indiscreet Alcidiana; yes, it shall be that wretch, which is to be offer'd a sacrifice for the safety of this State, and the glory of a Stranger. Let's quickly then to that immolation, and live no longer after so much shame. Let mee die, that I may no more look on Polexander. Her sighes here hindering her further speech, I besought her to consider things pass'd on that side which appear'd not so monstrous, and to conceive, that being guided by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of heaven, she could not look on them as things prodigious, but that withall shee must beleeve that very Providence subject to error and disorder. Afterwards, I went on with what I began this relation, and brought her, after five or six houres of contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to give mee the victory, or to say better, to reduce her to the absolute power of him that masters Kings. But I could not winne of her so much, as a consent to see Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander. Shee alwaies upbraided his treachery, and would not beleeve he lov'd her, since he fear'd so little to offend her. When Amintha had related thus much to mee (said Diceus) I was much confused. Yet at last, necessity encourag'd and lent me wit. I justifi'd your arrivall, your disguise, and silence; nay, all that I had spoken touching your death too. If after all this (said I) there remaines any other crime, 'tis I that committed it, and Polexander is cleare. Thus we parted. At the recitall of these misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, Polexander became as dead, and ruminated something dismall in his mind, when divers arm'd men coming in where he was, interrupted his thoughts, and oblig'd him to give them audience. Pallantus conducted and presented them: See (said he) the men from whom the Spaniards have receiv'd one of their mortall'st blowes. They are the Inhabitants of a little towne at the head of this Lake. By meanes of a very faire ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven within the inclosure of their walls, they have been chosen by our Kings to keep such Vessels as at any time by tempests were throwne on our coasts. They had a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of all burthens; and seeing this Island in so much danger, thought it fit to try all waies for the publick safety, and have recourse to other meanes then that of force. To which end, they resolv'd to fill some ships with wilde-fire, which set under saile, and steer'd neere the Spanish Navy they fir'd, and quitted so happily, that with a little or no losse they have defeated the principall strength of the Enemy. Polexander entertaining those generous Islanders with the best precedency of spirit which his private discontents had left him, prais'd their industry and courage; confessing, they had extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:54727:314"/>
to the deliverance of their country. With which good words he dismiss'd them, and taking Pallantus aside, let him know of Alcidiana's new choler. Pallantus could not reply, because at the instant he saw a great many people descend by the causey lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the upper towne. They were such as first heard news of their intire deliverance, and the metamorphosis of the slave Araxes into the Prince Polexander; and came to see him with all the expressions of an extraordinary joy. Some carried branches of Palme in their hands, others of Cedar, some had Laurell Crownes, and others had O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live. Those that march'd foremost, meeting with our Heroe sooner then they thought, witness'd their astonishment, and gladnesse by shoutes and clapping of hands. Those that followed, desirous to break their order and come in the first rank, that they might not be the last in rendring what they ow'd to the deliverer, made such a confusion; that divers of them fell into the Lake, and Polexander himselfe was almost stifled in the croude. He was compell'd whether he would or no to answer that unmeasurable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the multitude, by long kindnesses and great demonstrations of joy. But when he saw himselfe solicited by those indiscreet zelots, to goe in triumph into the upper towne, and then to the Temple of Wisedome, to render thanks for the happy successe of the warre; hee mildly remonstrated their fault, and told them, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their desires were just, yet they could not (without offence) be satisfi'd, but by order from the Queen. That they ought to attend her commands, and respect her as the sole power by whose wondrous effect the Spaniards were beaten from the Island. The multitude being a little held in by so discreet a remonstrance, by little and little retir'd into the towne; and our Heroe seeing most part of the Lords of the Island who had fought under his command, to come towards him, was againe obliged to constrain himselfe to treat them according to their merit. They congratulate with him for the victory; and by a proposition reduc'd him to a necessity farre more harsh then that which he had newly avoided. For they besought him with one voice, to goe and declare to the Queen how the Enemies had been defeated. He answered that Pallantus, and some others, had already retated it. But that's not enough (repli'd the Lords). Shee should (if you please) heare it from your owne mouth. There is none but he by whose valour we have been delivered, that can fitly declare how it was done. Polexander, having nothing to oppose against so much reason, but a great deale of wilfulnesse, which in all likelyhood had been ill grounded, made no other answer but that he was ready to obey them. Presently Pallantus, Amintas, and two others were sent to Alcidiana to entreat audience for Polexander and his followers. Upon consideration she granted it; and assoone as the Messengers were gone, 'Tis in vaine for mee (said she to Amin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha) to resist a stronger power then mine owne. I see well that Polexander must have the best of Alcidiana aswell as of his Enemies. That which I fear'd most is betided, and to my shame, I am inforc'd to shew a faire semblance to a man that hath cruelly offended me. Whil'st the Princesse made these and other the like complaints to her confident, the Embassadors return'd to those that had sent them, and intimated, that presently after the Queen had din'd they should have audience. They were glad of the time, lest they might appeare unfitly before the Princesse. For Polexander he never thought much of trimming or adorning himselfe. His fault, or (to speak more truely) his misfortune was still before his eies. Hee imagined that Alcidiana truely mislik'd him, and gave no way to see him but for her peoples sake. Whil'st these cogitations perplex'd him, Diceus presented a letter to him from Amintha; without knowing why, he trembled at the receiving it, and at the opening found these words:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The true Amintha to the false Araxes.</head>
                  <p>I Have not leasure to reprove you so much as your cunning and little friendship re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. Nor doe I write to you as one offended, but generous, that even pities the misfortune of an Enemy. Make use of my freedome, if you intend to be happy, and intreat it to forget your ingratitude, that you may after your publike Audience have by that meanes a more particular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:54727:315"/>
Polexander took not long time to deliberate what he was to answer so generous a friend, but calling for things fitting made this reply:</p>
               </div>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>Araxes and Polexander equally unfortunate, to the vertuous Amintha.</head>
                  <p>HE whom you stile ingratefull, without a murmure undergoes your reproaches, though his owne Conscience assures him he deserves them not. Neverthelesse, he renders you many humble thanks for the remedy you promise to his afflictions. But it is not enough, generous Amintha, that your charity hath found out a salve for those wounds which I thought to be incurable: It behoves you (if you please) to perfect the Cure, and instruct me how I should demeane my selfe.</p>
                  <p>This Answer brought to Amintha had all the successe Polexander could expect. For that worthy Lady with such discretion serv'd him, that she obtain'd from Alcidiana a tacite consent of seeing him, and to heare his justifications. But the blinded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet love of the people hindred the execution of this designe. They assembled by troopes in all quarters, and imagining their quiet would never be secur'd so long as the Prophesie had not its full accomplishment, beset the Palace as they had done the day before, and cri'd out that the Queen should perfect their happinesse. What's the cause, saies one, that her Majesty acquits not her selfe of the duty she owes the eternall Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for her own safety and that of her subjects? Is she so insensible of the favours she hath receiv'd from so powerfull a hand, that she deferres to give thanks for them? But, saies another, with what pretext can she colour her refusall and delaies, since there is no more talk of putting an unknown Slave into her throne? See what 'tis (quoth a third) to be too happy: we forget our selves in the excesse of diversifi'd good fortune. The Queen (who at length saw her self either a Slave, or engaged to wed a wretched African, is at this houre, not only victorious over her Enemies, but on the point to be the wife of the famousest Prince in the world) looseth her self in the greatnesse and abundance of her bliss, and beleevs she lessens something of her glory in making her self the companion of a man. Those insolent &amp; rash heads, having a long time entertain'd themselves with such discourses, press'd on the Palace guards, and said resolutely they would speak with the Queen. Rhadiotez came to them, and remonstrating instantly that the continuance of their violence would make them all subject to the Law, boldly and rigorously deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if they were not freed from all feare of their Enemies, and what they requested more? We come (repli'd they) to beseech the Queen, not to put off to a further day those thanksgivings which the divine Protection expects from our resentments; but conferring on our deliverer the reward destin'd him by heaven, by her obedience make our present felicity everlasting. Rhadiotez, who was as desirous as they to see Polexander and Alcidiana seated in one throne, but conceiving by some speech let fall by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, that she never intended to marry unlesse she were forc'd to it, mildly bespoke the multitude, prais'd their good intention, and promis'd them to represent to the Queen the justice of their demands. Whil'st he went to make this relation, those who were to accompany our Heroe to his Audience, fail'd not at the time assign'd to be with him. They entred the Fort, all cover'd with Gold and Jewels, and finding Polexander very melancholy, and in a too perceiveable neglect, told him, he either seem'd to envy their happinesse or his owne glory. Hee answered them not, but with a smile, and seeing himselfe urg'd to be gone, took the place these valiant men appointed, and march'd towards the Palace. No sooner was he out of the Fort, but Fame, which still flew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, got to Eliza, and proclaim'd from street to street, from one Carfour to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the deliverer of their country was coming to give their Queen an accompt of what hehad done. At which news, that part of people before the palace descended to the gate where Polexander was to enter, and receiving him with acclamations and all signes of joy; intreated, that hee would not leave his miracle imperfect, but rather

When they came into the first Court of the Palace throng'd full with people, Rhadiotez met them, and made knowne that the Queene no longer induring the cryes of her people, and desirous to begin her new government, by such thanksgivings as she owed to the Eternall Wisdome, put off their audience till after the Sacrifices. But (said the Priest) let every one prepare with joy for the Solemnizing so holy an action, and nev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> think more of our former miseries. We are now come to those happy times our Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies so long ago foretold us. All the Auditors understood well what he meant Even. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander (that would have been willing for conforming himself to what he believ'd of Alcidiana's thoughts to have found out somewhat that might have added to his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents) took notice of too visible assurances some certaine happinesse was betiding him. He instantly departed the Palace, with his pompous attendance, and retir'd to the High Chamberlaines house, where all the people following him, by their submissions, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations acknowledged him for their King: And withdrawing every one to his own home prepar'd themselves for the comfort, and mirth they expected from Alcidiana's resolution. Diceus in the meane while (who was still carefull for what ever concern'd his Masters service) came to him, with his Slaves, and all other necessaries; and was so eloquent in perswading him to his happinesse, that he made him consent to change his habit. The High Chamberlaine getting away the multitude, to leave the Prince at more libertie, went afterwards to performe his duty at the Palace, and receiving there the Queenes Commands, returned to give fitting Orders to the towne, and those of the Temple. When he came back, he found Polexander in case fit to appeare before Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana, and asking him how he would spend the remainder of the day, propos'd their private going to Amintha's lodging, and there passe that time with her. Polexander made some difficulty, though he much wish'd it. But Diceus advising him not to lose that occasion, he, with the High Chamberlaine (in a close Chariot) went to the Ladies lodging. Had she expected that visit she could not have been better prepared. She wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd Polexander with an unexpressible joy; and after a discourse of many things able enough to consolate him, said in his Eare, she would make good her word, and bring him to Alcidiana in private. But (said our wary Lover) will it not offend her? Feare nothing, repli'd Amintha, let the event of the Counsell I give you light on me. I obey Amintha (said Polexander) and goe boldly on the word of so good a guide. The High Chamberlaine discreetly slipping away during this conference, left them in full liberty. Presently Amintha, commanded her Chariot to be be made readie, and in the mean time sent to know what the Queene did. Word was brought back, she was retir'd into her Closet, and command given that none shall have admittance. Let's try our fotune yet said Amintha, turning to Polexander. Not so Madam by your leave, (repli'd the Prince timorously) let us not indanger the displeasing her againe. I have offended but too much alreadie, With that Amintha looking merrily upon him, Is it possible (said she) that so fearfull a man hath been able to subdue a Nation esteemed the the valiantest in the world? Ah Madam! (repli'd the Prince) this is no time to jeast. I know Alcidiana, and what I am. Well, howsoever (said the Lady) wee must to the Queene, wee'll warre upon sight, and undertake nothing rashly. With that she, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Polexander, and two of her wemen, took her Chariot, and descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (as she was wont) at an entrie of the Palace where no men were permitted to come. Thence she went up into her chamber, and leaving our lover there with her wemen, by a private Gallery came to the Queenes Cabinet. The Ladies which were the Ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, understanding who it was, opened the doore, knowing shee had a particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to see the Queene in what case soever. As she entred, she asked aloud and of purpose, what the Queene did? She heard her, and called her to come in, and said she should see. Presently the lesser Cabinet doore was opened, and she saw the Queen had before her the plate of brasse on which was ingraven the Prophesie we have so often spoken of. See (said she) my obedience. I doe all that you prescribe me; for above
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:54727:316"/>
this houre I have been troubling my braines to give this Prophesie some favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. Amintha, with a great reverence repli'd: If your Majestie find any thing difficult in it, I will go fetch you an excellent Inteprreter. I shall doe it well enough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone said Alcidiana smiling. Yet 'tis fitting and necessary (answered Amintha) for your Majestie to know that Interpreters opinion. If you please I will bring him to you. Why Amintha (said the Queene hastily) is he here? Yes Madam, repli'd the Lady. I took on me the boldnesse to bring him hither, on your Majesties word. O heaven! (said Alcidiana sadly) let me not see him. I thinke Madam (quoth Amintha) you are both of one mind, and will. How (said the Queen) will he not see me? Yes, (answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Amintha) but he dares not. You believe then (said the Queen) that I as extreamly desire it, but have not boldnesse enough to say so. Your Majestie (repli'd the Lady) may give my words what interpretation you please, and I will indure it, provided you give not to your owne such a one, as may be contrary to my intention. At last said the Queene, I see Amintha that I must obey. No sooner had she spoke the words, but A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mintha went forth to bring in the affrighted Polexander. Never was the like seen, as in the Princes action, and speech, when he saw himselfe ingaged to see Alcidiana. The most violent cold of an Ague, puts not a man into such an estate as he was, by the excess of his passion. He stagger'd at every step, and was oftentimes like to fall downe the staires. Sometimes he stood so glew'd to a step, that he could goe no further, and by and by descended two at once. Amintha was neare stifled with laughter; and every foot ask'd him if he truly in his conscience knew where he was. How can I know that, (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd the Prince seriously) since I doe not so much as know my selfe? At last, with much adoe they came to the Cabinet doore: Those who attended there opened it, and told Amintha that since she went forth, so great a giddinesse had taken the Queen, that she was faine to lye down on her bed in the greater privie chamber. Thither she went, and finding part of the windowes shut, and the rest darkned by great fine-coloured taf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fata curtaines drawne over them, came softly to the bed, and presented herselfe to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidiana. Come nearer Amintha (said the Queene) and see how I am. I was like to swound since you left me. But where is our deliverer now, said shee raising her voice? He is at last (Madam repli'd Amintha) come to your chamber door. How at last come, said Alcidiana? Because (repli'd Amintha) he hath been twentie times like to break his neck in coming downe the lesser staires. He could not find the steps, and I believe he will hardly be able to come in hither without swounding. Goe bring him in (said the Queen,) and raising her voice again, Come neare, come nearer our deliverer, said she. With that, Amintha took Polexander by the hand, and one might say with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exaggeraton, drew him to the Queenes bed side. Presently he threw himselfe, or rather sunke on his knees, and not daring to lift up his eyes to see that Sun which had purposely hidden part of her light for feare of dazeling him, kneel'd so without speech, memorie, or judgement. Polexander, (said the Princesse) I understand by Amintha you intend to justifie your selfe for what hath pass'd. But it needs not. That absolute Power, which disposeth of us as it pleaseth, is your justification. If you have err'd, you have err'd by its decree; and I should not have the thoughts which I ought, if I were not extreamly sensible of those miracles you have done for the safety of my subjects, and my selfe. During this speech, Polexander recovering his senses, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to her, but more elegantly with his eyes, then his tongue: 'Tis now Madam (said he) that I must call you the lively Image of that Eternall Spirit, which shewes too much love to his Creatures. Like him, you pardon infinitely, and like him, you heape favours on those, who by their demerits were to expect nothing but tortures, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. I therefore (since it pleaseth your Majestie) turne those excuses I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd into actions of thanksgiving. At that word, Alcidiana interrupting him; I will (said shee) neither have thanks, nor excuses. They are both due to you from me, but I know your generousnesse is so farre elevated above what is ordinary, that it would be taken for an offence, if I went about either to excuse my selfe, or render you thanks. Polexander hath done nothing (repli'd our Lover) as a Prince, or a Slave, which may be thought worthy that which he owes your Majestie, or his affection to your Majestie. By that name of Slave (said the Queene) you make me call to mind, what Amintha
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:54727:316"/>
hath related to me touching the many dangers and troubles you have pass'd in search of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If it were not too irksom to you, I should a great deal of content in hearing all that which hath beflne you since our separation. At that command Polexander began to be a little more imboldned then before, and fixed his eyes on the Queen, At the very first houre (said he) when I had the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

She took as many wounds as he, underwent as many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, &amp; triumph'd aswel over as many enemies. Polexander was very generous in his good fortune. He remembred Almanzor; and desirous to acquit himself of what he had promised to his memorie: How well knew'st thou great Almanzor (cri'd he) that Alcidiana was the only feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city which all Heroes were to seek for on earth; and how well didst thou to end thy dayes, when thou had'st lost all hope of attaining to that blessedness. Alcidiana being surpris'd with this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport, ask'd Polexander, who that Almanzor was. A Prince (Madam said he) that had never his equall. He was endow'd with all manner of high qualities, and aspir'd to nothing but what was extraordinary. By the sight likewise of one of yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Polexander (repli'd the Queen coldly) is without doubt that wretched King. But if I remember well what Amintha told me, that Prince whom you so little esteem, gave that great Heroe his life. 'Tis true Madam (said Polexander) that Almanzor, attempting with my life, to deprive me of my insolence in addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing you my vowes; the Chance of armes, which is almost alwaies unjust, gave from him that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which his valour deserved. Whereupon growne desperate with the disgrace, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to dye, and thought after his misfortune, he was not worthy to continue his adoration. He therefore caus'd a Tombe to be built in one of the Canaries which may go for one of the worlds miracles; and after he had shut himself into it, and invok'd your Majestie, as the sole Divinity he acknowledg'd here below, resolv'd to immolate himself to your glory, and to make his Victime the more admirable, was himselfe both the Priest, and Sacrifice. Before he dyed, he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deare Almandarin to pluck out his heart assoon as he was expir'd; and to assay all meanes to come and lay it at your Majesties feet. By a strange adventure that heart, so noble and so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, is in my hands, and I engag'd my self to see the last will of that Prince performed. But some two yeare, since, loosing that Treasure, with the vessell in which I inbark'd from the Canaries, to my great sorrow, I cannot but imperfectly accomplish the desires of that Semi-god. Polexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus ending, Alcidiana repli'd, that she held Almanzors heart as receiv'd. And for fear said she, you may be the cause of a new tumult, goe and prepare your selfe for the thanksgiving, which you, aswell as my self, doe owe for the saving of this Kingdome. Those last words which could not be more obliging, ended this sweet conversation. Polexander arose, as he stoop'd to take leave of the Queen he happily met with her hand, and kiss'd it with such a transport, as none but a discreet Lover is able to imagine; and leaving Amintha there, got into her Charior, and commanded to be set down at the high Chamberlains. 'Twas there that in good earnest he began to taste the sweets of his fortune. He related to Diceus all that had pass'd; and his memorie to please him making use of some priviledges of the imagination, represented to him as intire, and consummated felicities, a little Essay of his happiness to come. And to make an outward shew of the joy he conceal'd within, he clad himself as for a day of Triumph, &amp; was loaded with so many Diamonds, as by their onely richnesse he gave convincing proof of the greatnesse in which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had ordained him to be borne. Night shortly after coming on, every one prepar'd for the Temple. All the streets were inlightned with an infinite number of torches, and so full of goers and comers, that 'twas easie to be perceiv'd, the people look'd after the action they were to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:54727:317" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as a certaine Gage, and infallible Signe of their peace and perpetuall quietnesse. Assoon as Alcidiana; with her Court, were come to the Temple of Wisdome, she sent the high Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine (her Vice-roy) and her Captaine of the Guard, with his band to meet Polexander. They intimated to him the command they had, and brought him to the Temple, followed by all the great Lords of the Realme. All those of the towne which either by crowding, sleight or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty could get in, had been there expecting him above six houres; and persons of condition were on Scaffolds, from whence they might see the Queens throne. Assoon as the Slave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He was receiv'd by the chiefe Prelate, and conducted to the Incense Altar. Presently after, the Queen, of more lustre, and farre more glorious in her owne beauty, then in that of her Jewells, came and kneel'd downe on the same degree with Polexander. Instantly he rose up, and would have retir'd. But Alcidiana staying him, You must not, said she, at this time (if you please) have any will. Our Ceremonies require that resignation. Polexander taking those words as they were spoken, kneel'd down again, and in the very instant, twenty Priests clad in linnen robes, took their golden trumpets, and by a very pleasing sound, impos'd silence on all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. After that the Quire sang an Hymne of victory; which done, they celebrated with a great deale of devotion the sacrifice of thanksgiving. At last, the High-Priest arising, took a golden Censor, and putting fire on the little hearths where they stood, the ayre was presently fill'd with a most extreame sweet and pleasing odour. All the time the perfumes lasted, the musick sung, and when they were spent, the venerable Rhadiotez put himself betwixt the Queen, and Polex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, and lifting his hands and eyes to heaven, thank'd the Eter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>My Friends (said shee aloud) you have made me sufficiently know by your late actions, that you are yet in doubt of your happinesse, and that you cannot take for a true content, a quiet which you imagine not perpetuall. If the object of things present hath at first sight darted any mirth in your minds, the feare of what might happen hath as quickly driven it out againe; and you beleeve that your deliverance being not accompanied with all the circumstances which heaven desires, 'tis impossible it should be secur'd you. You foresee new troubles, you fear new enemies; and the love to your children being as sensible to you as the love of your selves, you do not think your selves perfectly happy, because you see not your happinesse likely to descend to your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity. But give over your foresights and fears, since 'tis in my power to give you an end to both. Yes, my Subjects, I will surmount all those difficulties which any way hinder the perfection of your felicity. I lay this Scepter at the feet of the Infinite Wisdome which we adore within this temple. To which I offer my liberty, and qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>tting all soveraign power, which was thence given me with my life, I give my consent it may be transferred to him who by his wondrous acts hath deserved to be both your Master and mine. The Princess had no sooner ended this short and judicious speech, but there arose amongst the People a kind of humming noise, intimating the content of all the Assembly. Rhadiotez presently, according to the order he had receiv'd from Alcidiana, took Polexander and led him up the Scaffold where she sate. She straight rose, and making two or three steps to receive him, presented Polexander the Scepter she held, who did what he could not to accept it. But the high Priest laying before him the necessity of that Ceremony, and moreover Alcidiana intreating him to give her that last proof of his obedience, he was inforc'd to yeeld to his honour. The Scepter being in his hand, al the people began to cry, Long live the King and the Queen: after these acclamatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s, the Quire sung a Hymne of peace, and another for that incomparable alliance. The chief Prelate ended these first Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, with those whereby he knit in an undiflolvable knot, Alcidiana and Polexander, and put off the rest to their solemne Coronation. Midnight striking, they departed the Temple, and follow'd by the Court, and almost the whole Towne returned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>o the Pallace. When they entred, the shoutes, the clapping of hands, and other signes of joy began again. The Canons went off on all sides the Towne, fire-workes crown'd with a great light the Turrets and Domes of the Pallace, and the Trumpets by their sound intimated the resounding noise of the people, who had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in their mouthes the names of Polexander and Alcidiana. Two houres after midnight the High Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine went out of the palace, and thanking the People in the name of their Kings, invited them to the pomps and sports which should be celebrated a whole moneths time, to solemnize so great a feast. At these promises they clapped their hands, gave a shout, and retir'd. Those who had the permission to follow our Semi-gods into their Sanctuary, came forth assoon as the People were gone. Let us imitate them that knew so much civility, and not boldy knock at so sacred gates, but be contented to know that Polexander and Alcidiana are together; and since we have so long time injoy'd them, have so much justice as to think it fitting now they should likewise enjoy one another</p>
