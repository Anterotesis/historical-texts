         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Authours of all ſorts; <hi>That whole Kingdomes, Parliaments, Senates, States, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
collectively conſidered, have ever conſtantly enjoyed, in all Ages, Nations, the
moſt Soveraigne Juriſdiction, and Authority, and beene Paramount their Kings and
Emperours, who were and are ſubordinate, accountable for their actions to them;</hi>

averre the contrary, not ſo much to flatter or ſeduce their Princes, as to advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
againſt whom the contrary conſtant practice and reſolutions of moſt lawfull Kingdomes,
that either are or have beene in the world from <hi>Adams</hi> dayes till now, ſhall unanimouſly riſe in
judgement, and paſſe a moſt Catholike irreverſible ſentence on them, for their notorious flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Impoſtures.</p>
            <p>For mine owne particular, as I have alwayes beene, and ever ſhall be an honourer, a defender
of Kings and Monarchy (the beſt of Government, whiles it keepes within the bounds which
Law and Conſcience have preſcribed;) So, I ſhall never degenerate ſo farre beneath the duty of
a Man, a Lawyer, a Scholar, a Chriſtian, as to miſ-informe, or flatter either; nor yet (out of
any popular vain-glory) court either <hi>Parliaments</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> to the prejudice of Kings <hi>juſt
Royalties;</hi> but carry ſuch an equall hand betweene them, as ſhall doe right to both, injury to
neither; and preſerve, ſupport their juſt, Legall ſeverall Soveraignties, Juriſdictions, Rights,
within their proper limits, without tyrannicall invaſions, or ſeditious encroachments, upon one
another, to their mutuall and the Republickes prejudice.</p>
            <p>It fares with <hi>Regall</hi> and <hi>Popular Powers,</hi> uſually, as with <hi>Seas</hi> and <hi>mighty Rivers,</hi>
if they violently breake downe, or ſwellingly overflow their fixed bankes, they preſently cauſe an

conſcience proteſt to all the world, that I have not willingly erred in any particular; and if I
have caſually failed in any thing, out of humane frailty, I ſhall (upon better information) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge

many common impoſtures and erroneous groſſe miſtakes in Law, Policy, Divinity, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity;
which have in later ages beene generally received as indubitable verities, by moſt men;
yea profeſſedly defended by ſundry <hi>injudicious Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>ignorant Divines</hi> (though
perchance reputed learned, ſolid in their own, and others opinions) who never tooke the paines
to dive into the true originall fundamentall creations, inſtitutions, publicke Lawes, Reaſons,
Policies, Juriſdictions, compoſitions, Rights, Cuſtomes, Hiſtories of Kings, Kingdomes, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
States, Magiſtrates, People; the ignorance whereof, hath made them confidently vent
many grand abſurdities, and untruthes, to the prejudice, imbroyling, and almoſt utter ruine of
divers Kings and States; which now, I hope, they will ingenuouſly acknowledge and recant with
reall griefe and ſhame, that they have ſo groſſely cheated, ſeduced Kings, Kingdomes, People,
and oft times ſtirred up civill warres, to maintaine their idle lies, crazy fictions, as juſt Royall
Rights, and indubitable Prerogatives, when as they are nothing leſſe.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not begge any mans beliefe, of any Truth here newly diſcovered, further than his own

as well to the Senators of the Realme, as to the Nobles of the Dukedomes, maturely adviſed

ſhould come armed with weapons to the Parliament, <hi>Num.</hi> 3. The cauſes of ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parliament were ſhewed to the Lords and Commons, to have their counſell
and advice therein, what was beſt to be done; and expreſſed to be three. Firſt, that
every one, great and ſmall, ſhould conſider, in what manner the peace might moſt
ſurely be preſerved within the Realme. Secondly, how the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
the Northerne parts might be beſt defended and kept againſt the enemies of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
Thirdly, how the Sea ſhould be guarded againſt the enemies, that they ſhould doe
no dammage, nor enter the Realme for to deſtroy it. <hi>After this. Num.</hi> 4. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Letters from the King then in <hi>France,</hi> relate to the Houſes the Eſtate of the
Kings Army, warres, and proceedings in <hi>France,</hi> and the great debts the King ſtood
ingaged in for the maintenance of his Army; for diſcharge whereof and the Kings
further reliefe in the eaſieſt way, to ſupport his warres, the Lords condeſcended to
grant the ninth ſheafe of all their corne, and the ninth fleece and Lambe of all their
flockes to the King, for the two next yeares, ſo as the cuſtome of Mal-tolt, newly
impoſed on Wools, ſhould be releaſed, and this grant not drawne hereafter into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
as a precedent to their prejudice. Who acquainting the Commons therewith,
they after deliberation; <hi>As to the Kings ſupply; returned this Anſwer. Num. 8, 9. That</hi>
they thought it meet the King ſhould be ſupplyed, and were ready to ayde him,
as they had alwayes formerly beene, but yet as the ayde was granted in this caſe,
they durſt not aſſent to it, untill they had conſulted and adviſed with the Commons
in the Country; for which end they craved time to goe into their Counties, and
that Writs might iſſue to ſummon another Parliament on the <hi>Octaves</hi> of Saint <hi>Hilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
of the richeſt Knights in every Shire at a ſhort day to come, (which, was<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 22, 23 24, 25.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
to.) <hi>After which, Num. 9, 10, 11. they gave this anſwer in writing concerning
the three Articles propounded to them: Firſt,</hi> As to the keeping of the peace of the Realme,
that the Juſtices of the Peace had ſufficient power already to that purpoſe; onely
they adde, that diſturbers of the peace ſhould not be let out of Priſon, but upon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Bayle, and that no Charters of pardon ſhould be granted to Felons, but by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115431:4"/>
common conſent in Parliament, and all other pardons held as voyd. <hi>To the ſecond
they anſwered,</hi> That the King before his going beyond the Seas had taken ſo good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and appointed ſuch ſufficient Guardians to defend the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who
were beſt able to guard thoſe parts, that the enforcement of them by the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
would be ſufficient, without any charge to the Commons; Only, they ordered,
that every man who had Lands in the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> of what condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they were, ſhould reſide upon them to defend them (as it had beene formerly
ordained) without charge to the Commons. <hi>To the third,</hi> concerning the guard
of the Seas: The Commons prayed that they might not be charged to give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
in things of which they had no coniſance (or charge;) and that they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed,
that the Barons of the Ports which at all times have honours before all the
Commons of the Land, and are ſo enfranchized to<note n="d" place="margin">

ſtrangers, (if ſo be it fals out, that they will enter and aſſaile our Land) that they

upon the Land, without taking or demanding wages. Likewiſe, there are other
great Townes and Havens which have a Navy, that are in the ſame caſe, and are
bound to guard the Sea. And as for the ſafeguard of the Watch-houſes upon the Sea
by Land; let the guard of them be made by the advice of the Knights of the Shire,
where the ſaid Guardians are aſſigned, in the ſafeſt manner that may be, without
charge of the Commons: And that the people of the Land, of what condition ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
which have lands on the Coaſt, ſhall keepe reſidence upon thoſe Lands, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to repulſe the enemies from the Land, ſo that for their abiding there, they ſhall
be diſcharged to give any aide toward the ſame guard elſewhere. <hi>Num.</hi> 13. The
Commons frame and demand a generall pardon, upon grant whereof they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to aide the King with monies. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. They make an Ordinance for increaſe
of monies in the Realme. <hi>Num.</hi> 15. Becauſe the ſhips of <hi>England</hi> went not out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Fleetes, to trade, but ſeverally, out of deſire of gaine and covetouſneſſe,
and ſo many of them were taken by the Enemies of the King, and the men ſlaine and
murthered, to the diſhonour of the King and the whole Realme; it was agreed, and
aſſented in full Parliament, that all the Navy ſhould ſtay and be arreſted, till further
order were given to the contrary. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. It was accorded and aſſented in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that the Biſhops and Lords in the Parliament, ſhould ſend Letters to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Clergy of his Province, under their Seales, to excite them
to grant a convenient ayd for the guard of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> for the defence of
the Church, the Realme, and themſelves, as the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
had done. <hi>Num.</hi> 17. It is accorded, that Maſter <hi>Robert de Scardeburgh</hi> ſhall be
put into the Commiſſion which ſhall be ſent into the Country of <hi>Yorke,</hi> to ſurvey the
Array of the people, which ſhall be choſen for the defence of the Realme, in lieu of

the Array in the Counties of <hi>Notingham</hi> and <hi>Denby,</hi> and <hi>John Feriby</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

taxed, and make ayde for the guarding of the Marches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
of the King in thoſe parts, notwithſtanding the Commiſſion made to them
to guard the Sea, <hi>Num.</hi> 21. The Lords who have Lands towards the Marches of

That it was his entire will. And thereupon a Bill made by the King himſelfe, by

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:115431:10"/>
Firſt then I anſwer, That the Parliament is the abſolute Soveraigne power within
the Realme, not ſubject to, or obliged by the letter, or intendment of any Laws,
being in truth the ſole Law-maker, and having an abſolute Soveraignty over the
Laws themſelves (yea, over <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and all other objected Acts) to repeale,
alter, determine and ſuſpend them when there is cauſe, as is undeniable by its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
the very common Law in many caſes, by repealing, changing many old Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Lawes, and enacting new ones every Seſſions as there is occaſion, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſafety and defence. This the practice of all Parliaments in all ages (yea the
conſtant courſe of all Parliaments and Aſſemblies of the Eſtates in all forraigne
Kingdoms too) abundantly manifeſts. The Parliament therefore never intended
by all or any of theſe objected Acts, to binde its owne hands, but onely the Kings
and his Miniſters, with inferiour Courts of Juſtice, neither is the Parliament within
the letter, words, or meaning of them; therefore not obliged by them.</p>
               <p>2. The King, with his Officers, Judges, and inferiour Courts of Juſtice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are included, and the Parliament, is directly excluded out of the very letter and
meaning of all theſe Acts; as is apparent. Firſt in generall, from the occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
all theſe Laws, which was not any complaints made to the King of any illegall
taxes, impriſonments, or proceedings of our Parliaments, to the oppreſſion of the
people; but onely the great complaints of the people and Parliament againſt the
illegall taxes,<note place="margin">

King, his Officers, Judges, and inferiour Courts of Juſtice, as all our Hiſtories,
with the Prefaces and words of the Acts themſelves atteſt; to redreſſe which grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
alone theſe Lawes were made by the Parliaments and peoples earneſt ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
much againſt the Kings good will. The Parliament then (who would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſolicit the making of a Law againſt, or to reſtrain it ſelfe) being cleare out of
the originall ground and miſchiefe of enacting theſe Lawes, and the King, with his
Miniſters, and inferiour Courts only within them; they can no way extend to the
Parliament, but to them alone.</p>
               <p>3. The Parliament, ever ſince the making of theſe Acts, hath alwayes conſtantly
enjoyed an abſolute right and power, without the leaſt diſpute, of granting and
impoſing on the Subjects whatſoever Taxes, Subſidies, Aids Confiſcations of
Goods, or reſtraint of Liberty by temporall or perpetuall impriſonment, it thought
meet and neceſſary for the publike defence, ſafety, and tranquility of the Realm, as
the ſeverall Taxes, Subſidies, and Poll-monies granted by them in all ages, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Statutes enjoyning confiſcation of Lands, Goods, corporall puniſhments, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,
temporary or perpetuall impriſonments, for divers things not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
nor criminall by the Common Law, or when <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the ancient
Statutes in purſuance of it were firſt enacted, abundantly evidence paſt all contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
none of all which the King himſelfe, his Officers, Judges, or inferiour Courts
of Juſtice can doe, being reſtrained by the objected Acts. Therefore it is altogether
irrefragable, that the Parliament and Houſes are neither within the words or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
of theſe Acts, nor any wayes limited or reſtrained by them, but left as free
in theſe particulars (in order to the publike good and ſafety) as if thoſe Acts had
never beene made, though the King, with all other Courts, Officers, Subjects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
obliged by them.</p>

4. This is evident by examination of the particular Statutes objected: The firſt
and principall of all the reſt is <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 29. But the very words of this
Law: <q>Nor We ſhall not paſſe upon him, nor condemne him, but by the lawfull
judgement of his Peeres, or by the Law of the Land: We ſhall deny nor
deferre to no man either Juſtice or Right, compared with the Preface to, and firſt
Chapter of it, <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp;c. know ye that We, &amp;c. out of meere and free will, have

given us the fifteenth part of all their moveables: And We have granted to them on

doe any thing, whereby the Liberties in this Charter contained ſhall be infringed
or broken; We confirme and make ſtrong all the ſame FOR US AND OUR
HEIRS PERPETUALLY.</q> (not the Parliament) All theſe, I ſay, infallibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate,
that this Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> did never extend unto the Parliament
to reſtraine its hands or power, but onely to the King, his Heirs, Officers, Courts of
Juſtice, and particular ſubjects. So that the Parliaments impriſoning of Malignants,
impoſing Taxes for the neceſſary defence of the Realm, and ſeizing mens goods, or
impriſoning their perſons for non-payment of it, is no wayes within the words
or intent of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as Royalliſts and Malignants ignorantly clamour; but
the Kings,<note place="margin">Raſtall Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> his Officers, Councellours, and Cavalliers proceedings of this nature
are cleerly moſt direct violations of this Law. And that which puts this paſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
are the ſeverall Statutes of 25. <hi>Edward 3. cap.</hi> 4. Statute 5. 37. <hi>Edward 3. cap. 18.
38 Edward 3. cap. 9. 42. Edward 3. cap. 3. 17. Richard 2. cap.</hi> 6. and the Petition of
right it ſelf, all which expreſly reſolve, that this very objected Law of <hi>Magna Charta,
extends onely to the King himſelfe, his Privy Councell, Judges, Juſtices, Officers, and
inferiour Courts of Juſtice,</hi> but not unto the ſupream Court of Parliament, which
no man (for ought I finde) ever yet held, to be abſolutely obliged by it, before the
Kings late receſſe from Parliament.</p>
               <p>The next Statute is that of 34. <hi>Edward 1. cap. 1. No tallage nor aid ſhall be taken or

other good Statutes of this Realm, your Subjects have inherited this freedom, that they
ſhould not be compelled to contribute any Taxe, Tallage, Custome, Aide, or other like
charge, not ſet</hi> BY COMMON CONSENT IN PARLIAMENT. Now it
is as evident as the noonday ſunſhine, that theſe Acts onely extend to the King, his
Heirs, Councell, Officers, inferiour Courts, and private Subjects onely, and that the
Parliament is preciſely excepted out of the very intent and letter of them all, having
free power to impoſe on the Subjects what Aids, Taxes, Tallages, Cuſtomes, and
Subſidies they ſhall deem meet, by the expreſſe proviſion of all theſe Laws, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the granting and impoſing of Subſidies, Therefore by the direct reſolution of

and taxes of the twentieth part, there were no doubt of what you alleage; but becauſe
the King is abſent, and not only diſaſſents to, but prohibits the payment of this or
any Parliamentary Aſſeſſments by his Proclamations, therefore they are illegall

               <p>1 To which I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> Firſt, that the King by his Oath, duty, the ancient cuſtom

               <p>This is evident: Firſt by the expreſſe letter of the forecited Acts; <hi>No Subſidy, Tax,
Ayde, Talleage, or Cuſtome ſhall be ſet, granted, taken or leavied, but by common conſent
and grant of the Prelates, Earles, Barons, Knights, Burgeſſes, and other free men of
the Realme in Parliament; or without the aſſent of the Parliament: ſo that their</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See part. 1. p. 47, 48, 49, 50.</note> 
                  <hi>grant
and aſſent in Parliament, (not the Kings) is the onely thing that makes them legall and
binding to the ſubject.</hi> Now both Houſes have granted, ordered, and aſſented to this
<hi>Aſſeſſement, exceeding not the twentieth part of mens eſtates;</hi> and given order for the
leavying of it, and that for the Parliaments, Kingdomes, religions, neceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
and preſervation. Therefore it is obligatory and legall, though the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
conſent not, or diſaſſent thereto, (eſpecially as the preſent condition of things
ſtands) even by the very letter of theſe acts.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this is apparent by the letter of all our publique Acts, for the granting
of Subſidies, Ayds, Tenths, Fifteenes, Taxes, Cuſtomes, Tonnage, Poundage, or any
ſuch like impoſitions in and by Parliament, either by the Temporalty or Clergy:
which Acts runne uſually in this manner.<note n="*" place="margin">12 E. 4. c. 3.</note>

they repreſent, to pay ſuch publike Taxes, to this end, without the Kings concurrence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this is cleare by conſidering, that the Commons and Lords in Parliament
have alwaies had:<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Raſtall.</hi> Taxes, &amp;c. throughout.</note> 1. An abſolute right and power to grant or deny Taxes, Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,

debarring the King oft times (when they ſaw cauſe) of any power at all to receive

thereupon they compounded with the Scots for 1600 Markes. But becauſe that

what the Major part concludes, ſtill bindes the Reſidue, and the diſſent of ſome
(though the Major, or Maſter of the Company be one) ſhall be no obſtacle to the
reſt. This all our Acts concerning Subſidies, Aydes, Tonnage and Poundage the
daily practice and conſtant experience of every Kingdom, Citie, Corporation,
Company, Fraternitie in the World, manifeſts paſt all contradictions; which
being an indubitable veritie, I think no reaſonable man can produce the leaſt
ſhadow of Law or Reaſon, why the Parliament repreſenting the whole Body
of the Kingdom, and being the ſupream Power, Counſell, in the Realm; bound
both in Dutie and Conſcience, to provide for its ſecuritie, may not in this Caſe
of extremitie legally impoſe this neceſſary Tax, for their own, the Kingdoms,
Subjects, Laws, Religions preſervations (of which they are the proper Judges,
Gardians) and ſhould not rather be credited herein then a private Cabinet

which they ſay they will maintain) to the utter impoveriſhing, and
ruining of the Country; yea, they have burned, ſacked, plundered, many whole
Towns, Cities, Counties, and ſpoiled thouſands of all they have, contrary to
their very Promiſes, Articles, Agreements, which they never faithfully obſerve
to any in the leaſt degree; and all this to ruine the Kingdom, People, Parliament,
and Religion; yet they juſtifie theſe their actions, and the Parliament, People,
muſt not controule, nor deem them Traytors to their Country for it: And may
not the Parliament then more juſtly impoſe a moderate in-deſtructive neceſſary
taxe without the King, for the Kingdoms, Religions, and Peoples defence
and preſervations, againſt their barbarous Taxes, Plunderings, and Devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then the King, or his Commanders, Souldiers play ſuch <hi>Rex,</hi> and uſe

inhumane practiſes, and extortions of this nature, and condemn themſelves,

               <p>The laſt Objection againſt the Parliament is,<note place="margin">Object. 7.</note> That they have Illegally impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned,

not in the Kings Perſon, who is inferiour to the Parliament:</hi> A Doctrine,
quite contrary to what Court Prelates and Chaplaines have for ſundry
yeeres inculcated into our Kings and People (who preach little elſe
but <hi>Tyranny</hi> to the one, and <hi>Slavery</hi> to the other, to ſupport their owne Lordly Prelacy,
and hinder an exact Church Reformation) and directly oppoſite to the reſolutions of
many malignant Courtiers, Lawyers, and Counſellours about His Majeſty; who have
either out of ignorance or malice, created him a new Utopian abſolute Royall Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,

anticipate which raſh cenſures, and undeceive both Kings and Subjects whom theſe

Kings lived not like other Monarchs, to rule all things according to their wills, Nullis
obnoxii cenſuris, as ob noxious to no cenſures; but all things, not only their publike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but even the regiment of their daily life, were conformed to the rule of the Lawes <hi>(as
he there manifeſts in ſundry particulars)</hi> both in reſpect of their attendants, diſpatches,
devotions, recreations, moderate ſpare dyet, and the like; neither was it lawfull for
them to judge, nor doe any thing, nor puniſh any man out of petulancy or anger, or any
other unjuſt cauſe, contrary to what the eſtabliſhed Lawes required concerning every of
them. Whiles they obſerved theſe things cuſtomarily, it was ſo farre that they tooke it
ill, or were offended in minde, that on the contrary they thought they lived a moſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
life. For other men raſhly giuing indulgence to the affections of nature, acted many
things accompanied with loſſes and dangers; yea ſome men ofttimes although they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew
they ſhould ſinne, did notwithſtanding perpetrate evill things, being led away with
love or hatred, or ſome other perturbation of minde; but they, imbracing the rule of life
approved by the moſt prudent men, reſolved not to erre from their duty in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.
Whiles Kings uſed this Iustice towards their Subjects, they had their Subjects
bound unto them in greater benevolence and love then their very kindred; For not only
the Colledge of Prieſts, but the whole Nation of the Aegyptians, and likewiſe every one
of them were not ſo carefull of their wives and children and private goods, as of the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their Kings: Wherefore they preſerved the eſtate of the Republike intire for a
long time under the mentioned kings, ſpending their life in greateſt felicity, as long as this
conſtitution of Lawes flouriſhed. And when theſe kings dyed, all the Aegyptians ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
mourned for them in an extraordinary manner divers wayes, made ſolemne Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their praiſe, buried them with great pompe and ſolemnity, and erected Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
to their eternall honour; all which funerall pompous ſolemnities many ill kings wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
after their deaths, <hi>ob plebis refragationem,</hi> becauſe the people gain-ſayed it, (who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Prieſts and Senates, who were ever preſent with the kings to aſſist, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
and direct them, were ſuperiour to their kings, ſince they could thus decree or deny
them theſe funerall honours) which made many of their following kings to addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

after their deceaſe. <hi>So this Author. To which I ſhall adde</hi>

was honeſt and juſt, and to ſuppreſſe the contrary; the very beginning of all true king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
and the end for which kings were firſt inſtituted by the people. Whiles they thus
demeaned themſelves, they were ſubject to no envy, becauſe they differed not much from
others, neither in apparell, nor in meat and drinke, but obſerved a converſation of life
conformable to other men, and lived perpetually like to others. But afterwards, when
thoſe who obtained the principality of ſucceſſion, and the prerogative of their blood had
thoſe things already provided, which made them able to ſecure themſelves, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
their ſtate, following their luſts by reaſon of their abundance, they then thought, it
belonged to Princes to be better clad then ſubjects, to exceed them in costlineſſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of meats, and to uſe venery with whom they pleaſed: Hence envy and offence was
begotten, and implacable hatred and anger kindled, and a kingdome by this meanes
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115431:29"/>
changed into a Tyranny: Hence men moſt generous and magnanimous bold ſpirits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to beare ſuch affronts and inſolences of Princes, ſeditiouſly conſpire againſt them;
and the people having got ſuch Captaines to make reſiſtance, joyne with them for the
foreſaid cauſes, that the Princes may be repreſſed. And thus the forme of a Kingdome
and Monarchy is utterly taken away by the roots, and the beginning of an Ariſtocracy
again laid, the people refuſing to ſet any more a King over them, yet not daring to commit
the Republike to many, fearing as yet the iujuſtice of Superiours, and therefore moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme

he deſired to know, what aide the three Eſtates would give unto him, for delivery
of his Father: Whereunto was anſwered, that the Clergie had given a <hi>diſme</hi> and
a halfe to be paid in a yeare, with that, that they may have licenſe of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the
Lords as much to be levied of their lands, and the Commons the tenth penny of their
moveable goods. The morrow following the <hi>Duke</hi> and his Councell met, and after
many Meſſages betweene them and the three Eſtates, offers to reforme ſome part
of the Articles. But the Eſtates firmely anſwered, <hi>That unleſſe he would reforme all
the ſaid faults, and confirme the ſaid Articles to their minde, for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of all the Land, they ſhould not aide him with their Goods, like as they ſhewed
him.</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> hereupon <hi>ſecretly acquainted King</hi> John <hi>of theſe proceedings, who
wrote to him againe,</hi> that in no wiſe he ſhould agree to the ſaid requeſts, and to the
end that theſe matters ſhould not be touched in open Parliament, he deferred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
of them from day to day; and at laſt by advice of his Councell, diſſolved the
Parliament of the three Eſtates, and commanded every man to returne home without
any effect of their long counſell: <hi>Wherewith many of the ſaid perſons were grievouſly
miſcontent, ſaying among themſelves, that they perceived well this was done by the
Duke to the intent the requeſts by them deviſed, ſhould not take place, but that the old
miſgovernance might continue like as before times it had done:</hi> Wherefore divers of them
aſſembled againe at the <hi>Gray Fryers,</hi> and there made out divers Copies of the ſaid
requeſts, to bear them into their Countries, and ſhew them unto the good Townes.
And albeit the <hi>Duke</hi> after this Councell thus diſolved, <hi>asked ayde of the Citie of</hi> Paris,
<hi>and other good Townes to maintaine his wars; he was plainly anſwered,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Note this.</note> 
               <hi>That they
might not ayde him, unleſſe the three Eſtates were againe reaſſembled, and that the grant
of the ayde might paſſe by their authority:</hi> Whereunto the Duke in no wiſe would
agree. In the mean time the 3 Eſtates of <hi>Languedock</hi> aſſembled in their Province by the
<hi>Earl of Armenake,</hi> the Kings Lieutenant, to <hi>make ayde for the Kings deliverance,</hi> agreed
to purvey at their proper coſts 500 men at Armes, with a furniture to every ſpeare, and
a 1000 ſouldiers on horsbacke, 1000 <hi>Arbaleſtres,</hi> and 2000 others called <hi>Gunſiers:</hi>
all which to be waged for a whole yeare; and farther ordained, that <hi>no man ſhould
weare any furres of great price: that women ſhould leave the rich at tire off their heads,

(who was then abſent at <hi>Meaux) requeſting him to ceaſe the uſe of that money; And
if not they would uſe ſuch meanes, that it ſhould not be ſuffered to be put forth nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

be ſtopped till the Dukes pleaſure was knowne:</hi> Vpon whoſe returne, the Dukes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

after many great and bold words, departed from the Counſell in great ire, and after
their returne unto the City, incenſed ſo the Commonalty, that they ſet apart all work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip

commanded the Provoſt, that the Kings peace were kept within the City; and that
he with certaine Citizens ſhould appeare at the Palace before him and his Counſell
the next day, at an houre aſſigned: at which time the Provoſt with his company came

houſes of <hi>Simon de Burg,</hi> and others accuſed of miſgoverning of the Realme, whoſe
houſes the ſaid Officers ſeized and made Inventories of their goods: That done, the
Duke ſent out Commiſſions, and aſſembled the Three Eſtates againe at <hi>Paris,</hi> the 15.
day of <hi>February:</hi> Where, in the parliament chamber in the preſence of the Duke,
Eſtates, and divers Nobles, <hi>Robert Coke</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> by command of the Duke,
made a long Oration, <hi>of the miſguiding the King and the Land by meanes of evill Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
as well by changing of money, as other many unlawfull Exciſes and Taxes, to
the great impoveriſhment of the Commonalty of the Realme, and to the ſingular enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and advancement of the ſaid Officers; Wherefore the Three Eſtates prayed, that all
ſuch Officers may be removed from their Offices, and other that ſhall be thought more
beneficiall for the King and his Realme to be admitted: Of which Officers the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of</hi> Roan (then newly made Cardinall) <hi>was noted for one, and other to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of 21. whereof ſome were right neere to the Duke.</hi> After which Oration, Sir <hi>Iohn
de Pigquine,</hi> in the name of the Three Eſtates offered, <hi>That the Three Estates ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115431:34"/>
finde to the King 30000. men for an whole yeare, ſo as all things might after that day be
ordered as the Biſhop had before deviſed: All which Articles were unto them by the
Duke granted, and incontinuently all ſuch Officers as they before had named were clearly
avoided, and other ſuch, as by the ſaid 3. Eſtates were thought moſt neceſſary, were put
and choſen to their roomes, except that ſome of the old (as Maſters of Accounts and
ſome of the Preſidents and Maſters of the Requests) were holden in for a time, to ſhew
unto the new, how they ſhould order and guide their ſaid Offices: And the 26 of March
was a new money proclaimed thorow Paris, ſuch as the ſaid 3. Eſtates had newly deviſed.</hi>
The King informed of this, ſends the Archbiſhop of <hi>Sennes</hi> and two Earles from <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>
where he was priſoner, with a Proclamation, which they cauſed to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in <hi>Paris</hi> the 6. of <hi>April, That the people ſhould not pay ſuch Subſidies as the 3. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
had ordained for the waging of the 30000. men aforeſaid, or for the Kings fine; and
alſo that the 3. Eſtates after that day ſhould no more aſſemble for any cauſes or matter
before touched, till they had farther knowledge of the Kings pleaſure:</hi> For which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
the Citizens of <hi>Paris</hi> much blamed the ſaid Biſhop and Earles, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
it, who as ſoone as this Proclamation was made, for feare of the people, fled
from <hi>Paris. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Proclamation the Commons waxed ſo mad, that they left their
occupations, drew them to Conventicles and Companies, and uſed many unfitting words
of the King and his Counſell:</hi> Whereupon to avoid inconvenience, <hi>the Duke comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Watch to be kept in the City day and night, and certaine Gates of the City to bee
kept ſhut.</hi> Vpon the 9. day of <hi>April, another Proclamation was made all contrary to
that other.</hi> By vertue whereof, it was charged, <hi>that the fore-ſaid Subſidies ſhould bee
levyed, and alſo that the 3. Estates ſhould re-aſſemble at Paris, the 5. day after Eaſter,
and there to proceed upon all ſuch matters as were before by them begar.</hi> When the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
meet againe there grew a difference between them and the Duke, about the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies
for the finding of 30000. men, the ſumme aſſeſſed for that purpoſe being too
ſmall by much, the Clergy and Lords then refuſing to pay any more then they were
firſt ſeſſed unto: By meanes of which difference, the aſſembly of State was diſſolved.
Whereupon ſtrait command was given by the Duke to the Provoſt of <hi>Paris</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

in the Aſſemblies of the 3. Eſtates, ſo that much of the buſineſſe was ruled by them

with the rule of the Realme, but onely with the good rule and government of the City of

of his purpoſe.</hi> Then ſhortly after he aſſembled at <hi>Paris</hi> certaine perſon of 20. or 30.

ſatisfie his minde:</hi> Upon which the Duke ſent forth Commiſſions, charging the ſaid
3. Eſtates to appeare before him at <hi>Paris</hi> the next Wedneſday after All-Saints day;

<hi>To which end all the Lords met at a Towne called</hi> Stampes, <hi>where they
continued their Councell fifteene dayes, and then marched to</hi> Paris, <hi>ſending four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
letters unto the citie; one to the Biſhops and ſpirituall men, the ſecond to the
Conſulls and headmen, the third to the Vniverſitie, the fourth to the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
ſignifying,</hi> That neither they nor any of their company were come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as enemies to the Citie, or to warre againſt it, or the Commonwealth of
the Land, but for the increaſe and augmentation thereof to the uttermoſt of their
powers. <hi>VVhereupon theſe foure parties ſent certaine Orators for them to the Lords,
who after long communication with them had, returned to the citie with this report;
Firſt,</hi> the Lords would that the inhabitants of the City ſhould conſider the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the King, which yearly oppreſſed his Subjects with taxes and other grievous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> how he deſpiſed the noble bloud of his Realme, and drew to him vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines
and men of no reputation, by whoſe counſell onely all the Common-weale of the
Land was guided and ruled. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how hee ruled his Subjects by force and will
without adminiſtration of juſtice, and himſelf in all Counſels and Parliaments is Iudge
of all cauſes, and calleth himſelfe Counſels and Parliaments more for this ſingular weale
then for the Common-weale of his Realme. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> how he enhaunſed men of low
birth to great honours, and cauſed Noblemen to be obedient unto them, intending to
bring the ſaid ignoble men to be equall with the Princes of the Land. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> how the
Lawes be delayed and bolſtered by ſuch as ſtand in his favour, wherethrough at this day
Law is will, and will is Law, and no man almoſt in any ſurety of life or goods; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that daily many have been baniſhed and put to death for unlawfull cauſes, and
alſo to any Noble-man at this day no power or roome of honour belongeth; ſo that to
the wild Beaſts in the Forreſts appertaineth more Liberty and ſurety then to the more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115431:36"/>
party of the Kings ſubjects. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The great taxes and ſummes of money which daily
be levied of the Commons be not ſpent in the Kings honourable needs, and for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale
of the Realme, but are ſpent vainly and riotouſly, and bribed out of the Kings
Coffers; for which enormities and miſgovernance with many other, the ſaid Lords were
come thither in defenſible wayes for the ſafeguard of their owne perſons, as to the head
and principall City of the Realme, for to have aide and Counſell, to reforme the foreſaid
evills, not intending any harme to the Kings perſon, or yet to remove him from his regality
or Kingly Majeſtie; but to induce and advertize him to that which ſhould be for his
honour and the weale of his Realme, and to live in wealth and honour, as his Noble
Progenitors lived before him; For which cauſes and conſiderations, the ſaid Lords, as
the Kings true Subjects, and friends to the Commonwealth of the Land, and of that
City, deſired to enter there to refreſh them and their people, and to pay truly for all things
they ſhould take, without doing harme or violence to any perſon. <hi>All which requeſts and
matters of the Lords ſhewed to the Inhabitants of the City, by fauour of ſome friends
they there had,</hi> it was with the more partie well accepted, and though convenient they
ſhould be received into the Citie; <hi>but by meanes of the Earle of</hi> Davoiſe <hi>it was reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
till they had further knowledge of the Kings pleaſure: who comming out of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie
<hi>into,</hi> Paris <hi>after diuers Skirmiſhes, the King and Lords fell to a Treaty of
peace, whereupon Commiſſioners on both ſides aſſembled and communed together
by ſundry times two dayes;</hi> In which ſeaſon new ſtrength of Souldiers came to the
King out of Normands. The Treatie hanging long, and a longer Truce being proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
the ſouldiers fell to robbing, and other unlawfull acts; and at laſt, through obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
on both parties, all offers were refuſed, and the day of the Truces expiration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
without hope of accord; whereupon proviſions for warre were made on both
ſides. <hi>Then begun grudges and murmures betweene the kings ſouldiers and the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of</hi> Paris: <hi>and ſhortly after newes came to the king, that the Caſtle and Citie
of</hi> Roan <hi>was yeelded up to the</hi> Duke of Burbon: <hi>VVhereupon</hi> the King conſidering
what great advantage the Lords had of him, both by ſtrength and favour of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
which daily drew unto them by ſundry companies, in avoiding of more danger,
concluded a peace: <hi>which being proclaimed thorowout all</hi> France, <hi>the King and
Lords met, to whom the King ſhewed great ſemblance of kindeneſſe, ſpecially to his
brother</hi> Charles <hi>Duke of</hi> Normandy; therein appeared great diſſimulation, Lewes
<hi>being of ſuch conditions,</hi> That what he might not overcome with ſtrength, he would
win with diſſimulation and treachery. <hi>Not long after the King warred upon</hi> Charles
<hi>his brother, the Duke of</hi> Burgundy <hi>and</hi> Brittaine, <hi>and a Treaty of peace being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
betweene them,</hi> Charles <hi>anſwered,</hi> That if a perfect concord ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
betweene the King and him, it ſhould be authorized by the whole conſent and
counſell of the Barons of the Realme. <hi>VVith which the King being content, at</hi> Turon,
<hi>in the moneth of</hi> April, <hi>and tenth yeare of his reigne, aſſembled a counſell of his
Lords ſpirtuall and temporall, in the which the demands of</hi> Charles, <hi>and offers of
the king were ſhewed: And after the ſaid Councell had at length reaſoned the ſaid
demands and offers, it was finally determined,</hi> That the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi> was ſo
appropriated unto the King of <hi>France,</hi> and to his heires, that in no wiſe it might be diſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from the Crowne; but that a perfect unitie might be had betweene the King and his
brother, the King ſhould be inſtanced to give yearly to his brother in recompence of the
ſaid Dutchy, 12000 pounds of <hi>Turon</hi> money, with certain land to be aſſigned with the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115431:36"/>
name of a Duke, and 40000 annuall rent of like money during his naturall life, for ſuch
portion as he claimed to be his right, within the Realme. <hi>To all which the king agreed,
and to pardon the Duke of offences againſt his Majeſtie, and all ſuch Lordſhips as he
had wonne from him in</hi> Britaine, <hi>to reſtore: which offers</hi> Charles <hi>refuſing, was the
yeare following contented with the</hi> Dutchy of Guyan <hi>onely, and ſo the warre of</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy
<hi>ceaſed. After</hi> Lewes <hi>his death moſt of his ſpeciall and deareſt beloved
Servants and ill Councellours (whom he ſpecially recommended to his ſonne</hi>
Charles <hi>the ninth on his death-bed) came to diſgracefull ends:</hi>

<hi>living under</hi> Lewes <hi>the eleventh, and</hi> Charles <hi>the eighth, by whom he was made
Lord of</hi> Argenton, <hi>being in high favour with them, and a great Councellor of State,
hath this notable paſſage, againſt the French Kings power then to impoſe any taxes
on their Subjects, without their free aſſents in a Parliament of the 3. Eſtates, though
the contrary be now daily practiſed, to the intollerable grievance of the ſubjects;</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Phili. de Com. l. 5. c. 18.</note> Is there any King or Prince that hath power to leavie one penny upon his ſubjects,
beſides his demains, without leave or conſent of thoſe that muſt pay it, unleſſe it be by
tyrannie and violence? A man will ſay, that ſometime a Prince cannot tarry to aſſemble
his Eſtates, becauſe it would require too long time. Whereunto I anſwere, That if he
move a Warre offenſive, there needeth no ſuch haſte, for he may have leiſure enough at
his owne pleaſure to make preparation; and further, he ſhall be much ſtronger and much
more feared of his enemies, when he moveth warre with the conſent of his ſubjects, then
otherwiſe. Now as touching a warre defenſive, that Cloud is ſeene long before the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt
fall, eſpecially when it is a forraine warre; and in this caſe good ſubjects ought not
to complaine, nor to refuſe any thing that is laid upon them: Notwithſtanding ſuch
invaſion cannot happen ſo ſuddenly, but the Prince may have leiſure at the leaſt to call
together certaine wiſe perſonages, to whom he may open the cauſes of the warre, uſing
no colluſion therein, neither ſeeking to maintaine a trifling warre upon no neceſſitie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to have ſome colour to leavie money. Money is alſo neceſſary in time of peace, to
fortifie the Frontiers, for defence of thoſe that dwell upon them, leſt they be taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided,
but this muſt be done meaſurably. In all theſe matters the wiſdome of a ſage
king ſufficeth, for if he be a juſt Prince, he knoweth what he may do, and not do, both
by Gods Lawes and mans. To be ſhort, in my opinion, of all the Seniories in the world
that I know, the Realme of <hi>England</hi> is the Countrey where the Commonwealth is beſt
governed, the people leaſt oppreſſed, and the feweſt buildings and houſes deſtroyed in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
warre, and alwayes the lot of miſfortune falleth upon them that be authors of this
warre:<note place="margin">Note.</note> Our King is the Prince in the whole world that hath leaſt cauſe to alledge that
he hath priviledges to leavie what he liſteth upon his ſubjects, conſidering that neither
he nor any other Prince hath power ſo to doe; and thoſe that ſay he hath, do him no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
neither make him to be eſteemed any whit the mightier Prince thereby, but cauſe
him to be hated and feared of his neighbours, who for nothing would live under ſuch a
government: But if our King, or thoſe that ſeeke to magnifie and extoll him, ſhould
ſay, I have ſo faithfull and obedient ſubjects that they deny me nothing I demand, and I
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115431:37"/>
am more feared, better obeyed, and better ſerved of my ſubjects, than any other Prince
living; they endure patiently whatſoever I lay upon them, and ſooneſt forget all charges
paſt. This (me thinkes, yea, I am ſure) were greater honour to the King, then to ſay,
I leavie what I liſt, and have priviledge ſo to doe, which I will ſtoutly maintaine.
King <hi>Charles</hi> the fift uſed no ſuch termes, neither did I ever heare ſuch language pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from any king, but from divers of their ſervants, who thought they did their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
great ſervice in uttering ſuch ſpeeches; but, in mine opinion they miſbehaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
towards their Prince, and uſed ſuch language, partly becauſe they would ſeeme to
be good ſervants, and partly becauſe they knew what they ſaid. But for a manifeſt proofe
of the French mens loyaltie and obedience to their Prince, we need alledge none other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
then that we have ſeene ourſelves of late by experience, when the Three Eſtates
were aſſembled at <hi>Towrs,</hi> after the death of our Maſter King <hi>Lewes</hi> the eleventh,

by right, with Provence, and Dolphine for the Duke of Bourbon, to incorporate them
with other Lands which he had formerly enjoyed, and to make all together a Kingdome.
<hi>Moreover the Emperour offered to give him his ſiſter in marriage, propounding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

whereof I neither <hi>WIL NOR CAN</hi> alienate any part without the conſent of the

We preferre the generall good before the private intereſt of Kings perſons. If the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
will treat with me, let him demand reaſonable things which lye in my power, then
ſhall he finde me ready to joyne with him, and to favour his greatneſſe. <hi>The Emperour
ſeeing the King conſtant in this reſolution, in the end yeelded to his delivery, upon
theſe termes,</hi> That within ſix weekes after his delivery he ſhould conſigne the Dutchy
of Burgengue to the Emperour, with all the dependancies, as well of the Dutchie, as
of the County, the which ſhould hereafter be ſequeſtred from the Soveraigntie of the

the Eſtates of <hi>Naples, Milan, Genoa,</hi> and <hi>Aſt:</hi> That he ſhould quit the Soveraignty of
<hi>Flaunders</hi> and <hi>Arthois,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hereupon the King being enlarged, and arrived at</hi>

came to a free place: <hi>but he delayed it with many excuſes, giving the Emperour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,</hi>
that before he proceeded to ſuch an act, it was neceſſary that he ſhould pacifie
his Subjects, who were diſcontented with bonds which tended to the diminution of the
Crowne of France, &amp;c. <hi>After which, the</hi> Pope <hi>and the</hi> Venetians <hi>ſending Meſſengers
unto him, he complained of the Emperour,</hi> that he had wronged him in that he had
forced him to make impoſſible promiſes, and that he would be revenged if ever occaſion
were offered; and that he had often told him,<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> that it was not in the power of a French
King to binde himſelfe to the alienation of any thing depending of the Crowne, without
the conſent of the Generall Eſtates: that the Lawes of Chriſtians did not allow, that he
which was taken in Warre ſhould be detained in perpetuall priſon, which was a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
proper to Malefactors, and not for ſuch as had bin beaten by the cruelty of fortune:
that all men knew that Bonds made by constraint in priſon, were of no value, and that the
capitulation being of no force, the faith likewiſe which was but acceſſary, and the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the ſame could not be bound: that by the oath which he had taken at <hi>Rhemes
at his Coronation,</hi> he was bound (according to the cuſtome of other Kings of France)
not to alienate the patrimony of the Crowne; and therefore for theſe reaſons he was no
leſſe free then ready to abate the Emperors pride. <hi>The Emperor growing jealous of the
Kings delayes, for ratification thereof ſent one unto him, to be certified of his intent,
who found him very unwilling to leave</hi> Burgundy; <hi>which being very prejudicall to
the Crowne of</hi> France, <hi>he ſaid,</hi> was not in his power to obſerve; and that hee could
not alien the Bourguinans without their aſſents in an aſſembly of the Estates of the
Country, which he intended to call ſhortly to know their minds. <hi>By which it is moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
that the Kings of</hi> France <hi>have no power at all to diſpoſe of their Crown lands
or alienate them to others (as other Subjects may doe) becauſe they hold them onely

being ſo vacant could not be diſpoſed of without the Barons, who had lawfully elected

be revenged for it, ſo as the memory thereof ſhould remaine for ever; writes to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
of the Provinces, chiefe Townes, and Magiſtrates, That he would take ſuch
order as the Authors of ſo wicked an act ſhould be knowne and puniſhed: And to his
Ambaſſadours to forraigne Princes, That they ſhould make it knowne to all the world,
that this outrage did diſpleaſe him. And for the Admirals ſafetie, he commands the
Captaines of his Guards, to give him as many of his Guard as he pleaſed, to ſuffer no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt
to enter his lodging; and adviſeth all the Gentlemen Proteſtants then in</hi> Paris <hi>to
lodge about the Admirals lodging.</hi> But all this Court Holy-water was onely to keep
every Bird within his owne neſt, and a Pitfall to entrap the chiefe of the Proteſtants:
For <hi>the ſame day after dinner, the King and Queene Mother, the Duke of Guiſe, and
others, take counſell to murther the Admirall, and all the chiefe Proteſtants, the night

who cauſing it to be embalmed, ſent it to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinall</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> for an

(who</hi> diſavows them, and forbids all leavyes of warre) <hi>raiſe a great Army, and
ſo enforce the king to publiſh a Declaration in his owne juſtification, and to procure
his peace with them, to revoke all</hi> Edicts <hi>made in favour of the Proteſtants, and make

from all dignities, from their pretentions to the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> and to expoſe

the modeſtie of former Popes, pernicious to all Chriſtendome, and derogating from the
Crowne of <hi>France: The Princes likewiſe</hi> proteſt againſt, and appeale from it, as abuſive

by the Leaguers,</hi> German <hi>Forces come in to ayde the Proteſtants; after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combates
the King deſires peace, but the Leaguers will have none; and aſſembling at</hi>
Nancy, <hi>they</hi> endeavour to force the King to make his Will, and allow the Regency unto
them; <hi>to which end they conclude,</hi> That the King ſhould be urged to joyne his Forces

To give them Townes to be named and fortified as the time and neceſſitie required, To

ſurprized by the Duke, who plotted to ſeize his Perſon. After which the Duke

power, by an Edict of re-union,</hi> admits no religion but the Popiſh, promiſeth never to
make Peace nor Truce with the Heretikes nor any Edict in their favour; bindes his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

thoſe of the Reformed Religion; promiſeth all favour to the Catholikes, declares them
guilty of High Treaſon who ſhall refuſe to ſigne to this new union, and ſhall afterwards
depart from it, <hi>But ſigning this forced Edict,</hi> he wept. <hi>To eſtabliſh which Edict, and

and aſſaſſinate committed on the perſon of Maſter</hi> Emery Doll, <hi>Councellor of
the ſaid Parliament; whereby it was approved,</hi> That it was a crime of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to kill a Councellor of Parliament. <hi>And in</hi> Anno 1475. <hi>on the eleventh day of</hi>
November, Mounſeir the Chancellor <hi>came to advertiſe the Court for going to
hear the confeſſion of the Conſtable of Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>to whom for his rebellions and
diſobediences king</hi> Lewes <hi>the eleventh directed his Proceſſe. And the ſaid Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
declared,</hi> That there was not a Lord in the Kingdome ſo great, except the
King and Mounſiour le Daulphine, but ought to come and appear at the ſaid Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in perſon, when it was ordained for him. <hi>And this is witneſſed by a</hi> Lyon aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

by the Parquet</hi> des Huiſiers <hi>thereof. So that by this illuſtrious and Soveraigne
Parliament are ordered and determined the principall affairs of the kingdom. And
in</hi> Anno 1482. <hi>the ſecond day of</hi> Aprill, <hi>king</hi> Lewes <hi>the eleventh, ſent unto the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
the Oath which he took at his ſacring,</hi> exhorting the ſaid Parliament to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
good juſtice, according as the King had promiſed to doe by his ſaid Oath, which
he purpoſed to keep; <hi>and the Oath is there Regiſtred downe. The Parliaments of</hi>
France <hi>are Oaks with exalted Heads, under whoſe Branches the people are covered
from the very ſtrongeſt violencies, which conſtraineth them to yeeld obedience to
their Prince: But when Princes (by bad councell) miſprize the authoritie of them
whereof they ought to be zealous defenders, as being exalted to the Royall dignity,
to rule and governe their Subjects by juſtice, they cut off the right hand from the left:

<hi>reporteth, that king</hi> Lewes the Debonnaire, <hi>holding his Parliament in</hi> May, <hi>there

was a Decree made in the Councell of State against the Decree and Remonſtrance in

this very Book the Authour (who hath likewiſe written a large</hi> Hiſtory of the affaires
and Kings of Spain) <hi>profeſſedly maintains (in a ſpeciall</hi>
               <note n="i" place="margin">Lib. 1. De Regum, Inſtit. cap. 8. p. 68, &amp;c.</note> Chapter, <hi>wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
this Queſtion,</hi> Whether the power of the Republike, or King be greater?) That the
whole Kingdom, State and People in every lawfull Kingdom, and in <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelfe, are of
greater power and authority then the King: <hi>His reaſons (which I have for brevity di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
into number in his own words) are theſe: Firſt,</hi> becauſe all Royall Power that is
lawfull, hath its originall from the People, by whoſe grant the firſt Kings in every Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
were placed in their Royall Authoritie; which they circumſcribed with certain laws
and ſanctions, leſt it ſhould too much exalt it ſelfe to the diſtruction of the Subjects, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into a Tyrannie. This appears in the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> long ſince, who committed
onely the care of Warre and procuration of holy things to the King, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Writes.
Alſo by a later example of the <hi>Aragonians</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> who being incited with an earneſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of defending their libertie, and not ignorant how the hights of Libertie are much
diminiſhed from ſmall beginnings, created a middle Magiſtrate, like the Tribunall power
(commonly called at this time <hi>Aragoniae Iuſtitia,</hi> the Juſtice of Aragon) who armed
with the lawes, authoritie and endeavours of the people, hath hitherto held the Royall
Power included within certain bounds; and it was ſpecially given to the Nobles, that there
might be no colluſion, if at any time having communicated their counſell among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they ſhould keep aſſemblies without the Kings privity, to defend their Lawes and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.
In theſe Nations, and thoſe who are like them, no man will doubt, but that the
authoritie of the Republike is greater then the Kings. Secondly, becauſe in other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where the people have leſſer and the Kings more power, and all grant the King to be
the Rector and ſupream Head of the Commonwealth, and to have ſupream authoritie in
managing things in times of warre or peace; yet there the whole Commonwealth and
thoſe who repreſent it, being choſen out of all Eſtates, and meeting together in one place,
<hi>(or Parliament)</hi> are of greater power to command and deny, than the King, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by experience in <hi>Spain,</hi> where the King can impoſe no Taxes, nor enact no Laws if the
people diſſent or approve them not: Yea, let the King uſe art, propound rewards to the
Citizens, ſometimes ſpeak by threats to draw others to conſent to him, ſolicite with words,
hopes, and promiſes, (which whether it may be well done we dispute not:) yet if they ſhall
reſist, their judgement ſhall be preferred and ratified before the Kings will. Thirdly,
becauſe when the King dies without Iſſue or Heir, the Kingdom and people, not the Prince
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115431:47"/>
deceaſed, ought to chuſe the ſucceding King out of another Family. Fourthly, becauſe if
the King vexe the Republike with his evill manners, and degenerate into an open tyrannie,
the ſame Commonwealth may reſtrain him, yea, deprive him of the Principalitie, and of his
life to, if need be; which it could not do unleſſe it were of greater Power then the King.
Fiftly, becauſe it is not likely that the whole Kingdom and Common-weal would ever
ſtrip themſelves of all Power and Authority, and transfer it to another, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
without counſell and reaſon, when they had no neceſſitie to do it, that ſo the Prince ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to corruption and wickedneſſe, might have greater Power then they all, and the Iſſue
be more excellent then the Father, the River than the Spring <hi>(the Creature than the
Creator of it:)</hi> And although perchance it be in the pleaſure of the Commonweal to take
away the plenary Power from it ſelf and give it to the Prince, yet the Commonwealth
ſhould do unwiſely to give it, and the Prince raſhly to receive it; by which the ſubjects, of
Free men ſhould become Slaves, and the Principalitie given for their ſafetie, ſhould dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
into a Tyrannie, which then onely is Regall, if it contain it ſelf within the bounds
of modeſty and med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>critie; which Power whiles ſome unwiſely labour daily to augment,
they diminiſh and utterly corrupt it, that Power being onely ſafe which puts a meaſure to
its ſtrength; for a Prince ought to rule over thoſe who are willing, to gain the love of his
ſubjects, and ſeek their welfare; which Power if it grows grievous, takes the King off his
peoples love, and turns his power into weakneſſe: <hi>Which he proves by the forecited Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of</hi> Theopompus: For Princes who impoſe a Bridle on this greatneſſe, more eaſily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
themſelves, it, and their ſubjects; whereas thoſe who forget humanity and modeſtie,
the higher they climb, the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er is their fall: This danger our Anceſtours, wiſe men,
conſidering how they might keep their Kings within the limits of mediocrity and modeſty;
ſo as not to lift up themſelves with overmuch power, to the Publike prejudice, have enacted
many things wiſely and excellently; among others, this, That nothing of great moment
ſhould be decreed without the conſent of the Peers and people; and to that end they had a
cuſtom to aſſemble Parliaments choſen out of all orders of men, as Prelates, Lords, and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
of Cities;<note place="margin">Note.</note> which cuſtom at this time is ſtill retained in <hi>Aragon</hi> and other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and I wiſh our Princes would reſtore it: For why is it diſcontinued for the moſt part in
our Nation, but that the common conſent being taken away, and Parliaments excluded,
wherein the publike ſafety is contained, both publike and private affairs may be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Princes pleaſure, and the luſts of a few corrupt, vicious, and voluptuous Courtiers
and Paraſites may domineer and order all things. Sixtly, becauſe many great and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men held, that the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> who is of greater Power then any King, is yet ſubject
to the whole Church and a Generall Councell; therefore the King muſt much more be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to his Kingdom. Seventhly, becauſe the whole Commonwealth hath greater ſtrength
and forces than the Prince, be he never ſo great in Power; and therefore if they diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
their Power will be greater: Yea, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wiſely would have the Commonweal, not
onely to be of greater authority, but likewiſe to have ſtronger Forces then the King; <hi>which
he proves by</hi> Aristotles <hi>forceited words, by the practice of the</hi> Ancients, <hi>and thoſe
of</hi> Syracuſe, who did moderate their Tyrants and Kings Guard ſo, that they might be able
to over-power and maſter them upon any occaſion. How great the authoritie of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike
and Nobilitie was in the times of our Anceſtors, I will give you but one example,
and ſo conclude: <hi>Alfonſo</hi> the eight King of <hi>Caſteil</hi> beſieged <hi>Concha,</hi> a City ſeated in
Rockie places, and the moſt firme Bulwark of the <hi>Moors</hi> territories on that part: wanting
money to pay his ſouldiers, and thereupon proviſions failing, the King haſtens to <hi>Burgon;</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:115431:48"/>
and in a nationall aſſembly, he demands, that becauſe the people were wearied with Taxes
for ſupporting the Warre, the gentlemen would give five Muruedines a Poll to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury;
that this opportunitie of blotting out the name of the Mores was not to be omitted.
<hi>Dieglius</hi> then Governour of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> aſſented to this Counſell, <hi>Peter</hi> Earl of <hi>Cara</hi>
withſtood this motion, and gatherieg a band of Nobles, departed from the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
readily to defend with Armes the Liberty gotten by their Anceſtors with Armes
and valour; affirming, that he would neither ſuffer a beginning to be made of oppreſſing
and vexing the Nobilitie with new Subſidies, from this entrance or occaſion; That to
ſuppreſſe the Mores was not of ſo great moment, that they ſhould ſuffer the Commonwealth
to be involved in a greater ſervitude. The King moved with the danger, deſiſted from that
purpoſe. The Nobles taking advice, decreed to entertain <hi>Peter</hi> with a banquet every year,
as a reward to him and his Poſteritie of this good ſervice, a monument so poſterity of a thing
well done, and a document that they ſhould not ſuffer the right of libertie to be diminiſhed
upon any occaſion. Let it be a fixt reſolution therefore to provide for the ſafetie of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
for the Authority of the Prince yet ſo as to retain their royall principality in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with certain bounds and limits, and that thoſe vain talking paraſites and decevers may
not ruine both, who exalt the Princes Power without meaſure, of which we may ſee a
great number in Princes Courts, excelling in wealth, favour and power, which plague
ſhall alwayes be accuſed and complained of, but ſhall ever be and continue. <hi>Thus</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana,
<hi>who in his next Chapter (worthy reading) proves at large by invincible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi>

to be bound by Laws, and are not exempted from them; that this doctrine ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
into thy mindes of Princes from their infancy, and to be beleeved, yea oft conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of them; that they are more ſtrictly obliged to obſerve their Laws than ſubjects,
becauſe they are ſworn to do it; they are the Conſervators of the Laws, the Avengers of
thoſe that infringe them, and their examples are the beſt means to draw ſubjects to obey
them. <hi>Where he again affirms,</hi> That the whole Kingdom is above the King, and may
not onely binde him by Lawes, but queſtion him for the breach of them. <hi>Before both theſe,
in his firſt Book</hi> De Rege &amp; Regum inſtitutione, Chap. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>he affirms the like;
adding moreover,</hi> That in many other Realms more, where the Crown is hereditary, the
whole Commonwealth, not the King hath and ought to have the chief power to deſigne by
a Law (which the King himſelf may not alter, but by their conſents) who ſhall be the
next Heir, to avoid queſtions and commotions about the Title to the Crown: That where
the Right of the Crown is in controverſie the whole Kingdom and State ought to decide
the right, and ſettle it where they ſee beſt cauſe: That if the right Heir in Hereditary
Kingdoms, yea in <hi>Spain,</hi> be an Ideot, Infant, Woman, or a perſon unmeet or not ſo fit to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as others of the blood, he may be lawfully put from the Crown, and another of their
Race lawfully ſubſtituted King in his place by the whole State, eſpecially when the good or
ſafetie of the Commonwealth requires it; becauſe the ſafety of the people is the ſupremoſt
Law, and what they by common conſent have Enacted onely for the publike ſafetie, they
may without any obſtacle alter, when things require it, by like common conſent; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
becauſe the hereditary Rights of reigning are for the moſt part made, rather by
the diſſimulation of the People, not daring to reſiſt the will of former Princes, then by
their certain will, and the free conſent of all the Estates: That he which is thus ſettled by
conſent of all the Estates hath a juſt Title againſt the next Heir of the Blood and his Iſſue,
who are put by the Crown; elſe divers Kings and Princes now reigning in Spain &amp; elſwhere,

of France, Ferdinand, Sancho the younger ſonne of Alfonſo, Henry the Baſtard, Iohn
King of Portugall, Fardinand, and Iohn the 2. of Aragon, &amp;c. concluding. That if the
King degenerate into a Tirant, by ſubverting Religion, Lawes, Liberties, oppreſſing,
murthering, or deflowring his ſubjects; the whole Kingdome may not onely queſtion,
admoniſh, and reprehend him, but in caſe he prove incorrigible after admonition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him, and ſubſtitute another in his place; which (ſaith he) hath been done more
then once in Spain: Thus King Peter was publikely rejected for his cruelty to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and Henry his Brother (though of an unclean Mother) obtained the Crowne: ſo
Henry his Nephewes Nephew for his ſlothfulneſſe and evill manners was depoſed by the
Nobles ſuffrages, and Alphanſo his Brother, though but a yong child proclaimed King.
<hi>After</hi> his death Elizabeth, (Henry his ſiſter) had the chiefe government of the Realme
leaving Henry. <hi>And for a concluſion he addes,</hi> That ſuch a Tyrannicall King conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
incorrigible after publike admonitions of the whole State, if there be no hopes of
amendment, may not onely be depoſed, but put to death and murthered by the whole
State, or any particular perſons by their appointment; yea without it, <hi>(a note ſomewhat

states cannot publikely aſſemble by reaſon of ſuch a Princes knowne notorious tyranny,
he writes, That then in ſuch a caſe it is lawfull for any private man to murther him, to
free the Countrey and Kingdome from deſtruction. <hi>Adding,</hi> that it is a wholſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
for Princes to be perſwaded, that if they oppreſſe the Common-wealth, if they

<hi>the ſecond,</hi> Anno 1055. Hildebrand <hi>a Cardinall Deacon Embaſſadour to</hi> Henry <hi>the

of</hi> Spain, <hi>in the Emperors Name,</hi> That againſt the Cuſtom of his Anceſtors and preſcript
of Laws, he did with incredible arrogancy and levity hold himſelf exempt from the power
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which iniury himſelfe could gladly ſuffer, if there were no other
loſſe but of his own honour; But ſince the eſtate of Chriſtendom could not well ſubſiſt,
and the Popes Authority would likewiſe be impaired, unleſſe all Chriſtian kingdoms were
united and knit together under one temporall head the Emperour, whom they ſhould obey;
they ought to ſuppreſſe the ſpringing temerity in the Wombe, leſt by their neglect ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it ſelf into other Provinces, animated with the ſweet, and oft-times deceitfull name of
libertie, the ſacred Majeſtie of the Empire and Popedom ſhould be reduced to an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
title; wherefore he deſired them to interdict all Spain, and excommuniate the King;
which if they did, he would be aſſiſtant to the Churches honour and Republiks ſafety then
indangered: But if they refuſed it out of fear, he would not be wanting to the honour of
the Empire, &amp; would certainly look to himſelf in private. <hi>The Pope after ſome delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
approved this motion as juſt, &amp; thereupon ſends Legats to</hi> Ferdinand <hi>in his own
and the Councils name,</hi> to ſatisfie the Emperors demands forthwith, under pain of preſent
excommunication. <hi>The King doubtfull and fearfull whether to obey or not, ſummons
a generall Aſſembly of the Eſtates of the Realme:</hi> The Clergy and religious ſort of
men perſwaded ſubmiſſion, for fear of the Popes excommunication; the fearfuller ſort
concurring with them, by reaſon of the Emperours power and their own weakneſſe and
diſtraction, and the Kings deſires of peace, inclined moſt to their opinion. <hi>But ſome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
ſpirits</hi> thought that a moſt grievous yoke ſhould thereby be laid on the liberty of
<hi>Spain;</hi> which being once admitted on their necks, they ſhould hardly ſhake off again;
that it was better to die fighting, then that the Republike ſhould be involved in ſo great
a miſchief and indignitie. Rodoricus Diacius, <hi>a noble Spanyards opinion (then abſent
from the aſſembly) being required by the king and it, anſwered.</hi> That this was
no matter of Counſell: that what was gotten with Arms was to be defended with Arms;
that it ſeemed moſt unjuſt, that the fruit of others valour ſhould return to thoſe who
in their loſt condition had not communicated in the labour and danger which recovered
it; that it was better to die valiantly, than to loſe the liberty gained by their Anceſtors,
to become a mocking-ſtock to a barbarous and cruell nation, who contemned all men but
themſelves; whoſe ears were proud, whoſe ſpeeches contumelious, whoſe acceſſe difficult,
riotings new, cruelty inhumane; Shall we who have yet hardly eſcaped the ſervitude
of Moors, undergo a new bondage prepared from the Chriſtians? They will deride both
us and ours. Doth the whole world, as farre as Chriſtianity extends it ſelfe, obey the
German Emperours? Shall all the grace, power, honour, riches, gained by ours, and our
Anceſtors blood, give place to the Germans? Shall they leave dangers, repulſes, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:115431:52"/>
want to us? Shall Germany again lay on us the yoke of the Roman Empire, which
our Anceſtors have ſhaken off? Shall we be a vulgar people without grace, without Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
without authority, obnoxious to thoſe, to whom if we had vigorous mindes, if we
were men, we might be a terrour? But it is difficult to reſiſt the Emperous endeavours,
not to obey the Roman Pontifs commands; verily it a baſneſſe of ſpirit, for an uncertain
fear of war, to involve the Commonwealth in moſt certain dangers: many things are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by triall, which ſeemed difficult to ſlothfull men. I know not what ſtupidity hath
ſeized on many, whom neither glory moves, nor the infamy of the wretchedneſſe, thinking
it great liberty enough if they be freed from ſcourges? I ſuppoſe the Popes ears will not be
ſo averſe to our affairs, that he will not be moved with our moſt juſt prayers, and the
equity of the cauſe; Let ſome now be ſent, who may boldly defend the cauſe of our liberty
before him, and teach him, that the Germans demand unjuſt things. Mine opinion is, that
the liberty gained by our Anceſtors, is to be defended with arms againſt the attempts of
all men, and with this my ſword I will maintain, THAT THEY ARE MOST
WICKED TRAITORS TO THEIR CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTREY, who out of a ſimulation
of a fond Religion, or ſhew of prepoſterous caution, ſhall give contrary advice, neither
ſhall reſolve, that ſervitude is to be repudiated with greater care by us, then domination
is affected by them. So farre forth as every one ſhall addict himſelf to the liberty of his

<hi>prevailed, in purſuit whereof they raiſe an army of ten thouſand men, whereof

the blinde, his Kinſman, in his own Court, when he had invited him to dinner on
all Saints day, and then condemning him for a Traitor, confiſcating his lands (a fact
unſeemly for a King, who ſhould be the mirrour of Iuſtice:) Hereupon <hi>Don Iohn
Manuell</hi> ſtood upon his Guard, fortified his Caſtles, revolted from the King for this
his Treachery, allyed himſelf with the Kings of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Granado,</hi> overran the

rebell and ſhut their gates againſt the King; and many others likewiſe revolted from
him: At laſt he was forced to call an Aſſembly of the Eſtates, who gave him Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to ayde him in his wars againſt the <hi>Moors)</hi> and to conclude a peace with <hi>Don
Manuel</hi> and his other diſcontented Subjects; whom he afterwards ſpoiling of their
lawfull inheritances, and purſuing them in their honours and lives by Tyrannous cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
extending his outragious diſdain even to women of his own blood, he thereby
ſo eſtranged moſt of his Princes and Nobles from him, that they revolted from him,
and joyned with <hi>Mahumet</hi> king of <hi>Granado,</hi> and the <hi>Moors</hi> in a warre againſt him,
which laſted three or four yeers, putting him to infinite trouble, vexations and expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
enforcing him to make a diſhonourable peace with the <hi>Moors,</hi> to releaſe the
Tribute which they payed him formerly; and after much mediation he concluded a
Peace thorowout all the Realm with his diſcontented Subjects. This Prince think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to raign more ſecurely, had taken a courſe of extream ſeverity, ſhewing himſelf
cruell and treacherous to his Nobility, whereby he was feared, but withall he loſt the
love and reſpect of his ſubjects, ſo as he was no ſooner freed from one danger, but he
fell into another worſe then the firſt, his Nobles holding this for a Maxime, That a
Tyrant being offended will at ſome time revenge himſelf, and therefore they muſt
not truſt him upon any reconciliation, who to pacifie the troubles which had grown
by his own errour, had made no difficulty to ſacrifice (upon the peoples ſpleen) his
own Mignions, degrading, and in the end murthering, condemning them as Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
after their death, yea, the Princes of his own blood, taking their goods, eſtates,
and depriving the lawfull Heirs, ſeeking to reign over free men, and generous Spirits as
over beaſts, entreating them as baſe and effeminate ſlaves, who might not ſpeak
their opinions freely in matters of State and Government, of which they were held
dead members and without feeling. Whereupon <hi>D. Manuel</hi> and other Nobles, as men
endued with underſtanding, reaſon, and not forgetting the nature of <hi>Alphonſo,</hi> who
was proud, a contemner of all laws, and treacherous, they proceeded ſo farre as to
withdraw themſelves from his ſubjection by proteſtation and publike act, and entred
into a league with the King of <hi>Portugall,</hi> incenſing him to take up Arms for their
defence: Where upon King <hi>Alphonſo</hi> having ſome feeling, that cruelty was too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
remedy for men that were Nobly borne, he ſought by all milde and courteous
meanes to divide them, and to draw ſome of them to his ſervice, which he effected,

               <q>
                  <hi>Sancho</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Arragon</hi> dying without iſſue, the Eſtates and
people adviſing together what courſe they ſhould take for their ſecurity and future
good adminiſtration of the Common-weale, about the year of our Lord, 842. elected
twelve principall men to whom they committed the care and government of the
Republike during the <hi>Inter-regnum</hi> Theſe becauſe they were very ancient men,
were called Elders, from whence thoſe who by birth are ſtiled Rici-men, drew their
originall; And this manner of governing the Common-wealth continued long:
But the great incurſions of the <hi>Arabians</hi> preſſing them, they imagined it would not
continue firme and ſtable: Yet notwithſtanding, taken with the ſweetneſſe of Liberty,
they feared to ſubject themſelves to the Empire of one man; becauſe verily they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
that ſervitude would proceed from thence. Therefore having conſidered and
rightly pondered all things, and reaſons, they made this the reſult of all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
that they ſhould conſult with Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſecond, and the <hi>Lombards;</hi>
what courſe they ſhould take by their adviſe, which ſhould be moſt meet for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuating
of the Empire: to whom, as reports goe, they returned this anſwer. That
preordaining certaine Rights and Lawes, ratified with the previous religion of
a cautionary oath, they ſhould ſet up one King over them; but yet ſhould reject a
forraign Dominion; and that they ſhould take heed, that he whom they adopted to
be King, ſhould be neither of the ſuperiours, nor inferiours; leſt, if ſuperiour he ſhould
oppreſſe inferiours, or leſt, if inferiour, hee ſhould be derided by ſuperiours; To
which counſell and ſentence they ſubmitting, founded that ancient Suprarbian
Court: For according to the anſwer given, all decreed, That they ought to elect one
man excelling in vertue for their King; But yet, leſt the pleaſure of Kings, like
as in other Princes, ſhould likewiſe even among us become Lawes, they firſt of all
enacted ſome Lawes by which they might heale this inconvenience. Theſe Lawes
they afterward called the Suprarbian Court, which we ſhould largely proſecute, but
through the injury of time, the knowledge of them is buried, and ſome fragments of
them only are extant, obſerved by Prince <hi>Charles</hi> himſelfe, and ſome other
Writers, which we ſhall verily remember; becauſe they are as the firſt elements of
our Republike, and containe in them, the inſtitution of the Magiſtrate of the <hi>Iuſtice of
Arragon,</hi> which is the chiefe thing of our inſtitution; therefore in the beginning of
that Court it was provided, that the King which ſhould be, ſince the Kingdom, lately
taken from the <hi>Moores,</hi> was freely and voluntarily conferred on him, ſhould be
bound both by the Religion of an Oath, as likewiſe by the force and power of
Lawes, to obſerve the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdom; Now the Lawes were
theſe,</q>
            </p>
            <p>Governe thou the Kingdome in peace and righteouſneſſe, and give us better Courts of
juſtice.</p>
            <p>The things which ſhall bee gained from the <hi>Moores,</hi> let them be devided not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Rich-men, but likewiſe between the ſouldiers and infantry; but let a ſtranger
receive nothing from thence.</p>
            <p>Let it bee unlawfull (or a wicked act) for the King to enact Lawes, unleſſe it be by
the advice of his Subjects firſt given.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:115431:59"/>
Let the King beware, that he begin no Warre, that he enter into no Peace, conclude no
Truce, or handle any other thing of great moment, without the concurring aſſent of the
Elders.</p>
            <p>Now leſt that our Lawes or Liberties ſhould ſuffer any detriment, Let there be a certain
middle Judge at hand, to whom it may be lawfull to appeal from the King, if he ſhall wrong
any one, and who may repell injuries, if peradventure he ſhall offer any to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.</p>
            <p>
               <q>With theſe Lawes therefore and ſanctions, thoſe our Anceſtors confirmed the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
of new moulding and reforming the Common-wealth: But verily this was
the chiefeſt gariſon for to retaine their liberty, whereby they ordained the Preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of a middle Iudge; placing the power in ſuch ſort in the King, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating
of it ſhould be in the middle Iudge: out of which things, the moderate and
muſicall ſtate of the Common-weale which we enjoy, is moulded and made up. For
from the very beginning of things even to theſe later times, wee ſee by force of this
intermediate Magiſtrate, and by the goodneſſe and clemency of moſt peaceable
Kings, that both our priſtine liberty, and ancient Priviledge hath been alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and due loyalty and reverence to the Kings Majeſty, obſerved: Neither hath
the Kingdome onely emplored the help of this Magiſtrate againſt Kings, but the
Kings themſelves oft-times againſt the Kingdome; by which meanes, many inteſtine
evils have been appeaſed without any tumult, which unleſſe they had been civilly
ſuppreſſed, ſeemed verily to have been likely to have broken out to the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of all men; ſo as we may rightly affirm, that in this alone, the ſumme of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
civill concord both to Kings and the Kingdome hath conſiſted. This Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
was at firſt called THE IUSTICE MAIOR; afterwards aſſuming
the name of the Kingdome it ſelfe, it was called THE IUSTICE OF
ARAGON: By theſe (formentioned) preſcribed Lawes, the will of him who
deſired to be King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> was wholy to bee directed and formed; and unleſſe
he would firſt ſuffer his faith to bee obliged in moſt ſtrick bonds for keeping of
them, any future ſoliciting was to be prepoſterous. Having therefore laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of their Countreys liberty, all of them began to diſpute among themſelves
about electing a King: to which end, they all aſſembled together at <hi>Arahveſt</hi> to
chuſe a King; where they were ſuddenly beſieged by the <hi>Arabians:</hi> which <hi>Junicus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſta</hi>
King of the <hi>Pompelonians</hi> hearing of, came with an Army and reſcued them;

people reputed theſe two priviledges of the Union obtained from <hi>Alphonſo</hi> the 3.

not as new favours or benefits, but as things done out of Office, &amp;c. Therefore in
thoſe ancient Rulers of which we treat, the Liberty of our Country was hedged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
by our Anceſtors with three moſt ſtrong fences; namely, with the Prefecture
of this middle Iudge, with the moſt ample power of the <hi>Rici-men</hi> (or <hi>Palatines)</hi> and
with this moſt fierce force of the Vnion; of which the firſt ſeemed to be Legal and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
the other domeſticall and of greateſt moment; the laſt warlike and popular.
Neither ought it then to be incloſed with a leſſer hedge, that ſo we might rejoyce, that
it hath therby come ſafe &amp; ſound to us now. But of theſe garriſons or fences the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
inventers of them, and thoſe who next ſucceeded them, conferred more aſſiſtance
and labour upon the two laſt, namely the domeſtick and popular, then on that Court
preſidentſhip: For they would alwayes retain in themſelves a power of moderating
and governing the moſt looſe reines of the Royall Dignity, which they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
or enlarges as there was need.<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pag. 664, 665, 667, 716, to 812.</note> The fore they aſſigned thoſe 12 elders to him
elected out of the greateſt men, by whoſe Counſels the Kings ought to be hedged in
on every ſide: the place of which Elders, the <hi>Rici-men</hi> afterwards poſſeſſed; who
were the chiefe of our Nobles; who in times paſt were ſecond to the Kings in ſuch
ſort, that they might ſeem to be their Peers and Companions. Theſe called that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
union to the ayde of Liberty, and out of them were choſen thoſe who ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be the prime and principall conſervators of it: for thus they called the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the Vnion. Finally, they ſuſtained on their necks all the Offices and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
of peace and warre, if not with the ſame power as the Kings, yet I may truly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115431:60"/>
ſay with very little leſſe; for the <hi>Rici-men,</hi> as long as they flouriſhed, relying on the
Forces of the Vnion, did alwayes hover over the Royall Empire, and by the intire
power of their offices, if the violence or aſſaults of Kings were unjuſt, did from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
reduce them into order, and as it were into a circle of Law and Iuſtice. In
which thing verily their grave cenſorious and domeſticall authority had ſufficient
tight and moment with our ancient Kings, who were well mannered: but if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
they could not with their fitting counſels bridle the exulting royall For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they did conſtantly repell them from their necks with the force of the raiſed V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.

according to the Lawes and inſtitutes of his Predeceſſors; and will ſafely conſerve
to every order and man his right, priviledge, and benefit, confirmed by former
Kings; nor will he diminiſh any of the borders or goods of the Realme, but will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his power recover thoſe that are loſt from others: After all which the
Senate ſweare fealty to him, &amp;c. The Revenues, Tributes, and Cuſtomes of the
King are all reduced to a certainty; the Nobles &amp; Clergie are exempted from Taxes.
The king by the Lawes of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> is prohibited to alien to any one the
Lands of the Crowne. No new Lawes can be made, nor old ones repealed but
by the king, Senate and Nobles aſſembled in Parliament. And becauſe there is
wont to be in higheſt power, a ſlippery and ready degree to Tyrannie, certaine
Senators and Councellours are adjoyned to the King, who may direct his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
and Actions to the ſafety of the Common-wealth, and his judgments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Rule of juſtice and equitie, and with their wholſome monitions and
Councells, may as there ſhall be occaſion, as it were with certaine living Lawes,
both informe his minde and moderate his power. This Royall Senate, much
greater now then in times paſt, conſiſts of a certaine number of men, which wee
call the Senators or Councellours of the REALME; who are not admitted to
the Councell without an Oath: and this Office is perpetuall during life, having
certaine Honours and Magiſtracies thereto annexed, partly Eccleſiaſticall, partly
Civill; It conſiſts of 96. perſons in all, ſome of them Biſhops, others Palatines,
Knights, Caſtellanes, and other Officers of the Realme. The Chancellor of the
Realme may ſigne many things without the Kings Privitie, and may deny to
ſeale thoſe things which are contrary to Law, though the king command them.
Moſt of the great Officers and Magiſtrates are choſen in Parliament, and cannot be
diſplaced but in Parliament, and that for ſome great offence. Their Parliaments or
Generall Aſſemblies of the States are held (much like ours) once every yeare at
leaſt, and ſome times every fift or ſixth moneth, if there be occaſion; and then they
are kept conſtantly at one place, to wit at <hi>Petricow,</hi> or <hi>Warſavia</hi> in the midſt of the
Kingdome, unleſſe it be upon ſome extraordinary juſt occaſion, and then the king
by advice of this Councel may ſommon the Parliament at another place. It is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by a Law within theſe 20. yeares; <hi>That it ſhall not be lawfull to the King to
make a warre without the aſſent of his Parliament and Great Councell;</hi> and that
the Nobles as oft as there is occaſion, ſhall at their owne coſts without wages de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the borders of the Realme, yet not without the King, unleſſe it be during the
Interregnum; but they may not be compelled to goe out of the Realme to any For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne

time there hapning ſome troubles and warres about the reformed Religion, which
many of the Nobles and people there contented for; the Queene <hi>Mother,</hi> granting
thoſe of the Religion, a confirmation of their liberties and Religion by way of
Truce for 6 moneths, ſhe in the meane time ſends for Souldiers out of <hi>France,</hi>
wherewith ſhe endeavoured to ſuppreſſe Religion, with the remaining liberty of
the Scots, and to ſubject them to the <hi>French.</hi> Whereupon the Nobles of <hi>Scotland</hi>
who ſtood for the defence of their Religion and Liberties, by a common decree in
Parliament, deprived the <hi>Queene Mother</hi> of her Regencie, make a league with our
<hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> being of the reformed Religion, and receiving ayde both of
men and money from her, beſieged the <hi>Queene Mother</hi> in <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Caſtle, where
ſhe dyed of griefe and ſickneſſe. After which they expelled the <hi>French,</hi> and procured
free exerciſe of the Reformed Religion. In the meane time <hi>Francis</hi> dying, the
Queene ſends for <hi>Henry Steward</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> where he and his Father had
beene Exiles; marries and proclaimes him king, <hi>Iuly</hi> 29. 1564. which done, ſhe
excluded the Nobility from her Councells, and was wholly adviſed by <hi>David Rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:115431:76"/>
a <hi>Subaudian,</hi> whom ſhe brought with her out of <hi>France,</hi> and did all things
by his Councell; wherewith the Nobles being much diſcontented, finding him
ſupping with the Queene in a little Chamber, commanded him to riſe out of the
place, which did little become him, and drawing him out of the Chamber, ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him to death, <hi>Anno.</hi> 1565. The Queene ſoone after was delivered of a
ſonne and heire, <hi>Iames</hi> the 6. and then admits <hi>Iames Hepburne</hi> Earle of <hi>Bothwell</hi>
into moſt intimate familiarity with her, ſetting him over all affaires of the Realm,
granting nothing to any petitioner almoſt but by him; and her husband <hi>Steward</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dead, (whether of a naturall death or poyſon is yet in controverſie) ſhe married
<hi>Bothwell</hi> openly, without the Lords and Parliaments conſents. Hereupon the
Nobles tooke up armes againſt <hi>Bothwel</hi> and the Queen, beſieged the Queen till ſhe
rendred her ſelfe priſoner, upon this condition; that ſhe ſhould adjure and reſigne
her intereſt in the Crowne and Kingdome to her infant ſonne; which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
her to performe, and appointed <hi>Iames</hi> Earle of <hi>Morton</hi> Vice-roy, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
during the Kings Minority. In the meane time the Queene was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
priſoner to the Caſtle of the Iſle of the <hi>Lake Leuine;</hi> where corrupting <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſe</hi>
her keeper, the Earle of <hi>Mortons</hi> Nephew, and a ſhipmaſter, ſhe eſcaped to
the <hi>Hamiltons</hi> in ſafety, who having raiſed Forces to free her, waited her comming
on the ſhoare: But the Vice-roy ſcattering theſe forces ſoone after, the Queene
thereupon fled into <hi>England. Anno.</hi> 1568. Where Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> taking her
expulſion ill, laboured that ſhe might be reſtored to the Crowne, which could not
be effected, but by Armes; or mediation; and neither of them without knowledge
of the cauſe. Whereupon the Queene ſent for the <hi>Vice-roy</hi> and Councell of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
into <hi>England,</hi> to anſwere the complaints of their Queene againſt them; which
they did in a writing, (compoſed by <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and afterwards Printed both in
Latine and <hi>Engliſh,)</hi> wherein they ſhewed the grounds and order of their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
againſt their Queene; wherewith the Queene and Councell were ſatisfied,
that they had proceeded rightly and orderly: yet to keepe both ſides in ſuſpence,
ſhe pronounced no definitive ſentence: The Vice-roy departing into <hi>Scotland,</hi>
was afterwards murthered by the <hi>Hamiltons,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Steward</hi> Earle of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seux</hi>
made Vice-roy in his ſteed. The Queene in the interim treated with <hi>Thomas
Howard</hi> Duke of <hi>Northfolke,</hi> about a match with him, and to ſeiſe upon the Realm
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> whereupon he was committed to the Tower, and ſhe reſtrained; after

                  <q>The Ancient cuſtome of our Anceſtors in puniſhing their Kings, ſuffers not our
forcing of the Queene to renounce her right unto the Crowne to her ſonne, to
ſeeme a Novelty; and the moderation of the puniſhment, ſhewes it proceeded
not from envie: for ſo many Kings puniſhed with death, bonds, baniſhment
by our Anceſtors, voluntarily offer themſelves in the ancient Monuments of
Hiſtories, that we neede no forraigne examples to confirme our owne act:
For the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, ſeeing it was free from the beginning, created it ſelfe
Kings upon this very Law, that the Empire being conferred on them by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
of the people, if the matter required it, they might take it away againe
by the ſame ſuffrages; of which law many footſteps have remained even to
our age: for in the Iſlands which lye round about us, and in many places of
the Continent, wherein the Ancient language and conſtitutions have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
this very cuſtome is yet obſerved in creating Governours: likewiſe the
Ceremonies which are uſed in the Kings inauguration have alſo an expreſſe
image of this Law; out of which it eaſily appeares, that a Kingdome is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but the mutuall ſtipulation betweene the people and their Kings: the
ſame likewiſe may be moſt apparently underſtood out of the inoffenſive te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the ancient Law, preſerved from the very beginning of raigning among
the <hi>Scots</hi> even unto our age; when as no man in the meane time hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
not onely not to abrogate this Law, but not ſo much as to ſhake it,
or in any part to diminiſh it: Yea, whereas our Anceſtors have deprived ſo
many Kings as would bee tedious to name, of their Realme; condemned
them to baniſhment, reſtrained them in priſons, and finally puniſhed them
with death, yet there was never any mention made of abating the rigor of
the Law; neither perchance undeſervedly, ſince it is not of that kinde of
Lawes which are obnoxious to the changes of times, but of thoſe
ingraven in the mindes of men in the firſt originall of mankinde, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the mutuall conſent well-nigh of all Nations, which continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken
and ſempiternall together with the Nature of things, and being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the commands of no man; domineere and rule over all men. This
law (which in every action offers it ſelfe to our eyes and mindes, and dwels
in our breſts will we, nill we) our Anceſtors following, were alwayes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
againſt violence, and ſuppreſſed the unrulineſſe of Tyrants. Neither is this
Law proper onely to the <hi>Scots,</hi> but common to all well-ordered Nations and
People: as the <hi>Athenians, Lacaedemonians, Romanes, Venetians, Germanes,
Danes:</hi> which he there manifeſts by examples.</q> So that I may hence infallibly
determine, the Realme, Parliament, and Nobles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> collectively
conſidered, to be the Soveraigne power in that Realme, ſuperiour to the
Kings themſelves: from whom I ſhall proceede to Scripture Preſidents,
in the Kings and Kingdomes of the <hi>Gentiles, Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> recorded in
Scripture.</p>

Scripture Preſidents, ratifying this truth beyond all contradiction. To begin with

That when <hi>David</hi> with his men offered to go with <hi>Achiſh</hi> and the Philiſtines againſt
King <hi>Saul</hi> (his Soveraign) and the Iſraelites to Battell, and paſſed on in there reward

advice together, ſaid to their King <hi>Achiſh,</hi> Make this fellow returne that he may goe
again to his place which thou haſt appointed him, and let him not go down with us to

of whom they ſang one to another in dances, ſaying, <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew his thouſands, and <hi>David</hi>

of the Philiſtines have ſaid, HE SHALL NOT GOE VP WITH VS TO

are come with thee, and aſſoon as ye have light, depart; whereupon they returned. <hi>Here
we ſee the Lords of the Philiſtines did peremptorily overrule their king againſt his
will, who durſt not contradict them; therefore they had a Power ſuperiour to his:
as will further appear by</hi> 1 Sam. 5. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>and</hi> ch. 6. 1, <hi>to 13. where when</hi> the Ark
of God was taken by the Philiſtines, the Lords and People of the Philiſtines (not the
King) met, conſulted, and ordered, how it ſhould be removed from place to place, and
at laſt ſent it back again. <hi>So</hi> Ahaſuerus <hi>the great</hi> Perſian Monarch, <hi>was</hi> adviſed, over-ruled
by his Councell of State, <hi>as appeareth by the caſe of Queen</hi> Vaſhti, Eſter 1. <hi>and</hi>
what his Princes thought meet to be done, that he decreed and proclaimed, verſe 19, 20,
21, 22. <hi>So</hi> Artaxerxes <hi>king of</hi> Perſia <hi>did all things of moment,</hi> by the adviſe of his

<hi>So</hi> Daniel 6. Darius King of the Medes and Perſians, was over-ruled by his Lords

that the Law of the Medes and Perſians is, that no Decree nor Statute which the

the King commanded, and they brought <hi>Daniel</hi> and caſt him into the Den of Lyons,
and a ſtone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the Den, and the King Sealed it

<hi>THEY DESIRED A KING,</hi> and God gave them <hi>Saul</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cis,</hi> by
the ſpace of forty years. <hi>All theſe concurring ſacred Texts will infallibly demonſtrate,
that this change of the Iudges into Kings, and the originall creation of their Kings
and kingdoms proceeded only from the importunity and authority of the people, who
would not be gainſaid herein, not from Gods inſtitution, or</hi> Samuels <hi>approbation,
who cenſured and diſavowed this their motion, though they at laſt condeſcended to
it; all which is elegantly related, confirmed by</hi> Ioſephus, Antiqu. Iudaeorum, l. 6. c. 4,
5, 6, 7. <hi>By all this it is apparent, that the congregation and people of the Iews had the
Soveraign power in themſelves, as well as other Nations, becauſe the authoritie to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the whole frame of their former</hi> Ariſtocraticall Government <hi>into a Monarchy,

                  <hi>Secondly, it is apparent,</hi> that the Iudges and kings of the Iſraelites were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
hereditary, but oft elective by the people: and though God did ſometimes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
nominate the perſons of thoſe that ſhould reign over them, as is apparent by <hi>Saul,
David, Ieroboam, Iohn,</hi> others; yet the people did conſtantly confirm, make them kings,
and gave them their royall authority, none being made kings by Divine appointment,
but ſuch as they willingly accepted, approved, confirmed for their kings; Gods previous
deſignation being but a preparative to their voluntary free <hi>(not reſtrained or limited)</hi>
election. <hi>The firſt king among the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>(though but over part of them) was</hi> Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech
<hi>the ſon of</hi> Ierubbaal, <hi>who was made king</hi> by the peoples election, Iudges, 9. 1,
<hi>to 7. who having perſwaded thoſe of</hi> Sechem <hi>to elect him for their king, thereupon
ALL THE MEN</hi> of Sechem gathered together, and <hi>ALL THE HOVSE</hi> of Millo
went and <hi>MADE ABIMELECH KING: whence</hi> Iotham <hi>thus upbraided them and him,
Verſe 14. to 19:</hi> Then ſaid all the trees unto the Bramble, come thou and reign over
us: And the Bramble ſaid unto the trees, If in truth ye annoint me king over you, then
come and put your trust in my ſhadow, &amp;c. Now therefore if ye have done truly and

The men of Iſrael ſaid unto <hi>Gideon, <hi>Rule thou</hi>

thy ſons ſon alſo, for thou haſt delivered us from the hand of Midiar. And <hi>Gideon</hi>
ſaid unto them, I will not rule over you, neither ſhall my ſon rule over you, the Lord ſhall
rule over you. <hi>Where we clearly ſee, the power and right to elect a Ruler, and to
limit the government to him and his Iſſue, for three Generations only, to reſide</hi> in the
peoples <hi>free election. So</hi> Iudges 10. 17, 18. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 11. 1. <hi>to</hi> 12. When the Children
of <hi>Ammon</hi> were gathered together and encamped againſt <hi>Gilead,</hi> the people and Princes
of <hi>Gilead</hi> ſaid one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Ammon,</hi> he ſhall be Head over all the Inhabitants of <hi>Gilead.</hi> And the Elders
of <hi>Gilead</hi> went to fetch <hi>Iephthah</hi> out of the Land of <hi>Tob,</hi> and ſaid unto him, Come and

all the inhabitants of <hi>Gilead:</hi> Vpon promiſe of which dignitie, he went with them to <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead;
and THE PEOPLE MADE HIM HEAD AND CAPTAIN OVER THEM.
That the election and making of their Kings belonged of right to all the people, is paſt
diſpute, being ſo reſolved by God himſelf,</hi> Deuter. 17. 14, 15. When thou art come into
the land, &amp;c. and ſhalt ſay, I WILL SET A KING OVER ME, like as all
the Nations that are about me, THOV ſhalt in any wiſe SET HIM KING OVER
THEE whom the Lord thy God ſhall chooſe; one from among thy Brethren ſhalt
<hi>THOV SET OVER THEE, THOV MAIST NOT SET A STRANGER OVER THEE:
Where the power of creating and electing the King, is left wholly to the peoples free
choice, with theſe generall reſtrictions, that he ſhould be one of their brethren, not a

deſign and nominate their Kings, yet he left the power of approbation and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of them free to the people, as is apparent by</hi> 1 Sa. 8. 18. And ye ſhall crie in that

the People anſwered the King (through indignation with one voyce, <hi>writes</hi> Ioſephus,

(which he proves by the example of Rehoboam and others) and that they obtained the
Royall dignity not onely by inheritance, but likewiſe by the Suffrages of the People, as
every one may clearly know, who ſhall but conſider the Histories of their kings;

came to <hi>Sechem</hi> to make <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King; and <hi>all the Congregation of Iſrael</hi>

after that with the young men about him, what anſwer he ſhould return; who giving
contrary advice, <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>all the people</hi> coming to him again the third day, the
King anſwered the people roughly, after the counſell of the young men, ſaying, My Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
made your yoke heavy, and I will adde to your yoke; My Father chastiſed you
with whips, but I will chaſtiſe you with ſcorpions: So when <hi>all the people ſaw that the
King hearkned not to them,</hi> the people anſwered the King, ſaying, What portion have
we in <hi>David?</hi> neither have we inheritance in the ſon of <hi>Ieſſe,</hi> to your tents ô Iſrael; now

the <hi>Shilonite</hi> to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat. Where we ſee the Kings not hearkning to
the people and congregation of Iſrael in their juſt requeſt, and giving them an harſh
anſwer, was a ſufficient ground and occaſion for them, to caſt off his government, and
elect another King to reign over them, and that with Divine approbation from God
himſelf: Such was the whole peoples and congregations Soveraigne power over their

Kingdome of Rehoboam, was not of the Iewes (or tribe of Iudah) but of the twelve
Tribes, from whence it followes, that even the Scepter for all thoſe times was of all the
Iſraelites. Now of this Scepter, which was long common to all the twelve Tribes, the
divine Patriarke ſpake not in that most famous Oracle: for he looked at latter yeares,
and future ages, when as the Tribe of Iudah, the people being divided into contrary
parts, began to have its Republike apart from the Iſraelites, which God approved and
loved; and would have to be called Iewiſh, from the Tribe of Iudah alone, untill hee
(to wit Chriſt) ſhould be given to the aſſemblies of men, to whom not onely the Empire
of the Iewes, but Gentiles alſo was deſtinated. And verily this Majeſty of the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
from the time it once began to be of the Iewes, we ſay continued to be theirs, although

This will be the manner of the King that ſhall reign over you; He will take your ſons and
daughters, and appoint them for himſelf, &amp;c. And he will take your fields, and your
Vineyards, and your Oliveyards, even the beſt of them, and give them to his ſervants.
And he will take the tenth of your ſeed, and of your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ineyards, and give to his ſervants:
And he will take your manſervants, your maidſervants, your goodliest young men and
your Aſſes, and put them to his ſervice; he will take the tenth of your ſheep, and ye ſhall
be his ſervants; And ye ſhall crie out in that day, becauſe of the King whom yee have

                  <hi>it is undeniably evident from all the premiſes,</hi> That all Monarchies, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
Kingdoms, Emperours, Kings, Princes in the world, were originally created, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
ordained, continued, limited, and received all their juriſdiction, power, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
both from, by, and for the people, whoſe Creatures, Miniſters, Servants they are,
and ought to be. <hi>If we ſurvey all the ſeverall Lawfull Monarchies, Empires, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,
Emperours, and Kings, that either have been, or yet are extant in the world;
we finde all ſacred and prophane Hiſtories concurre in this, that</hi> they had their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
erections, creations from, by, and for the People; <hi>Yea, we read the very times when,
the moſt Monarchies of note were inſtituted, the Names of thoſe on whom the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
were conferred, (by the peoples free election onely) yet extant on record
in moſt Hiſtories, and withall expreſſe relations, of many different kinds of Kingdoms,
Kings, in reſpect of ſucceſſion, continuance, Power, juriſdiction, ſcarce any two king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
or their Kings, being alike in all things in regard of Prerogatives &amp; juriſdictions;
all Hiſtories &amp; Polititians concurring, reſolving with</hi>
                  <note n="z" place="margin">Pet. 2. 13.</note> Peter, <hi>that</hi> Kings are <hi>humane

                  <q>We ſay now (writes he) that the people conſtitute Kings, deliver Kingdoms, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
Kings elections, with their ſuffrages; which God would have to be thus, that
ſo whatſoever authority and power they ſhould have, they ſhould, next to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
it to the people, and therefore ſhould beſtow all their care, thoughts, induſtrie
for the peoples profit; neither verily ſhould they think themſelves advanced above
other men for their excellency of nature, no otherwiſe then men are over Heards
and Flocks, but ſhould remember, that being born in the ſame condition with
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115431:94"/>
others, they were lifted up from the ground unto that condition by the ſuffrages, as it
were, by the Shoulders of the people, upon whoſe Shoulders the burthen of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale
ſhould for a great part reſt. After which he proves by <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. and
divers forecited preſidents in Scripture, that God gave the Election and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the kings of Iſrael to the people; and that notwithſtanding the ſucceſſion of the
kingdom of <hi>Iudah</hi> was by God entailed afterwards to the Linage of <hi>David,</hi> yet
the Kings thereof actually reigned not before they were ordained by the people.
Whence we may conclude, that the Kingdom of Iſrael, if we reſpect the ſtock, was
certainly hereditary, but if we regard the perſons, <hi>altogether elective.</hi> But to what
end was this, if the Election appear, as it is confeſſed, but that the remembrance of
ſo great a dignitie conferred by the people, ſhould make them alwayes mindefull of
their duty: So likewiſe among the Heathens we read, that Kings were conſtituted by
the people; for when they had wars abroad, or contention at home, ſome one man, of
whoſe fortitude and juſtice the multitude had a great opinion, was by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
aſſumed for King. And among the<note n="c" place="margin">Herod. l. 1. Cicero, l. 1. Offic.</note> 
                     <hi>Medes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cicero, Deioces</hi> was of an
Arbitrator made a Iugde, of a Iudge created a King; and among the <hi>Romanes</hi> the firſt
Kings were elected. Therefore when <hi>Romulus</hi> being taken away, the <hi>Inter-regnum</hi>
of the hundred Senators was diſpleaſing to the Romans, they accorded,<note n="d" place="margin">Livius, l. 1.</note> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Kings ſhould be choſen by the Suffrages of the people, the Senate approving
it: And <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud was therefore reputed a Tyrant, for that being created
neither by the people nor Senate, he held the Empire onely by force and power:
Wherefore <hi>Caeſar</hi> although he invaded the Empire by force, yet that he might coſen
the people at leaſt with ſome pretext of Law, would ſeem to have received the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
from the Senate and people: But <hi>Auguſtus</hi> although he was adopted by <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi>
yet he never bare himſelfe as heire of the Empire, by diviſe; but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it as from the Senate and people; as did alſo <hi>Caligula, Tiberius, Claudius;</hi>
whereas <hi>Nero,</hi> who firſt invaded the Empire by force and wickedneſſe without any
colour of Law, was condemned by the Senate. Since then no man could be born an
abſolute King, no man can be a King by himſelfe, no man can reigne without the
people: Whereas on the contrary, the people may both be, and are by themſelvs, and
are in time before a King; it moſt certainly appears, that all Kings were firſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the people. Now albeit that from the time that Sons or Nephews imitated the
vertues of their parents, they ſeem to have made kingdomes as it were hereditary
to themſelves in certain Countries, where the free power of Election may ſeem in
ſome ſort to have ceaſed, yet that cuſtome hath continued in all well conſtituted
kingdomes, that the children of the deceaſed kings ſhould not ſucceed untill they
were as <hi>de nono,</hi> newly conſtituted by the people, nor ſhould not be acknowledged
as heires to their Fathers, but ſhould onely then at length be reputed kings, when
they had as it were received inveſtiture of the Realme from thoſe who repreſent the
Majeſty of the people, by a Scepter and Diadem. In Chriſtian kingdomes which at
this day are ſaid to be conferd by ſucceſſion, there are extant moſt evident footſteps of
this thing. For the kings of <hi>France, Spain,</hi>

have been duly inaugurated: Neither alſo heretofore did they compute the time of
the reigne, but from the day of the inauguration, which computation was accurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

he were the ſonne of <hi>Charles</hi> the great.</q> Yea, in the very Teſtament of <hi>Charles,</hi> which

ſervants; Kings Miniſters; ſo likewiſe the people appoints the King, as the
Miniſter of the Commonweale; which title good Kings have not contemned, and
ill Kings have affected, ſo that for ſome ages, none of the Roman Emperours, but an
apparant Tyrant, ſuch as <hi>Nero, Domitian, Caligula,</hi> would be called <hi>LORD.</hi>
Moreover it appeares, that Kings were inſtituted for the peoples ſake; neither wilt
thou ſay, that for an hundred Homuncices more or leſſe, (for the moſt part far worſe
then the reſt) all inferiours whatſoever were created, rather then they for them.
Now reaſon requires, that he for whoſe ſake another exiſts, is to be accounted leſſer
then he. Thus the Governour of a Ship is inſtituted by the owner for the Shippes
ſake, who ſits at the Helme, leſt the Ship ſhould be broken on the Rocks, or ill hold
her courſe. And verily whiles he intends this buſineſſe, the other Mariners ſerve
him, and the owner himſelfe obeyes him; and yet he is a ſervant of the Ship, as well
as any mariner, neither differs he from a mariner in gender, but in kind: In the
Republike, which is uſually compared to a Ship, the King is in place of a Maſter, the
people of an Owner: Threfore to him ſeeking the publike ſafety, the people obey
and ſubmit; when notwithſtanding he is, and ought no leſſe to be accounted a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
to the Republike, as well as any Judge or Captain, neither differs he from thoſe
in any thing, but that he is bound to beare greater burthens, and undergoe more
dangers: Wherefore verily what things ſoever the King acquires in warre, or when
he gaineth adjoyning Coaſts by right of warre or by ſentence of Law, as thoſe things
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:115431:96"/>
which are brought into the Eſchequer, he acquires to the Kingdom not to himſelfe;
to the people, I ſay, which conſtitute the kingdome, no otherwiſe then as a ſervant
(purchaſeth) to his Lord; neither can any obligation be contracted with him, but
by their authority. Furthermore, innumerable people live without a king, but thou
canſt not conceive a King without a people, ſo much as in thy mind. Neither have
ſome attained a Royall Dignity becauſe they differed in kind from other men, and
ought to rule over others by a certain excellency of nature, as ſhepheards doe over
their Flocks; but rather, the people created out of the ſame Maſſe, have advanced
them to that degree, that ſo if they enjoyed any authority, any power, they ſhould
acknowledge it received from them, and poſſeſſe it as during their pleaſure; which
the ancient cuſtome of the French aptly ſheweth, who<note n="*" place="margin">Hotemani France Gallia, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Buckler, proclaimed him King. For why, I pray, are Kings ſaid to have innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eyes, many eares, long hands, moſt ſwift feet? what, becauſe they are like to
<hi>Argus, Gerion, Midas,</hi> or to thoſe whom fables have feined? verily no, but indeed
becauſe all the people whom it concerns, lend all their eies, their ears, their hands, feet,
and faculties to the king for the uſe of the Republike. Let the people recede from the
King, he who even now ſeemed eyed, eared, ſtrong and flouriſhing; will ſuddenly
wax blind, deafe, and fall to nothing; he who erewhile did magnificently triumph,
will in one moment become vile to all: he who even now was adored almoſt with
divine honours, will be compelled to play the Schoolmaſter at <hi>Corinth:</hi> Over-turn
only the baſis of this Giant-like heape, and like the Rhodian Coloſſus, it will
of neceſsity fall, and be broken into pieces. Since therefore a King exiſts by and for
the people, and cannot conſiſt without the people; to whom may it ſeem ſtrange if
we conclude, <hi>That the People are greater then the King.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>Moreover, what we ſay of all the People, we will have ſpoken alſo, as in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Queſtion, of thoſe alſo who lawfully repreſent all the people in every
kingdome or City, who verily are commonly reputed the Officers of the <hi>Kingdome,</hi>
not King. The Officers of the King, are created or diſcharged by the King at
his pleaſure; Moreover, when he dyeth they are out of place, and are in ſome ſort
accounted dead men. Contrarily, the Officers of the kingdome, receive their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
from the people, to wit, <hi>In a publike Councell,</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>Heretofore were

depend on the King, theſe on the kingdome: they, from the Supreme Officer of the
kingdome, who is the king himſelfe; theſe, <hi>From the Supream Dominion of the
People,</hi> from whom the king himſelfe, as well as they, ought to depend. Their
Office is, to take care of the king: theſe mens duty, to take heed that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
receiue no detriment any where: Theirs to be preſent and ſerue the King, as any
domeſtick ſervants doe their Maſters; theſe mens, to defend the rights and priuiledges

inſtituted only to obey him; theſe contrarily, are as the kings Aſſeſſors in jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
according to Law and Conſorts of the Royal Empire; ſo as all theſe are bound
to gouern the Commonweal, no otherwiſe then the king is; yet he, as a preſident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, may onely hold the firſt place. Now as <hi>All the People are ſuperiour

<hi>All of them are to be deemed ſuperiour to him.</hi> How great the power of the firſt

uſually referred to the people. And vetily in thoſe kingdomes, which at that time
were circumſcribed almoſt with one City, this was eaſie: But from that time kings
began to inlarge their Territories, neither could all the people aſſemble in one place
without confuſion, Officers of the kingdome were appointed, who ſhould ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defend their rights; yet ſo, as when there ſhould be need, either all the people,
or at leaſt a certain Epitome of them ſhould be extraordinarily aſſembled. Wee ſee
this order to have been in the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which by the judgement almoſt of
all polititians, was beſt of all conſtituted. The king had his Bakers, Butlers, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaines,
Maſters and Stewards of his Houſe, who overlooked his Family; the
kingdom had likewiſe its Officers, 71. Elders and Captains choſen out of every tribe,
who might take care of the Republike in time either of peace or warre: and finally
its Magiſtrates in every Town, who were every one to defend their Rites, as the
others the whole kingdome (which he proves to be above their kings, and to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule
them, in the<note n="*" place="margin">Har. p. 143. 144.</note> forecited paſſage.) Such were the 7.<note n="n" place="margin">Eſther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

there is one Chancellour of the Empire, another of the Emperour; other and different

PEERS, FROM WHOSE AVTHORITY HE COVLD DEROGATE
NOTHING.</hi> Hence even at this day the Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> which is called the
Court of Peers or Senators, is in ſome ſort conſtituted a Iudge between the King and
People, yea, between the King and every private man, and is bound, as with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation

that they may defend the People ſo farre forth as their juriſdiction exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,

thoſe things which were therein accorded, were reputed ſacred and holy, &amp; whether
Peace were to be concluded, or War to be waged, or the Guardianſhip of the Realm to
be committed to any one, or a Tax to be impoſed, was there concluded; but even Kings
themſelves for their luxury, ſlothfulnes or tyrannie, were thruſt into Monaſteries, &amp; by
their authority, even all their Ofsprings deprived of the ſucceſſion of the Kingdom, no
otherwiſe then at firſt, when as they were called to the kingdom, by the peoples autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
verily thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſent had advanced, diſſent did pull down again; thoſe whom
imitation of paternall vertues had as it were called into that inheritance, a degenerate
and ungratefull minde, as it had made then uncapable and unworthy, ſo it did make
them to be diſinherited: From whence verily it appears, that ſucceſſion truly was tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to avoid competition, ſucceſſion, an interregnum, and other incommodities of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection;
but truely when greater damages would follow; where Tyranny ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the Kingdom, where a Tyrant the Throne of a King, the lawfull Aſſembly of

or ſlothfull King,</hi> and of deducing him to his Kindred, and <hi>of ſubſtituting a good

in the Juſtice of <hi>Aragon,</hi> as they call it; therefore the great men, who repreſent the

and likewiſe every third year in the generall aſſembly of their Eſtates, <hi>Tantum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemus

above us both, who rules more than you.</hi> Yea, oftentimes what things the King hath
asked, what he hath injoyn'd, the <hi>Iuſtice</hi> hath prohibited; nay, he never dares to impoſe
any tribute without the authority of that Aſſembly. In the Realms of <hi>England and
Scotland, the Supreme power is in the Parliament,</hi> uſually wont to be held almoſt
<hi>every year.</hi> Now they call a Parliament, the Aſſembly of the Eſtates of the Realme,
where the Biſhops, Earls, Barons, Deputies of the Cities and Counties by common
ſuffrage determine of the Republikes affairs, whoſe authority is ſo ſacred, that what
things ſoever it ſhall once eſtabliſh, it is unlawfull (or a wicked act) for the king to
abrogate. Likewiſe <hi>all the Officers of the Realme are wont to receive their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from that Aſſembly, and thoſe who ordinarily aſſiſt the King or Quéen in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>
In brief, other Chriſtian Kingdoms, as <hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Denmarke, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and the reſt, have all their Officers of the Realm, or Conſuls of the Royall Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
who by their own Authority have ſometimes uſed even to depoſe their Kings
themſelves, as Hiſtories teach, or freſh memory ſufficiently manifeſts: Neither is
there verily any cauſe that we ſhould think the Royall Authority to be thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,
or that Kings ſhould hereby ſuffer as it were a diminution of their heads;
Truly, we deem not God the leſſe potent for this, becauſe he cannot ſin by himſelf,
nor his Empire more reſtrained, becauſe it cannot be ruined, nor grow worſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not a King, if that he who may offend by himſelf, be ſuſtained or kept from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
by anothers help; or if peradventure he had loſt any Empire by his own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
or fault, that he may retain by anothers prudence. What? do you think any
man leſſe healthy, becauſe Phiſitians ſit round about him, who dehort him from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,
who interdict him the eating of hurtfull meats, who likewiſe oft-times
purge him againſt his will, and reſiſting? Or whether doeſt thou think thoſe Phiſitians
who take care of his health, or flatterers who obtrude the moſt unwholſome things,
to be more his friends? Therefore this diſtinction is altogether neceſſary to be adhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited:
Some are friends of the King, others of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> thoſe are friends of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who
ſerve <hi>Caeſar;</hi> thoſe friends of the King or Emperour, who ſerve the Kingdom: For
ſince any one is called a King,<note place="margin">Note.</note> for the Kingdoms ſake, and the Kingdom conſiſts in
the people; but the Kingdom being loſt or decayed, the King muſt altogether ceaſe to
be a King, or, at leaſt, be leſſe a King: thoſe verily who ſhall ſtudy the profit of the
Kingdom, are truly the Kings friends; thoſe who neglect, or ſubvert the profit of the
Realm, are truly his Enemies: and as thou canſt by no means ſeparate the Kingdom
from the people, nor the King from the Kingdom; ſo neither the friends of the King
from the friends of the Kingdom or people; yea verily, as thoſe who truely love <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>

would rather have him to be a King then a private man, nor can they have him a
King without a Kingdom, in good ſooth thoſe ſhall be the Kingdoms friends who are
<hi>Caeſars;</hi> and thoſe who would ſeem to be more the friends of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

and if they bee truely friends, is it not manifeſt, that the King will become more
powerfull and ſtable, (as <hi>Theopompus</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Ephori</hi> when inſtituted) by how
much thoſe ſhall be more, and more powerfull, to whom the profit of the people or

                  <q>But perchance thou wilt ſay, You tell me of the Senators, Peers, and Officers

own affairs, to flatter kings, to cheat the people; ſcarce any where maiſt thou finde
one who takes pity of the maſcerated people, much leſſe who will give help to the
miſerable; but if there be any who are truely of that minde, or thought to be ſo, they
are judged Rebels, or Traitors, they are baniſhed, and they are compelled to begge
even their very food.<note place="margin">Note.</note> What? the thing is thus: It ſeems almoſt alwayes and in every
place the audacitie of Kings, or partly the prevarication, partly the ſlothfulneſſe of
the Nobility hath been ſuch, that kings may ſeem to have uſurped that licentiouſneſſe
wherewith moſt of them at this day ſeem to wax inſolent, by a long preſcription of
time, but the people may ſeem to have determined their Authority, or to have
loſt it by not uſing it: For ſo it happens for the moſt part, that no man takes care for
that which all are bound to take care of, that which is committed to all, no man thinks
it is commended to him. Yet notwithſtanding, againſt the people, neither this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
nor prevarication doth any thing. It is a vulgar ſaying, that no preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
can hurt the king, or Exchequer, much leſſe all the people, who are potenter then

thou objecteſt, that Kings were conſtituted by the people, who perchance lived above

kings doe die, the people in the mean time (as neither any other Univerſitie)
never dyeth; for as flowing waters make a perpetuall river, ſo alſo the viciſſitude of

the ſame as it was above a thouſand years agoe, ſo likewiſe the Germane, French,
Roman people are the ſame, (unleſſe Colonies ſhall have caſually intervened) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can their right be any wayes changed, either by the flux of water, or change of
individuals. Beſides, if they attribute the Kingdom received, not to their people, but
to their Father, &amp; he to his Grandfather, and ſo upwards, could he transfer more right
to another then himſelf firſt had? But and if he could not, (as it is certain he could
not) is it not manifeſt, whatſoever he ſhall arrogate to himſelf beſides, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
any more uſurp it then any theef? But on the contrary the people have a right of
perpetuall eviction. Therefore that the Nobles have been for a long ſpace oppreſſed
in any Kingdom, can no way prejudice the people; but rather, as the ſervant ſhould not
be heard, who in that he hath a very long time detained his Lord captive, ſhould
boaſt, that he was not onely a Free-man, but would likewiſe arrogate to himſelf a

yea rather, by how much the longer he hath been ſuch a one, the more ſeverely ſhould
he be puniſhed: So likewiſe a Prince is not to be heard or endured, who becauſe
he hath ſucceeded to a Tyrant, or hath for a long time uſed the people like a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave,
from whom he hath received his kingdome, or hath offered violence to the
Nobles, ſhould think that what ever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e luſted ſhould be lawfull to him, and ought
to be granted of right. Neither doe yeers ſubſtract any thing from the peoples right,
but adde to the injury of the King. But what, if the Nobles themſelves have col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
with the King? what, if in betraying the cauſe, they have betrayed the people
as it were bound, into the hands of a Tyrant? ſhall the authority of the people by
this prevarication or treaſon ſeem to be plainly transferred upon the King? whether
I ſay, by this fact is any thing taken away from the liberty of the people, or adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the licentiouſneſſe of the Prince? You will ſay, they may impute it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
who made choiſe of ſuch men of perfidious faith. But yet theſe are as patrons
to patronize the publike profit, and the peoples ſafety and liberty: Therfore as when
an Advocate ſhall make a compact with the adverſary of his Client, concerning the
value of the ſuit as they ſpeake, if he had betrayed his cauſe, he ſhould not hurt him
at all; ſo this conſpiracie of the Nobles, as it were made to the dammage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the people, cannot verily detract any thing from their right; but even
they themſelves ſhall fall into the penalty of the Law, which is promulged againſt
prevaricators, and the Law permits the people to chuſe another patron, and to
proſecute their right againe: For if the Roman people condemned their Emperors
to puniſhment, who at the Caudine Gallowes had diſhonourably contracted with
the enemies, although by compulſion, and reduced to greateſt ſtraits; and judged
that they were no wayes obliged by that paction; ſhall not the people be much
leſſe bound to ſuffer that yoke, which not by force, but willingly; not for feare of
death, but out of deſire of gain, hath been thus treacherouſly put upon them? Or
if thoſe who ought to ſhake it off ſhall impoſe it, or thoſe who might doe it, ſhall
tolerate it?</q>

if the Emperour think any Law neceſſary, he firſt deſires it in the generall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
if it be approved, the Princes, Barons, and Deputies of Cities ſubſigne it, and
then it is wont to be a firme Law: Yea, he ſwears, <hi>that he will keep the Laws Enacted,
and that he will make no news Laws but by common conſent.</hi> In the Kingdom of <hi>Poland</hi>
there is a Law, (renewed, <hi>An.</hi> 1454, and 1538.) That no new Laws or Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhall be made, but onely by publike conſent, or in any place but in Parliament.
In the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> where yet commonly the authority of Kings is thought moſt
ample, Laws were heretofore enacted in the Aſſembly of the three Eſtates, or in the
Kings ambulatory Councell; but ſince there hath been a ſtanding Parliament, all the
Kings Edicts are void, unleſſe the Senate approve them; when as yet the Arreſts of that
Senate or Parliament, if the law be wanting, even obtain the force of a Law: So in
the Kingdoms of <hi>England, Spain, Hungarie,</hi> and the reſt, there is, and of old hath been
the ſame Law: For if Kingdoms depend upon the conſervation of their Laws, and the
Laws themſelves ſhould depend upon the luſt of one Homuncio, would it not be
certain, that the Eſtate of no Kingdom ſhould ever be ſtable? Would not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
neceſſarily ſtumble, and fall to ruine preſently, or in a ſhort ſpace? But if as we
have ſhewed, the Lawes be better and greater than Kings, if Kings be bound to obey
the Laws, as ſervants are to obey their Lords, who would not obey the Law rather
then the King? who would obey the King violating the Law? who will or can refuſe
to give ayd to the Law thus infringed?</q>

verily he received from the people, the other from his Parents. This diſtinction is
frequent in the Civill Law, wherein the patrimonie of the Empire is ſaid to be one
thing, of <hi>Caeſar</hi> another, the Exchequer of <hi>Caeſar</hi> one thing, the Treaſury of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike

who as Emperour is preferred before a private man in a pledge, may ſometimes be

have no private Patrimonie, but onely the Republike received from the people, in

For what? whether becauſe one hath made thee a Shepheard for his Flocks ſake,
hath he delivered it thee to fley, divide, doe with it, and ſtrike it at thy pleaſure?
whether becauſe the people have conſtituted thee a Captain or Judge of ſome Citie
or County, have they given thee power of alienating, ſelling deſtroying that Citie or
County? And ſurely there is made an alienation of the people together with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
or Countie, have they therefore given thee authority of ſevering, proſtituting,
enſlaving them to whom thou wilt? Furthermore, is the Royall dignitie a poſſeſſion,
or rather a function? If a function, what community hath it with a propriety? If
a poſſeſſion, whether not at leaſt ſuch an one, that the ſame people by whom it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered,
may perpetually retain the propriety to it ſelf? Finally, if the patrimonie of
the Eſchequer, or demaines of the Republike, be truely called a Dower, and truely
ſuch a Dower, by whoſe alienation or delapidation both the Republike it ſelf and
Kingdom, and king himſelf finally periſheth; by what law at laſt, ſhall it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to alienate this Dower? Therefore let <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> the Emperour be infatuated,
let <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixth king of <hi>France</hi> be diſtracted, and give or ſell the kingdom or a
part thereof to the Engliſh; let <hi>Malchom</hi> king of <hi>Scotland</hi> prodigally ſpend the
Crown land, and royall Treaſure, what will follow? Thoſe who have choſen a
king againſt the invaſions of Forraigners, by the folly or madneſſe of the king ſhall
be made the ſervants of Forraigners; thoſe who by this means would ſeverally deſire
to ſecure their Eſtates, ſhall all of them together be expoſed to a prey; thoſe things
which every one ſhall take from himſelf or from his pupils, as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he
mightendow the Commonwealth, ſome Bawd ſhall riotouſly conſume. But if, as we
have already often ſaid, kings be created for the peoples uſe, what uſe at all ſhall
there be, if not onely the uſe, but even the abuſe be granted? To whoſe good are ſo
many evils? to whoſe benefit ſo many loſſes, ſo many perils? If, I ſay, whiles I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to look after my liberty or ſafetie, I make my ſelfe a ſlave, I expoſe my ſelfe to
the luſt of one man, I put my ſelf into Fetters and Stocks? Therefore we ſee this Law,
as it is infuſed by nature, ſo likewiſe it is approved by uſe almoſt among all Nations,
that it is not lawfull for the king to diminiſh the Commonwealth at his pleaſure;
and he who doth contrary, is cenſured to play not the king, but Tyrant. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where kings were created, there was a neceſſity to give them ſome Revenues, by
which they might both ſupport their Royall State, but moſt principally ſuſtain the
Royall burthens, for ſo both honeſty and profit ſeemed to require. It pertained to the
Royall Office to ſee Judges placed every where, who ſhould not take gifts, and who
ſhould not proſtitute the Law to ſale; Moreover, to provide a force ready at hand
which ſhould aſſiſt the Law when ever there ſhould be need; to preſerve the wayes
ſafe, Commerce ſafe, &amp;c. but if warre were feared; to ſortifie Cities with a Garriſon,
to inviron them with a Trench againſt enemies, to maintain an Army, to furniſh
Armories. Now this is a know proverb, that peace cannot conſiſt without warre,
nor war without ſouldiers, nor ſouldiers without wages, nor wages without tribute:
Therefore to ſuſtaine the burthens of Peace, the demeſne was inſtituted, (which
among the Lawyers is called Canon) to defray the charges of warre, tribute; yet ſo,
as if ſome more heavy charge ſhould accrue, an extraordinary ayde given by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould ſupply; the end of all which verily, is the good of the Commonwealth,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115431:101"/>
ſo as he that converts it to his private uſe, is plainly unworthy the name of a king.

ſhould be ready at hand to tranſport men over Rivers, &amp;c. There were no Tributes of
Saltpits, yea, moſt of them were in the Dominion of private men; becauſe what
things nature did voluntarily give, they thought ought no more to be ſold, then
Light, Ayre, water. And whereas a certain King named <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> had begun to
impoſe a Tax on Salt pits, as if nature would not ſuffer her liberality to be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are ſaid to have been preſently dried up; although at this day,

deſired to be eaſed thereof: Yea, the Turkes themſelves call the Tribute of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<hi>The ſacred blood of the People,</hi> which profuſely to ſpend, or to convert to any
other uſe, but to defend the people, is a curſed act. Therefore what things ſoever a
King acquires in warres in every Nation, becauſe he gaines it by the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
he acquires it to the people, not to himſelfe, as a factor doth to his Maſter:
Moreover if perchance he gaine any thing by marriage (which I ſay, is pure and
ſimply his wives) he is thought to acquire it to the Kingdome, becauſe he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to marry that wife, not as he is <hi>Philip</hi> or <hi>Charles,</hi> but as he is King. On the
contrary, as Queenes have part of thoſe things which their husbands not yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opted
into the Kingdome have gained during the marriage; ſo plainly they have
no part of thoſe things they get after they have obtained the Kingdome, becauſe they
are reputed gained to the publike Treaſures, not to the private meanes of the King,
which was judged in the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> between <hi>Philip Valoyes</hi> and <hi>Ioan</hi> of
<hi>Burgundy</hi> his wife. Now, leſt the monies ſhould be extorted to ſome other uſe, the
Emperour ſweares, that he will impoſe no cuſtomes, nor enjoyne no taxes, but by
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115431:102"/>
the Authority of a publike Aſſembly. The Kings of <hi>Poland, Hungary, Denmarke,
England</hi> doe the like out of the Lawes of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. The French Kings here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
demanded Tributes in the Aſſemblies of the three Eſtates; Hence alſo is that
Law of <hi>Philip Valoyes; That impoſitions ſhould not be impoſed but upon great and
urgent neceſsity, and that by the conſent of the Three Eſtates:</hi> Moreover in times
paſt thoſe taxes were laid up in Caſtles throughout every Dioceſſe, and delivered to
ſelected men (they even now call them Elected) to be kept, by whoſe hand the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
enrolled in every Town, ſhould receive their wages, which was alſo uſually
done in other Countries, as in the Belgick; At this day at leaſt, whatſoever things
are commanded, are not confirmed, unleſſe the Parliament conſent. Now there are
ſome Provinces, which are not bound by covenant, but by the conſent of the Eſtates,
as <hi>Languedoc, Britain, Province, Dolphenie,</hi> and ſome others; and in the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi>
clearly all. Finally, leſt the Eſchequer, ſwelling like the ſpleen, whereby all
the other Members do pine away, ſhould draw all things to it ſelf, every where
a due proportion is allotted to the Eſchequer. Since therefore at laſt it appeares,
that the tributes, cuſtomes, demeſall, that which they call demeſnes, (under which
names Portages, Impoſts, Expoſts, Royalties, wrecks, forfeitures, and ſuch like
are comprehended) which are ordinarily or extraordinary given to Kings, were
conferred on them for the benefit of the people, and ſupportation of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and ſo verily; that if theſe nerves ſhould be cut in ſunder the people would fall
to decay, theſe foundation being under-mined, the Kingdome muſt needs fall to the
ground; it truely followes, that he who to the prejudice of the people burthens the
people, who reaps a gain out of the publike loſſe, and ſo cuts their throat with their
own ſword, is not a King, but a Tyrant: contrarily, that a true King, as he is a
ſurvey or of the publike affaires, ſo likewiſe an Adminiſtrator of the publike riches,
but not a proprietary Lord, who can no more alienate or diſſipate, the Royall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes,
then the kingdome it ſelfe; but if he ſhall demene himſelfe otherwiſe; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
as it is behoovefull to the Republike, that every one ſhould uſe his own proper
goods well, much more is it beneficiall for the Commonweal, that every one ſhould
uſe the publike eſtate well. And therefore if a Lord who prodigally ſpends his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
is by publike authority deduced to the Wardſhip of his kinſmen, and Family
and compelled to abſtaine from his poſſeſſions; then truly much more juſtly, the
Gardian of the Republike, who converts the publike Adminiſtration of all wealth
into the publike deſtruction, or utterly ſubverts it, may juſtly be ſpoiled, by thoſe
whom it concernes, and to whom it belongeth out of Office, unleſſe he deſiſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
admonition. Now that a King in all lawfull Empires is not a proprietary Lord
of the Royall patrimony, is eaſie to be manifeſted. That we may not have recourſe
to thoſe moſt ancient ages, whoſe Image we have in the perſon of <hi>Ephron</hi> king of the
Hittites,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.</note> who durſt not verily ſell his field to <hi>Abraham,</hi> without the peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;

into any other but the Publike uſe, he is thought to have violently uſurped. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
verily is he leſſe obliged by the <hi>Cincian</hi> Law, then any private Citizen among
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>France</hi> where no gifts are of force without the conſent of
the Auditors of the Accounts. Hence the ordinary Annotations of the Chamber
under prodigall kings; This Donation is too great, and therefore let it be revoked.
Now this Chamber ſolemnly ſwears, that whatſoever reſcript they ſhall at any time
receive from the king, that they will admit nothing which may be hurtfull to the
kingdom and Commonweale. Finally, the Law cares not how a Fructuary uſeth and
enjoyeth his profits; contrarily, the Law preſcribes the king in what manner, and
unto what uſe he ought to put them. Therefore the ancient kings of <hi>France</hi> were
bound to divide the Rents into four parts; one part was ſpent in ſuſtaining the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Church, and the poor, another upon the kings Table, the third on the

                     <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt had converted all things into his and his Officers luſts, and
that the Domeſtick accounts, which before had not exceeded 94 thouſand French
Crowns in ſuch a miſerable eſtate of the republike, had increaſed to the ſum of five
hundred and forty thouſand Crowns, is ſufficiently evident out of Hiſtories: Now as
the rents of the Crown were thus leſſened, ſo alſo the oblations and ſubſidies were
ſpent upon the Warre, as the taxes and tallages were onely deſtinated to the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
of Souldiers. In other Realms the King verily hath not any more Authority,
yea, in moſt he hath leſſe, as in the Germane and Poliſh Empire: But we would
therefore prove this to be ſo in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> leſt by how much any man dares
to doe more injury,<note place="margin">Ex Concil. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. in c. de his quae finit. a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis abſque conſ capit.</note> by ſo much alſo he might be thought to have more right. In
ſumme, what we have ſaid before, the name of a King ſounds not an inheritance, not
a propriety, not a perception of profits, but a function, a procuration. As a Biſhop
is inſtituted for the cure and ſalvation of the ſoul, ſo the King of the body, in thoſe
things which pertain to the publike goods; as he is the diſpenſer of ſacred goods, ſo
the King of prophane, and what power he hath in his Epiſcopall, the ſame, and no
greater hath the King in his dominicall Lands; the alienation of the Epiſcopall
Lands without the conſent of the Chapter, is of no validitie, ſo neither of the Crown
Land without a publike Parliament or Senate of the Eſtates; Of ſacred revenews
one part is deſigned to aedifices, another to the poor, a third to Companions, a fourth
to the Biſhop himſelf; the ſame verily almoſt we ſee the King ought to do in diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the revenewes of the Kingdom. It hinders not, that the contrary every where is
at this day uſurped: For the duty of Biſhops is not any way changed, becauſe many
Biſhops ſell thoſe things from the poor, which they ſpend upon Bawds, or waſt all
their Mannors and Woods; nor yet that ſome Emperours have attributed all kinde
of power to themſelves, for neither can any one be judge in his own Cauſe. But if any

there any thing more agreeable to nature, then that thoſe things which have pleaſed
us,<note place="margin">L. 1. D de pact. l. non minorem. 20 D de tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act.</note> ſhould be obſerved? Moreover, why doth the King ſwear firſt, at the peoples ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or requeſt, but that he may receive either a tacit or expreſſe condition? But why
is a condition annexed to a contract, but onely to this end, that if it bee not fulfilled,
the contract ſhould become voide in Law it ſelfe? But if through default of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the condition, the contract be voide in Law it ſelfe, who may call the people

might and ought to fulfil &amp; violating that law to which he hath ſworn? Yea, who on

whom the Lord hath committed felony or perjury, although the Lord truly doth not

Tables commands a Patron who defrauded his Client to be deteſtable: if the civil laws

whether if not theſe Rights, not theſe Solemnities, not theſe Sacraments or Oathes
ſhould intervene, doth not nature it ſelfe ſufficiently teach, that Kings are conſtituted
by the people, upon this condition, that they ſhould reign well? Iudges, that they
ſhall pronounce Law? Captaines of warre, that they ſhould lead an Army againſt
enemies? But and if ſo be they rage, offer injury, ſo as themſelves are made enemies, as

Now what is more repugnant to nature, then that a people ſhould lay chaines
and fetters upon themſelves, then that they ſhould lay their own throats to the

the ſame thing) promiſe it to the Prince? Therefore there is a mutuall obligation

the unanimous reſolutions and notable decree of the United <hi>Netherland Provinces.
Anno Dom.</hi> 1581. declaring <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> to be fallen from the Seigniorie of
the <hi>Netherlands</hi> for his Tyranny and breach of Oath, which is thus recited by
<hi>Grimſtone,</hi> and recorded in his generall Hiſtory of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> page 658, to 667.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In the alterations which happen ſometimes in an Eſtate betwixt the Soveraigne
Prince and a people that is free and priviledged, there are ordinarily two points,
which make them to ayme at two divers ends: The one is, when as the Prince ſeeks
to have a full ſubjection and obedience of the people, and the people contrariwiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
that the Prince ſhould maintaine them in their freedomes and liberties, which
he hath promiſed and ſworne ſolemnly unto them, before his reception to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie.
Thereupon quarrels grow: the Prince will hold a hard hand, and will
ſeek by force to bee obeyed; and the ſubjects riſing againſt the Prince, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
with dangerous tumults, rejecting his authority, ſeek to embrace their full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>In theſe firſt motions there happen ſometimes conferences, at the inſtance of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
who may have intereſt therin, to quench this fire of diviſion betwixt the Prince
and his ſubjects. And then if any one of the parties groweth obſtinate, and will not
yeeld, although he ſeeme to be moſt in fault, it followeth of neceſſity, that they muſt
come to more violent remedies, that is to ſay, to armes. The power of the Prince is
great, when thee is ſupported by other Princes, which joyn with him for the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of the example, elſe it is but ſmall: but that of the people (which is the body,
whereof the Prince is the head) ſtirred up by conſcience (eſpecially if the queſtion
of Religion be touched) the members ordained for their function, doing joyntly their
duties, is farre greater. Thereupon they wound, they kill, they burne, they ruine,
and grow deſperately mad: but what is the event? God (who is an enemy to all
tyranny and diſobedience) judgeth quarrels, weigheth them in his ballance of juſtice,
helping the rightfull cauſe, and either cauſeth the Prince for his rigour and tyranny
to be chaſed away, and deprived of his eſtate and principality; or the people for their
contempt and rebellion are puniſhed and reduced unto reaſon; which cauſeth the
alterations to ceaſe, and procureth a peace: whereof we could produce many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
both antient and moderne, if the relation of this hiſtory did not furniſh us

would he not give eare to any other reaſon, but what himſelfe did propound: the
which the ſaid Eſtates did not only find unjuſt and unreaſonable, directly repugnant
to their liberties, conſtitutions, and freedomes of the Countrey; but alſo contrary to
their conſciences, and as it were ſo many ſnares layed to catch them, which were in

they were forced to enter into all courſes of extremity againſt a Prince, which held
himſelfe ſo hainouſly offended, as no reconciliation could be expected, relying upon

even as a ſhepheard for the defence of his ſheep, and that the ſubjects are not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by God for the Prince, to obey him in all he ſhall command, bee it with God, or
againſt him, reaſonable or unreaſonable, nor to ſerve him as ſlaves and bondmen;
but rather the Prince is ordained for his ſubjects (without the which he cannot be a
Prince) to governe them according unto equity and reaſon,<note place="margin">See <hi>Meteranus</hi> and others.</note> to take care for them,
and to love them even as a father doth his children, or a ſhepheard his ſheep, who
putteth both his body and life in danger, to defend and preſerve them. If the Prince
therefore faileth herein, and in ſtead of preſerving his ſubjects, doth outrage and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
them, depriving them of their priviledges and ancient cuſtomes, commandeth
and will be ſerved of them as of ſlaves, they are no longer bound to reſpect him as their
Soveragn Prince and Lord, but to eſteeme of him as a Tyrant; neither are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
(according unto Law and ſeaſon) bound to acknowledge him for their Prince;<note place="margin">Note.</note>
ſo as without any offence, being done with deliberation and the authority of the
Eſtates of the Countrey, they may freely abandon him, and in his place chuſe another
for their Prince and Lord, to defend them: eſpecially, when as the ſubjects by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſuit, intreatie, and admonitions, could never mollifie their Princes heart, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
him from his enterpriſes an tyrannous deſignes: ſo as they have no other meanes
left them to preſerve their antient libertie, their wives, children and poſterity, for the
which (according to the lawes of nature) they are bound to expoſe both life and
good; as for the like occaſions, we have ſeene it to fall out often in divers Countries,
whereof the examples are yet freſh in memory. The which ought eſpecially to bee
of force in theſe Countries, the which have alwayes been and ought to be governed,
according unto the oath taken by their Princes, when they receive them, conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their priviledges and antient cuſtomes, having no power to infringe them:
beſides that, moſt part of the ſaid Provices have alwayes received and admitted their
Princes and Lords upon certaine conditions, and by ſworn contracts; the which if
the Prince ſhall violate, hee is by right fallen from the rule and ſuperiority of the
Countrey. So it is, that the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> (after the deceaſe of the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, his father of famous memory, from whom all theſe Countries were
tranſported unto him) forgetting the ſervices, which as well his father as himſelfe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115431:108"/>
had received of theſe Countries, and the inhabitants thereof, by the which eſpecially
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had obtained ſuch glorious and memorable victories againſt his
enemies, as his name and power was renowned and feared throughout all the world;
forgetting alſo the admonitions which his ſaid Imperiall Majeſty had heretofore
given him: and contrariwiſe, hath given eare, beliefe, and credit unto them of the
Councell of Spain which were about him; the ſaid Councell having conceived a
ſecret hatred againſt theſe Countries and their Liberties (for that it was not lawfull
for them to command there, and to govern them, or to merit among them the
chiefe places and offices, as they doe in the Realm of Naples, Sicilie, Millaine, at the
Indies, and in other Countries which are ſubject to the Kings command, being alſo
moved thereunto by the riches of the ſaid Countries, well knowne to the moſt of
them:) the ſaid councell, or ſome of the chiefe of them, have oftentimes given the
King to underſtand, That for his Maieſties reputation and greater authority, it were
better to conquer the Netherlands anew, and then to command abſolutely at his
pleaſure, than to govern them under ſuch conditions, which he at his reception to the
Seigniory of the ſaid Countries had ſworn to obſerve. The King of Spain follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this counſell, hath ſought all meanes to reduce theſe countries (ſpoiling them of
their ancient Liberties) into ſervitude, under the government of Spaniards: having
under pretext of Religion ſought firſt to thruſt in new Biſhops into the chiefe and
greateſt Townes, indowing them with the richeſt Abbeyes, adding to every Biſhop
nine Chanons to ſerve him as Councellors, whereof three ſhould have a ſpecial charge
of the Inquiſition. By which incorporation of the ſaid Biſhops, being his creatures,
and at his devotion (the which ſhould happily have been choſen as well of ſtrangers,
as of them which were born in the Country) they ſhould have the firſt place and the
firſt voyce in the aſſemblies of the Eſtates of the Country. And by the adiunction of
the ſaid Chanons, had brought in the Inquiſition of Spain, the which had alſo bin ſo
abhorred, and ſo odious in theſe Countries, even as ſlavery it ſelfe, as all the world
doth well know: So as his Imperiall Maieſty having once propounded it unto theſe
Countries, upon due information given unto His Maieſty, ceaſed from any more
ſpeech thereof, ſhewing therein the great affection which he bare unto His Subjects.
Yet notwithſtanding divers Declarations which were made unto the King of Spain,
as well by the Provinces and Townes in particular, as by ſome other of the chiefe
Noblemen of the Country, namely, by the Baron of Montigny, and afterwards by
the Earle of Egmont, who by the conſent of the Dutcheſſe of Parma (then Regent of
the ſaid Countries) by the advice of the Councell of Eſtate, and of the Generalty,
had to that end been ſucceſſively ſent into Spain: And notwithſtanding that the king
had by his own mouth given them hope, that (according to their petitions) hee
would provide for the contentment of the Country; yet that he had ſince by his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
done the contrary, commanding expreſly, and upon pain of his indignation, to
receive the new Biſhops preſently, and to put them in poſſeſſion of their new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks
and incorporated Abbeyes, to effect the Inquiſition, where they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
to practiſe it, and to obſerve the Decrees and Canons of the Councell of Trent,
the which in divers points doe contradict the priviledges of the Countrey. The
which being come to the knowledge of the Commons, hath given juſt occaſion of
ſo great an alteration among them, and greatly diminiſhed the love and affection,
the which (as good ſubjects) they had alwayes borne unto the King, and to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115431:108"/>
For they called chiefly into conſideration, that the King not onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to tyrannize over their perſons and goods, but alſo upon their conſciences,
whereon they held themſelves not to be anſwerable, nor bound to give account to
any one but to God only. For this cauſe, and for the pitty they had of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the chiefe of the Nobility did in the yeare 1566. exhibit certain admonitions by
way of a Petition, beſeeching him, that for the pacifying of the Commons, and
to avoid all tumults and ſeditions, it would pleaſe his Majeſty, (ſhewing the love
and affection, which as a mild and mercifull Prince he bare unto his Subjects) to
moderate the ſaid points, and eſpecially thoſe which concerned the rigorous Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
and puniſhments for matters of Religion. And to informe the King more
particularly thereof, and with more authority, and to let him underſtand, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
it was for the good and proſperity of the Countrey, and for the maintenance
of peace and tranquility, to aboliſh and diſannull thoſe innovations, and to moderate
the rigour of publike Edicts, for matter of Religion; the ſaid Marqueſſe of Berges
and Baron of Montigny, at the requeſt of the ſaid Lady Regent, the Councell of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
and the Generall Eſtates of all the Countries, went into Spain as Embaſſadors:
whereas the King, inſtead of giving them audience, and to prevent the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
delivered by them, (the which, for that they were not redreſſed in time, as
urgent neceſſity required, began in effect to diſcover themſelves throughout the
whole Countrey) by the perſwaſion and advice of the Councell of Spain, hee hath
cauſed all them to be proclaimed Rebels, and guilty of high Treaſon, and to have
forfeited body and goods, that preſented the ſaid Petition. And moreover (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelfe to be fully aſſured of the Countrey, by the Forces of the Duke of Alva,
and to have reduced them under his full power and ſubiection) he had afterwards,
againſt the Lawes of Nations, (the which have been in all ages inviolably obſerved,
yea among the moſt barbarous and cruell Nations, and moſt tyrannous Princes)
impriſoned, and cauſed the ſaid Noblemen Embaſſadors to be put to death, confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all their goods. And although that all this alteration (which had hapned in the
yeare 1566. upon the foreſaid occaſion) was in a manner pacified by the Regent and
her councell, and that the greateſt part of them which had preſented themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her for the Liberty of the Countrey, were retired, or chaſed away, and the reſt
brought under obedience: yet not to loſe the opportunity which the Councell of
Spain had long expected (as it appeared plainly the ſame yeere 1566. by Letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted,
which were written by the Embaſſador Alana to the Ducheſſe of Parma)
to have meanes under ſome pretext to overthrow all the priviledges of the Country,
and to govern them tyrannouſly by the Spaniards (as they did the Indies and other
Countries which had been newly conquered by them) he by the advice and councell
of the ſaid Spaniards (ſhewing therein the ſmall affection which he bare unto his
Subiects of theſe countries, contrary unto that whereunto he was bound, as their
Prince, protector and good Shepheard) ſent into theſe countries the Duke of Alva,
very famous for his rigour and cruelty, and one of the chiefe enemies of theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
with a councell of the ſame Humour and diſpoſition. And although that the
ſaid Duke of Alva entred with his Army into this countrey, without any let
or oppoſition, and was received of the poore Inhabitants with all reverence and
Honour, expecting all mildneſſe and clemencie, according unto that which the King
had ſo often promiſed by His Letters fainedly written; yea, that He was reſolved to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115431:109"/>
come himſelfe in perſon into the Countrey, and to order all things to every mans
content; the ſaid King having beſides all this (at the very inſtant of the Duke of Alva
his departure) cauſed a fleet of ſhips to be armed in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to bring him hither,
and another in Zeeland to goe and meet him (as the bruite was) to the great charge
of the Countrey, the better to abuſe his poore ſubjects, and to draw them more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
into his ſnares: notwithſtanding, the ſaid Duke of Alva preſently after his
arrivall (although he were a ſtranger, and not any way of the blood Royall) gave
it out, that hee had a Commiſſion from the King, of Governour Generall of
the Countrey, the which was quite contrary to the priviledges and antient
Cuſtomes thereof: and diſcovering his deſignes plainly, he ſuddenly put garriſons
into the chiefe Townes and Forts of the Countrey, and then he built Citadels in the
richeſt and ſtrongeſt Townes, to keep them in ſubjection. And by commandement
from the King (as they ſaid) he friendly called unto him, as well by letters, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
the chiefe Noblemen of the Countrey, pretending, that he had need of their
councell and aſſiſtance, for the ſervice of the King, and the good of the Countrey:
who (having given credit to letters) were come unto him, whom, contrary to the
priviledges, hee cauſed to bee carried priſoners out of Brabant, where they had been
apprehended, cauſing their proceſſe to bee informed before him and his Councell
(although they were no competent Iudges;) and before any due proofes were made,
and the Noblemen that were accuſed, fully heard in their defences, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to have committed Rebellion, cauſing them to be publikely and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
put to death. Others, who for that they were better acquainted with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards
diſſembling, were retired and kept out of the Countrey, were declared Rebels,
and guilty of high treaſon, and to have forfeited bodies and goods: All which was
done, to the end the poor inhabitants ſhould not aide themſelves in the juſt defence of
their liberty, againſt the oppreſſion of the Spaniards and their forces, by the help and
aſſiſtance of theſe Noblemen, and Princes. Beſides, an infinite of Gentlemen and
rich bourgers, whereof ſome he hath put to death, others he had chaſed away and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
their goods, oppreſſing the reſt of the good inhabitants, as well by the inſolence
of the ſouldiers, as by other outrages in their wives, children, and goods; as alſo by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
exactions and taxes, forcing them to contribute for the building of new Citadels
and fortifications of townes, which hee made to oppreſſe them, and alſo to pay the
hundreth and twintieth peny, for the payment of ſouldiers, wherof ſome were brought
by him, and others newly levied, to employ them againſt their Countreymen, and
themſelves, who with the hazard of their lives ſought to defend the liberties of their
Countrey: to the end that the ſubjects being thus impoveriſhed, there ſhould be no
meanes to fruſtrate his deſignes, for the better effecting of the inſtructions which had
been given in <hi>Spain:</hi> which was, to uſe the Countrey as new conquered. To which
end, in ſome places and chiefe Townes, he changed their forme of government, and of
juſtice, and erected new Conſuls after the Spaniſh manner, directly contrary to
to the priviledges of the Countrey. And in the end (thinking himſelfe free from all
feare) he ſought to bring in by force a certaine impoſition of the tenth peny, upon all
marchandiſe and handi-works, to the abſolute ruine of the Commons, whoſe
good and proſperity conſiſts chiefly in traffique and handi-works; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
many admonitions and perſwaſions made to the contrary, as well by every
one of the Provinces in particular, as by all in generall. The which he had effected
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115431:109"/>
by force, if it had not beene that ſoon after by the means of the Prince of Orange,
(and a good number of Gentlemen, and others borne in theſe Countries) baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Duke of Alua, following the party of the ſaid Prince, and being for
moſt part in ſervice, and other inhabitants affected to the libertie of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
the Provinces of Holland and Zeeland had not revolted, and put themſelves
under the Princes protection. Againſt which two Provinces the Duke hath ſince
during his Government, and after him the great Commander of Caſtile (ſent in his
place by the King, not to moderate any thing of his Predeceſſors Tyrannie, but to
purſue it more covertly and cunningly than he had done) force thoſe ſaid Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who by their Garriſons and Citadels, were made ſubject to the Spaniſh Yoke,
to imploy their perſons and meanes to helpe to ſubdue them: yet no wayes eaſing
the ſaid Provinces, but intreating them like enemies, ſuffering the Spanyards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colour of a mutinie, in view of the ſaid Commander, to enter by force in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Town of Antuerpe, and there to continue ſix weeks, living at diſcretion at the
poore Bourgers charge; ſorcing them moreover (to be freed from their inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies)
to furniſh foure hundred thouſand florins, to pay the ſaid Spanyards: which
done, the ſaid Souldiers (growing more bold through the ſufferance of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders)
preſumed to take Armes againſt the Countrey, ſeeking firſt to ſurprize
Bruſſels, and in the place of the ancient and ordinary ſeate of Princes, to make
it a neſt and den of theeves. The which not ſucceeding according to their deſigne,
they tooke A loſt by force, and ſoone after forced the Towne of Maeſtricht. And
ſince being violently entred into Antuerpe, they ſpoyled it, ſacked it, and waſted
it with fire and ſword, in ſuch ſort, as the moſt barbarous and cruell enemies could
not have done more, to the unſpeakable loſſe, not onely of the poore inhabitants,
but in a manner of all the Nations of the world, who had their Merchandiſe, debts,
and money there. And although the ſaid Spanyards by a Decree of the Councell
of Eſtate (to whom the King by the death of the great Commander, had conferred
the generall Government of the Countrey) were in the preſence of <hi>Ieronimo de
Rhoda,</hi> proclaimed enemies to the Countrey: yet the ſaid <hi>Rhoda</hi> of his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
authority (or as it is to bee preſumed, by vertue of ſome ſecret inſtruction
which he had from Spaine) took upon him to be the head of the ſaid Spanyards, and
their adherents, ſo as without reſpect of the Councell of Eſtate, he uſurped the kings
Name and Authority, counterfeited his Seale, and carried himſelf as a Governour,
and the Kings Lieutenant in the Countries. The which moved the Eſtates at the
ſame inſtant to agree with the Prince of Orange, and the Eſtates of Holland and Zee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
which accord was allowed by the Councell of State (as lawfull Governours)
that they might joyntly with their common forces, make warre againſt the Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards:
Omitting not as good ſubjects, but by divers humble petitions, to beſeech the
King to have regard unto the troubles, oppreſſions and inſolencies which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and were like to follow: and that hee would bee pleaſed with all convenient
ſpeed poſſible, to command the Spanyards to depart out of the Countrey, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thoſe which had been the cauſe of the ſacke and ruine of the chiefe Towns of the
Countrey, and other innumerable inſolences and violences which his poore ſubjects
had endured, to the comfort and eaſe of them which had endured them, and to the
example of others: yet notwithſtanding; the King (although that he made ſhew
by words, that what had hapned, diſpleaſed him, and was againſt his will, and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115431:110"/>
that he had an intent to puniſh the heads and authors, and to provide for the quiet
of the Countrey with all clemency, as it behoved a mercifull Prince) hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
neglected to puniſh the ſaid Heads and Authors: but contrariwiſe, (as it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
all was with his conſent and former reſolution of the councell of Spain, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
letters of his, intercepted ſoon after, do plainly ſhew: by the which it was
written unto <hi>Rhoda,</hi> and to the other Captains, authors of all the miſchiefe, That
the King did not blame that action, but did allow thereof, and commend it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to recompence them, eſpecially the ſaid <hi>Rhoda,</hi> as having done him a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ſervice: The which, at his return into Spaine, and to all other miniſters of the
oppreſſions that were uſed in theſe Countries, he did ſhew by effect. At the ſame
time, the King thinking the better to blinde the eyes of his ſubjects, ſent into theſe
Countries for Governour Generall, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of Auſtria, his baſe brother, as
being of his blood: who (making ſhew unto the Eſtates, that he did allow of the
Pacification of Gant, promiſed to ſend away the Spanyards, to puniſh the authors
of all inſolencies and diſorders which had hapned in the Countrey, and to take an
order for the generall peace, and the reſtoring of their ancient liberties) ſought to
divide the Eſtates, and to ſubdue one Countrey after another. By the permiſſion
and providence of God, who is an enemy to all oppreſſion, he was diſcovered by
the intercepting of certain letters, where he was commanded by the King to govern
himſelf in theſe Countries, according to the Inſtructions that ſhould be given him
by <hi>Rhoda:</hi> and to cover this practice, the King had forbidden <hi>Don Iohn</hi> to ſpeake
with him, commanding him to carry himſelfe unto the chiefe Noblemen with all
mildeneſſe and courteſie, to winne their loves, untill that by their aſſiſtance and
meanes, he might reduce Holland and Zeeland, and afterwards work his will of the
other Provinces. Whereupon <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> notwithſtanding that he had ſolmnly ſworn
in the preſence of all the Eſtates of the Countrey, to obſerve the ſaid Pacification of
Gant, yet contrary thereunto he ſought by meanes of their Colonels (whom he had
already at his devotion) and great promiſes, to winne the Germane ſouldiers who
were then in Garriſon, and had the guard of the chiefe Townes and Forts of the
Countrey, whereof by that meanes he made himſelfe maſter, holding himſelfe aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of thoſe places they held, and ſo by that meanes to force them that would not
joyne with him, to make warre againſt the Prince of Orange, and them of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
and Zeeland, and ſo to raiſe a more boody and inteſtine warre, than had been
before. But as all things that are treated cunningly and with diſſimulation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be long kept ſecret, <hi>Don Iohns</hi> practiſes being diſcovered, before hee could effect
what he had deſigned, hee could not bring his conceptions and enterpriſes to the
end that he pretended: Yet he revived a new warre, the which continues unto this
day, in ſtead of reſt and an aſſured peace, whereof hee did ſo much vaunt at his
coming. Which reaſons have given us great occaſion to forſake the King of Spain,
and to ſeeke ſome other mighty and mercifull Prince, to helpe to defend theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and to take them into his protection: and the rather for that theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
have endured ſuch oppreſſions, received ſuch wrongs, and have been forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and abandoned by their Prince for the ſpace of twenty years and more; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
the which the Inhabitants have beene intreated not as ſubjects, but as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
their naturall Prince and Lord ſeeking to ruine them by armes. Moreover,
after the death of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> having ſent the Baron of Selles, who (under colour
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115431:110"/>
propounding ſome meanes of an accord) declared ſufficiently, That the king
would not avow the Pacification made a Gant (which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
had ſworne to maintaine) ſetting downe more hard conditions. Yet
for that we would diſcharge our ſelves of our duties, wee have not omitted to
make humble ſuite by writing, imploying moreover the favour of the greateſt
Princes of Chriſtendome, ſeeking by all meanes without intermiſſion, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
our ſelves unto the King; having alſo of late kept our deputies long at
Cologne, hoping there (by the interceſſion of his imperiall Majeſtie, and ſome
Princes Electors) to have obtained an aſſured peace, with ſome moderate tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of Religion (the which doth chiefly concerne God and mens conſciences)
as the eſtate of the affairs of the Countrey did then require: But in the end we
found it by experience, that nothing was to be obtained from the King, by the
Conference at Cologne: and that it was practiſed and did onely ſerve to diſunite
and divide the Provinces, that they might with the more facility vanquiſh and
ſubdue firſt one, and then another, and execute upon them their firſt deſignes. The
which hath ſince plainly appeared, by a certain proſcription, which the King hath
cauſed to be publiſhed, whereby we and all the Inhabitants of the united Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Officers that hold their partie, are proclaimed Rebels, and to have forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
lives and goods: Promiſing moreover, a great ſumme of money to him that
ſhould murther the ſaid Prince, and all to make the poore Inhabitants odious, to
hinder their Navigation and Traffique, and to bring them into extreme deſpaire. So
as deſpairing of all meanes of reconciliation, and deſtitute of all other ſuccours and
ayde we have according to the Law of nature (for the defence of us and other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
the Rights, priviledges, ancient cuſtomes, and libertie of the Countrey,
and the lives and honours of us, our wives, children, and poſterity, to the end
they fall not into the ſlavery of the Spanyards, leaving upon juſt cauſe the King of
Spaine) beene forced to ſeeke out ſome other meanes, ſuch as for the greater ſafety
and preſervation of our Rights, Priviledges, and liberties, we have thought moſt fit
and convenient.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We therefore give all men to underſtand, That having duely conſidered all theſe
things, and being preſt by extreme neceſſitie, We have by a generall reſolution and
conſent, declared, and doe declare by theſe preſents, the King of Spaine, <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
jure,</hi> to be fallen from the Seigniory, Principalitie, juriſdiction, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of theſe Countries: And that we are reſolved, never to acknowledge him
any more, in any matter concerning the Prince, juriſdictions or demeanes of
theſe Netherlands, nor to uſe hereafter, neither yet to ſuffer any other to uſe his
Name as Soveraigne Lord thereof. According to the which we declare all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
private Noblemen, Vaſſels, and other inhabitants of theſe Countries, of
what condition or qualitie ſoever, to be from henceforth diſcharged of the Oath
which they have made in any manner whatſoever, unto the King of Spaine, as Lord
of theſe countries, or of that whereby they may be bound unto him. And for the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
reaſons, the moſt part of the ſaid united Provinces, by a common accord and
conſent of their Members, have ſubmitted themſelves under the command &amp; govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the high and mighty Prince, the Duke of Aniou and Alanſon, &amp;c. upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conditions contracted and accorded with his Highneſſe: and that the Archduke
of Auſtria, <hi>Mathias,</hi> hath reſigned into our hands the government generall of theſe
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115431:111"/>
Countries, the which hath been accepted by us. We enjoyn and command all Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Officers, and all others, to whom it ſhall appertain, That hereafter they forbeare
to uſe any more, the name, titles, great ſeal, or ſignet of the K. of <hi>Spain:</hi> and inſtead
therof, whilſt that the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> for his urgent affaires, concerning the good
and welfare of the Country, ſhall be yet abſent, for as much as ſhall concern the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
which have contracted with his Highneſſe, and touching the reſt by way of
proviſion, they ſhall uſe the title and name of the chiefe and Counſell of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
And until that the ſaid heads and Counſellors, ſhall be named, called, and really
eſtabliſhed in the exerciſe of their charges, and offices, they ſhall uſe our name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Holland and Zeeland, where they ſhall uſe as they have formerly done, the name
of the Prince of Orange, and of the Eſtates of the ſaid Provinces, untill that the ſaid
Councell ſhall be in force, and then they ſhall govern themſelves as it is agreed, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the inſtructions given for the ſaid Counſell, and the accords made with his
Highneſſe. And inſtead of the Kings ſeales, they ſhall hereafter uſe our Great Seale,
counter Seale, and Signet, in matters concerning the government generall, for the
which the Councell of the Country, according to their inſtructions ſhall have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And in matters concerning the policie, adminiſtration of Iuſtice, and other
private acts of every Province, the Provinciall Councels and others, ſhall reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uſe the name and Seale of the ſaid Province, where the matter ſhall be in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and no other, upon pain of nullity of the ſaid Letters, or Diſpatches which ſhall
be otherwiſe made or ſealed. And to the end theſe things may bee the better ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

ſubmitted themſelves unto any Emperour or King whatſoever (for ought can be proved or

condition, no Natian certainty would have conſented, had it been propounded to
them by their Kings at firſt, as <hi>Grotius</hi> well obſerves. <hi>This point of greateſt difficulty
and concerment, I have largely debated and confirmed already, in the third part of this
Diſcourſe, where all contrary Objections againſt it, are refuted; Yet becauſe it ſtill
ſeemes a ſeditious unchriſtian Paradox to many Malignants and Royalliſts, I ſhall
ratifie it with ſuch new Authorities, of all ſorts, which may happily convince, if not
convert them from their inveterate wilfull error.</hi>

                  <hi>My firſt Authority of this kinde, is that paſſage of</hi> Sozomon <hi>(an ancient Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall

turned both a</hi> Tyrant, Apoſtate, and Perſecutor <hi>of the Chriſtians) reputed to be
ſlaine by a Chriſtian Souldier of his own Army, for his Tyranny and impiety.</hi>
Whereas <hi>Libanius</hi> writes in this manner; Hee ſeemes to ſay, that the ſlayer of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
the tranſgreſſor was a Chriſtian, which peradventure was true; Neither is it incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
that ſome one of the Souldiers who marched under his colours, had conſidered theſe
things thus in his minde: That not only the Heathens, but likewiſe ALL OTHERS
are wont to applaud thoſe even unto our Age, who ſlew Tyrants heretofore, as thoſe
who for the liberty of all, feared not to undergoe the danger of death, and likewiſe
for the ſafety of their Citizens, Kindred and friends, with willing minds. And verily hee
CANNOT WELL BE REPREHENDED BY ANY MAN, eſpecially
ſince hee ſhould ſhew himſelfe ſo valiant and ſirenuous FOR GOD AND that
RELIGION which hee did approve, &amp;c. However it is certaine that he was taken away
by Gods divine judgement.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     </gap>piis Belli,</hi> layes down theſe ſeverall
Poſitions for Law, Num. 125. to 139. <q>That all the Inferiour Magiſtrates in the
Empire or other Kingdoms, collectively conſidered, are above the Emperour and
Kings themſelves; that if they be unjuſtly aſſaulted with unjuſt violence by any
whomſoever, they may by a neceſſary and juſt warre, defend both themſelves and
theirs, and repell and proſecute the unjuſt aſſailants. That if the Superiour Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
neglect to do his duty, (as if the <hi>Turke</hi> ſhould invade any Countrey, and the
Supreme Magiſtrate would not reſiſt him.) the inferiour Magiſtrate may call the
people to Arms, raiſe an Army, and exerciſe all forces policie and devices againſt the
common enemy of Chriſtians: Or if the Supreme Magiſtrate ſhould exerciſe manifeſt
Tyrannie, it is verily lawfull to the Inferiour to undertake the care of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
which he endeavours to oppreſſe with all his power: That thoſe who repreſent
all the people, as the Electors, Palatines, Nobles, Parliament, may admoniſh the
Prince of his duty, and ought to ſeek by all means to divert him from his Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and impious purpoſe; but if he proceeds, and repenteth not, being frequently
admoniſhed, but wilfully ſubverts the Common-wealth, obſtinately perverts Laws;
hath no care of faith, covenants, juſtice, piety; and tends onely to this, that he may
perpetrate any thing with impunity, and impiouſly reign over mens conſciences, then
verily he is accounted a Tyrant, that is, an enemy of God and man; whence, if he
hath proceeded to that hight of malice, that hee cannot bee expelled but by armed
force, <hi>It is Lawfull</hi> for the Electors, Palatines and others, to call the people to
Arms, and not onely to defend themſelves and others againſt ſuch a one, but plainly
to deject him from his Throne: For the intire Government of the Realm is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the people to the Prince alone, as neither the Biſhopprick of the whole
Church to the Pope, but to every one of the Nobles or Magiſtrates according to his
power: For the Nobles, as they are called into part of the honour, ſo of the burthen
of the Commonwealth; which is committed to the Prince, as to the Supreme Tutor,
but to them as Fellow-tutors, he having the firſt, they the ſecond place in governing
the Republike. The Prince ſwears that he will ſeek the good of the Realm, and all
the Nobles promiſe the ſame: therefore if he doth ill, they ought not to do ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
if the Republike go to ruine, they ſhall not continue: For the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is no leſſe committed to them, than to the King, ſo as they ought not onely
to do their duty, but alſo to contain the Prince within the limits of his duty: For if
the Prince doth ought againſt his Oath, they are not abſolved from their Oaths,
but rather then eſpecially ought to manifeſt their fidelity, when the Republike
requires it, becauſe they were ſpecially inſtituted for that end, as the Ephori, and
every thing ought to be reputed juſt, when it attains its end. Hence <hi>Brutus</hi> the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune,
and <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Governour of the City, called the people to Armes
againſt <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud, and by their authority expelled him the Ringdom. So
the Roman Senate judged <hi>Nero</hi> an enemy of the Republike, and condemned
him to the Gallowes; puniſhed <hi>Vitellius</hi> with death, ignominiouſly mutilated
and dragged thorow the City, and ſpoyled <hi>Maximinus</hi> of the Empire, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up <hi>Albinus</hi> in his place. Thus the French by Authority of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

                     <hi>Childericke</hi> the firſt, <hi>Sigebert, Theodoric,</hi> and <hi>Childericke</hi> the third of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Realm. Neither is it impertinent to pronounce the ſame ſentence of ſuch
a one, as was given of <hi>Manlius Capitulinus,</hi>

But if perchance moſt of the Nobles collude and connive, and being unmindfull of
their duty, take no care of the people; let there at leaſt be one who may admoniſh and
deteſt the invading Tyrant, and take care that the Republike ſuſtain no detrimen;
For the care of the Republike is no leſſe committed to him, than to the Prince and
his Collegues, and he hath plighted his faith to the Republike no leſſe than they.
If many have promiſed the ſame thing, the obligation of the one is not taken away
by the negligence or periury of the other. If there be many Truſtees, Executors, or
Guardians, the negligence default or fraud of ſome of them, doth not diſcharge or
diſingage the reſt; yea, unleſſe they to their power diſcharge their truſt and Oath,
they become perfidious, yea guilty of the ſame crime, and are ſubiect unto actions
for their neglect as well as the others: Therfore thoſe who are bound to the whole
Kingdom and Empire, as the Peers of <hi>France,</hi> the Electors, or to ſome certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey
or City which makes a part of the Realme, as Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earles, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables,

Quaeſt. 3. p.</hi> 177. to 106. To paſſe by his Diſcourſe concerning the reſiſting of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
who uſurp a Dominion without any Title, whom every man may juſtly reſiſt
and ſuppreſſe, and are bound in duty ſo to doe, as he there proves at large; I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tranſcribe what concernes them who have a lawfull Title. <q>Firſt (ſaith he) we ought
to conſider, that all Princes are born men. We cannot therefore expect to have only
perfect Princes, but rather we ought to thinke it well with us, if we have
gained but indifferent ones. Therefore the Prince ſhall not preſently be a Tyrant,
if he keep not meaſure in ſome things, if now and then he obey not reaſon; if hee
more ſlowly ſeek the publike good; if he be leſſe diligent in adminiſtring Iuſtice,
or leſſe fierce in propulſing warre. For ſeeing a man is not ſet over men, as if he were
ſome God, as he is overbeaſts; but as he is a man, born in the ſame condition with
them; as that Prince ſhall be proud, who will abuſe men like Beaſts; ſo that people
ſhall be unjuſt, who ſhall ſeek a God in a Prince, and a Divinity in this frail Nature.
But truly if he ſhall willingly ſubvert the Republike; if he ſhall wilfully pervert the
Lawes, if he ſhall have no care of his faith, none of his promiſes, none of Iuſtice, none
of piety; if himſelfe become an enemy of his people, or ſhall uſe all or the chiefeſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115431:114"/>
notes we have mentioned, then verily he may be iudged a Tyrant, that is, an enemy of
God and men. Therefore we treat not of a Prince, leſſe good; but of the worſt;
not of one leſſe prudent, but of a malicious and ſubtile one; not of one unskilfull
in Law, but of a contemner of Law; not of an unwarlike one, but of an enemy of
the people and waſter of the Realme. A Senate may aſſiſt him with prudence, a
Iudge with the knowledge of the Law, a Captain in the skilfulneſſe of warre; but
this man wiſheth the Nobles, Senators, Captain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of Warre one neck, that he might
cut them off at one ſtroake, neither hates he any more then them. The firſt verily,
though he may lawfully be removed, yet however he may be tolerated; the latter
contrarily, by how much the longer he is tollerated, the more intollerable he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes.
Moreover, as euery thing is not lawfull to a Prince; ſo often times, that
which is lawfull to the people, is not expedient. For frequently it may fall out, that
the remedy which is uſed, may be worſe than the diſeaſe. Therefore it becomes a
wiſe man to try all things, before he uſe the hot Iron; and uſe all remedies, before
he take up armes. If therefore thoſe who repreſent the people perceive any thing to
be done againſt the Republike by force or fraud, let them firſt admoniſh the Prince,
neither may they expect, till the miſchiefe grow heavie, and acquire forces. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
is like an heptick Feaver, which at firſt is eaſie to be cured, difficult to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
afterward it becomes eaſie to be known, but very difficult to be cured.
Therfore they ſhall withſtand the beginnings, neither ſhould they pretermit any
thing, though the ſmalleſt. But if he ſhall proceed, and not repent though frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admoniſhed, but tend onely to this, that he may commit any thing without
puniſhment; then verily he is really guilty of Tyranny, and they may act againſt
him, whatſoever they may uſe againſt a Tyrant, either by Law or juſt force. Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is not onely a crime, but the head, and as it were, the heap of all crimes. A
Tyrant ſubverts the Republike, makes a prey of all, lyeth in wait for the life of all,
violates faith to all, contemnes all the Religion of a ſacred Oath. Therefore is he ſo
much more wicked then any Theefe, murtherer, ſacrilegious perſon, by how much
it is the more grievous, to offend many and all, then particular perſons. Now if all
theſe be reputed enemies, if they be capitally puniſhed, if they ſuffer paines
of death, can any one invent a puniſhment worthy ſo horrid a crime?
Moreover,<note place="margin">Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> wee have proved, that all Kings receive their Royall Dignity from
the people; that all the people are better and higher then the King, that the King is
onely the ſuperiour miniſter and Ruler of the kingdome, the Emperour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<note place="margin">In Trastat. de Tyranno, &amp; in Tract. de reg. Civit.</note> but the people are the true head. Therfore it follows, that a Tyrant who commits
felony againſt the people as the Lord of the fee, hurts the ſacred Majeſty of the Realm
and Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Becoms a Rebel,</hi> and therfore falls into the danger of the ſame Lawes,
and demerits more grievous puniſhments. Therfore, ſaith <hi>Bartolus,</hi> he may be depoſed
by a Superiour; or be moſt juſtly puniſhed by the Julian Law, for publike violence.
Now all the people, or thoſe who repreſent them, as Electors, Palatines, Nobles
the Aſſembly of the Eſtates, &amp;c. are his Superiour. But and if he ſhall proceed ſo
farre, that he cannot be expelled but by armed violence, then verily it ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for them, to call the people to Armes, to raiſe an Army, and to practiſe force,
policy, ſtratagems, as againſt an adjudged enemy of his Country and of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale.

That lawfull which tends to the publike good, that unlawfull which tends to the
private. Therefore, ſaith <hi>Thomas,</hi> becauſe a tyrannicall kingdome which is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to the common good, but principally for the benefit of the Governour, is moſt
uniuſt; therefore the diſturbance of this Kingdome <hi>Hath not the reaſon of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
nor doe they fall into the crime of Treaſor.</hi> This crime is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a lawfull Prince; Now a lawfull Prince is nothing but a living Law: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he who kils the Law as much as in him lyeth, cannot be called by that name;
therefore thoſe who take up Arms againſt him ſhall not be guilty of that crime. It
is likewiſe committed againſt the Common-wealth, but becauſe the Repub. is there
only where the authority of the Law prevailes, not where the private luſt of a Tyrant
ſwalloweth the Republike, a Tyrant ſhall be guilty of that crime which offends the
publike Maieſty, &amp; thoſe be Vindicators of the Republike, who ſhall oppugne a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<hi>Ex Officio,</hi> ſupported with their own authority. Neither in this caſe, I ſay, doth
every one, but all the Subiects, but the Lords ſeem to require an account of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
from their agent: no more ſhall they be accounted perfidious for doing it;
there is every where between the Prince &amp; people a mutuall &amp; reciprocal Obligation;
he promiſeth, that he will be a iuſt Prince: they, that they will obey him, if he ſhall
be ſuch a one. Therefore the people are obliged to the Prince under a condition:
the Prince, purely to the people: Therefore if the condition be not fulfilled, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are unbound, the Contract void, the Obligation null in Law it ſelfe: Therefore,
the King is perfidious if he reign uniuſtly; the people perfidious, if they obey not
him who reignes iuſtly: But the people are free from all crime of perfidiouſneſſe,
if they publikely renounce him who reignes uniuſtly; or if they endeavour to evict
him with Armes who deſires to retein the kingdome unlawfully.<note place="margin">L. 160. D. de reg Iur.</note> Therefore it is
lawfull for all or many of the Officers of the Realme to remove a Tyrant. Neither is
it onely lawfull; but it lyeth ſo upon them of duty, that unleſſe they doe it, they
can no way be excuſed. Neither may Electors, Palatines, Senators, and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
think, that they were created and inſtituted onely for that end, that they ſhould
ſhew themſelves once peradventure in the Kings inauguration, attired after the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

in ſome ſhew repreſent the Round Table of <hi>Arthur,</hi> as they call it; ſo as after that
the multitude is diſmiſſed, and <hi>Calliopus</hi> hath ſaid, Farewell, they ſhould think they
had excellently played their parts. Theſe things are not ſpoken in jeſt, theſe things
are not perfunctorily done; theſe things are not the paſtimes of children, who as it

they are called unto part of that honor, ſo likewiſe of the burthen, and ſhew, that the
Republike is committed and commended to the King, as to the ſupreme and chiefeſt
Tutor, ſo alſo to them as fellow Tutors (even Honorari) aſſigned to him as obſervers of
his actions who hath the chief tutelage, who may daily exact an account of him, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115431:115"/>
diligently take heed, in what manner he reverſeth; ſo even theſe, that they might
obſerve the King (who,<note place="margin">L. 27. D. eodem.</note> as to his tutelary providence, is onely reputed in the place
of a Lord) that he doe nothing to the detriment of the people. Therefore as the
fact of him who acts the Gardian, is imputed to the Co-gardians, unleſſe where
they ought and are able, they ſuſpect and likewiſe take care to remove him; to wit,
when he communicates not the adminiſtration with them,<note place="margin">L. 14. D. de ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. &amp; peric. tut.</note> if he doe not faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manage the tutelage or care, if he admits fraud, if he doth any thing ſordidly
or perniciouſly to the Pupill,<note place="margin">L 3. de ſuſpect. tut. &amp; cur.</note> if he intercept any of the Pupils goods, if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an enemy to the Pupill; finally, if he be over rude, ſloathfull, unskilfull,
&amp;c. So even the Nobles ſhall be held guilty of the Princes deed, unleſſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move,
or prevent his tyranny, or ſupply his ſloathfulneſſe, with their vigilance
and diligence. Finally, as oft as the Gardian doth not doe in the name of the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pill,
that which any fit Maſter of a family would doe, he may not ſeeme to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
but that he may be the better defended, his Co-gardians are bound to
foreſee: So much more juſtly, if the Prince doth not act the houſholder but the
Enemy,<note place="margin">L. 10. &amp; 33. D. de admin. &amp; peric. tutor. &amp; Curat.</note> the Nobles may and ought to act againſt him, ſince they are bound by
his deed, no leſſe then by their owne. Moreover the Nobles may conſider, that
the King in governing the Republike, holds the firſt part, but they the ſecond,
third, and every one in his place. Therefore if he doth his part ill, they may not
follow him: if he deſtroy the Republike, they may not connive; for it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, as well as to him; and in ſuch ſort truly, that not onely they
themſelves ought rightly to execute their office by themſelves, but to containe the
Prince within the bounds of his office. Finally, as the King promiſeth, that he
will take care of the benefit of the Commonweale, ſo alſo doe they. Therefore
if he breakes his oath, they may not thinke, that they are abſolved from theirs,
no more then Biſhops, if the Pope ſhould defend hereſie or deſtroy the Church:
yea, they ſhould thinke themſelves ſo much the more obliged to performe their
oathes, by how much the more he ſhall violate his. Therefore if they collude, they
are reputed in the number of prevaricators; if they connive, of deſertors; and
TRAITORS, if they vindicate not the Republike from the tyranny of tyrants:
as finally they become Patrons, Defenders, little Kings, if they by all meanes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
and defend the Republike, which they have undertaken to protect. Theſe
things,<note place="margin">Judg. 5.</note> though they are ſufficiently firme of themſelves, yet they may be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
by examples. The Canaanitiſh Kings, who oppreſſed the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
with hard ſervitude, as well corporall as ſpirituall, (interdicting them both
commerce and armes) were true tyrants, I ſay in practice, yet not without a title;
for <hi>Eglon</hi> and <hi>Jabin</hi> reigned quietly almoſt twenty years: Now God extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtirred up <hi>Ehud,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Eglon</hi> craftily; and <hi>Debora,</hi> who routed the army of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin;</hi>
and by that meanes freed the people from tyranny: This was not verily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was leſſe lawfull to the ordinary Magiſtrates and Princes of the Tribes, and
the reſt to doe it, but <hi>Debora</hi> rather objecteth their ſloathfulneſſe and careleſneſſe

he had made war with <hi>France,</hi> in favour of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and <hi>Wenceſlaus, An.</hi> 1400.
although theſe may be called, not ſo well evill, as leſſe good Princes. Thus in the
Realme of <hi>England, Edward</hi> the ſecond, for his tyranny to his Subjects, eſpecially
the Nobles, whom he deſtroyed without hearing their cauſe, was at his Queenes
requeſt, adjudged unworthy of his Crowne by the Parliament. Not long ſince,
<hi>Chriſtierne</hi> in <hi>Denmarke, Ericus</hi> in <hi>Sweden,</hi> Queene <hi>Mary</hi> very lately in <hi>Scotland,</hi> were
deprived: which Hiſtories worthy credit teſtifie, hath beene frequently done in the
Kingdome of <hi>Poland, Hungary, Spaine, Portugall, Bohemia,</hi> and the reſt. But what
concerning the Pope himſelfe? The Cardinals, they ſay, becauſe they have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
him, or if they doe not their duty, the Patriarks, who are Primates next after
the Cardinals, may againſt his will, for certaine cauſes call a Councell, and in it
judge the Pope, if he ſhall ſcandalize the Church by his notorious offences; if he
be incorrigible, if reformation be neceſſary as well in the head as members; if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Oath he will not aſſemble a Councell, and the like; and <hi>de facto,</hi> we
read that many Popes have beene depoſed by authority of a Councell. But if (ſaith

                     <hi>Baldus)</hi> they be pertinaciouſly abuſed; at firſt they muſt uſe words, ſecondly,
herbes, that is, medicines; laſtly, ſtones; and where the truth of vertue ſufficeth
not, there the defence of weapons ought to prevaile. But and if by the ſuffrages
almoſt of all learned men, the Decrees of Councels, and the Acts themſelves done,
it be proved, that a Councell, as they ſpeak, may lawfully depoſe the Pope, who
yet boaſts himſelfe to be the Kings of Kings, and claimes as much to be above the
Emperour, as the Sunne is above the Moone; yea, alſo arrogates to himſelfe
an authority of depoſing Kings and Emperours at his pleaſure; who at laſt can
doubt, but that by the publike Councell of every Realme, not onely a tyrant, but
a King, pernicious to his Kingdome for his madneſſe or folly, may be depoſed or
removed?</q>

                  <q>Goe to now, in this our politicke Ship, the Maſter gluts himſelfe with wine;
moſt of his aſſiſtants either aſleepe, or drunke with mutuall cups ſportingly behold

which is expedient for the owner, or ſeemes ſpeedily to be wracked; what thinkeſt
thou is here to be done under the Maſter, by one who is vigilant and ſollicitous?
Shall he pull thoſe by the eares who are aſleepe, or onely jogge them by the ſides?
but in the meane time,<note place="margin">Plato. l. 8. &amp; 9. de Repub.</note> leſt he ſhould ſeeme to doe ought without their command,
ſhall he not afford his helpe and aſſiſtance to the indangered Ship? Truly what
madneſſe, or rather impiety will this be? Seeing then (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith) tyranny is
a certaine phrenſie and drunkenneſſe, the Prince may utterly ſubvert the Republike,
the moſt of the Nobles may collude, connive, or at leaſt are faſt aſleepe: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are Lords of the Republike, by the fraud or negligence of theſe miniſters,
which is their fault, are reduced into greateſt ſtraights in the meane time there is
one of the Nobles which conſiders the incroaching tyranny, and deteſts it from
his ſoule, what thinkeſt thou is now to be done againſt him by this man? Shall he
onely admoniſh his Colleagues of their duty, who themſelves doe as much hurt
as they may? But, beſides, as it is perillous to admoniſh, and in that ſtate of things it
may be deemed a capitall crime, ſhall he do like thoſe, who contemning other helps,
caſting away their armes, ſhall cite Lawes, and make an Oration concerning juſtice
among theeves,<note place="margin">L. 3. &amp; l. omne delictum. Sect. ult D. de re mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit.</note> in the midſt of a wood? but this truly, is that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moly ſaid, to
be madde with reaſon: What then? ſhall he grow deafe at the peoples groanes?
ſhall he be ſilent at the entrance of theeves? or ſhall he finally grow laſie, and put his
hands into his boſome? But if the Lawes appoint the puniſhment of a Traytor
againſt one wearing buskins on his legs, who counterfeits ſickneſſe for fear of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
what puniſhment at leaſt ſhall we decree againſt him, who either through
malice, or ſloathfulneſſe, ſhall betray thoſe whom he hath undertaken to protect?
But rather he ſhall command thoſe things that are needfull to ſuch as are wary by
a Mariners ſhout; he ſhall take care leſt the Common-wealth receive any detriment,
and ſhall preſerve the Kingdome even againſt the Kings wil and reſiſtance, by which
he himſelfe becomes a King; and ſhall cure the King himſelfe as a frantick man, by
binding his hands and feet,<note place="margin">C. nullus in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagin. Concil. Doctores Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificii.</note> if he may not otherwiſe doe it. For, as we have ſaid, the
univerſall government of the Realme is not committed by the people to the King,
as neither the overſight of the whole Church to the Pope, but to every one of the
Nobles according to his power. But certainely, becauſe concord proceeds from u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
that there ſhould be no emulation among Peeres, a King was inſtituted, who
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:115431:117"/>
ſhould hold the ſupreme place in the adminiſtration of the Common-wealth. The
King ſwears that he will ſeeke the ſafety of the Realme; the Nobles ſwear every one
the ſame by himſelfe: whether therefore the King or moſt of the Nobles neglecting
their oath, ſhal either deſtroy the Common weale, or deſert it being in danger, ought
the reſt therefore to deſert the Republike, or at leaſt be leſſe bound to defend it, as
if they were abſolved from their oath? But rather then eſpecially they ought to
ſhew their fidelity, when as others neglect it, eſpecially ſince they were principally
inſtituted for that end, like the Ephori; and every thing may then be reputed juſt,
when it attaines its end: whether truly if many have promiſed the ſame thing,
is the obligation of the one diſſolved by the perjury of the other? whether if ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
be guilty of the ſame ſinne, are the reſt freed by the fraud of one? Whether,
if many Co-gardians ill defend their Pupill, ſhall one good man be leſſe bound
with the burthen of the wardſhip through their default? But rather, neither can
they avoyd the infamy of perjury, unleſſe they endeavour to ſatisfie their truſt as
much as in them lieth; neither can thoſe exempt themſelves from the danger and
judgement of a Gardianſhip ill adminiſtred, unleſſe they implead the other Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
ſuſpected;<note place="margin">L. 3. D. de ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſt &amp; peric. tutor. &amp; cur. l. 3. D. deſuſpect. tut. &amp; curat.</note> when as verily one Gardian may not only implead the reſt ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and take care of thoſe to be removed, but alſo remove them. Therefore thoſe
who have promiſed their aide and aſſiſtance to all the Realme or Empire; ſuch as
Earles of the ſtable, Marſhals, Senators, and the reſt; or thoſe who have done it
ſpecially to any County or City which may make a part of the Realme; as Dukes,
Marqueſſes, Earles, Majors, and the reſt, are bound to aide the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale
oppreſſed with tyranny, or that part thereof, which the people have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them next after the King. And theſe truly ought to vindicate the whole
Commonweale from tyranny, if they be able; thoſe as Gardians aſſigned through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Counties, that part of the Realme whoſe defence they have undertaken: Theſe
I ſay, are bound to reſtaine a tyrant, thoſe to drive him out of their coaſts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Mattathias</hi> as one of the Nobles,<note place="margin">Maccab. lib. 1. c. 3. v. 45.</note> the reſt partly conniving, partly colluding;
when <hi>Antiochus</hi> tyrannically oppreſſed the Kingdome of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſpeakes thus to the
people ready to take up armes: Let us reſtore the ſtate of our people; let us fight for
our people, and our holy places: whence it plainely appeares, that we may not
onely lawfully fight for Religion, but for our Countrey; for an hearth I ſay,
no leſt juſtly then for our Altars, and take up armes againſt ſuch a tyrant as he
was: neither are they blamed by any, for recovering the Kingdome, but that they
claimed the royall dignity to themſelves,<note place="margin">Juſtin. l. 1. Diodor. l. 2. c. 37.</note> which pertained to the Tribe of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
Many pertinent examples to this purpoſe occurre in Hiſtorians. <hi>Arbactus</hi> governor
of <hi>Media,</hi> ſlew <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> ſpinning among women, and ſpending the royall
treaſure among whores. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>index</hi> Preſident of the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Galba</hi> of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
revolted from <hi>Nero,</hi> together with all <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> the Senate conniving
at his tyranny. But eſpecially that <hi>Laconick</hi> judgement is obſervable, which verily
proceeding from that Senate, ought to paſſe into a thing adjudged among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
When the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> poſſeſſed <hi>Byzantium,</hi> they made <hi>Clearches</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Army, Governour of the City, who taking corne from the Citizens,
diſtributed it to the forraine ſouldiers; but in the meane time the families of the
Citizens periſhed with famine. <hi>Anexilaus</hi> therefore, one of the Magiſtrates of the
City, moved with that tyranny, agreed with <hi>Alcibiades</hi> about the yeelding up of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115431:117"/>
his Countrey to him, and he ſoone after is received into the City. <hi>Anexilaus</hi> being
accuſed at <hi>Sparta</hi> for yeelding up of <hi>Byzantium,</hi> pleaded his cauſe himſelfe, the
<hi>Spartanes</hi> abſolved the man; becauſe they ſaid, warres were to be waged with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
not with the nature of things; now nothing is more repugnant to nature,
then, if thoſe who are bound to defend a City, became more unjuſt then the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Thus the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> determined juſtly, to whom ſcarce any good Kings
will not aſſent; verily thoſe who deſire to rule well, care not at all what is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
concerning tyrants, or what the Nobles or people themſelves may doe by
Law. But we muſt yet proceed further. Every one of the Mariners is bound, if the
Ship be endangered through the default or negligence of the Ship-maſter, to put to
his helping hand: every one of the Nobles is bound, if the Republike periſh by the
wickedneſſe or careleſneſſe of the Prince and his Colleagues, to helpe it, being
like to fall, and to vindicate the whole Kingdome, or at leaſt that part thereof
which is committed to him, from tyranny. But then ſhall it be lawfull for every
ordinary ſlave to doe the like? or peradventure ſhall it be lawfull to <hi>Herdonius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binus,
Euno Surianus, Spartacus</hi> the fencer, or, I ſay, to any private man to enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe
ſervants, to ſtirre up Subjects to armes, finally to combate with the Prince,
if tyranny urge them? No verily. The republike is not committed to ſingle or
private men, yea they themſelves are committed to the care of the Nobles and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
no otherwiſe then Pupils. Therefore they are not bound to defend the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publike,
who cannot defend themſelves. The ſword is not committed to every man
neither by God,<note place="margin">L. 1. c. de Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſis.</note> nor by the people; therefore if they draw the ſword without
command, they are ſeditious, although the cauſe may ſeeme to be juſt. Finally,
private men doe not make the Prince, but all. Therefore they ought to expect the
command of all, or of thoſe, I ſay, who repreſent all in a Realme, Countrey or
City, which may make a part of the Realme, or at leaſt of one of them, before
they attempt any thing againſt the Prince.<note place="margin">L. I. l. 9. D. de autor. &amp; conſil. tutor. &amp; curat.</note> For as a Pupill cannot bring an action
without authority of his Tutor, although the Pupill be truly a Lord, and the
Tutor onely is reputed for the Lord, as farre forth as appertaines to his tutelary
providence: So neither may the people doe ought, but by the authority of thoſe,
on whom they have transferred their authority and power; whether they be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Magiſtrates, or extraordinarily, created in a publike Aſſembly; whom, I
ſay, they have guirded with the ſword for this purpoſe, to whom they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
themſelves up to be governed and cared for;<note place="margin">Seneca l. 8. de Benefic.</note> who finally like that Pretor
of <hi>Rome,</hi> who judged betweene ſervants and maſters, are truly conſtituted in that
place, that if any contention ariſe betweene King and Subjects, they may ſhew
themſelves Judges and Redreſſors, leſt the Subjects themſelves ſhould pronounce
ſentence in their owne cauſe. Therefore if unjuſt cuſtomes or grievous taxes be
impoſed, if things be done againſt pacts or fraudulently, and yet not one of the
Nobles ſpeakes againſt or reſiſts it, let them thinke they muſt then ſit ſtill, and
thinke, that the beſt Phyſitians to prevent or take away a diſeaſe, doe oft-times
preſcribe the opening of a veine, the evacuation of humours, yea and ſcarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For ſuch is the nature of things, that ſcarce any miſchiefe can be cured
without another; ſcarce any good may be acquired without diligent labour. They
have the example of the people under <hi>Solomon,</hi> who refuſed not the grievous tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
impoſed on them for the building of the Temple, and fortifying the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115431:118"/>
becauſe they judged thoſe things to be impoſed by the publike Councell,
to the glory of God, the beauty and ornament of the Republike. They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the example of Chriſt our Saviour, who although he were the King of Kings,
yet becauſe he then ſuſtained a private perſon, he payed tribute willingly. If the
Nobles and Magiſtrates themſelves favour apparent tyranny,<note place="margin">John 34 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 30.</note> or at leaſt oppoſe it
not, they may remember, that for the ſinnes of the people, God ſuffers Hypocrites
to reigne; whom unleſſe they turne themſelves to God with all their heart, cannot
be overturned with any engines. Therefore there is no need of feet or hands,
but bended knees. Finally, they muſt ſuffer evill Princes, wiſh for better, and
thinke, they muſt beare that tyranny with a patient minde as they doe haile;
ſtormes, tempeſts, and other naturall calamities, or change their habitations. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
retired into the Mountaines, and ſpared <hi>Saul</hi> a tyrant, becauſe he was none of
the Nobles of the people: Chriſt, becauſe he was not of this world fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi>
to avoyd <hi>Herods</hi> tyranny. <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe he deſcribes the office of private Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
not of Magiſtrates, teacheth that they muſt obey <hi>Nero</hi> himſelfe. But if all the
Nobles, or moſt of them, or at leaſt one of them endeavour to reſtraine apparent
tyranny, or the Magiſtrate to drive it from that part of the Realme which is
committed to him, if he be ſuch a one, as under pretext of expelling it, may not
introduce another tyranny; then verily aſſembling together, they may run who
ſhall goe faſteſt to this choyce man, they may earneſtly aſſiſt with their feete and
hands, and as if God himſelfe had given a ſigne from Heaven, of a fight againſt
tyrants, endeavour to free the Kingdome from tyranny. For as God puniſheth
and chaſtiſeth the people by tyrants,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.</note> ſo likewiſe tyrants by the people: and that
is a perpetuall truth which <hi>Syrach</hi> ſaith; that Kingdomes are tranſlated from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Nation, for the iniquities, injuries, and wickedneſſe of Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
every tyranny continues but a ſhort ſpace. Thus the Captaines and ſouldiers care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
executed all the commands of <hi>Iehojada</hi> the High Prieſt, in revenging the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of Queene <hi>Athaliah:</hi> Thus all the godly men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> went to the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi>
partly that they might defend the true worſhip of God, partly that they
might free the Republike againſt the impious and unjuſt attempts of <hi>Antiochus;</hi>
yea God favoured their juſt endeavours, and gave them proſperous ſucceſſe. What
then? May not God likewiſe out of private men themſelves raiſe up ſome aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of tyranny? Cannot the very ſame who raiſeth up tyrants out of the people,
backed with no title, no pretext, to puniſh the people, likewiſe raiſe up deliverers
alſo out of the loweſt of the people? Cannot the ſame who enthralled the people
to <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Eglon,</hi> deliver the ſame people by <hi>Ehud, Barac, Deborah,</hi> and as it
were manumit them when they were deſerted by the Nobles? What therefore
ſhould now hinder, thou wilt ſay, but that the ſame God who hath ſent Tyrants
on us at this time, ſhould likewiſe extraordinarily ſend revengers of tyrants?
Why, if <hi>Ahab</hi> rageth againſt good men, if <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſuborne falſe witneſſes againſt
<hi>Naboth,</hi> ſhall not there be alſo a <hi>Iehu,</hi> which may extirpate the family of <hi>Ahab,</hi>
who may avenge the bloud of <hi>Naboth,</hi> who may caſt downe <hi>Iezebel</hi> to be torne
in peeces of Dogges? Verily, what I have anſwered before, as nothing hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the juſtice of God at any time, ſo not from his mercy. But yet
ſince thoſe evident ſignes, by which God was wont to confirme theſe extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
vocations of thoſe Worthies, are for the moſt part wanting to us in this age,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115431:118"/>
let the people take heed, leſt whiles they ſeeke to paſſe over Sea with a drie foote,
ſome Impoſtor being their Captaine, they fall not headlong into a gulfe, which
we read ſometimes to have hapned to the Jewes: leſt whiles they ſeeke a reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of tyranny, they perchance follow one, who, that tyrant being expelled,
will tranſlate the tyranny it ſelfe unto himſelfe: leſt finally whiles they ſeeke to
deſerve well of the Common-wealth, they militate to the private luſt of any; ſo as
that may fall out which hath hapned to many Republikes, eſpecially the <hi>Italian,</hi>
whiles that they endeavour to remove the preſent evill, they bring in a farre greater.</q>
I ſhall cloſe up this with three Authorities more; the firſt, of Mr. <hi>John Calvin,</hi> who
pleads as much for obedience to Tyrants and unjuſt Magiſtrates as any man: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit.
lib. 4. c. 20. ſect. 31. I alwayes ſpeake of private men:</hi> For <hi>if there be any popular
Magiſtrates conſtituted to moderate the luſt of Kings (ſuch as heretofore were the Ephori,
who were oppoſed to the Lacedaemonian Kings, or Tribunes of the people againſt the Roman
Senate; or the Demarchi againſt the Athenian Senate, and which power peradventure, as now
things ſtand, <hi>The three Eſtates in all Kingdomes enjoy, when they aſſemble)
I am ſo farre from inhibiting them</hi> to withſtand the raging licentiouſneſſe of Kings,
according to their duty:</hi> that if they connive at Kings outragiouſly encroaching upon,
and inſulting over the inferiour common people, I ſhall affirme, that their diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wants not nefarious perfidiouſneſſe, becauſe they fraudulently betray the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the people of which they know themſelves ordained protectors by Gods
ordinance. The ſecond is, <hi>Huldericus Zuinglius: Explanatio Artic. 42. Quando

our common Countrey afflicted by a more then barbarous and tyrannous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of Spaniards, we have beene forced and moved to unite our ſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and with Armes, Counſell, Men, and Money, to aſſiſt one another againſt

the Pacification laſt made; and all by the authority and conſent of the Councell
of State, committed by his Majeſty for the generall government of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries:
And as the pretended end of this Union requires all fidelity, conſtancie, and
naturall aſſiſtance for ever; and that we would not by any miſpriſion have cauſe

the Pacification, as alſo for the expulſion of Spaniards and their adherents (with
all due obedience to his Majeſty) for the good and quiet of our Countrey, and
the maintenance of our Priviledges, rights, Freedomes, Statutes, Cuſtomes, and

for their tyranny and miſdemeanors, notwithſtanding this their ſtile of <hi>Dei gratia,</hi>
or pretence of divine inſtitution: yea, we know that Biſhops have beene lately

Therefore tyrannicall degenerous Kings, may be juſtly reſiſted, cenſured, deprived,
as well as they, and royalties changed into other governments, by the peoples and
kingdomes common conſents, if they ſee juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>If any ſecondly object:<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>That Kings are annoynted at their Coronation;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

or exorbitant actions whatſoever.</p>
               <p>I briefly anſwer: firſt, that every Chriſtians Baptiſme, (being a Sacrament of
Chriſts owne inſtitution) at leaſt his ſpirituall unction and ſanctification, (as I
have<note n="i" place="margin">Part. 3. p. 89. to 94.</note> formerly proved) makes a perſon as ſacred, yea more holy, then Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting
(being no Sacrament) can, or doth of it ſelfe make the perſon of any
King whatſoever. A truth which no Chriſtian can without blaſphemy deny. But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,
and the inward unction of the ſpirit of grace and ſanctification, exempts no
Chriſtians from reſiſtance, cenſure, puniſhments of all ſorts, in caſe they commit
any exorbitant or capitall crimes; as experience tels us: Therefore Kings Coronation
annoyntings cannot doe it.</p>

all Kings perſons are reputed ſacred, as well as theſe foure who are annoynted; and
theſe Kings as ſoone as the Crowne deſcended to them, even before their Unctions
and Coronations were deemed as ſacred and inviolable as before; it is certaine, that
their very enoyling of it ſelfe makes no addition to their perſonall immunities

<hi>Suerus,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Birkebain,</hi> uſurped a Tyranny, twice defeated <hi>Magnus</hi> by warlike
ſtratagems, and at laſt utterly routed and ſlew him in battell; (notwithſtanding his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynting)
and uſurping the Crowne, renounced his holy orders, married a wife, and would

two competitors who were ſlaine, <hi>Suerus</hi> obtained the Royall Crowne, <hi>with myſticall

were ſecure by his frequent ſucceſſes, from the uncertaine end of a long proſpering tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

                           <p>IN the name of God Amen: We <hi>John</hi> by the grace of God, <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of the Church
of <hi>Mentz,</hi> Arch-chancellor of the ſacred <hi>Roman Empire</hi> throughout <hi>Germany,</hi> make
knowne to all men preſent and to come. What various, manifold, and grievous, as well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities
as diſcords, have for many yeares ſince beene brought into the holy Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
even to this preſent, and daily ſprouting up more abundantly to the moſt grievous
convulſion, imminution, and diſſipation of the ſacred <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> (which ought to be a
Garriſon to the Church of God and the Chriſtian world) as they cannot be all written, ſo the
miſchiefes daily increaſing do manifeſtly enough teach and confirme. And for this cauſe the
Lords Electors of the ſacred Roman Empire, the ardent petitions of the holy Church,
Princes, Nobles, Cities, Provinces, and Subjects of the ſacred Empire, intreating, deſiring
a prudent Moderator, have long agone very often and ſeriouſly, together with us admoniſhed
the moſt illuſtrious Prince Lord <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> both by their owne and
their friends labour, and finally by letters; and have diligently ſet before his eyes, privately
and publikely, his unbeſeeming and deteſtable manners and actions in governing, as alſo
the defects, incommodities and diſcords of the ſaid Church and Chriſtian world, likewiſe the
moſt grievous avulſions and diminutions of the members of the ſacred Empire, hurtfully
done, and permitted to be done, againſt the dignity of his name: to wit, that he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
peace in the Church, although the great neceſſity of the Chriſtian world, as likewiſe his
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115431:121"/>
office of Advocate and Defendor of the Church, earneſtly required it, and he hath alſo beene
frequently deſired, required, and admoniſhed to doe it: he notwithſtanding perniciouſly mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated
the Empire, and permitted it to be maimed in ſome members. In the number
whereof are <hi>Millain,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which were of the right of the ſame
Roman Empire, moſt ample emoluments returning thence to the Empire: in which Dominion
the <hi>Millainer,</hi> like a Miniſter, enjoyed it as a part of the Roman Empire; when as He, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that which became his ſublimity and dignity, receiving money, created a Duke of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and an Earle of <hi>Papia.</hi> Moreover, he hath alienated divers Cities and Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Empire, as well in <hi>Germany</hi> as in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſome whereof had returned to the
ſame, having little conſideration, that he ought to retaine them with the ſacred Empire.</p>
                           <p>Moreover, he hath ſold for money to his friends, very many naked and unwritten Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ratified notwithſtanding with the Seale of his Majeſty; wherein it was lawfull
both for them and others into whoſe hands theſe Parchments came, to write what things they
pleaſed under the royall Seale. Out of which thing, for the hurtfull diminution and diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the rights and emoluments of the ſacred Roman Empire, great complaints are riſen
up. Moreover he never had any care of the controverſies and warres, which (alas for griefe!)
have miſerably afflicted and ruined <hi>Germany,</hi> and other lands of the ſacred Empire.
Hence ſpoylings, burnings, and robberies have ſprung up, with ſuch lamentable encreaſes
even at this day, that none, neither Clarks nor Laicks, neither hasbandmen nor Merchants,
neither men nor women, whether by land or ſea, may converſe in ſafety. Temples, Monaſteries,
and religious houſes, which the ſacred Empire ought with its hand to aſſiſt and defend, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to rapines, and burnings, and reduced to deſtruction. Things are gone to this paſſe, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one might have handled, and may even now handle another at his pleaſure, againſt the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of right and equity, without any feare of the ſacred, and long deſpiſed Imperiall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
ſo as even the place of conventing any one, where the defence and patronage of
right may be undertaken in the name of the Empire, is altogether unknowne. Finally,
which is horrible and dreadfull to be ſpoken, both with his owne hand, and the hand of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wicked inſtruments he hath with him, he hath put to death, drowned in the waters,
burned in the fire, miſerably and cruelly deſtroyed, the reverend Biſhops of holy things,
Prieſts, and ſpirituall Paſtors, likewiſe many other men of honeſt note, againſt the rule of
right, otherwiſe then became the King of Romans. Which mentioned things verily, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other grievous wickedneſſes and dammages are ſo divulged and openly knowne, that
they can be no wayes excuſed or concealed. Therefore we, as we have fore-written, have
frequently very earneſtly beſeeched, admoniſhed, and required him, that renouncing this
unbeſeeming kind of life, he would take the ſtudy and labour to himſelfe, whereby he
might recover to the holy Church, oft-times imploring his aide, as King of <hi>Romans,</hi> and
her Advocate, peace and tranquillity, and to the ſacred Empire, its preſtine honours, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and finally its emoluments; to the aſſiſtance and conſolation of the Chriſtian
world, grievouſly debilitated and oppreſſed in this regard.</p>
                           <p>Now albeit we have moſt clearely explicated to the foreſaid Lord <hi>Wence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                    <desc>••</desc>
                                 </gap>aus,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to him in writing, theſe and other more grievous defects, concerning him as King
of Romans, and the Empire; yet having heard his anſwers, and having reiterated our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
exhortations, moreover having communicated the buſineſſe to the ſacred Roman Sea,
we have never as yet found him, to have amended his manners as became a King of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;
namely to recover peace to the Church, principally neceſſary to the Chriſtian world;
alſo to the ſacred Empire, its dignities, lands, and Dominions: a thing which is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115431:122"/>
knowne throughout all the Provinces of the Empire.</p>
                           <p>Therefore becauſe we could no longer neither conceale, nor endure the remembred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other defects, touching the ſacred Church and Empire, with grievous loſſe and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
by reaſon of the inſtant petitions of the perſons aforeſaid, but eſpecially by reaſon of
the Oath wherewith we are obliged to the ſame, as the next ſuperiour members of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Empire; therefore as of bounden duty, we were to adviſe and endeavour how the
ſacred Empire might be more rightly and wholeſomly provided for, (by whoſe madde and
negligent adminiſtration thoſe inconveniences have crept in) to the ſafegard and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Chriſtian world. And verily as He in obeying us, had performed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
thing, ſo we have ſufficiently and ſeriouſly called and cited him, ſo as wee have
ſignified to him; that unleſſe he ſhould be preſent at the place and day appointed, it would
come to paſſe, that both in reſpect of the petitions exhibited to us, as likewiſe in reſpect of
our Oath, we ſhould be compelled to take and enter into ſuch counſels, whereby the ſacred
Empire might be better ſetled: moſt clearely atteſting it in our letters. For this purpoſe
we appeared at the place and time preſcribed, together with our Coelectors ſufficiently
ſummoned, alſo with the other Princes and of the ſacred Empire, expecting from day to
day, whether the foreſaid Lord <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> would appeare, to apply a remedy to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
diſeaſes, and from thenceforth more rightly to conſult about the affaires of the ſacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
But he neither vouchſafed to appeare, nor yet to ſend any one to us in the name of a
Proctor. Wherefore when as by reaſon of ſo many pregnant and pernicious defects, we
had admoniſhed and reproved him very often in private and in friendly manner, but
after that, when we could doe no good, before the Princes and Nobles, and Cities of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
in divers Aſſemblies, not without great and grievous expences, yet without any fruit;
therefore we referred all the fore-mentioned things to the ſacred Roman Sea. But when
as neither then, he no whit regarded all thoſe things, we could conjecture nothing elſe from
thence, but that he had laid downe the care both of the Church and Chriſtian world,
but eſpecially of the ſacred Empire. Therefore reſolving, that this miſchiefe, deſtructive
to the whole Chriſtian Republike, was by no meanes to be any longer borne and tolerated,
with a minde well confirmed, after many and various debates and conſultations, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
our ſelves, as alſo with other Princes and Nobles of the ſacred Empire, ſeriously
had, for the ſafety of the Church, the conſolation of the Chriſtian world, the honour and
profit of the ſacred Empire, we have thought meet, that the foreſaid Lord <hi>Wenceſlaus,</hi>
ſhould at this time be wholly removed from the Roman ſacred Empire and all its dignity,
as one that is negligent and a deſtroyer of the Empire, and unworthy of it.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we <hi>John,</hi> Archbiſh. in the name of the foreſaid Lords Coelectors of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

notable defects and cauſes, by this our ſentence, which we give and pronounce by this our

as well of ſoules as bodies; as well of the Church as Common-wealth of

ſecond, King of <hi>France,</hi> to have made warre with the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth:
and that under pretext of ſuccouring and defending the Princes of the Empire, and
of the Proteſtants too; as alſo <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>England,</hi> was ready to
aide the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany,</hi> to make worke for <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth: But if any
danger may be feared from thence, or little gaine may be expected, then verily they
muſt heare moſt Princes diſputing, whether it be lawfull or no? And as thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115431:123"/>
a pretext of piety, did cover either ambition or gaine; ſo theſe pretend juſtice
for their ſloathfulneſſe; when as verily neither did piety exhort them, which
ſeekes onely the good of others, nor yet juſtice ought to dehort theſe, which looks
wholly abroad, and is as it were, caſt out of its owne doores. Therefore, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
both theſe, let us ſee firſt in the cauſe of Religion, what true piety, and what
true juſtice may perſwade. Firſt, let it be agreed, that there is but one Church,
whoſe head is Chriſt, and whoſe members ſo cohere and agree among themſelves,
that none of them; even the ſmalleſt can ſuffer violence or hurt, but the reſt are
hurt and ſuffer griefe, as the whole Scripture teacheth. Therefore the Church is
compared to a body. Now the body is oft-times affected not onely with
the hurt of the arme, or legge, but even of the very the leaſt finger, or periſheth
with its wound. Therefore in vaine may any one boaſt, that he is cordially affected
with the ſafety of the body, who when he may defend the whole, yet ſuffers it to
be torne and mangled limb after limb. It is compared to a building: Now, where
mines are made againſt any part of the building, the whole building oft-times fals
downe to the ground; and the flame which invades any part thereof endangers
the whole. Therefore he ſhould be ridiculous, who becauſe he dwels in the cellar
perchance, ſhould delay to drive the flame from the top of the houſe: He ſhould
be ſcarce in his wits, who would not prevent mines with countermines, becauſe
they are made againſt this wall, not againſt that. It is alſo compared to a Ship:
Now the whole Ship is endangered together, the whole periſheth together: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thoſe are equally ſafe who are in the fore part, as thoſe who are in the puppe;
thoſe who are in keel, as ſafe as thoſe in the ſhrouds, if the ſtorme rage: when ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
even in the common proveb, thoſe who are converſant in the ſame danger, are
ſaid to be in the ſame Ship: Theſe things laid downe, verily he who is not moved
with its griefe, burning, toſſing, is not of that body, is not accounted of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Chriſt, hath no place in the Arke. Yet he who is but a little moved,
ought no more to doubt, whether he ought to aide the afflicted members of the
Church, then whether he may helpe himſelfe, ſince in the Church all are one; but
rather every one is bound in his place to afford his helpe and aſſiſtance to them; and
ſo much the more helpe, by how much the more riches he hath received from
God, not ſo much to be poſſeſſed, as expended.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This Church as it is but one, ſo likewiſe it is univerſally and intirely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
commended to all Chriſtian Princes ſeverally: For becauſe it had beene dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to commit the whole Church to any one; and to commit the ſeverall parts
thereof to particular perſons, had beene clearely contrary to its unity; God hath
committed all of it to every of them, and its particular parts to any of them: Nor
yet ſo, as that they ſhould onely defend it; but alſo, that they ſhould have a care
to propagate it, as much as they are able. Therefore if the Prince of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
takes care of one part thereof, perchance the German or Engliſh; but yet
deſerts and neglects the other oppreſſed part, if he be able to relieve it; he is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to have deſerted the Church, ſince the ſpouſe of Chriſt verily is but one, which
he ought to defend and protect with all his might, leſt it ſhould be violated or
corrupted any where. The inſtauration of this univerſall Church as private men
are bound to promote with bended knees, ſo Magiſtrates, I ſay, are obliged to doe
it with their feet, hands, and all their ſtrength. Neither is the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Church
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115431:124"/>
one, the <hi>Coloſſian</hi> another, and the reſt; but all theſe particular Churches are parts
of the univerſall; now the univerſall is the Kingdome of Chriſt, which all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men ought to deſire; but Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, are bound to amplifie,
dilate, defend, and propagate every where, and againſt all whomſoever. Therefore
among the Jewes there was one onely Temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> which repreſented
the unity of the Church. Now he ſhould be a ridiculous Churchwarden, and to
be puniſhed, who ſhould take care onely to preſerve one part ſafe and ſound, but
ſuffer the reſt to fall to decay; likewiſe all Chriſtian Kings when they are inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
receive a ſword, of purpoſe to defend the Catholike or univerſall Church;
which taking into their hand, they point out all the quarters of the world, and
brandiſh it towards the Eaſt, Weſt, South and North, leſt any part thereof ſhould
be thought excepted. Since then they receive the protection of the Church in
this manner, without doubt they underſtand the true, not falſe Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ought to doe their endeavour to defend,<note place="margin">

Church, which they profeſſe to be true and pure. Now that thus it was obſerved
by pious Princes, examples may teach us. In the time of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi>
the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was long before enthralled to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> to

is in the Kingdome of <hi>Judah,</hi> and not alſo the univerſall, had beene committed to
<hi>Hezekiah;</hi> and if the bounds of the Realmes had been to be kept in defending the
Church, in the ſame manner as they are in impoſing tribute; without doubt <hi>Hez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
eſpecially at that ſeaſon wherein the Aſſyrians enjoyed the Empire of the
world, would have contained himſelfe: But we ſee that he invited by poſts all <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi>
the ſubjects, I ſay, of the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> to celebrate the paſſeover in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi>
and moreover that the godly in <hi>Iſrael</hi> helped them in pulling downe the high
places, even in the territories of <hi>Ephraim, Manaſſes,</hi> and the reſt. So likewiſe we
read that King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> a moſt godly Prince, purged not onely his owne Kingdome,
but the <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> likewiſe,<note place="margin">2 King 22.</note> then wholly ſubject to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> from
the worſhip of Idols.<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chron. 34. 6. 7. &amp; 35.</note> Verily where the glory of God, where the Kingdome of
Chriſt are in queſtion, no limits, no bounds, no railes ought to exclude or keepe off
the zeale of pious Princes. But if peradventure ſome greater feare hangs over their
heads, they may remember by the example of theſe, that thoſe who truly feare
the Lord, can feare no man. Theſe examples of pious Princes, ſince the time that
the Church, which was firſt circumſcribed in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> hath beene ſpread over all
the world, many Chriſtian Princes have followed: <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius</hi> were
both Emperours, he of the Eaſt, this of the Weſt: they were likewiſe colleagues
endued with equall power: Now it is known, what is commonly ſpoken; That
one equall hath no Empire over another equall: Yet notwithſtanding <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
made warre with <hi>Licinius:</hi> who being vexed, ſlew the Chriſtians, and among them
many of the Nobles, either for the cauſe, or for the pretext of Religion; by force
obtaines free profeſſion of Religion for the Chriſtians; and finally breaking his
faith, and reverting to his priſtine cruelty, he commanded him to be put to death
at <hi>Theſſalonica.</hi> This I ſay did <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, whoſe piety is ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
by the Divines of that age, that ſome of them will have that ſpoken of
him, written in the Prophet <hi>Eſay; That Kings ſhould become nurſing fathers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
of the Church.</hi> He being dead, the Roman Empire was divided between both his
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115431:124"/>
ſonnes by equall right, no prerogative being annexed to either of them. Of them,
<hi>Conſtans</hi> foſtered the Orthodox, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the elder, the Arrians; and he verily
expelled <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the enemy of the Arrians, out of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> Truly, if any
rules of bounds ought to have beene kept, it ought to have beene betweene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
Yet in the meane time <hi>Conſtans</hi> threatned his brother, if he reſtored not
<hi>Athanaſius;</hi> being ready to doe it by force, unleſſe <hi>Conſtantius</hi> had ſpeedily reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him intirely; Now if ſo be he doubted not to doe this, onely for the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of one Biſhop, might he not much more juſtly doe it, where ſome part of the
people is oppreſſed, when they implore aſſiſtance, when they deſire to defend their
Religion by the Nobles approbation?<note place="margin">Sozom. l. 7. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </note> So likewiſe <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> by the perſwaſion

releeve the Chriſtians perſecuted for Religion ſake, although they were truly privat
men, which ſurely thoſe moſt juſt Princes, who enacted ſo many Lawes, and who
had ſo great a care of Law, had never done, if they had imagined, that by this their
Act others territories and the Lawes of Nations had beene violated. Yea, to what
end were ſo many expeditions of Chriſtian Princes into <hi>Syria</hi> againſt the <hi>Saracens;</hi>
to what end were thoſe Saladinian Diſmes ſo oft impoſed; to what end ſo many
ſociall warres againſt the Turkes, ſo many Croſſadoes indicted againſt them, if it
be not lawfull for any Chriſtian Princes, even the moſt remote, to free the Church
from Tyranny, and Chriſtian captives from the yoke of bondage? Now with
what arguments were they impelled to the warre, with what reaſons were they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
unleſſe theſe, that the Church was one? that Chriſt called all whatſoever from
all quarters to this ſervice? that common dangers were to be repulſed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
armes? all which likewiſe doe plainely ſuite with this our cauſe. Now and
if this were lawfull for them againſt <hi>Mahomet;</hi> yea, not onely lawfull, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
as a reward was appointed to the induſtrious, ſo a puniſhment both to the
ſloathfull, and delayers; why not alſo againſt the enemy of Chriſt? If I ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Graecians beſieging our Troy; why not alſo againſt <hi>Sinon</hi> the incendiary?
Finally, if it be a pious act to free Chriſtians from bodily ſervitude, (for the
Turkes compell no man to it) is it not much more ſo, to manumit the ſoules of
miſerable men, and to reſtore them to liberty? And verily theſe ſo many examples
of pious Princes may be inſteed of a Law. But now heare what God himſelfe by
the mouth of his Prophets doth every where threaten againſt thoſe, who promote
not the inſtauration of the Church, or neglect its affliction. The Gadites, Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benites,

obtained their portion, that they ſhould goe before them, and be placed in the
forefront of them: Which if they ſhould not doe, he accurſeth them, ſmites them
with anathema, and compares them to thoſe who had beene judged Rebels at
<hi>Cadesbernea:</hi> For what? ſaith he, ſhall your brethren goe to warre, and you in

a crime the will it ſelfe ought to be regarded. But certainly, the murther, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of Chriſtian Princes, who helpe not thoſe who are perſecuted for Religion, is
ſo much the more grievous, by how much the more they ſlay, whom they might
ſet free, and by how much it is more wicked to ſlay a brother, than any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
A wickedneſſe more horrid than that of the Tyrants themſelves; by how
much it is worſe to ſlay a good, juſt, pious, innocent man, than a Theefe, impoſter,

to deliver from a theefe, if he be able, not a Jew onely, but likewiſe every ſtranger,
yea likewiſe one unknowne. Neither will any one diſpute, whether it be juſt to
defend himſelfe; ſeeing verily it is more juſt to defend another than himſelfe in this

the heathens themſelves, what humane ſociety, and what the common nature of
all men require of us in this thing. For <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, there is one nature of all men;
that even nature it ſelfe preſcribes this, that a man ought to take care of a man,
who ever he be, even for this very cauſe, that he is a man. If otherwiſe, all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
conſociation muſt neceſſarily be diſſolved. Therefore, as there are two foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of juſtice: firſt, that no hurt be done to any; next, that the profit of
all, if it may be done, be advanced: So alſo there are two kinds of injuſtice; one
of thoſe who offer injury; the other of thoſe who propulſe not wrong from
thoſe to whom it is offered, if they be able. For he who doth unjuſtly againſt any
one, incited either by anger, or other perturbation, he ſeemes as it were to offer
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115431:126"/>
violent hands to his companion; but he who doth not defend, or reſiſt an injury
if he can, is as much in fault, as if he deſerted either his Parents, or Friends, or
Country. So that what the one doth, anger is judged to doe, which is reputed
a ſhort fury; what the other, an evill minde truely, which is a perpetuall tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
And however his fury may be excuſed, the others deſtinated counſell can by
no meanes be excuſed. Thou wilt ſay, I feare that while I repulſe an injury from
him, I ſhould doe an injury to the other. Yea verily, thou wilt cover thine injuſtice
with a pretext of Juſtice; Whereas if thou conſulteſt with thy ſelfe, not juſtice
moves thee to deſert thy duty, but rather ſome other cauſe. For as he ſaith in
another place, either thou wilt not undertake enmities, or labour, or coſt; or elſe
thou art ſo hindered with negligence, ſloathfulneſſe, idleneſſe, or with thy ſtudies,
or certaine imployments, that thou ſuffereſt thoſe to be deſerted, whom thou
oughteſt to protect. But while thou ſayeſt, thou doſt thine owne buſineſſe, leſt
thou mighteſt ſeeme to doe wrong to any, thou runneſt into another kinde of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.
For thou deſerteſt the ſociety of life, becauſe thou beſtoweſt on it nothing
of thy ſtudy, nothing of thy paines, nothing of thy goods. Theſe things Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes,
Philoſophers, and Politicians hold, truely more piouſly than many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians

and rightly; for a Tyrant is in a ſort compelled to retaine violently the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
which he hath violently invaded; becauſe, as <hi>Tyberius</hi> ſaid, he ſeemeth
to hold a Wolfe by the eares, which he cannot retaine without force, nor yet let
goe without danger. Therefore that he may extinguiſh one crime with another,
hee commits many wickedneſſes, and is compelled to injure others, leſt he ſhould
be injurious to himſelfe. But that Prince who idlely beholds the wickedneſſes of
a tyrant, and the ruine of the blood of innocents which he may hinder, becauſe
he doth as it were take pleaſure in the gladiatory ſport, is by ſo much more crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous

it is not lawfull to thruſt a ſickle into anothers Corne: Neither truely do I adviſe,
that by this pretence thou ſhouldeſt invade anothers territories, uſurpe anothers
juriſdiction to thy ſelfe, draw thy neighbours corne into thine owne floore, which
moſt doe under this pretext.<note place="margin">Cic. 2. Offic.</note> I doe not ſay, that by the example of that arbitrator,
of whom <hi>Cicero,</hi> thou thy ſelfe ſhouldeſt judge the thing controverted to thy
ſelfe; but rather that thou ſhouldeſt reſtraine a Prince invading the Kingdome of
Chriſt, containe a tyrant within his limits, ſtretch out an helping hand to an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
people, and a proſtrated Commonweale; But thou muſt do it in ſuch ſort,
that thou mayeſt not looke after thine owne profit, but the good of humane ſociety
altogether. For ſince Juſtice wholly lookes abroad, injuſtice onely regards it ſelfe,
thou ſhalt at laſt doe this juſtly, if thou ſhalt have no regard of thine owne profits.
Briefely, if a Prince violently paſſeth over the fixed limits of piety and juſtice, a
neighbour may piouſly and juſtly leape over his limits, not that he ſhould invade
anothers, but that he ſhould bid him be content with his owne: yea, he ſhall be
impious and unjuſt, if he neglect it. If a Prince exerciſe tyranny over the people, he
may no leſſe, or leſſe ſlackly aſſiſt them, than him, if the people ſhould move ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
yea, he ought to doe it the more readily, by how much it is more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that many ſuffer, than one. If <hi>Porſena</hi> reduce <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud to <hi>Rome,</hi>
much more juſtly may <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſent for by the people and Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyrant out of the City. Finally, if a man may become a Wolfe
to a man, nothing truely forbids, but that a man may be a God to a man, as it is
in the Proverbe. Therefore antiquity hath enrolled <hi>Hercules</hi> among the number of
the gods, becauſe he puniſhed and tamed <hi>Procruſtes, Buſyris,</hi> and other Tyrants,
(the peſts of mankinde,<note place="margin">Cic lib. 2. Offic.</note> and monſters of the world) in every place. So alſo the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as long as it ſtood free, was often called, <hi>The Patrocinie againſt the
Robberies of Tyrants,</hi> becauſe the Senate was the haven and refuge of Kings, People,
Nations. So <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſent for by the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt <hi>Maxentius</hi> the Tyrant, had
God the Captaine of his Army, whoſe expedition the Univerſall Church exalted
with powerfull prayſes; when yet <hi>Maxentius</hi> had the ſame authority in the Weſt,
as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the Eaſt. Likewiſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, undertooke a Warre againſt
the <hi>Lombardes,</hi> being called by the Nobles of <hi>Italy</hi> to their aide, when as yet the
Kingdome of the <hi>Lombards</hi> was long before eſtabliſhed, and he could claime no
right to himſelfe over them. Likewiſe, when <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald King of <hi>France,</hi> had
by Tyranny taken away the Preſident of that Country,<note place="margin">Joan. Avent. in Anal. Boyorum.</note> which lyeth betweene
<hi>Seine</hi> and <hi>Liger,</hi> Duke <hi>Lambert,</hi> and <hi>Jameſius,</hi> and the other Nobles of <hi>France</hi> had
fled to <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Germany, Charles</hi> his Brother by another mother, to crave
aide againſt <hi>Charles</hi> and his mother <hi>Judith,</hi> a moſt wicked Woman: He in a moſt
ample Aſſembly of the <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, heard theſe ſuppliants, by whoſe unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Counſell, a warre was publickely decreed againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> for to reſtore the
exiles. Finally, as there have beene ſome Tyrants in every place, ſo likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Hiſtorians there are every where examples extant, of tyranny revenged,
and people defended by neighbour Princes; which the Princes now at this day
ought to imitate, in curbing the tyrants both of bodies and Soules of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
and of the Church of Chriſt, unleſſe they themſelves will be named Tyrants,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115431:127"/>
by a moſt deſerved right. And (that we may at laſt conclude this Treatiſe in one
word) piety commands the Law of God to be obſerved, and the Church to be
defended juſtice, that Tyrants and the ſubverters of Law and the Republike ſhould
be curbed; charity, that the oppreſſed ſhould be releeved, and have a helping
hand extended. But thoſe who take away theſe things, take away piety, juſtice,
charity from among men, and deſire them to be altogether extinguiſhed.
