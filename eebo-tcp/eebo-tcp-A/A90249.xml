            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Wherefore your Petitioners moſt humble deſire is, that you would, according to the reſpective Appeales of the ſaid Free Subjects unto this Supreame Houſe, be pleaſed to take their cauſe into the legall judgment, and ſpeedie determination of this Houſe, as the whole matter thereof ſhall be reported unto you, by the honourable Committee, for conſideration of the Commons Liberties, who have their whole manner of the proceedings againſt them, together with their reſpective defences ready to repreſent unto your Honours, and to grant unto them your indubitable juſtice (according to their late Petitionarie, and ſtill conſtant deſires) whereby they may receive the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of this Houſe, either for their preſent juſtification, or condemnation; that they may not be ruined and undone by an arbitrary and injuſtifiable Impriſonment. And if that, through the urgent affaires of the Kingdome, your occaſions will not afford you ſo much time, as to conſider and expedite their buſineſſe at preſent: Our humble requeſt is, that you would by an Order from this Houſe, forthwith ſet them free out of priſon; they giving legall ſecurity for their future forthcoming, until ſuch time as your honours ſhall be pleaſed to hand out to them full and effectuall Juſtice. And that you would be pleaſed, in caſe the principall Informers and Actors be found guilty, to grant them full and ample reparations according to the Law of the Land. And further, that you would take care, for the time to come, to free us and our children from the fear and prejudice of the like Arbitrarie and Prerogative-proceedings, according to your late promiſe in your moſt juſt Declaration of the 17. of <hi>April,</hi> 1646.
