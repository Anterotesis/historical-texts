         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O thou diuell, how hast thou wounded me?
I bewailed somtime the fall of Dinah and
Thamar; but now haue I felt far woorse

Aholla, and Ahollibah; but now am I fallen much

Bersabe, Rizpa, Tamer, and the Leuits wife; but
now haue I felt far woorse my selfe. I haue bewailed
heretofore the state of all sinners; yet now am I plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in them all. For I haue beene more bold than A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam;
more impudent than Memphetica Potiphers
wife; more shameles than Lots two daughters; more
wicked than Baara, or Salomen; and more bloudie
in persecuting than Iesabel. Dinah, and Thamer,
through violence offered them, were defloured against
their wils; but I with all greedines haue most filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
followed my fleshlie desires. Iudith decked hir selfe
brauelie of a right discretion and vertue, for the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

sighed, and thought it better to crie, and shrich
out, that she might so fall into the hands of hir eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and suffer death without the deed dooing, than to
sin in thy sight by consenting vnto their wicked wils;
but I both openly and priuilie haue followed too much
the deuises and desires of mine owne hart, and too soone
consented to those that haue burnt in lust towards
me. It was Dinahs libertie that brought hir to hir
fall; but it is mine owne wanton eies, mine owne rash
tongue, and mine owne wilful follie that hath brought
me to this sinfull fall and great confusion. And as she
was the cause, that manie of the Sichemites lost
their earthlie possessions and liues; euen so my lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
hath depriued me of the spirituall gifts, which
somtime haue flowed with heauenlie riches. And euen
as she being seuered from hir father and brethren, and

Bewaile me, O all ye virgins, that am deflou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

Let the fountaine of teares be opened, and gush

yet am I not vnworthie with continuall weeping and
crieng for grace to loose them. For seeing my soule is
constrained through greef of conscience, to powre forth
praiers to my God for his mercie and grace, it is meete
it should be done with great contrition of heart, and
continuall mourning. Consider therefore, O my soule,
what thou hast done, and what plagues thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
for losing thy virginitie. Ponder (I say) lament,
and remember O my soule, before thou end the short
pilgrimage of this life, how thine aduersarie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
like a roring lion, lies lurking in euerie corner to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1691:17"/>
deuoure thee, and sends out his messengers into all
places to entrap thee. O my God, what doo I see on
earth but engins to entrap me? What, I say, can I
behold, but baites to entise mee? Alas, and out alas,
what doo I heare? A co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession of mourners, a crashing
of teeth, and a great multitude of howlers. Wo is me
alas. For me thinks I see great flames of fire; huge
balles of wild fire, and fornaces full of boiling leade,
and all approching neere vnto me.</p>
            <p>Alas, what meanes these strange cries of monstrous
woormes? What diuelish spite doth thus inflame
them, and what firie flame doth so torment them? O
yee hellish hagges, frieng with heate, and frowning
with furie; why are yee so cruell to those that lie how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
amongst you? Is there no meane, no remedie, nor
no end of this your punishments, and are these O my
God the torments which are prepared for filthie forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators,
and contemners of thy commandements; of
which I am one, yea the cheef of all sinners? And must
I needs abide these infernall plagues? Then O my
soule, why art thou not afraid? And thou my hart why
dooest thou not rent in sunder? Alas, alas, how sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
yea and how greeuouslie the serieants of sinne
now seeme to arrest me? Alas I saie, what wicked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
mine aduersarie sinne hath found against mee?
But oh cruell sinne, whether wilt thou carrie me? And
thou my God, whither wilt thou leade me? If I haue
committed this horrible crime which deserueth death,
O yet remember I praie thee that thou art my Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
If I haue broken the bands of chastitie, O yet
call to mind that thou art my redeemer. O my God, if
I haue done any thing that deserueth death and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
yet forget not how that thou sheddest thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
bloud to saue me. And therefore, O my mercifull
God, be not so seuere, in marking what is done amisse
of me; but let thy mercie preuaile and couer all my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1691:17"/>
and open faults. Remember thou saiedst by the
mouth of the Prophet, <hi>I will not the death of a sinner, but
that he should conuert and liue.</hi> My God, which canst
not lie, what meanest thou to say that thou wouldest
not the death of a sinner, if thou throwe him into the
bottomlesse pit of hell? Dooest thou meane that thou
carest not for the death of a sinner, when thou commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
him to the slauerie of the diuell? Is this thy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
I say, when thou saiedst, I had rather he should
turne and liue?</p>
            <p>I am a sinner, O my God; if therefore thou haue no
delight in the death of a sinner, then who shall let thee
to take compassion vpon mee sillie woman? If thou
hadst rather he should turne and liue, then who shall
withhold thy countenance from me sinfull wretch? If
the hugenesse of my sinnes deserues a wound, the care
of so gratious a father prepares a salue. God forbid
that the wickednesse of a sinner, repenting hir of hir
sinne from the bottome of hir heart, should surmount
the mercies of so bounteous a Sauiour. O therefore
remember me most louing father, I beseech thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou art my redeemer, and take compassion vpon
thine vnwoorthie handmaid, because thou art my saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Respect not, O my God, the iustice due to so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
a sinner; but remember thy louing kindnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thy creature. Remember not, O Lord, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
of a sore transgressor, but call to mind the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of a louing sauiour. I confesse, O Lord, that my
sinnes both old and new, deserues eternall condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that no repentance is able to make satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the least of my faults, and yet by faith I am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of my saluation, bicause thy mercies surpasse thy
iudgements. Spare me therefore, O Lord, for my soule
appealeth from the seate of thy iustice, to the throne of
thy mercie. O deliuer me, because thou art almightie.
Oh saue me sinfull woman, because thou art mercifull,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1691:18"/>
and take compassion vpon me, wretched woman, for
thy beloued sonne Iesus Christes sake, who liueth

            <p>Oh thou God of all comfort, and father of all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
when thou art angrie with vs for our sinnes, then
shewest thou vs mercie, and in time of trouble and

hast commanded vs to doo in all our needs and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
beseeching thee to be mercifull vnto me, oh deere
God, and heare me thy poore handmaid and worke of
thy hands. Thou hast made all mankind of the mould
of the earth, and hast wrought in me and this man
that now woeth mee, according to thy good pleasure.
Thou hast regenerated vs by thy holie spirit, and new

not, nor may not come togither in marriage after the

manner of the heathen, which be ignorant, and knowe
not thee to be their God.</p>
            <p>Now therefore O louing father, to whome all harts

that therein we seeke nothing but thy glorie, and

I praie thee, suffer vs not to go amisse, but as a father,

we may liue honestlie and prosperouslie, euen as we
ought to thy honour: and either deliuer vs from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
lusts, and concupiscence of the flesh, and defend vs
from all slander and shame, whereby anie offence may
be giuen to thy people; or else in thy good time take vs
out of this earth and miserie. Thou knowest, O Lord,
that I haue not fished with poison, nor endeuoured to
allure him by deceipts &amp; charmes to loue me, and that
this coniunction of our minds is not begun in vs for
voluptuousnes nor of lust, but onlie in the feare of thee,
and for the desire of Christian societie and mutuall
loue, and the increase of godlie fruit, to the profiting of
thy holie congregation. We knowe, O Lord, that it is
thou onelie that prouidest the marriage, that hast
the harts of vs both in thy hand, and that giuest the
will to consent and make choice, or ordinarie election;
and that thy counsell standeth not in anie mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
neither can anie man alter or diminish thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
Wherfore I most humblie beseech thee, most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
father, that if this coniunction of our minds and
loue be thy worke and counsell, that thou vouchsafe, for
the glorie of thy name, to giue vs some token and true

our godly loue in thee, that thou wilt performe

            <p>But if it be a false persuasion, or temptation of the

good Lord, for thy deere sonne Christes sake I beseech
thee, so to alter our loue, and change our minds, so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Christ not onlie to be present himselfe at the nuptiall

the same thy spirit reioiceth in three things, which are

            <p>O eternall God, it is sufficientlie apparant with

which in the beginning didst create

didst bring hir vnto the man, that
she might be an helper vnto him;
and therefore thou causedst him to

man and his wife, as for whose sake he ought to leaue
father and mother, and to clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of our Lord Iesus Christ, &amp; his sanctified Church

against God, and of the wilfull breach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1691:39"/>
of his ordinance.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, oh Lord, sith it hath pleased thee to
match me in this most honourable state of marriage,
according to thy diuine prouidence; I beseech thee to
make him an head vnto me, and my selfe an helper vnto
him, according to my creation, and as thy holie institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
requireth. And because thy holie word is the onlie
rule, and ordinarie to gouerne and direct our liues; I
hartilie desire thee oh good God, giue this mine hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
thy grace and holie spirit, and so open thou his
wits and senses, that hauing by the light of thy grace
the true knowledge and vnderstanding of thy holie
word in all discretion, he may knowe how to walke in
his vocation, both towards mee his poore wife and
yoke-fellowe, and all others, as becommeth him, and
thereby become vnto me not so bitter a despiser and
hater, but a true louer, sweet freend, and godlie gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>Thou, O good father, seest the great lacke and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
that I thine handmaid haue, of a wise guide,
graue counseller, holie instructor, and continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter.
O therefore I beseech thee, looke vpon my
trouble which I endure; consider my reproofe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches
that I beare in my bosome; pitie my miserie,
ease me of so great a burthen, and releeue my great
need and necessitie. Make this my husband I saie, O
deere God, a head, a vaile, and defence vnto me for my
preseruation and safetie: for if we thus bite and deuour
one another, it cannot possible be, but we shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
one of another. Make him therefore tender,
carefull and comfortable vnto me thy weake creature,
if it be thy good pleasure; and grant, that according to
his promise made before thee, and as thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
else-where in thy holie word, he may with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

she that is heire togither with him of the grace of life,
that our praiers and godlie exercises to the benefiting
of our soules and bodies, be not interrupted or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Grant that he forsaking all other, may cleaue on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

that he may dwell with me as a man of knowledge,
and christian behauiour and gouernement, to thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
my comfort, and others edifieng.</p>
            <p>But alas, I must needs confesse vnto thee my God,

yea, the hatred and disdaine of my husband, thus

being fullie persuaded in my faith, that thou callest
none into perill and danger, but both thou canst, and
wilt at conuenient season deliuer them.</p>
            <p>Thou most gratious God hast commanded vs in all
our trouble to call vpon thee for aid and helpe: and not
only hast commanded vs, but also of thy mercifull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
hast promised to vs good deliuerance, saieng, Call
vpon me in time of trouble, and I will deliuer thee. O
good Lord, how greatlie doo these words comfort my
hart, and susteine my seelie soule? Who would not
greatlie reioice, that knoweth certainlie almightie
God to be present with him in his trouble? Saith not
God thus? Or euer they call (saith he) I shall answere
them. While they are yet but thinking how to speake,
I shall heare them. And in the Psalme, I am with him
(saith God) in his trouble, out of the which I will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him. What a comfortable Lord is this? He is
more readie to helpe, than we to call for helpe. He is
more readie to giue grace, than we to aske it. There
was neuer anie yet that with a pure faith asked grace
of his Lord, but he had it. Christ saith, Aske and ye shall
haue. Euerie one that asketh, hath. He that saith eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one, excepteth none. Uerelie, verelie, I saie vnto
you (saith Christ) whatsoeuer you shall aske my father
in my name, he shall giue it you. Our sauiour Christ
saith this, and he is God, and shall not I hearken to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1691:50"/>
my Lord Gods commandements &amp; promises? Uerelie
I will sticke surelie to it: for sure I am, that sooner shall
heauen and earth perish, than Gods promises be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed.
For albeit euerie man naturallie is a lier
and deceiuer, yet God is alwaies true and iust in all
his words and promises. I will therfore make my sute
vnto him, whome I need not go far to seeke: for he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie-where
present with his elect, and is nigh vnto
all them that call vpon him faithfullie, and thus will
I praie vnto him.</p>
            <p>FAther of mercie, and God of comfort and all consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I thy poore hand-maid humblie beseech thee for
Christ Iesus sake, and in his blessed and holie name,
that thou wilt vouchsafe to forgiue me all my sins and
trespasses, that I haue heeretofore offended in against
thy godlie maiestie, either in thought, consent, delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
word or deed; and that thou wilt heereafter during
my life, mercifullie preserue me from transgressing of
thy commandements, and dailie increase in me perfect
repentance for my sins, a sure purpose of amendment
of my life, and a diligent studie to walke in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.
Increase in me also a liuelie faith, a sure
hope and charitie. Ingraffe in me humblenes of hart,
meekenes of mind, cleannes of conscience. Grant mee
that I may be wise, sad, sober, discreet, circumspect, and
well aduised in all my saiengs, and that I may strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ouercome all the temptations of mine enimies, the
diuell, the world, and the flesh, and that whether I be
sleeping or waking, eating, drinking, or whatsoeuer I
doo, all may be to thine honor and glorie. Grant me also
that I may humblie reuerence my husband, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
loue him, and be obedient to all his honest, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and godlie requests. And chieflie of all, grant mee,
O Lord, that I may feare and dread thee: for well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
I am, that looke how high the heauen is in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the earth, and so great is gods mercie towards
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1691:51"/>
them that feare him. Looke how wide the East is from
the West, so far hath he set our sins from vs; yea, like
as a father pitieth his owne children, euen so is the
Lord mercifull to them that feare him.</p>
            <p>And as touching my deliuerance of this burthen,
and thy gratious gift, I am right well assured, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
thou prosper my trauell, all womens helpe, and all
physicke is in vaine: but my full trust is, that like as
thou hast created this child in me, and hast breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it the spirit of life; so at such time as shall be feene
most meete to thy most godlie maiestie, thou both canst
and wilt prosper the childs birth, and my deliuerance.
In consideration whereof, I humblie beseech thee of
thy fatherlie pitie to strengthen me, in this my dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
labour and trauell, and so susteine me, that I may
patientlie beare all my throwes, and pangs, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to thy promise, suffer me not to be tempted aboue
my strength, but in the midst of my temptation, make
a way to come out, that I may beare it.</p>
            <p>Increase my faith, O most mercifull sauiour Christ,
that I may constantlie beleeue thy word, which saiest,
Ye shall be sorrowfull, but your sorrowe shall be turned
into ioie. A woman when she trauelleth, hath sorrowe,
for hir houre is come; but when she is deliuered of the
child, she thinketh no more of the anguish, for ioie that
a man is borne into the world. I be seech thee therefore
in the dangerous time of my trauell, grant me speedie
deliuerance, and ioifull beholding of my child, that I
being a merie and ioifull mother, may render vnto
thee honour, laud, praise, and thanks, for thine aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
mercies, and gratious gifts and benefits.</p>
            <p>And finallie, aboue all things I beseech thy gratious
goodnes to endue my child with grace, that it may be
one of the number of thine elect, baptised, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the holie Ghost, and that at the yeeres of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
it may learne to knowe thee: and knowing

thee, may trust surelie in thy mercie: trusting in thy

            <p>These, most mercifull Father, be the principall ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
of thine inestimable riches bestowed vpon vs;
which the more excellent they are, the lesse are we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

towards thy maiestie, in dailie sinning more and more
against thee; in so much that feeling the same in our

when we call to mind thy sure and sweet promises in
Christs pretious blood, we are thereby refreshed, and
recouering strength by hope, approch to thy throne
boldlie, not offering anie thing for the satisfaction of
our sinnes, but onelie crauing, that the oblation of
thine annointed, which is the iustifier and sanctifier of

the sacrifice of our lips, better than the flesh and blood
of beasts, grant that we may finish our mortall race
in shewing foorth thy praise, and keeping thy holie

            <p>And forasmuch as thou hast thought good to set vp
thy seruant our Queene, a woman, and a fraile vessell,
ouer vs, to gouerne this kingdome, and that she must
render an account thereof (a hard thing so to doo) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

downe, we beseech thee, O Father, send downe such
grace from thy high throne, vpon thy daughter our

both willing and able simplie &amp; faithfullie to consult,
and also prouidentlie to prouide, aswell for thy church,
as for hir, and vs hir people.</p>
            <p>It is thy grace, O Lord, that we hir people renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

godlie and true teachers, to feed vs: and driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
all hirelings, and rauening woolues, from this
flocke of thine, and of thy sonne Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Besides this, so blesse vs the sheepe of thy pasture,
that we may neuer denie thee the chiefe honour, our
Queene thy deputie hir obedience, and our neighbours
mutuall loue.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, of thy goodnes mainteine peace and
tranquillitie, defend our Queene, hir kingdome and
countrie, from bloudie warres: and especiallie protect
hir, and vs, from hollowe harts, &amp; from ciuill tumults
and conspiracies, which haue shaken the greatest part
of Christendome.</p>
            <p>And bicause the affliction of euerie poore creature
apperteineth to hir, in so much as she is thine; inspire
the magistrates vnder hir with thy holie spirit, that
they may willinglie and carefullie mainteine iustice,
and prouide for the releefe of Christs poore members,
whose treasures both she, and we, and all others are,
whom thou hast blessed with thy earthlie benefites.
Heare our praiers, we beseech thee, for the sake
