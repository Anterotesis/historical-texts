         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Asting my eyes upon the Title of
your Pamphlet, I promised my
self a Diversion I have much co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted,
that is, a Vindication of
Mr. <hi>Dreyden,</hi> whose Pen at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is one of the most Ingenious
and Innocent Recreations <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
enjoys; when proceeding
to satisfie my Curiosity in the
Discourse as before in the Title, I perceiv'd 'twas my
Destinie to share with Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> in his Abuse; onely
with this difference: His Reputation, and my lost time
were the Preys. As for my Injury, I had let it sleep, in
respect that it was not onely mine, but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> general Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
But when I found Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> so coursly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
fearing such Discourses might be of ill consequence,
(as Presidents who make it a Mode to decry all Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
the Zeal and Reverence I had for Learning, Wit, and
Innocent pleasure, urg'd me (in this ensuing Treatise) to
vindicate <hi>him,</hi> who is so great a Patron of all those three
Virtues.</p>
            <p>The world is now so over-run with <hi>Wits,</hi> that <hi>Poets</hi>
have as hard a Task as Women's Parsons or Taylors, not
one in ten pleases. So numerous are the Criticks, so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
is Wit, and so elevated are their Fancies, that as a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59512:3"/>
               <hi>great Lady</hi> did, they forget Common Notions, and cry to
their servants, <hi>Give me, give me, give me, I think ye call it
a Pin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, your stomachs are now grown so squeamish, that
good solid Sense will not take; no, it must have Wit:
But if you hear a sentence which is a Jest with no Sense
in it, then away you run with that; 'tis Wit, 'tis Wit;
no matter for Sense. Now of this latter sort of Wit is
the <hi>Rota</hi> fill'd with, from whence sprung your Pamphlet
as Branches from the Root of a tree: neither are you
less severe; but as the Greatest Treasons are generally
Maqueraded, and acted privately, so is yours, who meets
him with a kiss, and then stabs him; Reprieves him in
your Title, and Condemns him in your Book.</p>
            <p>As on Mr. <hi>Dreydens</hi> behalf I cannot but be exceeding
sorrowful that the <hi>Rota</hi> so surpriz'd him, as to put him
in a Swound, <hi>(with his Critical Engines levell'd against
his sieges and Conquests)</hi> so on the Publicks behalf I
greatly rejoyce that you have found out such an easie
Expedient to recover one out of a Trance, as you say
<hi>Tweaking by the Nose</hi> is. Had you been Contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and of his Cabal, you must either
have conceal'd that Expedient, or you had confounded
him for a Prophet. But howsoever, I hope you'll be so
good a Commonwealths-man as to put it in <hi>Culpeper</hi>'s
Dispensatory at the Next Impression.</p>
            <p>I am altogether Ignorant whether your Expectation is
of succeeding Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> in his Lawrel. If so, your
War is Lawful. But the world is apt to censure it may be
with you as with some University-professors of Wit, who
having learnt one or two Sentences of Latine, or Divine
Clinches, make Discourses on purpose to extend them.
Some Authors are as thrifty of their Jests, as Chancery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Clerks
of their words, who allow but three a peny in
their Writings. But you are as free of your Wit and
Jests, as Citizens of Macquerel when they are Twenty a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59512:3"/>
Groat; that you may winde the house (where they are)
before you see it.</p>
            <p>Those Objections you raise against Mr. <hi>Dreyden,</hi> are
observ'd to be collected not so much out of Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>
as out of the <hi>Rota;</hi> which makes your Readers conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
you to be some Itinerant Pastor, that takes Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
at <hi>London</hi>-Scrmons, and then in the Country vents
them for his own, and makes them fit any Text, though
the Foppery be the same.
<q>
                  <l>You were gay-humour'd, and you are</l>
                  <l>Now pensive;</l>
                  <l>Once calm, and now unquiet.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here you have borrow'd an Objection from the <hi>Rota,</hi>
and for want of French fallen into their Mistake: for
<hi>Gay-humour'd</hi> is nothing else but <hi>Gayeté du Coeur,</hi> and an
expression that may be apply'd without forfeiture of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to any person how great soever. Besides, if this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
were not resin'd enough for a Privie Counsellor
to salute his Soveraign with, yet it were for a Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid,
she never being bred up at the University.
<q>
                  <l>Ev'n as the fearful Hare when cours'd on Plain,</l>
                  <l>and longer can't her flight maintain;</l>
                  <l>By the fierce Dog, with flix turn'd up does lie,</l>
                  <l>Who though not kill'd, yet cannot flie.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Here I finde the main scruple which troubles his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is, why Mr. <hi>Dreyden calls fearful, so timerous a
creature as a Hare naturally is?</hi> To which I Reply:
Why do we say, <hi>Cruel Tyrant,</hi> or <hi>Wicked Rogue?</hi> since
a Tyrant naturally is so Cruel, and a Rogue so Wicked:
for a Tyrant hath as little mercy; and Rogue goodness,
as an Hare valour. <hi>Pavidum<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  </expan> Leporem,</hi> says <hi>Horace,</hi>
Epist. 2. Also this Simile was appl'd onely to the Ship,
and not to the Prince; wherefore it injures not him: and
I believe the Ship never askt for Justice against Mr. <hi>Drey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s
Simile.</p>
            <p>Methinks the Gentleman who was so Indulgent to Mr.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59512:4"/>
               <hi>Dreydens</hi> Reputation, should have a little consider'd his
own, and retain'd that Wit for himself which he so free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bestows on Mr. <hi>Dreyden,</hi> when he turns
<q>
                  <l>This is my Will, <hi>&amp;c. into</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>This is my Wit, and this my Wit shall be.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He might e'en as well have said,
<q>I love Wit, but Wit loveth not me.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As Sir <hi>Roger</hi> saith of Tobacco in the Play, when it
makes him sick:
<q>I love it, but it loveth not me: this is my will, and
this I will have done.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the Descant upon these words, I finde the Author
of the <hi>Rota</hi> goes a little beyond our Vindicator, and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
with the Chiming of the two words <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi>
whereas that Ingemination addes a further grace and
force to the Authority of the Resolution. Neither can it
properly be call'd a Tautologie, the inculcating of a
Command; as if a man should say, <hi>You shall, you shall, I
say you shall do't;</hi> where's the Chime or the Absurdity
of the same thing again? But here we have reason to
imagine that worthy Gentleman (who was so indulgent
to Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>'s Repute) had more experience in Limn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then Poetry, by his discourse of Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>'s pale and
Vermilion cheeks; which terms of Art are to hint you
of his skill in Polygraphy. He does like a Country-Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in a Coffee-house, that brings in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8's Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
or <hi>Dalton,</hi> upon all occasions, to shew his Reading;
or as some Apothecaries, that will run you over all the
Titles of their Gally-pots, to be thought Doctors. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the same indulgent party complains of the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Sawcie</hi> with <hi>Boldness,</hi> in the <hi>Maiden-Queen.</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>I must tell you it is a sawcie</l>
                  <l>Boldness thus to press on my Retirements.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, and to make these words seem more Ridiculous,
he says that <hi>Saucie-Boldness</hi> is a pretty Sawcebox-word.
Truly a very ingenious Quibble: A man would almost
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59512:4"/>
swear this Gentleman to be the Poetaster that in a Reply
upon <hi>Doctor Wild's Poems,</hi> Christen'd him the <hi>Wild Poet.</hi>
But for his better information, the Epithet of <hi>Sawcie</hi>
serves very well to distinguish an <hi>Impudent</hi> or an <hi>Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Boldness,</hi> from a <hi>generous:</hi> as put the case, A man
should take the freedom to pass a Judgement upon the
<hi>Boldness</hi> of the <hi>vindicator;</hi> there is a <hi>Boldness</hi> in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Style of a man that writes better than himself;
and that's an <hi>Arrogant Boldness:</hi> there is a <hi>Boldness</hi> of
censuring a man that lives better than himself; and that's
a <hi>Scandalous Boldness:</hi> and then there's the <hi>Boldness</hi> of
<hi>Blind Bayard,</hi> that makes a man run his head against
Stone-walls; and that's a <hi>Bruital Boldness.</hi> I shall leave
the <hi>Vindicator</hi> to take his Choice: for my Business is
onely to prove that <hi>Boldness</hi> requires an <hi>Epithet</hi> to clear
it. Another of your Comerades condemns Mr. <hi>Drey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>'s
Fiction in <hi>Tyrannick Love,</hi> pag. 4.
<q>
                  <l>-Midst this was heard the <hi>Shrill</hi> and <hi>Tender</hi> cry</l>
                  <l>Of well-pleas'd Ghosts which in the storm did fly,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Danc'd</hi> to and fro, and skim'd along the Ground,</l>
                  <l>Till to the Magick Circle they were bound—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon these Lines I perceive the Worthy Gentleman is
offended that Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> permits his Ghosts to <hi>Sing and
Dance:</hi> which is no great matter to him, so long as he is
at no Charge either for <hi>Singing-master</hi> or <hi>Dancing-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
But his chief Cavil is at the words <hi>Shrill</hi> and <hi>Tender</hi>
as inconsistent; which most ingeniously he illustrates by
<hi>Harsh</hi> and <hi>Gentle.</hi> Now if Ghosts in general may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
I beseech you let us imagine withal, that there is
something for them to do; and it shall be all one to me

well as when they were Men and Women? I am sure if
<hi>Valeria</hi>'s <hi>Ghost</hi> in <hi>Tyrannick Love</hi> speaks truth, they do:
for she says,
<q>
                  <l>—That after death we Sprights have just such Natures.</l>
                  <l>We had for all the world when Humane creatures.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Your next Quarrel is at these Lines in <hi>Maximin:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—They <hi>Coursing</hi> it <hi>as He were</hi> fenc'd within,</l>
                  <l>And saw this dreadful Scene of Fate begin.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Your Asterism * upon <hi>They,</hi> and then your Marginal
Comment upon it, <hi>viz. The Rota Coursing his Muse,</hi> has
left us more in the Dark then we were before: for I hope
you do not intend to make a pack of Curs of the Cabal,
or that his Muse is brought upon the Stage to be baited
to death, as the Primitive Christians were upon the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre.
But your main Criticism lies upon placing <hi>as he
were</hi> in stead of <hi>while we were:</hi> whence arise two diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
<hi>viz.</hi> upon <hi>as</hi> in stead of <hi>while;</hi> and then <hi>he</hi> for
<hi>we.</hi> The <hi>latter</hi> was manifestly the Printers mistake; the
<hi>former</hi> seems to me to be none at all: for <hi>as</hi> and <hi>while</hi> are
very commonly and warrantably us'd to the same purpose;
for Instance, <hi>As</hi> I was in my Chamber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why not <hi>As</hi> as
well as <hi>while?</hi> But some people love to play with
words, as a Cat with a Feather, or an Ape with a pair
of Breeches; sometimes with his head out at the Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes,
sometimes at the Codpiece, sometimes at the Waste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
when the Breeches are the same still, which way
soever he turns them. Again, I perceive you are much
disgusted with those Lines of <hi>Maximin:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Provoke my Rage no further, lest I be</l>
                  <l>Reveng'd at once upon the Gods and thee.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where you accuse Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> for Profaneness. This
Nicety perchance may advance the sale of your Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the pretended Zealots; yes, and your Reputation
too; although it were as absurd to make an Atheist speak
piously, as a pious man Atheistically: but the sound of
Religion goes a great way with those that place it rather
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59512:5"/>
in the Accent than in the Practice. And methinks your
Scruple at the Expression, might have done as well, if
it had been season'd with a little Charity for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.
But we'll Compound that Point, if you please;
and Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>'s next <hi>Pagan</hi> shall enter the Stage with
a <hi>Pater Noester.</hi> A man might make Remarques pleasant
enough upon the Remainder of your sixth page, where
you are pleas'd to sport your self with Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>'s
Conscience, and the <hi>Equivogue</hi> of <hi>Assignation</hi> upon <hi>Love
in a Nunnery:</hi> but it is all Bubble, and breaks with the
blowing upon. Here now you must permit me to say,
You are too severe to Railly upon this last new Play so
suddenly, before you can have the opportunity of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: which makes some apprehend it with you, as with
Fruit-women, who are so eager of venting the Earliest
fruit, that they bring onely Trash to the Market. And
truly 'tis observed in your weak Objections, that you
are Cautious what Devils you raise, lest you should not
be able to lay them again. We'll now pass to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more material, and that is, your grand Exception
to the <hi>White-day,</hi> in these Lines of his <hi>Maximin:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Let us use all, for if we loose one day,</l>
                  <l>That White one in the Crowd may slip away.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You urge, that it is not usual in the English Tongue
to call a <hi>prosperous day</hi> a <hi>White day.</hi> Where you must
give me leave to minde you of a whole Nest of Mistakes
one within another. First, Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
a <hi>prosperous day,</hi> but a <hi>day</hi> that might have been
<hi>Prosperous,</hi> if the Opportunity then offer'd had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd;
and advises the watching of all Opportunities
that no Occasions slip. Secondly, you argue, <hi>that it is
not Current, because it is not Common:</hi> which rate of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
will destroy all things that are excellent. And
thirdly, that <hi>White day is not good in English.</hi> As if a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Emperour had been to be treated in the English
Tongue. But it is very Elegant Latine. See the two
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59512:6"/>
first lines of the second Satyr of <hi>Perseus:</hi>

<q>
                  <l>Quicquid agunt Homines, Votum, Timor, Ira, Voluptas,</l>
                  <l>Gaudia, discursus nostri est farrago libelli.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This was <hi>Iuvenals</hi> Theme, and may without any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement
be Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s. But the poor man, it
seems, is fallen under a miserable <hi>Dilemma;</hi> either he
must represent on the one side what was never said or
done, (and so make himself Ridiculous) or fall under
the scandal of a Libeller for the contrary on the other.
But as to what you charge upon him for falling upon
persons, it is neither prov'd by you, nor justifi'd by me.</p>
            <p>Another Objection you collect from the <hi>Rota,</hi> upon
the <hi>Contradiction</hi> in a <hi>severe and sullen Ioy. Seneca</hi> tells
you <hi>Res est severa Gaudium.</hi> And then for your <hi>Gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
smile</hi> too, which gives so much offence; I think
<hi>A Gloomy smile and sullen joy appear'd,</hi> is as proper a
form of speech, as <hi>A Gloomy or Waterish sunshine,</hi> when
the Sun appears through a Cloud or Mist.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Mr. Dreydens Prologue to his Maiden Queen,</hi>
wherein <hi>you tax him with confidence;</hi> this may be his
excuse, <hi>that Confidence as well becomes those that write
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59512:6"/>
well, as Silence those that write ill.</hi> Now (for all your
severe Censures) however Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> is highly oblig'd
to you, in giving your self the trouble <hi>to finde out whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he was a Wit or no;</hi> which is a very great trouble,
I can assure you Sir: for all Philosophers are not Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finders:
the pains being equal, as if you had gone to
Mr. <hi>Lilly,</hi> or Cast his Ingenuity: for you prov'd it by as
infallible a Signe, as any Privie Counsellor to the Planets
could have certifi'd you by his Calculation, that is, by
Logick, as thus:—
<q>-Either you have a Gig, or you have lost a Gig.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Which may be answer'd,
<q>—You never had a Gig.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Truly, a very Learned way of Conjuring and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
much after the rate that some Soph-wits prove the
Moon to be made of Green-cheese; whose Arguments
are these:
<q>
                  <l>The Moon is made of Green-cheese, or something else.</l>
                  <l>Now Custard is something else; and it is not made
of Custard.</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> 'tis made of Green-cheese.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Another Accusation against Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> is, that his
presumption extends to the defaming of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
as <hi>Ben Iohnson,</hi> &amp;c. by saying,
<q>—Then Comedy was faultless, but 'twas course.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Commendation of a fresh Country-girl,
that she is sound, but hard-favourd: and it was a true
definition of our predecessors Plays, The <hi>Drama</hi> and
Poetical Methods were most accurately observ'd, as the
Plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but view the Lines, apprehend the Sence, and
compare the Language with those of this present Age,
and then you'll perceive the difference.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>'s Prologue to his <hi>Maiden-Queen,</hi>
where you <hi>tax him with Again for Boasting</hi>; he does
but confess his Little Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> honestly; and therefore justly
merits a Pardon.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59512:7"/>
               <q>
                  <l>—A mingled Chime</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Johnson</hi>'s and <hi>Corneille's</hi> Rhime.—</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But if you condemn the Boldness of Poets, how comes
<hi>Ben Iohnson</hi> to scape you? who when his <hi>Sejanus</hi> was
hiss'd, comes himself on the Stage, and speaks thus to
the Audience:</p>
            <p>Gentlemen,
<q>
                  <l>This in my Plays behalf I boldly say,</l>
                  <l>By God 'tis good; and if you like't, you may.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The next Impeachment you bring against Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi>
is for the obscenity of his Comedies; where you term
them all <hi>downright Bawdery,</hi> when the worst of them
is but Implicite. Now against such Reports, he may
plead that every Poet must strive to please the Humour
of the Age wherein he writes; and so does Mr. <hi>Drey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and so did his Predecessors. See <hi>The Heiress, Alchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,</hi>
and <hi>Bartholmew-Fayr.</hi> Besides, as a supple Courtier
ought not to write against Flattery, so ought not you
against Obscenity,
<q>
                  <l>Whose Railing Style is so obscene and loud,</l>
                  <l>As if your very Muse it self went Proud.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a receiv'd Opinion amongst all your Readers, that
Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> did Prophetically railly upon you in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilogue
to <hi>Granado,</hi> 1 Part; where he says,-
<q>
                  <l>-They who write Ill, and they who ne'er durst write,</l>
                  <l>Turn Criticks out of meer Revenge and Spite.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>By your Writing, you do appear to be one of those
Spiteful Criticks, who, like old crabbed-fac'd Maids,
wish there were no such things as Beauty and Husbands,
because they have none; and do so malice those who
have, that they will Paint and Patch at Threescore years
old to get them Beauty and Husbands; making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Baboons on Earth, for fear of leading Apes in
Hell. The onely Defence I can make for you, is the
same Quibling Excuse your Generosity conferr'd on Mr.
<hi>Dreyden,</hi> which was—
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59512:7"/>
               <q>That he writ as well as any man—that could write
no better.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as for Mr. <hi>Dreyden,</hi> all these Errours wherewith
he hath been tax'd, are so few and inconsiderable, that
nothing but a self-conceited Envie could have spy'd:
which implies, either that he never committed great
Crimes, or that you had not the Wit to finde them; to
whom Mr. <hi>Dreyden</hi> makes this Application, in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
