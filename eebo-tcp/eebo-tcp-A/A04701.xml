            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

legions of deuyls, fetered still in all idola<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>try and false religion, then that Iesus Chryst withe his worde shulde here tary any longer.</p>
            <p>Hereof may ye se what a preposter feare and sinister iugement there is nowe in this worlde. Men to be more afrayd of Chryst &amp; his gospell of saluacion to dwel with them, then of a legion of deuyls redy to rende them in peses. Be you (oh papy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes) sewerer (thynke ye) vnder the deuyl then vnder Chryst: Do ye promyse your selues to be more quyet in Satans seruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Christs peaceable religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? What harme (I pray you) hath our lorde Iesus Chryst &amp; his gospell done to you, so that yf ye walke in his wais and receyue his gospell, ye shulde feare any suche perels of batail sedicions and tumults to fall vpon you? He hath drowned our swyne (say you) he is not the autor of euill say I. He came to drowne and to mortifye your swynisshe filthynes &amp; bestly affectis and to blesse you and yours with encrease. He is the autor of peace and not of sedicion batail and tumult. Your selues thrustinge him and his worde awaye from you so truelly persecuting him in his preachers and professours be the very autors &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of all batail sedicions trouble morin of your beastis derthe famyn and pestele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.
<pb facs="tcp:3978:4"/>
And forbecause you feare so sore these euils to fall vpon you for receiuinge and retayninge Chryst with his gospell, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye sewer, all these heuey heapes of calamities and yet greter &amp; grenoser pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges shorteli to be powered forth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you.</p>

And therfore trede downe this blessed sead with your filthy feet, suffocate it, burne it, thrust it from you with swerde and fyer, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risshe still emonge you rather a legion of deuilis co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pellinge men to recant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye the truthe openly &amp; oft preched, orels burne them. Compell them to sayt. This is a realme of rightwijsenes where in is ministred all inste execucion and uo perse cucion. For where the heade and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner professeth Chryst there can be no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secucion. Nether is Chryst (tell it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) per secuted but emonge the Iewes and genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Unto this I answer. That the gospel preched is the worde of the crosse, Paul to witnes. i. Cor. i. And the true preachers therof, Chrystsendeth as lombes emonge

wolues, Matth. x. Wherfor where as ye haue chased awaye &amp; suppressed the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the crosse there can be no persecucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, &amp; where as be no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bes sent emon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge wolues, there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not the wolues deuou re any lombes. And thus breifly by your owne factis and recantacion wordes, you haue properly proued your selues nether to haue the gospell nor any true prechers sent amonge you purely and frely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache it, which as it is the most euident to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of gods heuey wrath to take awaye his worde and preachers from you, so is it the present token of his fauor to sende vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Also where so euer is Christ our head, there are his members. And what the worlde and Satan did to our head and father of the houshold, the same do thei<note place="margin">Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

If the highe preistes and bisshops Caiphas and Annas with the pharisais persecuted our heade Chryst so shall their successours persecute his members, for persecucion is as comon to the body as to the heade. And therfore sayd Paul, Col. i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I nowe reioyse in myne affliccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for your sakis. For I supple that at yet remayneth and shall euer endure in the affliccions of Chryst in my fleshe for his bodye whiche is the chirche. Here is it playn, Chryst in his members to suffer persecucions vnto

Which all gone, there must the persewers &amp; thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters out of Chryst and his worde be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with legions of deuyls. For neuer was there any chirche so litle, so hole and perfit, but it had an aduersarye to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. Chryst was euer to many mo a stomblinge stone and a signe to be agene<note place="margin">Luke. ij.</note> sayd, then to be beleued &amp; to ryse at hym. Then beginneth Satan to rustle when a strouger armed inuadeth his realme. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els what shuld he do but lydowun &amp; laugh or sleape to se his realme in tranquilyte and in a paceable possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

there semed to be a good quiete concorde of the chrysten religion, as longe as men beleued in the pope to be head of Chrysts chirche, receyued his false doctryne, ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes cere, tradicions, pardons, satisfaccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, merits, prayd for the dead and to sayuts, and for the souls in purgatory, pelgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, worshipped stockes and stones, and his misse as a sacrifice for the syunes of the quike and dead. Whiche was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the same that Chryst sayd in his gospell. As longe as the strong armed kepeth his fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re courte and castel gates, all thinges are in peace and salf gard that he hathe. For where Satan hath the rule and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer the comon doctryne and techers there taketh he diligent heed lest any or many externe dissensions or tumults ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se, nether stereth he vp there many here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spes, no not in the Turkes nor Iewes chirches in these dayes, because he hath them sewer at his pleasure beinge lorde head and kinge openly ouer their religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

So that there is no certayner argument and more euident token of the gospell to be vtterly oppressed, &amp; of Satan to raigne in peace, as to se the publike concorde of, and in the religion. And there is no toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so certayn manifest and euident of the worde of god arysing and cominge forth into syght, as when ye se a comon publike discorde in, and of the religion. For and yf euer men shuld haue loked and trusted for any open and generall concorde of, &amp; in the religion in the worlde, at the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge and open prechinge of the gospell, it shuld haue ben at that tyme when our lorde Iesus Chryst him selfe reueled and preached it emonge the Iewes.

And as ye se, that if our god in this worlde promoueth his, out of affliccion and persecucion into glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye honor and felicite, miche more tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth he his derely beloued chosen out of these miserable and heuey present per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secucions into that heuenly perpetuall ioye and felicite in the other worlde.

Wherfore the more affliccion and persecucion the worde of the crosse bringeth to vs, the more feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and greter ioye abideth vs in heuen. But the worldly peace, idle ease, welthey pleasure and this present transitory feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyte which the vngodly imagin to procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re them selues here by persecutinge and thrustinge awaye the gospell, shal be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned here into their owne trouble bataill (as ye now this daye see it) and at laste into the horrible destruccions and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of their realmes, and aftir this (if they repent not) into ther own perpetual infelicite, perdicion and dampnacion. And if our lordely prowed bishops wolde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and measure the state of the christen chirche by the actes of the Apostles, they shuld see in howe greuouse persecucion it was, when the moste nowmber of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples<note place="margin">Act. vi.</note> encreased.

as ye may see in constantyne the empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours dayes, and in gregoryes the grete his tyme, howe Chrystes religion then began to dekaye.
