            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is no maruell, though that Antichrist the Pope of Rome (seeing his kingdome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse decay apace in these dayes, and fearing the vtter ouerthrowe of it for euer) being rowzed, bestirre himselfe as hee doth. He is in high place, &amp; hath of some yeres growen too mightie in this world by his owne am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious pride, and the grace hee hath founde in the eies of great princes and their people: God so iustly punishing mens ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, towardes his maiestie. This lawlesse man therefore, of whom I speake, will no doubt leaue no meanes vnattempted, so long as hee may, to vpholde this his pompe and estate, whiche thing will not in these daies be perfourmed without much ado, especially when he cannot bee content to keepe himselfe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in boundes, that is, as a Romane at home in his owne Citie and Countrie, where hee dwelleth, or as a Churche man in Church matters: but will needes roue ouer the worlde, sitting in <hi>Gods seate,</hi> and hauing; an Oare in euery mans boate (as they say) yea and ruffle, euen among Monarques and great Princes, and that in, and for their kingdomes: giuing the same, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, placing, displacing, disposing, &amp;c. at his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
            <p>But playing thus his parte like himselfe, that is, so impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Godlesly, in the sight nowe of all the worlde bewraying himselfe to bee in deede that man of sinne that is prophesied of: Gods spirit on the other side, detecting and reuealing day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">2.

                  <pb facs="tcp:20565:3"/>
not, that the light of the glorious Gospell of Christe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, which is the image of God, should not shine vnto them.</hi> And againe, <hi>because they that perishe, haue not receiued the loue of the truth that they might be saued, therefore God will</hi>

            <p>So then, such thinges as wee see come to passe at this day, and set abrod for the vpholding of that beast the Pope of Rome and his rotten religion, ought so little to seeme strange vnto the faithfull, that being assured the Lorde will destroy that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse<note place="margin">2.

There followed after another session wherein againe after the same maner, the madge <hi>Howlet,</hi> (though as I thinke not called) failed not to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, casting still his foule eyes vpon <hi>Balthasar,</hi> which m. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let,</hi> he seeing to be returned, was not without iust cause, more troubled and striken with shame than afore, and not being able to abide the sight of the madge <hi>Howlet</hi> any longer; he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be beaten away with libbets and clubbes, and with crying noyse, but M. <hi>Howlet</hi> neuer a whit disquieted either with
<pb facs="tcp:20565:5"/>
their shreeching noyse or other disturbaunce woulde not flie away, till with muche cudgeling at him, being very sore beaten, hee fell. downe dead before them all. These things (saith our Authour) learned I of a certaine faithfull, and trustie friende, who, at that time came straight and directly from Rome, of whiche I making doubt, by reason of the strangenesse thereof, my friende being very earnestly sworne; Assured me, hee told mee that was moste true, and added further, that all that were present, were hereby brought into an vtter contempt, disdaine, and mocking of that councell, and the whole companie by little and little falling away, hee affirmed there was nothing at all there doone to any purpose. Thus farre <hi>Clamengius,</hi> cited very truely by maister Foxe.</p>
            <p>For the Gentleman, the authours worshipfull friende (as hee speaketh) if there be any suche, and he not too farre gone, I wish him to bee aduised, and take heede, what scholemaisters hee betake his conscience to be framed by, the matter is of no small importance, let him at leastwise without preiudicate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion heare and reade both sides before hee iudge, or thruste himselfe too farre ouer the shoes: for our part (what euer opinion the aduersaries bee of,) leauing the rest to hym that is aboue, wee desire no more at his handes: this is it wee haue from the beginning, and many a day sought and requested. If hee will heare this counsell, hee shall first see that wee drawe him not from the Pope and Popishe religion, to carry him to depende vppon any mortall man in the case of religion and conscience, bee he neuer so high or mightie: but only vppon the true and immortall God of heauen, and his sacred mouth: Next, that wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde him not doctrines deuised by mans braine, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnder title of the Church, to intangle his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scienee, and without eyther grounde or good reason, make him per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and doubtfull by subtill quidities and questions, as these men doe, but after we haue brought him to feede in the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20565:5"/>
and sweete pasture, and to drinke of the pure and liuely fountaine of Gods holy woorde, which is the trueth, hee shall see, wee endeuour to vnwrap and vnfoulde his conscience from snares, to quiet the same with the true peace of God, teaching him to make conscience where God and his woorde woulde, and no where els, and to looke well to these two points in the case of conscience. God may and doth make lawes to bynde conscience withall, and onely God may deale therein and no mortall man, muche lesse that man of sinne the Pope.</p>
            <p>In summe, the more precisely in these matters pertayning to his soules health, he shall cleaue to God and his holye truth contayned in the Scriptures, renouncing all sectes and partes of whomesoeuer, aswell Pope as other, the better shall he please, I will not say vs, but first God, and next to God, satissie her Maiestie our dread soueraigne and his, who pretendeth not by her selfe, nor her lawes, to make any of her subiectes to be of her Religion, but vs altogether with her selfe, of Gods true, certayne, and most holie Religion. Shee sitteth in no mans conscience as doth the Pope ywis, in doing this, shortely to say, he shall shewe himselfe to bee a faythfull and good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt to GOD, and her Maiestie, bearing a duetifull minde, lyke a true subiect, to her godly lawes in euery respecte, a profitable member also shall hee shewe him selfe to bee in Church and common wealth, and most of all (which hee hath to consider of) his owne friende; all which benefites, hee quite spoyleth himselfe of, in following the course these men sette hym in who as blynde guydes conducte him in the darkenes by bywayes of traditions, forefathers, custome, multitude, good intentes, and meaning, as they call them, and all without the light of Gods holy woorde, or any good warrant.</p>
            <p>Nowe as there are two partes of this booke, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle dedicatorie to her Maiestie, and the treatise or reasons, where vnto accordingly I haue to answere, so for the matter, the drift wherto this booke tendeth, &amp; the manner of handling

the whole, generally to speake, it so bewrayeth it selfe as the indifferent Reader may and will (I doubt not) easily espie out the treacherie. Poyson to infect deadly, couered, and as it were sugured, that is: with faire wordes glosed and reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, is the whole matter: for what haue wee els to iugde of reasons, not grounded on any art of reason, and of persuasion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all foundation. The whole that so great account is made of, was a letter from a friend to a friende, shuffled vp in hast, as the writer confesseth.

Forsooth, madge <hi>Howlet</hi> and his fellowes opinion must rule heerein, to make a Treatise and discourse thereof, and at length to publish the same in print, wherby besides the rest, they may shewe what great reasons they stay their consciences vppon (as they speake) to the condemning of others, yea of their own side that thinke not and do not as they doe, and what weightie motiues also they haue to moue her Maiestie withall, and what inuincible <hi>Scholasticall</hi> argumentes wee must looke for at these terrible fellowes handes. Of all which that I may heere briefly and in summe, giue a note, I say if their store behinde, bee no better then this they nowe sende vs, for all their great bragges, wee may turne them ouer to Sophisters and laddes in the Schooles to answere them, so little neede wee surely feare their hie woordes and threates.

from publique Church assembles here (wherein to Gods glorie are vsed the preaching of Christes Gospell, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his sacramentes, godly prayers, &amp;ct.) And againe, to refuse the othe of alleageance to her Maiestie, alluring other to the like: they drawe men (as much as in them is) from the ordinarie meanes whereby God beginneth, aduaunceth, and continueth faith and Religion in his, they dishonour his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in swaruing from the rule of his holy woorde, they pine away and slaye their owne soules, and theirs that hearken vnto them. Besides this offence to God, and priuate hurt to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues and others, they induce them further to disobey in the highest degree, their gracious Soueraigne and ours, and to break her wholsome lawes made for the aduauncement of Christes syncere Religion, and the suppressing of Idolatrie and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the maintenance of her Royal estate and most law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full dignitie among her subiectes, they offend moreouer all the godly minded, &amp; weake ones also, by their euil exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple and dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. That I speak nothing of vtter enemies to the truth, which can learne no good hereby. Finally, they seeke to make a schisme, and to maintaine heresie in this holy Congregation, and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously disturbing the peace and quiet here, they make a way to a newe rebellion, if it bee possible for them, infecting other with the same opinion and obstinacie, whiche are not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto so hot and forward, or peruerse and frowarde in this matter.</p>
            <p>These and such like things are sought to bee iustified, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and defended, by coloured reason and false perswasion, and all vnder pretence of conscience, in this booke. They must be tollerated in these doings, her Maiestie, and the state must be satisfied therewith, otherwise, they playne of the state and publique authoritie here, they deuise and inuent sclanders, they chalenge and threate, they bragge and vaunt, they whine and repine, and what not? They are loth to let goe their holde, and to leese all their labour, being come so farre as from Rome, the poore helpe of <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Romane</hi> souldiers, which our English <hi>Italianated</hi> Romanistes, had by suite procured from the

For, least those of their companie that are left, after the suppressing of the rebelles among vs, shoulde be dismaide and discouraged, setting a good face on the matter, they comfort them with such wordes and motiues, as they may in so bad a matter, and least when they can not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly in person goe abroade, their well willers and friendes, whereof they bragge of moe here, then I trust they shall finde, shoulde want their ayde in aduauncing the proude prelate of Rome, and his religion against the eternall God of heauen and her Maiestie, our naturall and dread soueraigne and Prince: here vpon they print and cast abroad this and such like libels, full of holownes and vauntes, contayning litle or no other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as such doe easily and at first fight perceiue, which vntaught by them, are none of their disciples, but through Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnder her Maiesties happie gouernement, haue been now many yeeres trayned vp in the schoole of the holy ghost, where (if wee haue grace) wee haue learned ynough to confirme and stablishe our mindes in the trueth of God, and to repell and ouerthrowe all deuises of men.</p>
            <p>Now, because they haue by their euill desertes, iustly brought themselues farre into hatred, least they shoulde seeme common enemies, all their cunning of Rhetorique and persuasion muste be applied for the auoyding of this blot, hence commeth the dedication of this treatise to her Maiestie, and the allegation of conscience.

Which al be but duties of obedience on their behalfes, to set vp his creatures, the Prelates of the Clergie, to be Lordes ouer Gods Church, whose seruantes they ought to bee. As your very Pope also professeth himselfe to bee, the seruant of the seruantes of God: But as Salomon saith. <hi>When a<note place="margin">Prou. 30. verse 21. 22.</note> serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t raigneth, or is Lord, it is one of the things of three or foure for the which the earth is moued, &amp; can not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine it selfe:</hi> So this, and such like slauishe obedience, is nothing to the commendation of your Popishe religion: which in too vile speeche and maner, subiecteth into it those that yee call of the Laytte.

long since, such a wicket as greatly profited the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie in Gods matters.

                  </gap>, and no lesse furthered and profited Gods cause, and encouraged all the godly, by his godly and learned writings, and otherwise. The thirde is, that odde and incomparable man of our time: The reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rende Father, and most painefull and faithfull Pastor and Teacher in Christes Church, M John Caluin; Whom, thogh your heart swelt, you can not discredite among Gods seruantes,, nor iustly staine his trauailes and writings, left among vs for the benefite of Gods Church, so hath it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his maiestie, to blesse this good mans labours: The Diuell, I confesse, as in other, hath beene very busie in his instruments, to deface, and disgrace this excellent man di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes, but euer their mischiefes returned vpon their owne pates, and they, euen as many as haue risen and bent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against him, haue had the foyle to their shame: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, wee highly prayse God for these men, and for his great gifts in them, as in others, giuing them likewise their due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, as reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, yet would I y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you M. <hi>Howlet,</hi> and your fellowes shoulde knowe, we make none of them, nor them all, our Pope, to depende of them and their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, ne yet the Authours of our religion, as you do the man of sinne at Rome: But we reserue this priuiledge to Jesus Christ alone, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out being addicted to any mans doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine or writings, for faith and religion, further then he shal teach vs by canonicall scriptures.

               <p>But it shall not be amisse to enter into particular exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that ye say: first therefore let vs see, what it is yee charge M.

               <p>If Wyckliffe should haue holden any errour, the times wherein he liued considered, it were not greatly to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyled at: God rather is highly to be praysed, that in so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and blinde times, he sawe and helde the truth in many pointes. We are not, we may not, nor no reason why wee should be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mainteiners of any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s errours. This article, as it is set vs downe here by you, is (That I may say what seemeth to me) not only false, but also seditious, &amp; so is it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs; &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which ye father vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M.

Doth not your Pope and Popishe religion disable, and seeke to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possesse any lawfull prince: onely supposed by those of your side to fall into the mortall sinne of heresie, and arme his subiectes against him; Your selues also must define both mortall sinne and heresie too, full euill fauouredly ywis, as al men may easily see. Did not Wickliffe in his life time write that the Clergie, moued by the Fryers, went about<note place="margin">Wickliffe in his Trialogue.</note> that matter here in Englnade; hath not the Pope your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, claymed the ryght of disposing all ciuill and earthly Kingdomes; hath he not called the King of England (to omit other) his vassall; as though he held his kingdome, but as his tennant, and at his pleasure.

Wickliffe, whereof I praye you entreateth, hee there; for sooth this is the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. To shew in this speech of Christ: <hi>This is my body.</hi> What is signified by this woorde, <hi>This.</hi> wherein (establishing the truth) he mightely ouerthroweth your Popish corrupt doctrine of this Sacrament. Now for M. Wycklyff, to teache in that place the article you set vs downe, were nothing to the purpose. And this I say: if any such worde as ye reporte be in this place ye send vs vnto, let me leese my credite for euer, if not, let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reader take heede for euer howe hee trust your lying spirite in quoting things.

Yee take al one from anothers reporte, and beeing our sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, howe is it to bee thought you will reporte truely of vs, and of our opinions and wrytings: but the fault may possibly bee in the Printer; or you taking this from your Authours second promised parte, vnperformed yet, might bee deceyued; as indeed you or hee set vs downe in another place this article to bee in the 36. chapter of the 4. booke of Wycklyffs Trialogue. Thus your Authour and you leade<note place="margin">Fol. 68. pag. 2.</note> about the reader vncertainly, not knowing where to seeke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you alledge, There is as much to be had of this article in the 36. chapter of that booke, as in the place before allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which is nothing at all. The matter hee handleth in this 36. chapter is, how Fryers so greatly poysoned king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes wherein they dwelt, as in those dayes they did: So, wee send you still to seeke vs a newe place for this article in Wycklyff. Marke your wordes, Cogge not, foyst not, Tell vs where the wordes, as you set them downe be to be had? Tell vs not what begging and lying fryers may haue deuised, or your enuyous Papisticall wryters of this mans doctrine: you set vs the article downe as though it were his owne woordes: I am not ignorant that in Wycklyffs life time, not much an vnlike slaunder (as the latter part of your article containeth) was raysed against the profession

               <p>Nowe come I to the two other places you send vs vnto in your marginall quotation. I meruaile you bee not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to sende vs for the report of Wickliffes doctrine, to his so deadly enimies: one of the testimonies is fetched but from a yesterdayes byrde to speake of, who was vnborne many yeeres after Wickliffe was dead, I meane that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate enimie to Christes Gospell, brawling and rayling <hi>Cocleus,</hi> who is saide to haue died 1552. well toward 200. yeeres after Wickliffs daies, whose bookes long before y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time, being condemned to be burnt, were then hardly to bee gotten &amp; neither sought after but to that end, nor regarded by those of your side; but let that enimies testimonie of Wickliffs doctrine goe, as not worth the examining.

Why learne you not that lesson; Why reforme you not your consciences by Gods word, that God and her Maiestie may haue due obedience of her Subiects: which shee requireth and no more without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, murmuring, &amp; this bitter accusing: ye tel her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of errors, &amp; your selues run into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> headlong; Ye wil by no meanes with Luther haue Christians free &amp; exempted from Princes lawes; no not in their conseiences, and yet by meanes of conscience you will exempt your selues, what shoulde I say: like not that in your selues, yee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne in other. The difference (gentle Reader) betweene vs and them is, as thou mayest perceiue, that wee exempt mens consciences from all mortall men to giue them to God aboue alone, to be guided by his holy worde &amp; no other wise, which in deede her maiestie alloweth well of, slaunder these fellowes what they can herein, for her title of supreme gouernour ouer her subiects. They without any warrant of Gods worde exempt, not conscience, but pretended, or that they call conscience, from dutifulnes to God and their lawfull Prince and Soueraigne in God, to giue it to the Pope, induced therto, because they see her Maiestie to leaue mens consciences free &amp; vntouched, hauing a tender care &amp; great respect therof. Where conscience is in deed, though it be but weake, according to the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Scriptures &amp; Gospell where shee learned this: &amp; not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> popery &amp; Pope, to whose supreme authoritie grounded vpon suppositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; false principles, these cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeited Catholiks haue by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilement and oth betaken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues according to their rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, so defrauding God &amp; her Maiestie of their due, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing their Soueraigne authoritie, &amp; themselues greatly. After this commeth M. <hi>Howlet</hi> to note our demeanour, &amp; heere passing other, as hee saith, hee setteth vs downe at large a matter doone the last Sommer at Stamforde,
<pb facs="tcp:20565:56"/>
and dwelling therin, he reprooueth both the doctrine of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Preachers there, and their demeanour also, whereof he maketh no small a doe, <hi>seditious,</hi> pretendeth he, was the doctrine there taught, seditious was the vsage, and yet, I trowe, nothing like to that of theirs in the North, in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, nor that which I haue described before. It is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, God made not him the Prince of this lande, nor any of the State, otherwise I perceiue the poore men had beene trounced: he giueth sentence as though the matter were his owne, when nothing was there doone against him, and as for her Maiestie and the State, they call not for his help in the gouernment heere. But I see M. <hi>Howlet</hi> is still like himselfe, that is past shame, els woulde he haue blushed to haue spoken so vntruly of a matter so lately doone and so publikely in the face of all the worlde: but let vs see what hee saith: first he entreth into this matter, to <hi>quitte,</hi> as hee speaketh, <hi>the Puritan that hath so infamed the Catholiks.</hi> Therefore he thinketh good to diffame him againe.

When yee can finde no more matter in the man to raile vpon, you immagine he sendeth out Preachers, yee call them at Stamforde his Preachers.

               <p>Next, he alledgeth a Minister to be his Authour in the report of this matter: but that is for his vantage, he nameth him not, neither thinke I, he can name any such, hee were too notorious an hypocrite and false brother, so lewdly to belie and betray his brethren.

And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> soner they leaue this course, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> soner will there bee an end of troubles. To mooue <hi>commiseration</hi> and pitie by <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricall figure,</hi> they guilefully imagine greater miseries than in truth bee founde heere among vs. Thankes bee to God, and her Maiestie therfore; they attaine not their with and desired purpose in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>rare matter</hi> of <hi>comfort,</hi> that the discourser spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himselfe withall, is the obstinacie of a fewe Papistes, which shewe their vndutifulnesse, first to God, his holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell and worde: Next to her Maiestie, and her good and wholesome lawes made against <hi>superstition and idolatry:</hi> All which vndutifulnesse is couered vnder the cloke of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> when in deede it is nothing lesse; as in place wee shewe. So as with some altering of this mans woordes we may say: The Diuell or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enimie laugheth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, <hi>the example is very euill to those abrode that shall heare thereof, and perillous to the state at home, while</hi> other like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues may seeme to be incouraged in naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vsage, the good and dutifull subiects are offended &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested with this treacher ous dealing, the Prince also and the state more troubled then otherwise needed, in preuenting and repressing the seditions that are heereby attempted and mooued, neither taking comfort in such Mates presently, nor hoping any good at their hands in time to come, vnlesse God giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> better minds, then they yet shew themselue

to haue: For howe can her Maiestie trust them that vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breaking God his testament, and <hi>the othe made vnto his Maiestie in Baptisme;</hi> (as this man calleth it) <hi>betake themselues,</hi> not to Christe and Christian religion compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in holy scriptures, but to <hi>Rome and Romishe religion</hi> deuised by men, that I say not, by the Diuell of Hell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and withall, leauing their naturall borne <hi>Soueraigne</hi> and Prince, followe the Pope and forraine power, to her Graces great preiudice, and the impayring, so much as they may, of her royall dignitie and title, which, also to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost of their power, they impugne, and would bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hazarde: And as for those of contrary religion vnto them, that is suche as here sticke to the Gospel and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere profession thereof, how can they like of such, as make no <hi>conscience</hi> to roue without the boundes of Gods booke in his matters, choosing to themselues <hi>a religion</hi> at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure (if <hi>will worship</hi> may rather be called <hi>religion,</hi> then by the owne proper name of superstition) so this whole parte might haue beene spared well enough, if it had liked the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</p>

First, what cause or reason the Catholiks <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> haue, to stande as they doe in the Refusal of thinges of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them, especially of going to the Church.

            <p>Thirdely, if that way or meanes doe not preuaile,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> then howe they ought to beare and endure the same.</p>
            <p>Wee see the grounde of the whole letter that is nowe published, and made a <hi>Treatise, or Discourse;</hi> As it wel may bee so called: for in deede, he that euen nowe promised <hi>most briefly to touche three thinges in this letter,</hi> hath so am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie <hi>discoursed,</hi> trotting vp and downe in his first course, that wearying himselfe: <hi>partly by euill disposition of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,</hi> as he sayde elsewhere, <hi>partly by other sudden busines falling vpon him, he was</hi> both <hi>inforced to leaue the place, and the matter,</hi> and tyme fayling him, and <hi>he saying more</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:20565:113"/>
of the first point, <hi>then hee purposed at the beginning: the Messe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger also, that brought that that was written awaye, being,</hi> as seemeth in poste <hi>haste,</hi> he forgate likewise, belike, what he had promised at the beginning, and therevpon ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther himselfe, or some other for him, rather as appeareth, is forced to excuse <hi>the omission of the seconde and thirde part, promised at the beginning.</hi> Thus haue wee <hi>a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> hereof, borne out of time, maymed, and more then halfe <hi>a Monster.</hi> You that are so great schoolemen and Orators, shoulde haue learned, at the least out of <hi>Tullie,</hi> that: to omit any thing in deuiding is a very great fault: Yet two things are here cleane omitted, or two partes of your owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, &amp;c. It helpeth you not if you <hi>Scholasticall men,</hi> bee <hi>Scholastically,</hi> or <hi>Schoolelike</hi> followed, to say: <hi>you haue reckened vs vppe all three partes that you purposed to treate of:</hi> for we reply, that you promised <hi>to treate of all three.</hi> Nowe, to runne such a course in one parte, that you quite leaue out the two other: I wot not well howe it will agree with the <hi>Rhetorike Schooles</hi> about you, nor what libertie <hi>you Orators,</hi> nowe a dayes take to your selues: and therefore I will leaue it, sauing that mee thinkes your friende <hi>M. Howlet,</hi> who is most like to bee the Poste or Messenger ye talke of, might haue forborne the printing of an vnperfect worke, or haue beene better aduised, then to haue <hi>Dedicated</hi> the same, at least to such a Personage as is her Maiestie: But we might stay well enough for the other two partes, this point to confirme, or obstinate and poyson rather, her Maicsties subiectes, was so necessarie, that it was to bee hastened: This was the <hi>Resolution</hi> of your wise heades; Yee are a <hi>Societie,</hi> I must suppose all is done by consent: Besides, I see <hi>M. Howlet</hi> in his Epistle <hi>Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie, to her Maiestie,</hi> hath entred into the <hi>seconde parte of his fellowes Diuision,</hi> as the same is reported vnto vs, in the excuse that is made in the latter ende of the booke: for though he haue omitted to treat of <hi>Instant and feruent Prayer to Almightie God,</hi> very necessarie for all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb facs="tcp:20565:114"/>
and namely for him and his felowes, that they may doe better then they doe: he taketh vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him bolde <hi>recourse vnto the Queenes Maiestie for tolleration</hi> in their corrupte religion, and he is busie with his <hi>Authours Motiues, &amp;c.</hi> which is the seconde promised parte: It had beene better he had been more occupied in that hee hath left out of this <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde part of the Diuision,</hi> and to haue exhorted his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks to obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to her maiesty, our most dread <hi>soueraine.</hi> This had beene a very necessarie point in deede, for such of his secte, as are here giuen to sedition and rebellion among vs. Once, while it is sayde that the Authour meaneth, to this pointe to exhorte; many mischiefes by that u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de there while, are among vs wrought. God amende them, or cut them more short. I will not charge <hi>M. Howlet</hi> heere with iniurie doyng, in preuenting his fellowe: because it is likely, all is done by compact &amp; agreement among them. It may seeme as thinges fall out, that all this excuse of <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the two latter partes,</hi> is but a flourishe, and the promise but a meere pretence: <hi>If health and leasure shall permit,</hi> he promiseth to finishe the rest: but I am hardely perswaded, that his <hi>health and leasure,</hi> will in these dayes serue him to perfourme so good an office, being so directly contrarie to the profession of their Popish religion, seeing especially it hath lost so good a place, as to haue gone first, or to haue been the foundation of the <hi>Supplication to her Maiestie.</hi> A great oportunitie and occasion lost: But least I seeme to dispayre of them, I pray God this peece of <hi>true o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to her Maiestie,</hi> may bee thought of, and wrote of by these <hi>hot Catholikes:</hi> But y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may bee done with better <hi>conscience,</hi> &amp; more stedfastnes, then hee that in Latin wrote<note place="margin">Steuen Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener.</note> of true <hi>obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</hi> in her maiesties fathers dayes, the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous &amp; renoumed prince of blessed memory, K.

If to seeke to disturbe and molest by Rebellion their Lords and Princes, be the custome of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and <hi>Sectaries</hi> of our time, then with vs are the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes such here, who followe that trade with her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie and this State right. If Subiectes bee bounde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to beare, and to obey, howe hardely so euer their Princes shall deale with them, vnder payne of deadly sinne and damnation, as these men in fayre wordes will seeme to professe, howe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes it then to passe they take vp the sword against their &amp; our noble Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Again, if English men owe true obedience to her Maiestie, <hi>for conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce sake, euen as to God himself,</hi> why do not pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes render it then; If it appertaine not <hi>to subiectes to iudge whether their Princes rule well or not,</hi> (as they say) why iudge they the whole matter so violently against her Maiestie; Why do other iustifie the same by wryting; yea, why procure they their Popes most traiterous bulles to be published and sent ouer hither; why come they not home, and liue like quiet Subiectes; words are winde, &amp; all is but words &amp; wind.

            <p>Now come I to the authours necessarie supposition, as he calleth it, and the <hi>two sortes of Catholikes</hi> that hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, where he deuideth badly still, for he telleth vs, <hi>There are to sortes of Catholikes in England.</hi> And when he hath done, maketh vs three before he come to his <hi>Reasons.</hi> One <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sorte for the iustifiyng of whom he wrote his <hi>Treatise.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sorte, for the reforming of whom hee wrote the same.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And the third sort of very bad <hi>Catholikes,</hi> whom he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth damned men in this life. So where he telleth vs there are here two sorts of <hi>Catholikes,</hi> we finde three, as we find but one parte, of his treatise, where he promised three: this is scholasticall and Orator like with these men. Let vs heare what he sayth: <hi>But first of all is to be noted that my
<pb facs="tcp:20565:115"/>
reasons to the end they may conuince, are to be supposed to proceede from a catholike minde, that is from a man which in his conscience is throughly petsuaded: that onely the catholike Romane religion is trueth; and that all other newe doctrines and religions are false religions: as all newe Gods are false Gods. &amp;c.</hi> First your supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ambiguous, doubtfull and captious, by reason you do not plainely and particularly enough expresse in the first part what the <hi>Catholike Romane religion</hi> is, which you say <hi>is onely trueth:</hi> when you oppose <hi>all other doctrines</hi> and religions which you say <hi>are false, to the Romane reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> you call them <hi>newe.</hi> So as some man might thinke, ye talked in the first parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true christian religion grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the doctrine of the prophets and Apostles, and comprised in the canonicall Scriptures of Gods holy By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which indeede is the onely Truth and the old religion. And this is the very same her maiestie and we her subiects heere professe in the church of england, and is elsewhere professed by those that are termed <hi>Gospellers, Protestants &amp;c,</hi> whom you yet account and call heretikes and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion <hi>A newe doctrine and religion.</hi> Wee call this our religion, not in captious and doubtefull terme <hi>the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Romane religion,</hi> or which we might with as muche right as you do; <hi>the Catholike English religion:</hi> but simply and plainly of the Authours, <hi>Gods and Christs true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Or if you wil, insteede of <hi>Rome and Romane,</hi> which be particular wordes restraining the word <hi>Catholike,</hi> wee are content to call it with your fellowe <hi>M.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:20565:115"/>
in speech: if this I haue now spoken of, be the true religion, ye receiue, embrace, and beeleeue, we doe so with you, and you with vs, that is wee agree; But vnderstand withall, that hereby we ouerthrowe all Poperie and Popish religion, as we doe Anabaptistrie, and all other false religions whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer deuised and erected by men, not warranted by Gods holy written worde call ye the same <hi>Romane, Italian, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, French, Spanish, English, Scottish,</hi> or what else you will, where and of whome soeuer it be professed, all is one; either it is that I haue here shortly described, or els it is false and naught: The true <hi>and Christian catholike</hi> religion, is not tyed to any certaine place, person, or time; but belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth indifferently to all the <hi>Faithful, in al ages</hi> and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: eyther therfore tel vs whether you meane by <hi>the catho like Romane religion,</hi> that Religion which the <hi>faithful</hi> people dwelling at Rome helde in the time of the Apostles, To whom <hi>S.

There are made another sort of Catholikes that are said to agree with these in the two first pointes, disagreeing from them, in the thirde onely: And yet these that agree so well with them in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and dissent from them in doing onely, and that as they speake, for feare, or some worldely respect: the former Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes so abhorre and detest, that they pronounce these yet aliue in God his prouidence, dead and damned in <hi>hell.</hi> They are priuie to their consciences, they knowe who shal goe thither: nay, they sende at pleasure whome they liste: they leaue these men without comforte or hope of pardon, and esteeme them no <hi>Christians,</hi> much <hi>lesse Catholikes,</hi> so hee here pronounceth of them.

euen by this man and other of that syde: Therefore the Catholikes <hi>communicating with our Churches,</hi> can not bee iustly called <hi>sinne against the holy Ghost.</hi> Thus far of those, that you accompt the worst, and to to badde Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes, I pray God we may find them <hi>good Christians:</hi> And yet, if they haue learned any euill, they haue learned it of your religion and in your schoole. I haue beene herein the longer bicause the whole booke seemeth to be written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this kinde of men. God open their eyes they may see, knowe, and discerne their friendes from their foes, bee carefull, and watchfull, amending at least in time to come, that which is amisse.</p>
            <p>The third sort of <hi>catholikes,</hi> or the seconde as you tearm them (quite leauing out such as your selfe are) agree but in one of the three points I spake of before, &amp; dissent in two: <hi>they iudge all religions beside theyr owne,</hi> say you, <hi>false, erronious &amp; damnable,</hi> this haue they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romane catholikes:</hi> but they thinke it lawfull for some worldly respect, as for sauing their offices, dignities, liberties, credits, or the like, to shewe themselues conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, in going to church, and other church proceedinges here. &amp;c. thinking also other too scrupulous that stand in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. This make you y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proper difference of these from other <hi>catholikes.</hi> Nowe as they agree with the rest in the first point: so in going to church, taking othe, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating. &amp;c. they disagree from <hi>hot Catholikes,</hi> and agree therein with those I haue at large discoursed of euen now<hi rend="sup">t</hi>e.

Albeit these agree no better with you hot Catholikes, but dissent in mo pointes then the other that went afore, yet ye thought it pollicie belike, hauing so scourged and taken vp those, somewhat here to spare these men, least you should do your religion too much hurt, if you should fal too farre out with

You cut them off from you, and yet you woulde fayne holde them in still, what opinion you <hi>hot Catholikes</hi> haue of all besides your selues, euen such of your owne side, whom ye speake farest vnto, let me be bolde shortly to giue here a taste. Generally you count no better of all them that goe to Churche heere, for what respect soeuer, other then such as the Pope will allowe; (whereof you speake, and we shall see more in your qualifications afterwardes) then of Apostataes, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the <hi>Catholike religion, perfidious, betrayers of Gods Catholike cause, traytours to God, no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Heathen men, and Publicanes. &amp;c.</hi>

Nowe, if in bending, and contendyng hereto, her Maiestie, the State, and people, euery one in their place, haue not thorowly and fully attayned to their purpose in reformation and practise hitherto: yet is not the profession and purpose to be blamed, yea, their will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is much to be commended, and they to be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and stirred vp, to growe dayly from good to better, in these cold &amp; naughty daies, while other, seeing in so waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and necessarie a matter, many and great abuses, sit still, and either maintaine, or winke thereat.

Againe, to haue due and charitable conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Church of God and their Christian brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> and common honesty among men.

reformation of the Church, need not be forborne in respect of them: I woulde this great and necessarie matter might as easily be obtayned (which our sinnes onely let) as it is not harde to answere, what euer those fellowes can nowe alleadge for them selues: Unto the examination therefore of this mans particular <hi>Reasons for refusall of comming to Church,</hi> I nowe turne my selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE first Reason, why I being a Catholike in minde may not goe to the Churches, or seruice of the contrary Religion, is: because I perswading my selfe, their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine to be false doctrine, and consequently, venemous vnto the hearer: I may not venture my soule to bee infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the firste proposition or grounde of this first reason, to make it in forme of argument: is this. No man that perswadeth himselfe, the doctrine nowe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed and taught in the Church of Englande, is <hi>false and venemous to the hearer,</hi> may venture his soule to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith: But euery <hi>Romane Catholike</hi> is a man that perswadeth him selfe, the doctrine nowe professed and taught in the Church of England <hi>is false doctrine, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous to the hearer.</hi> Therefore no Romane Catholike may venture his soule to be infected therewith. First, Sir, such <hi>Catholikes</hi> as are of contrary opinion vnto you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (for whose sake you wrote this discourse) must you sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, will denie one of your two propositions, &amp; finde shifts to auoyde all your proofes, which will not bee harde to bee done for those of your religion: But let them shift with you as they and you can agree. I am no patrone of theirs: I will speake and answere to the matter. Therefore, to this first Argument or <hi>Reason,</hi> I answere, that it is vayne and naught, because it is grounded vpon opinion, fancie, and ones perswading of him selfe, and doing after his perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and not vpon the matter and truth. Nowe these two matters be diuers, and doe differ much: I perswade my selfe, that such a thing is thus or so: And such a thing in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20565:134"/>
deed is thus or so. The reason why, because one may be and to often is deceiued in perswading himself of things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they be: But the truth is alwaies one, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not according to our perswasion, neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thereon. What if one perswade himselfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is a Prince, or haue a bag of money, is he so, or hath he it euer the more, or euer the sooner for that: neuer a whit sure. Or if one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himself there is a snake in his bed, shall he not sleepe neere it, or if your fellow perswade himself you go about to deceiue him, shall hee not trust you: Surely our doing or not doing of thinges, euen appertayning to this lyfe; to haue the same well done; must not depende vpon our own perswasion, which is very changeable and vncertayne: but our perswasion to doe any thing, must depende rather vpon the trueth and goodnesse of the matter, that wee minde to doe. Otherwise, one perswading him selfe that euery man hee shall meete, will kil him, may not venture to goe abroad about his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

What it aduauntageth your side to suppose that which you cannot proue; and lieth in controuersie betweene vs, I wote not, but easily may one perceiue that it sauoureth neyther of trueth, nor of learning, which you so confidently affirme. Till you can conuince vs therefore of heresie &amp; our assemblies to be hereticall, (which while we may be hearde to make answere will neuer bee) giue vs leaue to turne on your owne heades, that which you charge vs with. And
<pb facs="tcp:20565:178"/>
forasmuch as our men haue prooued Papistes Heretikes, and their Idolatrous assemblies heretical; giue the Pastors, and other godlie Learned, leaue to admonish all the faithfull to abstayne therefrom, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prohibited &amp; vnlawfull things, where you especially haue nothing to doe, or not to comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at least.</p>
            <p>And seeing the case thus standeth nowe betweene these two religious that of the Protestantes and Papists: In the meane while till you can more sufficiently then hitherto, reproue our Church assemblies, let vs craue at your hands to shewe, that the whole act of going to Churche, is (as it is of you Papistes sayde to bee) prohibited also <hi>Iure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uino &amp; naturali:</hi> that is by the Lawe of GOD and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

of our consciences, vnto the good example of other, in making publike confession of our sinnes, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian fayth, in hearing GOD his holie woorde, making publike prayers, participating of the holye Sacraments, &amp;c. which we take to be the principall endes, and chiefest vses of Christian assemblies, in steede of gasing, croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, crossing, pyping, singing, and other ceremoniall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions in vse among you.</p>
            <p>For the rest whether it bee impossible to bee so, that your Pope shoulde offer too her Maiestye to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Englishe seruice vppon condition to recouer his Supremacie heere in Englande, whiche hee is farre from, and GOD so keepe him still: and whether his authoritie be aboue the Scriptures, so as hee may dispense with thinges agaynst GOD his Lawe or no, I leaue to the Authoures, that first inuented such brabbles to occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie mens heades with all. Onelye this in perusing of late, I remember <hi>N. Saunders</hi> an Archepapiste among you English Romanists, handeling this latter question of the Popes authoritie in dispensing against the woorde of God, disputeth whether the Pope may not dispence agaynst the Apostle, thus mynceth hee thinges, and for his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage propoundeth this question, and hee affirmeth as one put to his shiftes therein, that the Pope may doe, or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to bee doone, sometime otherwise then the Apostle commaundeth and ordereth.

And why not, I pray you: when hee hath done, still doth, and can doe greater thinges then this, whereof I enter not now to entr eate vpon this occasion particularly, nor to examine <hi>Saunders,</hi> cauilles and meere shifts indeede, and no better. The Learned know this man of sinne well ynough, and the excessiue authoritie he vsurpeth and chalengeth. The vnlearned I thinke are sufficiently warned before. Let all that are Godlie take heede of dealing with Pope or Papistes in mariage, or otherwise.</p>
            <p>In the seconde conclusion, you bring no newe matter, but turne vs ouer to the olde, and therefore I also send the Reader to that I haue before particularly answeared.</p>
            <p>In the thirde conclusion, it greeueth you her Maiesties Subiectes bee and shoulde bee so obedient to her godlie commaundements, and therefore where obedience for going to Churche is alleadged, you call it a <hi>A vayne pretence.</hi> As the holie Scriptures, for the grounde of our G O D his seruice, were a greate blocke lying in your way, wherewith you were troubled before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon trauelled to inuay agaynst the sacred Scriptures: So now heere, her Maiesties authoritie grounded on the Scriptures, and ioyning therein with the Mynisters do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and exhortation, to call her Subiectes to holie assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, lyeth in your way agayne, and combreth you greate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It wil make you sweate, and your shoulders ake too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will be able to remoue these two blockes. If you possible stumble at them, and breake your shinnes; thanke your selfe of your hurt, who are more busie with them then you neede be.</p>
            <p>Obedience, yea and protestation of obedience to her Maiestie and her wholesome lawes in this behalfe <hi>aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wateth the sinne, rather then diminisheth</hi> it, you say: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I thinke there bee none that hath so little regarde to his Soules health, as to goe to Church ouelie for

obedience sake, and not of a religious minde also. He that thinketh it is naught to speake against the Pope at Paules Crosse (which is your example, though you call it rayling) thinketh therein amisse, and therefore being commanded, if occasion serue therto, shall do well to obey and doe it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressing his former foolish thinking, which too absurdly still you make conscience, when it is indeede but a fancie and a dreame: tel vs it is Pilats case, as much &amp; as lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as you wil, we wil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

of the least of his commandementes, shall haue least pare in the kingdome of heauen. The which words of Christ, Saint Iames explicating, sayeth: hee that keepeth all the whole lawe and doth offend but in one thing onelie, yet is he guiltie in all the rest. And againe, to be imperfect is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the will of Christ which would haue vs perfect.</hi> For Christes wordes you quote <hi>Matthewe.</hi> 5. for the other, <hi>Iames.</hi> 2.

Is it not God his Law I pray you? <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen Image, nor the likenes of any thing that is in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue. &amp;c.</hi> Who breake the same and teach men so to doe?

Is it not Christ his commandement, in the Supper of the Lord? <hi>Drinke you al of this.</hi> Who breake and corrupt the same with false gloses? But you Papistes.</p>
            <p>Euen in this place of the. 5. of <hi>Mat.</hi> the. 6. &amp;. 7. also. Who but papistes? make of Christ his precise commandementes counsels ouely, so loosing or breaking rather the knot wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hath tyed men in dutie towardes him: and all this to bring in workes of supererrogation, <hi>merits, the popish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Fryers, &amp; other their religious men. &amp;c.</hi> things of their owne deuise. Who at this day but Papists denyeth concupiscence or lust to be sinne, which is forbidden in the tenth and last of God his commandements, to the extolling<note place="margin">Look. Rom. 7 from the. 7. verse.</note> of mans nature, and derogating of Gods grace? who to the like effect, set our iustification by workes but they? who is it I pray you tell me if you can, that commeth to that perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in life by workes that Christ here requireth? who can say that he offendeth not in one thing, which if he doe, he is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (as you here tell vs out of <hi>S. Iames</hi>) guiltie in all the rest. There is no such man I trow. That made the holy prophet<note place="margin">Psal. 143. 2. &amp; 130. 3.</note> say, <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy seruant, for in thy sight shall none that liueth be iustifyed.</hi> And againe: <hi>If

            <p>Now then, out of these places. Thus doe I reason against mens being iustified by workes: none that is guiltie in all Gods commandementes, can alledge his workes for his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, or can be iustified by workes, but who euer offendeth but in one thing onely, as I thinke you wil graunt euery man doeth, is guiltie in all the rest as you alledge vs here, out of S. <hi>Iames.</hi> Wherefore none that offendeth but in one thing onely, or which is all one, no mortall man, can alleadge his workes, for his iustice, or can bee iustified by woorkes. To bee iustified by woorkes and through workes to offende GOD and bee thereby guiltie and that in all his commandements, be two contrary thinges, and will euelly stand together: which maketh vs I tell you to seeke out of our selues, and to finde our righteousnes in Christ, and to lay holde on him and it by fayth, where alone it is truely and indeede to bee had. And for our selues and our woorkes, though receiued nowe to grace and iustified in Christ by faith, We be continually and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occupied in godly &amp; good works co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded of God in his law, acknowledging it to be our duetie so to doe, as wherin true christianitie is liuely expressed and shewed foorth: and doe likewise teach other the same, and set them in that course: Yet come we short euer of that Gods Law iustly're<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth therein at our hands, &amp; we our selues would be glad to perfourme. And therfore in the matter of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, we renounce our owne righteousnes: and cleaue onely to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> righteousnes of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ our Lord: &amp; when we haue done all those things that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">Luke. 17. 10.</note> vs, yet say we (as Christ our good maister teacheth vs.) We are vnprofitable seruants we haue done that which was our duetie to doe. &amp;c.</p>

As to geue yet further example, euen in this place of this papists corrupting of the holy scriptures to mans praise and gods and Christes disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Let vs consider one onely place by him selfe heere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged. He pretendeth it to be in the first chapter of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> epistle to the Collossians, but as he began with forgerie, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the words and sence of the holy ghost in the first text of scripture, that he alledged out of <hi>S. Paule</hi> in the. 14. to the Romans, as we haue seen in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning of this his treatise: So in this place, now which is his last text, concludeth he and bindeth vp the whole with corruption &amp; forgery: stil he hath wanted none in the body &amp; middes of his discourse, he is like him selfe euer. That which <hi>S. Paule,</hi> and we with <hi>S. Paule</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe vnto god and Christ that they may haue the glory in all, that doeth this forgerer ascribe vnto man and vs; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:20565:182"/>
both S. Paules (yea the holy ghosts) wordes &amp; the sence of the sacred scriptures also: for where S. Paule liuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the office of the true Christ sheweth what benefite the church Gods people receiue from god by him, thereby discerning and seuering him from all false Christes: there this fellow as though there wanted other false Christs, sets man or our selues in place to take gods, and Christes office, and roome vpon vs. Thus S. Paule: <hi>And you which were in timee past strangers and enimies:</hi> your minds being set in euil works hath hee reconciled in the bodie of his fleshe, thorow death, <hi>to present you holy &amp; vnblameable &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fault in his sight.</hi> Thus this gentle companion telles vs, S. Paule saith: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Christ died for vs, to the end <hi>We should exhibite our selues holie, and vnspotted, and irreprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in his sight.</hi> And yet he further corrupteth the text with his Commentarie: Let the Reader compare, examine, and iudge indifferently of the whole.</p>
            <p>For the rest either it needeth no answere, or is alreadie answeared before. Wherefore I will here ende: wishing vs onelie, that at this day professe the Gospel, and Christes true religion, to apply to the confirming of vs in the trueth, those testimonies and places: which this man (abusing the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
