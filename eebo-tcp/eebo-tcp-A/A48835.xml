            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>33. And the King lamented over <hi>Abner,</hi>
and said, Died <hi>Abner</hi> as a fool dieth?</p>
                  <p>34. Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet
put into fetters: as a man falleth before

self to transgress the rules of
this place, to Preach without a
Text, it should be now, having
this subject before me. Here's a
subject that makes it's own Sermon and its own
Prayer.<note place="margin">Heb. xi. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Blood of</hi> Abel <hi>speaks,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.
This Innocent Blood speaks and cries
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61311:3"/>
in the Ears of God, (the All-knowing God that
hears matter without words;) it speaks and
cries aloud to him for Vengeance: <hi>How long,
O Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. vi. 10.</note> 
               <hi>holy and true, dost thou not judge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It speaks to you, to your eyes, and to your
hearts, many sad and astonishing things. I
judge of others by my self; I do not hear, but
I feel what this speaks to me: It speaks in such
Language as this,</p>
            <p>Oh my Friends! I spent my life in serving
you. It was my business to do Justice and
shew Mercy. See what I had for it, Insnared
and Butcher'd by wicked Men against Justice
and without Mercy. How many things did I
endure e're they brought me to this? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Lies were you told the mean while, to hide
it from you? How many deaths have I suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before Death came to relieve me? And if
that would have satisfied them, if they would
but have Buried me, you should have heard
none of all this. But their Malice went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
My poor mangled macerated Body
must be thrown out to Birds and Beasts, and
my Name to the obloquy of worse men. Then
it was time for me to speak for my self, and
God brought a number of you to hear me:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61311:3"/>
then I said, see, see, O my Friends, how they
have used me! Behold the Spectacle they have
given you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I saw it among the rest: It was a most dismal
fight, such as that which we read of.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iudg. xix. 30.</note> It was so, that
all that saw it, said, There was no such deed done nor
seen from the time that we first came to be a Nation,
till this day.</p>
            <p>'Tis possible I might find something like it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other Nations; but I shall confine my
self to what we find among the people of God.
And of all that God delivers to us in Scripture,
among them, I think there is no example like
that of the Murther of <hi>Abner,</hi> which occasioned
those words which I have chosen for my Text.
And because I do not intend to dwell upon
that, I shall shew you (but briefly) these three
particulars in it,</p>
            <p>First, the Person; secondly, his Sufferings;
and thirdly, the Consequences of it.</p>
            <p>First, the Person; that was <hi>Abner,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
man, both in dignity, and also in useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
among his people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, His Sufferings; a bloody violent
death. And herein I have three things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider.</p>
            <p>First, the kind of Fact: He died, he fell by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61311:4"/>
wicked men: He was Murthered by <hi>Ioab</hi> and
<hi>Abishai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the manner of it; Perfidiously
and cruelly, with shew of the greatest Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
they inhumanly killed him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Authors of it; Such as can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
Friendship to destroy; such no doubt are
wicked men, the most dangerous sort of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men. By such a Wise man may be caught,
and die like a Fool; a mighty man may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the use of his hands; a wary man
may be deprived of the use of his feet: There
is no fighting with such, nor no running away
from such an Enemy.</p>
            <p>This <hi>David</hi> exprest in his Lamentation,
which moved the People to theirs, and that
was the consequence of it, which comes last
to be considered.</p>
            <p>I shall repeat you my Text, that you may
see how all these parts lie together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King Lamented over ABNER, and said,
Died</hi> Abner <hi>as a Fool dieth?</hi> Could he make no
shift for himself? Why couldst thou not fight?
<hi>Thy hands were not bound. nor thy feet put in Fetters,</hi>
why couldst thou not run away? The reason is
plain, thou couldst do nothing to help thy self.
Thou wert caught in a trap. <hi>As a man falleth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61311:4"/>
wicked men, so fellest thou.</hi> This the King
having said, <hi>all the People,</hi> who wept before,
now <hi>wept again</hi> over <hi>Abner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Person here spoken of; He was a<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. xiv. 50.</note>
Prince of the Blood,<note n="b" place="margin">Iosepho <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> Cousin German to
King <hi>Saul,</hi> and General of his Armies all his
Reign. He was an excellent person (as<note n="c" place="margin">Ios. Ant. Iud. lib. 7. c. 1.</note>
               <hi>Iosephus</hi> describes him) for Counsel, &amp; Courage,
and Diligence, &amp; Experience in affairs. There
is ground to believe this from Scripture, which
makes him after <hi>Saul</hi>'s Death, to have been the
only support of his Son and Successor <hi>Ishbosheth.</hi>
'Tis said 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 8, 9. That <hi>Abner took</hi> Ishbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,
<hi>and made him King over all</hi> Israel. He
might, in all probability, considering the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
weakness, as easily have made himself
King if he pleased. But he was true to his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and his Trust. In this Chapter, at the
sixth verse, <hi>He set himself with all his might for
the House of</hi> Saul.</p>
            <p>Amidst his cares and concerns for the State,
he was not forgetful of the Church, as appears
by his Dedications, 1 <hi>Chron. xxvi.</hi> 28.</p>
            <p>I find nothing that can any way blemish his
Memory, unless it was something contained
in this Chapter; where it is said, that he was
charged by <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> with dishonouring the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61311:5"/>
Bed of his late Master, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. He asketh him,
<hi>Wherefore hast thou gone in unto my Fathers Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioseph. Ib.</note>
               <hi>Iosephus</hi> believeth the information was
not true; and it seems not so likely of one of
his age, being then above sixty years old when
the King charged him with it.</p>
            <p>The more cause he had to lay this to heart.
it made that great man think his Service
misplaced, and that God was not pleased with
what he did for <hi>Sauls</hi> Family, in opposition to
<hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. iii. 9, 10.</note> who had a better title to the Crown.
He knew that the Government was not yet
made Hereditary, but that it was conferred
immediately by God, who had decreed that
he would take away <hi>Saul</hi> and set up <hi>David</hi> in
his stead. And reflecting upon this, <hi>Abner</hi>
swore he would now make amends for his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
he would bring over the Kingdom to
<hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> heard;<note place="margin">2 Sam. iil. 11.</note> and durst not gain-say,
nay, it seems he consented to it, by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:
For when <hi>Abner</hi> sent to <hi>David</hi> for
Terms, and he required this preliminary point,
that his Wife <hi>Michal</hi> should be sent home to
him;<note place="margin">Verse 13, 14, 15.</note> we read that <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> used his Authority
in the matter: He sent for his Sister <hi>Michal,</hi>
and delivered her to <hi>Abner,</hi> to take her with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61311:5"/>
him when he went to perfect his agreement
with <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being supposed, that he had <hi>Ishbosheths</hi>
consent, I do not see what can be blamed in
the conduct of <hi>Abner;</hi> I see much to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in him, especially considering the
greatness of his Birth, and how near he was to
the Crown, and in what probability he stood
for it; that notwithstanding all these temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he still adhered to just and right, he kept
his Loyalty to his Prince, he did all possible
Service to his Country.</p>
            <p>He was about the greatest work, to secure
both the peace and the Religion of God's
people, in uniting them under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>David;</hi> when unexpectedly he was
taken off by Death, which is the <hi>second</hi> thing
I am to consider.</p>
            <p>His Death was Untimely, and Bloody, and
Treacherous.</p>
            <p>First, Untimely; for he was then in the
midst of his Business. He had been at <hi>Hebron</hi>
with <hi>David.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. iii. 20, 21.</note> He had made his terms with
him; such as would have united all <hi>Israel</hi>
without a stroke; such as would have saved
<hi>Ishbosheth</hi>'s life, as appears by what follows,
2 <hi>Sam. iv.</hi> 1. (which confirms me in what I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61311:6"/>
said, that he had his consent along with him;
For there it is said) <hi>When</hi> Saul'<hi>s Son heard
that</hi> Abner <hi>was dead, his hands were feeble,
and all the</hi> Israelites <hi>were troubled.</hi> Then,
and not before, the reins of Government fell
out of his hands. He could hold them no
longer, when his friend <hi>Abner</hi> was dead, both his
and all <hi>Israel</hi>'s hopes, depended upon <hi>Abner</hi>'s
safe return.</p>
            <p>And he was so far towards it. He was then
upon the way, when he was fetched back to
<hi>Hebron</hi> by a Messenger in <hi>David</hi>'s name. So
<hi>Iosephus</hi> understands those words in the 26th
verse,<note place="margin">Ioseph. <hi>Ib.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>But</hi> David <hi>knew not of it;</hi> It was in
<hi>David</hi>'s name, but he knew it not.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>Abner</hi> was come back,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 27.</note> even at
the Gate of the Royal City, he was met and
received by some friends whom he did not
suspect. They had him apart from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
they brought him into a lone place,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> saith <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioseph. <hi>Ib.</hi>
               </note> to tell him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which the King had forgot. And there
he soon had his Message; it was a Stab, that
put an end to his life.</p>
            <p>The Authors of this fact were as soon known
as the fact it self. They were <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishai,</hi>
the Sons of <hi>Zerviah;</hi> men that had a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61311:6"/>
pretence to do this,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> iii. 27, 30.</note> in revenge of their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
whom <hi>Abner</hi> had slain some years since
in defence of his own life. Revenge was an
ill reason; but the Scripture mentions that,
as the only one they had to give. The true
reason was (saith the Jewish Historian, who
is herein followed by most Christians,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Ib.</note>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they feared that among <hi>Abner</hi>'s Terms,
this was one, to keep his place, to be Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Armies of <hi>Israel.</hi> That interfered
with the Ambition of these men, who were
resolved to have all the power to themselves,
to admit of no sharer. They would scarce
take in the King himself; Even He complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they were too hard for him, in the last
verse of this Chapter. <hi>I am weak this day,
though anointed King, and these men the Sons of</hi>
Zerviah <hi>are too hard for me.</hi> It appeared they
were so, by this, that he durst not call them
to account for it.</p>
            <p>But he did all that he could. He disclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> iii. 28<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</note>
he detested the wicked fact; He curst the
Authors of it most bitterly. He exposed them
to the people; requiring them all to mourn
for <hi>Abner,</hi> and to shew all possible signs of
it, by renting their clothes; and putting on
Sackcloth, which the people did most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61311:7"/>
and <hi>Ioab</hi> durst not but do it among
the rest. In this mournful array they attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to his grave. The King followed
him weeping, and <hi>all the people wept with him,</hi>
saith the Text.</p>
            <p>When they had buried him, the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the funeral
Song, for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies, which
being in <hi>Ioab</hi>'s and <hi>Abishai</hi>'s presence, it was
a fresh mortification to them, as well as a
just honour to <hi>Abner. The King lamented over
ABNER, saying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I intended all this but to shew you
in Scripture a Record which God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us of his peoples behaviour in such a
case as we have before us. Such as that in
divers respects, though very different in many
other. And yet whereinsoever they differ, if
their case exceed our's in some respects, it is
exceeded by our's in so many more, as may
sufficiently justifie us, and oblige us to the
like Lamentation.</p>
            <p>Only bating this one Circumstance, <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>'s
high birth and quality, being a Prince
of the blood, and so nearly allied to King
<hi>David;</hi> (which, together with some other
public considerations, might well oblige <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61311:7"/>
himself to be present at his Funeral. This
we have no reason to expect of our King,
who hath done in other respects more than
<hi>David</hi> could or durst do for <hi>Abner.</hi> But wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this,) we have all other Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
some greater than what God's people
had in my Text, to weep and weep again,
in our private and in our public Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>First, the Person, and his Personal Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments,
were such, as, though I would not
compare them with <hi>Abners;</hi> yet I would not
lessen him by declining the Comparison.
They were very considerable in his rank.
He was a great blessing to this place, and
will be so understood, as all God's Blessings
are, by the loss of them.</p>
            <p>But secondly, for the Kind of our loss, for
the things that he indured, for the manner
in which he was brought to it, for the
Treachery and Barbarity of it; These things
are so far above all that were in <hi>Abner</hi>'s
case, that we cannot admit them into the
comparison.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the Authors of <hi>Abner</hi>'s Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they were known, by this, and one
more, that of <hi>Amasai</hi> whom they killed in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61311:8"/>
like manner. But for our's, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.
We are yet to inquire for them,
and we have reason to fear we may find them
too late, and yet too soon.</p>
            <p>Lastly, For the Consequences, I shall shew
you how the King hath lamented it; and how,
besides all that we have done, we are yet to do
it so as to make the best of our loss; To sow in
Tears that we may reap in Joy. That is the
End and Benefit of our Lamentation.</p>
            <p>First of the Person, I must crave leave to
say so much as may justifie the public sorrow
upon the account of an Extraordinary loss.
And being my self particularly concerned in it,
I may be allowed to speak with the more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
'Tis all the way I have to shew my Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for the many good offices that I among
many others received from him, while he was
living. And what I am to say, I have so well
considered, that I do not fear to be suspected
of Flattery by any that knew him so well as
most of you did in this place.</p>
            <p>As to those things which belong to a private
Christian, I ought to know him better than most
others; and I did know <hi>that</hi> by him which gives
me abundant comfort in his Death. I knew him
to be a Just and Charitable man, a Devout, a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61311:8"/>
Zealous and Conscientious Christian. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
was more for use than for shew. And yet
he was constant in all the acts of Gods Worship.
He loved the Communion of the Church, as
well out of Judgment as Affection. And though
the compassion that he had for all men that did
amiss, extended it self to allmanner of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
and among them he had a kindness for the
Persons of many <hi>Roman-Catholicks:</hi> Yet he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
declared a particular Hatred and Detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Popery.</hi> I say this on purpose to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
(because some would have him a
<hi>Papist,</hi> or inclined that way,) I never pleased
him with any duty I performed, at least he
never thanked me for any, so much, as he did
for those Sermons which I preacht here against
Popery.</p>
            <p>But these things are less considerable in our
loss, we are more concerned for what he was in
his Publick capacity. And for that he seem'd
made and fitted up with more than ordinary
care: God seemed to have singled him forth,
and designed him to be the Useful man that he
was in this place.</p>
            <p>He was composed for it, both by Nature,
and Education, &amp; Choice, &amp; Study, &amp; Practice:
I know not what could be added to make him
fitter than he was.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:61311:9"/>
He was (as it were) Born to be a Justice of
Peace; his Grand-father, his Father, his
elder Brother were so before him. The two last
were also Members of Parliament. His great
Grand-father was a Captain, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
in those days.</p>
            <p>His Education was sutable to his Birth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
brought up at <hi>Westminster</hi> School, from
whence he was sent to the University, thence
to Travel in forein parts; then he came to
live in the Inns of Court, where wanting health,
he retired for a time into the Countrey: And
now all our hopes of him might seem to have
been defeated at once. But that God, who by
his Providence, designed him for this place,
brought him back with an intimate Friend and
Relation; who having suffered much for the
late King, whose Servant he was, turned what
he had left into Money, and to make the most
of that, employed it in a Wood-yard in this
Parish.</p>
            <p>Our Friend could have no great Estate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tenth Son of his Father, who had four
Sons younger than he was: and his Father was
a younger Son of his Grand-father: So that
though his Father had a plentiful Estate, and
his Grand-father one of the fairest in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61311:9"/>
yet but a small portion of these could fall
to his share.</p>
            <p>But what he had, he laid it out as Partner
with his Friend, and so improved it, till he
had wherewith to live like himself. And then,
he that was never bred to a Trade, needed not
be perswaded to ease himself of it. He found o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
business more equal to his Soul: Which
having practised at first, with his other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment,
afterwards he withdrew from all
other business to this. He dedicated himself
wholly to it; made his Country his Family,
this Parish his Wife and Children; attended
wholly to their good; to keep up Law, and
Justice, and Safety, and Liberty; to save others
from violence and wrong, to reduce them from
disorder and idleness.</p>
            <p>He was perhaps the Man of our Age, that
did the most good in that Station: I should
not doubt of it, having so great an Author.
He that ought to know best, hath often said,
<hi>Sir</hi> Edmund Godfrey <hi>he took to be the best Iustice
of Peace in this Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knew what he had reason to expect
would come of this, the emulation even of
good Men, for they are but men. And he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his own infirmity in this, that sometimes he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61311:10"/>
was troubled at it. But for others, he despised
whatsoever they thought or said. He knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand the price of doing his duty, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ill men he must displease, what Scoffs and
Censures he must indure, what hazards he must
run. And this was all he expected for his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>He thought it worth the while, to suffer this
for God's Glory and the Public Good. 'Tis vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Virtue that puts men only upon safe good
things. 'Tis Virtue in its Perfection, when one
dares do well, and suffer for it. And of this
degree, he shewed some as great proofs, as
perhaps have been given in our days.</p>
            <p>In the Plague-time, who would have done
as he did? not only to stay here, but to expose
himself upon every Occasion. It was much
to indure the very Air; that, besides its own
Putrefaction, was filled with the steams of
so many thousands of dying-breaths. It was
fearful to see and hear the mournful Objects
and Cries that went hourly every-where about
the street. It was a desperate thing to Flesh and
Blood, to converse with them, and to be in the
midst of them. God knows, when I am cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to this, how I shall perform it; But he did,
what I have even trembled to hear; He fed so
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61311:10"/>
many poor with his own hands, distributed as
well Physic as food, exposing himself to be pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and haled by them sometimes. And that
which exceeds all the rest, where the Officers
durst not, he went himself into the Pesthouse to
seize on a Malefactor.</p>
            <p>These are instances of so high a Courage, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
a Zeal to Public Good, that if we should
have the like occasion again, (which God forbid)
we could scarce hope to find the like Instances.
He could not shew the like himself at other times.</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall the more easily pass over
those things which in themselves were very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable;
those Watchings, and Hazards, and
Toils, which would have been great matters to
others; But they were less to him, because he had
inured himself to them. They were by long and
constant practice become so natural to him, that
he seemed to have left himself, no sense of any
Labour, no Weariness of watching, no Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Danger, in any thing by which he might
do service to God, the King, and his Countrey.
There are but few such men living, the greater
is our loss by his Death.</p>
            <p>A great loss, if he had died a Natural Death.
Then we should have submitted to the will of God.
And so we must now. But we could easier have
done it, if he had lived out his time, and done all
the good we could have hoped from him. If he
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61311:11"/>
had lived the Age of a man, as his Grandfather did;
or as his Father,<note place="margin">Psal. xc. 10.</note> to that which <hi>Moses</hi> calls Labour
and Sorrow; or as his Mother, who is eighty six
years old, and yet living. How much good might
one do so qualified as he was, so disposed, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
so verst in Business? How much more
good might he have done, if he had lived to those
Years? But to be taken off at six and fifty, as he
was, when he might have lived much longer, to
go on doing still as he did; the thought of this
hath much uneasiness in it.</p>
            <p>But then farther, to think how he was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
by a violent Death; He was Murthered; The
very mention of this strikes horror into one that
considers it. Human Nature abhors it. Much more,
Grace in Christians; whom God hath strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it, by all the Laws that are given to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
            <p>But then, to murther a Magistrate, that should
be the Keeper of those Laws; This is so much
beyond Common Horror, I know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
it. If it were an Assault, if it were a false Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
much more if the Murther, of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
person, the Magistrate is he that should punish
it. But that he should be murthered himself! To
murther <hi>Him,</hi> it cannot be without the highest Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
to Authority, and Laws, to the King, to the
whole Nation, to God himself. Alas! that such
wickedness should be done in our Nation, in this
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in this Place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:61311:11"/>
But especially upon such a Magistrate, that was
the blessing of this place. They could not hurt
him, but they must hurt us all, for whom he
lived, and cared, more than for himself; for
whom he also died, as we have too much reason
to believe. Considering this, it concerns us all
to know how he died.</p>
            <p>There are ways, that a Wise man may die
like a Fool; that he can neither fight nor run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
(as my Text shews us). Thus died <hi>Abner,</hi>
and thus died our Friend; and this heightens our
horror above measure. Had he died by sudden
chance, or by open Malicious design, it had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
to him as it hath done to many others:
But perhaps never any was Murthered as he was,
so treacherously and basely, and with such bloody
and barbarous Cruelty.</p>
            <p>For the Treacherousness of it, if <hi>Abner</hi> were
catcht so, it is no wonder. 'Tis no hard thing
for any one that hath made himself base enongh;
that will violate his Faith, and break the bonds
of human society; to call another aside, and secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to cut his Throat. The pretence of common
Friendship is enough to enable any one that is
wicked enough, to do this.</p>
            <p>But in our case, there was no need of so much
as that pretence or colour of Friendship. Any
Stranger might do it to a person of so easie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess;
one that never denied himself to any one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61311:12"/>
that had need of him; one that neither feared
force, nor affected shew; and therefore never
took so much as a Servant along with him. He
was at every ones call, to do that which was his
daily business; to make Peace, to do Justice, to
do any good to any Person. Was it not a worthy
Prize to get such a one into their hands? Oh
Cowards! that could go such a low mean way
to take him. Oh Monsters! that having taken
him, could find in their hearts to do him hurt.</p>
            <p>Well, he is now in their hands, as he thinks,
to do them Service in his place. What business
have they for him? What they said, we are not
able to guess: But what they did, appeared by
woful tokens in this poor body.</p>
            <p>God knows where they kept him. We know
only it was under restraint; and 'twas not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in darkness, by the Wax-candle-drops up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Cloaths; and therefore it was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hell upon Earth; though it was like it in
his usage, that Hellish usage that he indured.</p>
            <p>Ah poor Soul! How many comfortless hours
did he reckon in that merciless Trap where they
kept him? How many insulting words, how
many reproaches did he hear? What Racks, what
Bodily tortures might he probably suffer? And
what Cordial, what Refection to support him
under all this? We know nothing but what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in his Body; his sunk Belly, his empty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61311:12"/>
Stomach, his blancht Tongue, were all witnesses
of his Chear. <hi>My Tears are my Meat day and night,
while I call upon my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet we cannot say they starved him. God knows
what they would have done, had they had time;
but in all likelihood, it was the fear of Search that
hastned his Death.</p>
            <p>And the same death it was, that they deserved
ten thousand times over. They can suffer no worse
(if they are taken) than this, to be Strangled, and
then the Law hath done with them. But when they
had Strangled <hi>him,</hi> they had not done with him
so, he must be cast forth to the Birds &amp; Beasts: and
that with the formality of a Sword thrust through
his body, that if men came to find him, they
might judge that he had killed himself; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were to save themselves from Suspicion, or
whether out of malice to him, or whether both
these together, God knows.</p>
            <p>Sure enough, it was the worst they could do to
<hi>him;</hi> It was that which being believed, would
ruin all that they had left. All that they could not
reach, the Law would, if he had Murthered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
It must have ruined his Name, it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his Estate, it had brought a blot upon his
Family. Nothing could be done more to shew
their Malice, if that were their meaning.</p>
            <p>If they rather sought to hide their own Guilt,
it was surely an Infatuation from God: He took
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61311:13"/>
away their understandings, that they could not
consider those things which every Child could not
but observe. What, would none miss his Band, or
take notice of his clean Shoes? Would none look
for the effusion of Blood, or take notice of that
which hindred it, that so manifest Coagulation?
Twenty things more that have been considered
elsewhere, and are not to be repeated in this place.</p>
            <p>It was surely an Infatuation from God. Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
suffered them to run on in their sin to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
to make that scarlet sin of Murther, even
blush at it self (if it were possible); having suffered
the Devil to teach them every thing else that he
could think of, to consummate the Ruin of this
good man; yet was pleased so to take away their
understandings, that they could not see so many
evident proofs as would be made to all the world;
of his Innocence, and of their horrible wickedness.</p>
            <p>But now I speak of Discovery, me-thinks I see
you all stirred up, as it were, expecting that I
should name you the Persons that did this bloody
Fact. I would I could, for sundry reasons. But I
cannot pretend to that. I can only say with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
they were <hi>Wicked men.</hi> He was the common
Enemy of all such, and it pleased God to let him
fall into their hands. He fell by the hands of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men,</hi> that is certain.</p>
            <p>But if you would know more, I will endeavour
to shew you how possibly You may discover them.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61311:13"/>
Perhaps some that are wiser, would be afraid to go
so far. But why so? I speak for <hi>him</hi> that feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to lose an Opportunity of doing good.
And in hopes to do good by it, I will be so far like
him; I will not fear to go on with what I offered, as
to the discovery.</p>
            <p>There are three things to be chiefly considered in
this matter. First, Mens Actions: Secondly, Their
Interests: and Thirdly, their Principles. We shall
consider each of these,</p>
            <p>First, their Actions and Practices. Since we know
not who they are that were the Authors of this Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
at least can we find who they are that are
not willing we should know it? They that have
practised, and intrigued to this purpose, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to hinder the Search, or the Discovery; if they
knew what they did, we have reason to judge they
were concerned, for themselves, or for their Friends.</p>
            <p>You cannot but remember the dust that was raised
in the week when the Search should have been made;
those Calumnies, &amp; those various reports that went
about, as it were, on purpose to hinder the discovery.
One while he had withdrawn himself for Debt; Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
while he was Married, &amp; that not very decently;
Another while he was run away with a Harlot;
even what the Father of Lies put into their heads.</p>
            <p>At last, when they knew what they intended to do
with him; they prepared you to expect it, by giving
out that he had kild himself. You know how impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61311:14"/>
they were to have this believ'd. I was told it some
hours before the discovery, that he was found with
his own Sword through his Body. Others could tell
that he had two wounds about him. These things
were found to be True some hours after.</p>
            <p>But then they devised sundry Untruths to colour it.</p>
            <p>It was suggested that it might be done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which (they said) was an Hereditary Disease in
his Family, that his Father and his Grand-father had it
before him; that this Disease being stirred up by
some mis-apprehensions, wrought that direful effect
upon him, to make him kill himself.</p>
            <p>These things (from whatsoever Author they came)
being confidently said, were as easily believed by
them that knew nothing to the contrary. I confess I
knew not what to think my self, till I saw the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
with my eyes. When I saw he was strangled
as well as thrust through, I soon considered, that no
man could kill himself both those ways.</p>
            <p>And then for the Scandal that was raised of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
I found upon inquiry; that all the colour they
had to say it, was only this: that his Father was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
afflicted with Melancholy, almost to Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but it was before he was fifty years old; he soon
recovered of it, and lived till the eightieth year of
his Age. Besides, I am informed, that there never
was any appearance of the like Distemper in any
one Person of all that numerous Family: Nor did
any of his Relations ever come to an untimely end,
as has been falsly reported.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61311:14"/>
For the Melancholy that was observed in our
Friend, I think none, that knew him, ever
thought it Distraction, or any thing tending
that way; but a thoughtfulness sometimes, that
proceeded from the Intricacy and Multiplicity
of Business. I believe the weightiest business
that ever he had, was that which made him say
some Days before his Death, <hi>I am told I shall
be knock'd in the Head.</hi> He said this in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
without any great visible Concern. He
continued the same he ever was, in his daily
Conversation; Serious in Business, but Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Pleasant at other times. Thus he used to
be alway. He was so the last day of his living
life; that is, till the hour that we lost him. And
how he was afterwards, I suppose they best
know, that were the Authors of these Rumors.
That's one way to try men, I think, by their
Actions and Practises.</p>
            <p>A Second way to find out the Authors of any
Fact, is to consider who they were that were
concerned to have it done. It was <hi>Cassius</hi>'s word,
<hi>Cui bono?</hi> For whose Interest was it? Now
consider for whose Interest it was to kill this
Person.</p>
            <p>They must be some that were not safe while
he lived; or some that might be the better for
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61311:15"/>
his Death; And that in some considerable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
such as would requite all the danger they
were to incur by it.</p>
            <p>If you know of any that could not think
themselves safe while he lived, you have great
reason to believe you know the Authors of his
Death. I have not so far been Privy to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
as that I could be able to enter into this
Secret.</p>
            <p>Much less to know of any Personal Malice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. He that was so tender hearted, even to
those whom he punished, could not provoke any
one to this height of Revenge.</p>
            <p>Much less were they Robbers, or any such
Poor Rogues, that kill men for what they have.
These did their work <hi>Gratis.</hi> They left him all
his Money. They took nothing but his Band,
except Papers.</p>
            <p>'Tis therefore very credible, that the Authors
had some other Interest that moved them to it.
And that seems rather to have been, against the
Government and the Laws. They knew how
firm he was in his Duty to both; and perhaps
they had tried it in something else than we
know of. If so, they could not but think it
worth their while to send him out of the World.
One that durst do his duty, when he knew,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61311:15"/>
whom, and what, he should provoke by it; One
that would give so ill an Example to other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates,
which if followed, might be the Ruin
of their Cause; What could they think of such
a man? We cannot scare him, We cannot
bribe him, but we can kill him. They could not
have thought of a more Compendious way than
this.</p>
            <p>Especially, if the killing of him would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten
others, and so be a means to weaken
Authority and Laws. Such men cannot but
know, that Publick-Spirited men are not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and they that are, are but Men, They may
be daunted, they may be discouraged. And
what can do that, more, than the Terror of
such an Example?</p>
            <p>I doubt not, they that did this, would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have done it Publickly for that reason. As
we hang up Thieves, for Example to others;
so to hang up Justices for doing their Duty; Oh
that would be a pleasant thing indeed!</p>
            <p>No, Gentlemen, we are not come to that
yet. God knows, what we may come to for
our Sins, and by your Means. But it will be the
longer first, if the Laws can find You out. And
towards that, we have some guess at you by this
Token; They that are against the Established
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61311:16"/>
Laws, it was their Interest to do this, That is
the <hi>Second</hi> thing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Token is, by their Principles. And
so, whosoever did this, they should be either
such as hold nothing Unlawful, or at least such
as hold it Lawful to do such things.</p>
            <p>For the First, that is, Men of Atheistical
Principles; they follow only their Lust, or
their Interest; Which will scarce unite any
number of men to carry on such a formed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
as this was. Or if it had, they would scarce
have held together so long, they would have
impeached one another, and so saved us the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of Discovering them by this Token.
I do not therefore charge it upon them that hold
nothing Unlawful.</p>
            <p>But how shall we excuse them, that hold it
Lawful to do such things? If there are such
Men in the World, and if the other Tokens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to them, they surely are the likeliest that
can be thought of for this Matter.</p>
            <p>But such a sort of men there is, even here in
<hi>England,</hi> we have them among us. I could
not but think of them when I named the other
Tokens, and so must any one that hath been
conversant in their Books.</p>
            <p>We need not put them upon the Rack, to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61311:16"/>
make them Confess. They offer themselves,
they tell us such things which we scarce dare
tell you again. 'Tis scarce credible, how open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and how grosly, they teach men these things
They are the <hi>Iesuits</hi> I speak of. And whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reads their Books cannot but know I do not
wrong them in what I say.</p>
            <p>I say, <hi>First,</hi> They teach men to raise such
Reports as we heard of this Person.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis their Interest to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Execution of the Law.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They hold it Lawful to kill
Men that would prejudice them or their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>If I prove these <hi>Three</hi> things, we have all the
Tokens together, which I think are not to be
found so in any other Persons or Society. Let
them clear themselves as they can of the Fact.
I will prove the Tokens. And <hi>First</hi> for their
teaching of Calumny.</p>

Defence of ones own Right or Honor, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

the Society; some hold it plainly Lawful. Some
say, it is a Venial Sin. For the Proofs you may
find them together in the <hi>Fifteenth</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Letters.</hi> If so, what should hinder these

               </gap>ising all those Reports of this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
Since it was in Defence of themselves, and
of their Sect, if they killed him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That it was their Interest to kill
him, 'tis manifest; if they have any design against
the Government; And if either his Life would
have hindred or discovered them in it, or if his
Death would discourage others from being Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in their Place. But that it is the Interest of
their Sect, and of their Church, to subvert the
Government; and that they for their Parts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
it now at this Present; I think this is so pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
that I should but lose time in proving it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That they hold it Lawful to kill in
such cases. For this, 'tis as plainly delivered in
their Writings, as any Article of Faith is in the
Creed.</p>
            <p>They say First in General, To kill another,
is Murther indeed, if you do it for Revenge, or
any such Sinister End. And therefore you must
be careful to direct your Intention aright. And
so by directing the Intention, though you do the
same Act, it is not Murther.</p>
            <p>For Example (saith <hi>Amicus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Now who that knows what Informations our
Friend had against them, can doubt but they
might lawfully kill him by these Doctrines?</p>
            <p>I name but one for each. Whosoever would
see more, may find them collected in the <hi>seventh</hi>
and the <hi>thirteenth</hi> of the <hi>Provincial Letters.</hi>
Though if we had but one Author for each of
these Doctrines, that's enough to make a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Doctrine, as they tell us. And then, if it is
probable,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lessius</hi> de Jure &amp; Just. lib. 2. c. 9. dub. 12. Sect 1 81.</note> we may practise it safely without sin.</p>
            <p>I know what any <hi>Iesuit</hi> would answer to this.
They would say that these Doctrines, are some
of them delivered as being only Speculatively
true; that is, they are true in their own Nature:
But they are not <hi>Practicè sequendae,</hi> that is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61311:18"/>
of the Consequences, they are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to Practice. And why so? If they are spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatively
true,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Filliuc.</hi> Ib. majora ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la in Rep. sequeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> why then are they not to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised?
They themselves tell you why, They
would cause disorders in the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lessius</hi> hath a better Reason,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lessius</hi> de Jure &amp; <hi>Iust.</hi> lib. 2. c. 9. dub. 8. Sect. 47.—talis in Rep. bene constitutâ ut homicida plecteretur.</note> for one of them,
He saith, one ought not to practise it, because if
one doth, he may be hang'd for it. The mean
while, if one can do it so secretly, as not to disturb
the Commonwealth, (and then to be sure he
shall not hang for it) in that case it is <hi>Practicè
sequenda,</hi> 'Tis to be practised according to their
Doctrine. Or if not, while it is speculatively
true, that the thing it self is no sin; Who that
knows this, and hath a mind to kill another, and
sees his Occasion, will make any Scruple of the
Practice?</p>
            <p>Yes, (they will tell you) the Pope hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it, in that Decree of the Year 1665.
which is set down in the end of the last <hi>Roman
Index</hi> To their shame be it said, These Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are forbidden indeed; But not as being
Untrue, not as Contrary to God's word, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Immorality in them: How then? He
saith, they are <hi>ad minimum scandalosae,</hi> At least
they are apt to give Offence, (no doubt they are,
if we Hereticks come to know them:) And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61311:18"/>
he charges them upon their Obedience to
himself, that they must not Practise these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
            <p>Had he said upon their Obedience to God,
that had been a dangerous word. It would have
made them afraid to Practise them, even in his
own Service. He would take heed of that, not
to spoil that which may be a Useful Doctrine.
But he forbade it, forsooth, upon Obedience to
himself, which is such a Restraint as the Pope
may take off when he pleaseth.</p>
            <p>And how can we tell, when he doth, or doth
not, that which is in his Power secretly to do or
not to do? We have only this measure by which
to judg: He will do whatsoever he sees best for the
Catholick Cause. If he sees it best for the Cause,
we shall live. If not, you see it is no sin to kill
us; even the Pope being Judge. So that now
we hold our Lives at his Courtesie.</p>
            <p>But thanks be to God, that gives us better se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
than that; gives us Government and Laws
to protect us: Or else, no man here knows how
soon he might be laid as our Friend is before us.</p>
            <p>And we thank you, Reverend Fathers of the
Society, if you were the men that killed him, as
you are the likeliest if we may believe yourselves;
We thank you, that you did not begin with the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61311:19"/>
Government first. That you killed <hi>him,</hi> not the
<hi>King.</hi> There had been a Blow indeed. We
thank you for not beginning with That. Though
we have the less cause, if your Plot was against
the King, and you only took this man away,
that you might the better cover it. We thank
you at least, though we pay too dear for it, that
you have made the People know your Religion;
that you have Alarm'd the State with your
Practises; We may live the longer for that, to
thank you for it.</p>
            <p>But then we must remember, we ow this to
God, not to you. He it is that hath crossed your
Design. It is he that hath taken away your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,
and spread reproach on your faces in the
stead. We see what you would be at; if not by
this, by some thing else.</p>
            <p>And if we saw it by nothing else, we know
it sufficiently in your Writings. When your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
are so plain, we have no Reason to doubt
of your Practises. God still deliver us from your
Bloody hands. God keep <hi>England</hi> from your
Bloody Religion.</p>
            <p>This being at present as far as we can go in
the Discovery; all that remains is, to return, and
to consider our loss, and to lament over it. It was
the Consequence of <hi>Abner</hi>'s Death. <hi>The King
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61311:19"/>
Lamented over</hi> Abner, <hi>and the People wept over
him again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>David</hi> mourned for <hi>Abner.</hi> That was
all that he could do. Our King hath done
more. He hath not only lamented, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
his sense of it, to the whole Nation. He
hath done it, once, and again, with all possible
Demonstrations of his Care, and of his Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
for the Discovery, and for the Punishment
of this wickedness.</p>
            <p>Where the King hath begun to us, we ought
to follow him, as <hi>Israel</hi> did <hi>David.</hi> We have
wept already, we are here to weep over him <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
And because I would not keep you long in
pain, nor stir you up to fruitless Tears, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to shew you how it may be a useful
Lamentation.</p>
            <p>There is no fruit to Godward, but is to be
brought forth with Patience. And therefore <hi>first.</hi>
I must caution you to that, in this and all other
Trials. If this Horrible Fact were committed by
those hands, (which of all other we have reason
by all Tokens to suspect) yet have Patience, and
deal not violently even with <hi>them.</hi> What by Law
may be done, I would not preclude, I pray for
it. But otherwise, 'tis Murther in you to kill a
<hi>Iesuit,</hi> that thinks it none in such Cases as this to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61311:20"/>
kill You. God be thanked, you are no Disciples
of theirs, but of him whose sacred name they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse;
that Holy <hi>Iesus;</hi> He hath taught us other
Rules, he hath shewed us other Practises. <hi>Love your
Enemies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note> 
               <hi>Bless them that curse you, Pray for them
that despightfully use you and persecute you.</hi> These
Rules, and the like, are the Soul of the Christian
Religion. 'Tis that which softens the Heart, and
makes it gentle, and tender, and pitiful. And so
conforms us to the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled,
reviled not again; When he suffered, he
threatned not; but committed himself to him that
judgeth Righteously.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, when I consider the temper that is
required of all Christians; I cannot but bless God
for what I find in the Protestant Religion. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but reflect on the incredible Patience that
was found in you at the Fire of <hi>London.</hi>
Though so many believed, and few very much
doubted whence it came; that it was from the
same hands which we justly suspect for this
Wickedness; yet there was no Tumult rose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; no Violence done that extended to the
Life of any Person.</p>
            <p>You then bore patiently that great loss both
of your Houses and of your Goods. And now it
cometh to your Persons and Lives, still your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61311:20"/>
continues. Is not this a fair proof of your
Religion? I bless God for it; and pray for the
like in other things; Though this one is a great
Testimony to us, even our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
being Judges, if they would but consider
it.</p>
            <p>Had either of these things been done or hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in any Popish Countrey; had the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
been suspected to have had any the least
Finger in them; there had not been one of them
suffered to live in that Countrey. Alas! with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that, What have those poor men suffered?
What have they not suffered, who have had
their Lot in Popish Countries? In <hi>France</hi> a
hundred thousand Massacred in a few daies.
How many more thousands in <hi>Ireland</hi> in our
Memory? not to speak of the like Slaughters,
in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Where can they shew the like in Countries
of our Religion? They might have found it now
here, if we had been like them. But blessed be
God, we are not so, and I hope shall never
be.</p>
            <p>I beseech you to continue the same Patience
still; not lose it for any, even the highest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.
Commit your wrongs to him that
judgeth righteously; and under him to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61311:21"/>
that <hi>bears not the Sword in vain.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Next, Since we ought to Imitate those whom
we praise; let us follow our Friend, in those
things which were praise worthy in him. I might
enlarge this in sundry Particulars, for he had not
a few Exemplary Virtues. But I must not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
beyond those that are of present Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Let us first endeavour to right him in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
that he has suffered, and then not shrink
from our Duties for fear of suffering the like
our selves.</p>
            <p>For the First, He was ready to do all right
to others, especially if they had been so handled
as he was. If any other, If his Murtherers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
had been used thus, he had been the man
to have righted them; by all lawful means to
clear the Innocent, to discover and to punish the
Guilty. This Duty is now Yours, every one in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61311:21"/>
his Place, to do all that possibly he can, to right
his Memory, to discover his Murtherers, and to
bring them to due Punishment.</p>
            <p>I need not much exhort You to this; and
therefore next, for that which may be more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
I beseech you to follow him in this, not to
shrink so far from your Duty as to fear them, He
feared them not for Your sakes.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, he suffered for it, he lost his life.
But let the Devil get nothing more by that. He
hopes, and it seems to have been his design,
to deter You from Your Duties, for fear if you
be too forward, he may stir up others to serve
You in like manner.</p>
            <p>Well, but that will not certainly follow.
They will not alwaies find men unprovid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor alwaies ready to be drawn into
Traps. You see they have awakened the
Government, I hope this will also awaken
You. Oh how happy should we be, (though
we paid so dear for it,) if we could
gain this by what we have lost; If all would
be so vigilant, so resolved, that they might
not know which to take next; If for one
Sir <hi>Edmund Godfrey,</hi> whom they have taken
away, we might see twenty, yea a hundred
such Justices in this City.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:61311:22"/>
And why not? The <hi>English</hi> Spirit is Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
and Bold, as well as it is Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
and Gentle. They may be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
or misled, but they are not to be
frighted, or threatned; not easily into their
Duties, I hope, much less out of them. That,
I trust, will never be.</p>
            <p>Especially, if we remember the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, which is the <hi>third</hi> thing.
If we look up to him, that hath secured us
against so great and so many Dangers.<note place="margin">1 Sam 17. 37.</note> 
               <hi>He
that delivered me from the Bear, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
(saith <hi>David) he will deliver me from the
hand of this Philistin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may argue likewise; He that saved us
in <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> he that saved us from the <hi>Gun-powder
Plot,</hi> he will deliver us from this curs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Conspiracy. He will give us this fruit of
our Loss, and of all their Machinations against
us.</p>
            <p>Who knows, but, in the end, it may
prove a fatal blow to themselves? This, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with other things, which are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Consideration, may occasion a fair rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of all that Faction out of <hi>England.</hi> It
may so happen to them, as the Apostle fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
it would to the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61311:22"/>
the Christians at <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> That
they would but <hi>fill up the measure of their Sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thes. 2. 16.</note>
               <hi>that Wrath might come upon them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pray rather for their Conversion. But
whether that will ever be; Whether the
one, or the other, we must leave that to
God.</p>
            <p>And Lastly, Look to our Selves, that all
our ways be pleasing in his sight. If so,
he is able to secure us against all others:
But otherwise there is nothing can secure us
against <hi>Him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 127. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 118. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Except he keep the City, the
Watchman wakes but in vain. But if he be
on our side, we need not fear what man can do
unto us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore cleave we to him, with all our
Hearts, and Souls. Hold fast that which he
hath committed to our Charge, the Gospel of
Christ. When God sees Truth on our Side,
nothing can make Him against us, but
Sin.</p>
            <p>Therefore Watch also against Sin, Shew
the Truth of your Faith by your Works,
Adorn your Holy Profession with a Holy
Life. So living, Death can be no Surprize
to us, even such a Death, or worse, if worse
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61311:23"/>
can be, Let them kill our Bodies, abuse them,
mangle them, as this is, or worse; Let them
burn them, and throw our Ashes whither
they please; We lose nothing by it. At last,
all shall meet again in a happy and blessed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
