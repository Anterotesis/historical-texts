            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSAL. X. 4.</bibl>
               <q>The Wicked, through the Pride of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
will not seek after God; neither is
God in all his Thoughts.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN these words, I have, in a former Discourse,
taken notice of these Three Particulars:</p>
            <p>I. The General Character or Qualifications of the
Person here mentioned, which is, <hi>That he is a
Wicked Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The Particular Kind of Wickedness, or Origin
from whence the Spirit of Atheism and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
doth chiefly proceed, and that is Pride;
<hi>The Wicked, through the Pride of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>III. The great Charge which the Psalmist brings
against the Person here spoken of in my Text,
<hi>viz.</hi> Wilful Atheism and Infidelity; <hi>He will not
seek after God, neither is God in all his Thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Two first of these I have already dispatch'd,
and therefore shall now proceed to discourse on my
Third Head, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Charge here brought against this Wicked
Person, <hi>That he will not seek after God; neither
is God in all his Thoughts:</hi> or, as it is in the
Margin, with good grounds (as I have before
observed) from the Hebrew, <hi>All his Thoughts are,
There is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:59824:3"/>
Which appears to me to imply a wilful and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
slighting and contemning of God, and his Laws,
and an endeavour to banish the very Thoughts of his
Existence out of their Minds. And under this Head,
I shall make it my business to enumerate all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Arguments and Objections which I have met
with, and are of any weight, against the Being of
a God, in general; and then endeavour to shew how
Weak and Inconclusive they are, and how miserable
a Support they will prove for Atheism and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</p>
            <p>But first it will be necessary, briefly to clear up
one Point, and to obviate one Objection that may
be made against this very Attempt of mine, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
and Answering the Atheists Arguments and
Objections.</p>
            <p>It will, I doubt not, be said, That there is not now,
nor ever perhaps was in the World, any such Person
as a <hi>Speculative Atheist,</hi> or one that believes, there is
no God. It is said, with great assurance, by some,
That the Ancient Atheists were only such as declared
against the Plurality of Gods, and the Idolatry and
Superstition of the Heathen Worship. And we
are told by one, very lately,<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Two</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>says <hi>from</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>in the</hi> Apology.</note> 
               <hi>That he hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled
many Countries, and could never meet with any
Atheists, (which are few, if any;) and all the Noise and
Clamour,</hi> saith he, <hi>is against Castles in the Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Answer, That nothing can be more
plain and clear, than that both Ancient and Modern
Writers do give us an account of such Persons as were
known and reputed Atheists, by those that were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary
with them, and did well understand their
Principles and Tenets. I need not insist on Proofs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59824:3"/>
from any of the Ancient Christian Writers; for 'tis
sufficient, that <hi>Plato, Diogenes Laertius, Plutarch, Cicero,</hi>
and many others, do acquaint us, that such kind of
Men there have been in the World. Tho' I shall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
produce the Testimony of two Authors, one
ancient, and the other, 'tis probable, now living,
to prove this Point; and these are, <hi>Sextus Empiricus,</hi>
and he that wrote the <hi>Thoughts on the Comet that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in the Year 1680. Sextus</hi> is express,<note n="a" place="margin">Adv. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them. <hi>p 317, 318, &amp;c.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevae, 1621.</note> That
<hi>Diagoras Melius, Prodicus Chius, Euemerus, Critias
Atheniensis, Theodorus,</hi> and many others, were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Atheists, and denied that there were any Gods
at all. And the <hi>French</hi> Gentleman<note n="b" place="margin">Pensees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses à l' Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion de la Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mete, <hi>Tom. 2. §. clxxiv. p.</hi> 531.</note> saith the same
of most of those mentioned by <hi>Sextus,</hi> and other
Ancient Writers; and to the number, adds some
others of a Modern date: And Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> saith,
<note n="c" place="margin">Anim, Mand. <hi>p.</hi> 96.</note> that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> constantly affirmed, there
were no Gods. Now the Evidence of these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
will, I hope, be allowed, because they seem
Well-wishers to the Cause of Infidelity themselves.
To these I might add, were it necessary, That <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninus</hi>
himself tells us frequently of Atheists that he
met with, (and no one will doubt but that he knew
where to find one at any time,) and he calls <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel,</hi>
expressly, <hi>Atheorum facilè Princeps</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatr. D. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiae, <hi>p.</hi> 35.</note> But
indeed, this Assertion of these Gentlemen, That
there is no such thing as an <hi>Atheist</hi> in the World, is
like most other things that they advance, Uncertain
and Precarious, and often contradicted by what at
other times they deliver: for though they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and in some Companies, for Reasons that are
very obvious, unwilling to take the Title of <hi>Atheist</hi>
on themselves or their Party; yet they are often
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59824:4"/>
ready enough to bestow it on others; and when it is
subservient to their purpose, will insinuate,<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Blount</hi>'s Translation of the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollonius,</hi> p. 34.</note> That the
greatest Lights and Teachers of the Church believe
as little of Religion as themselves. But I say also,</p>
            <p>2. That 'tis one thing to disbelieve the Existence
of a God, and another to declare so to the World.
And it doth not at all follow, that a Man is not an
Atheist, because he doth not openly profess himself
to be so, at all times, and in all Companies. There
are no Writers so insincere as these kind of Gentlemen;
they are very cautious and tender how they expose
themselves to the just Punishment of the Law. <hi>Vaninus</hi>
himself, though he did at last suffer Death <hi>madly,</hi> for
his Infidelity, (as one<note n="b" place="margin">Anima Mundi, <hi>in the</hi> Oracles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, p. 54.</note> saith of him, that died as
madly himself,) yet is he very cautious and careful,
in his Writings, how he renders himself obnoxious
to the Censure of the <hi>Inquisition;</hi> and he declares,
<note n="c" place="margin">Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatr. <hi>p.</hi> 151, 334. Lugdum. 1615.</note> That he will submit all things to the Judgment
of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> So a Gentleman of our own
Nation, though he endeavours, as effectually as 'tis
possible, under-hand, to ridicule and undermine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
yet he would fain appear to the World to be
a good Christian, and one that hath a mighty Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for God and his Laws: but, in the mean time,
'tis very easie to discover his true Principles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
for he declares,<note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>Blount</hi>'s Translation of <hi>Philostratus</hi>'s <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonius,</hi> in the Preface.</note> That he thinks it much
<hi>safer to believe as the Church believes, and to pin his
Faith always on my Lord of</hi> Canterbury<hi>'s Sleeve,</hi> as he
saith he will do, and <hi>subscribe</hi> to any ridiculous Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend,
rather than incurr the Censure of the <hi>Popish
Clergy;</hi> as he basely calls the Ministers of this most
Excellent <hi>Protestant</hi> Church: for the same laudable
Reasons also, he forbears communicating, what he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59824:4"/>
doth, or ought to think Truth, to Mankind, (as he
tells us in many places.) Now if this be the case
with these <hi>Men of Honour,</hi> that they dare not speak
their Minds, nor discover their true Sentiments plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the World; we must by no means conclude
over-hastily of their <hi>Orthodoxy,</hi> by what they say in
Discourse at <hi>some times,</hi> or publish in Print at <hi>others:</hi>
but, in short, if they set up such a Notion of a God,
as is essentially inconsistent with the <hi>Idea</hi> that all
Mankind have of such a Being; if they make him
either a Necessary Agent, or a Blind, Idle and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active
One; if they divest him of his Providence,
or cramp him in his Attributes, as those that call
themselves <hi>Deists</hi> generally do: in a word, if they
make him such an Impotent and Careless Being, as
either cannot or will not govern the World, give
Laws to his People, vindicate his own Honour, and
punish and reward Men according to their Actions:
'Tis plain, I say, that though in <hi>words</hi> they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to believe and honour a God, yet in <hi>reality</hi> they
deny him, and have no manner of Notion of his true
Nature and Perfections. But 'tis not the <hi>Name</hi> only,
nor the empty Sound of the word <hi>Deity,</hi> but the <hi>Thing,</hi>
that is wanting in the World; 'tis the true Knowledge
and Belief of <hi>this</hi> only, that can clear a Man from the
imputation of Atheism: If he be not right in this
Point, <hi>i. e.</hi> if he have not such a belief of God, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in it a knowledge of the Perfections of his Nature,
he may call himself by as <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>fashionable</hi> Names
as he pleases, and pretend to <hi>Deism</hi> and <hi>Natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
but in reality he is an <hi>Atheist,</hi> and so ought
to be esteemed by all Mankind; for as one saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Blount<hi>'s</hi> Anima Mundi, <hi>in</hi> Oracles of Reason, <hi>Pref.</hi>
               </note>
that knew very well what an Atheist was, <hi>Such are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59824:5"/>
Atheists, as deny God's Providence; or who restrain
it in some particulars, and exclude it in reference to
others,</hi> as well as those who directly deny the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of a Deity: And <hi>Vaninus</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatr. <hi>p.</hi> 124.</note> calls <hi>Tully</hi> Atheist,
on this very account; and in another place, he saith,
<note n="c" place="margin">Pag. 152.</note> That to deny a Providence, is the same thing as
to deny a God.</p>
            <p>This therefore being returned in Answer to the
Objection, That there is no such thing as an Atheist:
Let us now go about to examine and consider the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
and Objections that are usually brought by
Atheistical Men, against the Being of a God. And
these, one would think, should be exceeding weighty
ones, and no less than <hi>direct Demonstrations;</hi> for if
they are not such strenuous Proofs as are impossible to
be refuted, I'm sure the Atheist ought to pass for the
most senseless and stupid of all Mankind. He slights
and despises that inestimable Offer of being Happy for
ever; he runs the risque of being eternally Miserable;
he bids open defiance to the Laws of God and Man;
and he opposes his own Opinion and Judgment, to
the sober and considerate Sentiments of the judicious
part of Mankind, in all Ages of the World. Now
surely, in such a case, he ought to be very sure that
he cannot be mistaken; and to be as demonstratively
certain, as of the truth of any <hi>Theorem</hi> in <hi>Euclid,</hi>
that there is no God, no Moral Good nor Evil, no
Revealed Religion, nor any Future State of Rewards
and Punishments. But can any Man have the face to
pretend to this? Will not the common sense of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
pronounce this impossible? and that a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the <hi>Non-Existence</hi> of these things, is not to
be obtained? Can any one be directly assured, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59824:5"/>
there is not so much as a <hi>Possibility</hi> that these things
should be true? And if so, then 'tis plain, that for
any thing he can directly prove to the contrary, the
Atheist may be in the wrong, and consequently be
Eternally damned and miserable. Now would any
one, that can think at all, run this Dreadful Hazard <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
much less sure, one that pretends to be a Man of
<hi>Penetration</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and to Philosophize above
the Vulgar: And yet this every Atheist doth; and
that too on no other Grounds but the Strength of
some trifling Objections against, and seeming Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
in, the Notion of a God, and Religion, which
the Extravagant Wit of wicked Men hath invented
and coined to stop the Mouths of those that reprove
them, to stifle and bear down the Stings of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and to gain some pretence to Reason and
Principles in their Impious Proceedings. But surely
these Persons must know well enough, that 'tis a
very easie thing to start Objections against the most
plain and obvious Truths; They know also, that in
other Cases, themselves think it very unreasonable to
disbelieve the truth of a Thing, <hi>only</hi> because they
can't readily answer all the Objections a witty Man
may bring against it, and because they cannot solve
all the <hi>Phoenomena</hi> of it. Now, why should not
they proceed so in Matters of Religion? They
know that all the great Truths of it, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsrated
over and over, by those Learned and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Persons which have written in the Defence of
it; Nay, they know too, that most of their Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
have been already refuted and answered, and
that they adhere to a Cause that hath been frequently
baffled. They know the weight and importance of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59824:6"/>
the Subject, and that if Religion should at last prove
to be true, they must be for ever Miserable: All this,
I say, they very well know; and therefore it looks
strangely like an Infatuation upon them, that they
will run this Dreadful Hazard only on the Strength
of a few <hi>Objections,</hi> and a bare surmise only that
there is no such thing as a God or Religion. These
<hi>Objections</hi> are their only Hold and Pretence that
they can stick to and abide by, and <hi>what</hi> and how
Great they are, I shall now proceed to Examine.
These I shall take in their Natural Order: And,</p>
            <p>1. Consider such Objections as are brought against
the Being of a God in General.</p>
            <p>2. Such as are alledged against his Attributes and
Perfections.</p>
            <p>3. Such as are advanced against the Truth and
Authority of revealed Religion. The Groundless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Inconclusiveness of all which I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as clearly as I can to Demonstrate.</p>
            <p>And First, I shall consider and refute the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and Arguments that are brought against the
Being of God in General; and these are (as far as
I can find) all reducible to these two Heads. It
is said,</p>
            <p>1. That we can have no Idea of God.</p>
            <p>2. That the Notion of a Deity owes its Original,
either to the foolish Fears of some Men, or the Crafty
Designs of others.</p>
            <p>I shall at this Time handle the <hi>former</hi> of these,
and Refute the Objections that are brought against
the Existence of a Deity, from our not being able
(as they say) to have any <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Notion</hi> of him.
The Atheist alledges, That whatsoever is Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59824:6"/>
is really nothing at all: that we can have
no Idea, or possible Notion of any thing that is not
some how or other an Object of our Senses; for
<hi>all Knowledge is Sense:</hi> and we can only judge of the
Existence of things by its Evidence and Testimony.
Now God is by Divines said to be <hi>Incomprehensible,
Infinite,</hi> and <hi>Invisible; i. e.</hi> Something that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to know any thing about; that is every
where,<note place="margin">Leviathan, <hi>p.</hi> 208.</note> and yet no where; that sees every thing,
and yet no body can see him; nor can we perceive
any thing of him by any other of our Senses: We
cannot tell what to make of such an Account as this
of a God; we can have no Phantasm, Idea or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of any such Thing; and therefore we justly
conclude, There is no such Being in Nature. And as
for that precarious Notion of a God, that is so much
talk'd of in the World, 'tis nothing but a meer <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome</hi>
or <hi>Mormo</hi> devised and set up by Politick
and Designing Men to keep the Rabble in awe, and
to scare such Fools as are afraid of their own Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.
The several Points of this Objection, I shall
singly consider; and,</p>
            <p>As to the First Part of it, That what we cannot
attain any <hi>Idea</hi> of; or, That what is <hi>absolutely Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable,</hi>
is really <hi>nothing</hi> at all; perhaps it may be
true, taking it in the most strict and proper sence
of the words; for though I am not of <hi>Protagoras</hi>'s
Mind, that Man is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> yet as
I think, that That which is <hi>absolutely Unconceivable
in its own Nature,</hi> is not possible to be Existent; so
<hi>what is absolutely so to us,</hi> we can know nothing at
all of, nor reason, nor argue about it; since there is
no doing of this but from our Ideas. But I cannot
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59824:7"/>
see how this will be advantageous at all to the Cause
of Infidelity: For there is neither any one that asserts;
nor is the Atheist able to prove, that That Being
which we call God, is <hi>absolutely Unconceiveable.</hi>
There is a vast difference between a thing's being <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable,</hi>
and <hi>Incomprehensible;</hi> between our having
<hi>no Idea at all</hi> of a thing, and our having an <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
one; and between our knowing <hi>Nothing at all</hi> of
a Being, and our comprehending all the <hi>Possible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi>
and Excellencies of such a Being. We readily
grant that the Immense Nature of God is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible
to our finite Understandings; but we don't
say 'tis absolutely <hi>Unconceivable,</hi> and that we can
know nothing at all about it. The common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<note n="c" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sextus Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericus</hi> allows, that there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Idea of a God, even when he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es against him. <hi>Adv. Math.</hi> p. 333.</note> which all Mankind have of a God, is a
sufficient Refutation of this Part of the Objection,
as it is also a very good Proof of the real Existence
of a Deity; for if there were no such Being, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to conceive how any Idea of him could ever
have come into any one's Mind, as I shall hereafter
more largely prove.</p>
            <p>2. There is implied in this Objection, That we can
have no <hi>possible Idea, nor Notion of the Existence of
any thing that is not the Object of our Senses:</hi> And
from hence these Sublime Thinkers argue against the
Existence of a Deity, and conclude there is no God,
because they cannot <hi>see</hi> him, and because he is not
perceivable by any of our Bodily Senses. Thus one
of our Modern Atheistical Writers asserts, <hi>That the
only Evidence we can have of the Existence of any thing,
is from Sense.</hi> And in another place,<note n="a" place="margin">Hob<hi>'s</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viath. <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> 
               <hi>Whatsoever
we can conceive</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath been perceived first by
Sense, either at once or in Parts, and a Man can have
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59824:7"/>
no Thought representing any thing not subject to Sense.</hi> And
he defines <hi>Sense to be Original Knowledge.</hi> Which is but
the Reverse of what <hi>Protagoras,</hi> long ago determin'd:
for <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Theaetetus,</hi> tells us, That he defined all
<hi>Knowledge</hi> to be <hi>Sense.</hi> Now, is not this admirable
Philosophy? and worthy of those that pretend to a
sublimer pitch of Knowledge than the Vulgar? There
is no <hi>Knowledge,</hi> say they, but <hi>Sense.</hi> If so, then, as
<hi>Protagoras</hi> saith, <hi>all Sense must be Knowledge;</hi> and
consequently, he that sees, hears, smells or feels
any thing, must immediately know all that is to
be known about it: By seeing the Letters of any
Language, or hearing the Words pronounced, a Man
or a Beast must needs understand all the Sense
and Meaning of it; and the Philosophick Nature
of all Bodies will be perfectly comprehended, as soon as
ever they once come within the reach of our Senses.
This is, indeed, a good easie method of attaining
Learning; and perhaps very suitable to the Genius
of these Gentlemen! But I cannot account from this
Notion, how <hi>they</hi> come to have so much more Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration
and Knowledge than their Neighbours. Are
their Eyes and Ears, Noses and Feeling, so much
more accurate than those of the Vulgar? Yes, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
these are truly <hi>Men of Sense!</hi> their Lyncean Eyes
can penetrate Mill-stones, and the least silent whisper
of Nature moves the Intelligent Drum of their tender
Ears; nothing escapes their Knowledge, but what is
undiscoverable by the nicest Sense, and can only be
<hi>comprehended by Reason. Reason!</hi> an <hi>Ignis Fatuus
of the Mind,</hi> whose uncertain Direction they scorn to
follow, while this <hi>Light of Nature, Sense,</hi> can be
their Guide. Nor will it avail them to alledge here,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59824:8"/>
that when they say, we have no Knowledge but what
we have from our Senses; they mean only, that all
our Knowledge comes in that way, and not by <hi>Innate
Idea's:</hi> for the Author I have mentioned above, is
express, that <hi>we can have no thought of any thing not
subject to Sense;</hi> that <hi>the only Knowledge we have of the
Existence of all things, is from Sense;</hi> and that <hi>Sense is
Original Knowledge,</hi> And if so, there can be no such
thing as comparing or distinguishing of <hi>Idea's</hi> in our
Mind; but the simple <hi>Idea's</hi> of Sensible Objects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impressed upon our Brain, must needs convey to
us, by that means, all the Knowledge that we can
ever obtain about them, and that as soon too as ever
the Objects are perceived. But than this, nothing
can be more false and absurd: for 'tis plain, that by
our bare Sensations of Objects, we know nothing at
all of their Natures. Our Mind, indeed, by these
Sensations, is vigorously excited to enquire further
about them: but this we could by no means do, if
<hi>Sense</hi> were the <hi>highest Faculty</hi> and Power in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and we were quite devoid of a <hi>Reasoning and
Thinking Mind.</hi> This, <hi>Democritus</hi> of old was very
well aware of, (however he comes now to be deserted
by the Modern Atheistick Writers,) for saith he,<note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>There is in us two kinds of Knowledges; one Dark and
Obscure, which is by the Senses; the other Genuine and
Proper, which is by the Mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nothing can be more plain, than that we have
certain Knowledge of the Existence of many things,
which never were, nor perhaps can possibly be the
Objects of our Bodily Senses. <hi>Protagoras</hi> himself saith,
<note n="b" place="margin">Sext. Emp.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59824:8"/>
               <hi>Take heed that none of the Uninitiated
hear you, who are such as think nothing to Exist, but
what they can lay hold of with their Hands; and who
will not allow any thing that is Invisible, to have a place
among Beings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Epicurean Atheist must needs grant the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of his <hi>Atoms,</hi> and his <hi>Empty Space;</hi> when yet
they must be <hi>both</hi> acknowledged to be no way sensible.
Those that hold a Soul or Life in Matter, Plastically
diffused through all Parts of the Universe, by which
all things are actuated and regulated, cannot deny
but this Power is Invisible, and no way the Object
of Bodily Sense. Nay, those that assert a Corporeal
Deity, and say, that nothing can possibly exist but
Body; must needs own, that something of this Deity,
as his <hi>Wisdom, Power</hi> and <hi>Understanding,</hi> which is
certainly the Chief and most Noble of all his Essence,
can no ways fall under our Bodily Senses. Let him
that asserts, That what is not the Object of Sense, is
really nothing at all; let him tell me, if he ever saw
that <hi>Power, Faculty, Understanding</hi> or <hi>Mind,</hi> by which
he is enabled to make such a Determination? That
there is such a Power or Mind in him, 'tis impossible
for him to doubt or deny: for that very <hi>doubting</hi>
and <hi>denying,</hi> will <hi>refute</hi> him; and must convince him,
that there must be something in him of a <hi>Real Nature,</hi>
that can thus Think and Consider, Doubt and Deny;
and at last conclude, That there is <hi>nothing Actually
Existent, but what is Sensible;</hi> For what is <hi>really</hi> and
<hi>absolutely</hi> Nothing, can never Think, Consider, Doubt
or Determine.</p>
            <p>Now let him call this Mind or Soul of his what
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59824:9"/>
he pleases, I do not here consider its Nature;
let it be a Substance distinct from Matter, be it
a happy Combination of Animal Spirits; or the brisk
Agitation of any fine and subtile Parts of Matter,
'tis all one to our present purpose, it certainly <hi>Exists,</hi>
or <hi>is;</hi> and yet is it by no means an Object of Sense.
For Animal Spirits, Motion, and the finest and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilest
Parts of Matter are no more sensible to us <hi>now,</hi>
than an Incorporeal Substance is. And as he is thus
assured that there is something real in himself, which
yet is the Object of none of his Senses; so he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conclude the same of other Men that are
round about him, that they also have a Soul or Mind
of the same Nature: for he must know and be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that <hi>they</hi> can <hi>think, reason, doubt, affirm, deny</hi>
and <hi>determine,</hi> as well as himself. Now, if he must
grant that there are on this Account many things
existent in the World, which do no way fall under
the cognisance of our Senses, it will be strangely sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and ridiculous to argue against the Being of a
God from <hi>His</hi> not being so; and to deny that there is
<hi>any such thing,</hi> because he cannot see <hi>Him</hi> with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
Eyes, because he cannot feel <hi>Him</hi> with his Hands,
and hear the Sound of his Voice actually speaking
from Heaven. For the Existence of that Divine Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>whom no Eye hath seen nor can see,</hi> is as plainly
demonstrable from Reason and Nature, from his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Works in the World, and from the inward Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of our unprejudiced Minds, as the Being of
our <hi>Own</hi> and <hi>Others Minds</hi> is from the power of
thinking and reasoning that we find in our selves
and them.</p>

               <hi>That we

(That is, say they) something which we can know

and do only discover their Astonishment and Rusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
This Bold Writer doth in another place tell
us,<note n="e" place="margin">Pag. 150.</note> That <hi>God must not be said to be Finite;</hi> and
so being neither <hi>Finite</hi> nor <hi>Infinite,</hi> he must be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all: Which is the very same <hi>Dilemma</hi> that

a Deity. Another Modern Author of the same

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59824:10"/>
doth but, <hi>Rei quam non capit attribuere nomen quod

               <q>Give an unintelligible Name to a

agrees exactly with what <hi>Sextus</hi> also saith, in many
places of his Book; and whom these Gentlemen fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
pretty closely in most things, without taking
any notice at all of him.</p>
            <p>Now to this, I return; That as 'tis very foolish
and precarious, to deny the Existence of a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
He is not an Object of our Bodily Senses; so,
to conclude, that there is no such Being, from our
not being able perfectly to comprehend Him, and to
have a true and adequate Idea of him, is equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and unaccountable. For at this rate, we may
soon come to deny the Existence of most things in
Nature, since there are very many of which we do
not adequately comprehend the Nature of, and know
all that is to be known about them. There is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>something Incomprehensible</hi> in the Nature
of all things. Are there not a thousand Beings,
which we are sure are truly and actually existent in
Nature, the manner of whose Operation and Action we
cannot comprehend, and whose <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
Philosophically explain? Let any of these Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating
Gentlemen try their Skill at <hi>Gravity, Light,
Sound, Magnetism</hi> and <hi>Electricity,</hi> and oblige the
World with such an adequate Account of <hi>any one</hi> of
them, as shall make all impartial and curious Men
acquiesce in it as satisfactory. Let him clearly shew
us how his own <hi>Sensations</hi> are made; how the <hi>Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Blood first begins,</hi> and <hi>continues its Vital
Tour</hi> round his Body; how <hi>Pestilential</hi> and <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
Diseases <hi>first invade</hi> and are <hi>propagated;</hi> how
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59824:10"/>
several Medicines, that may be properly enough
call'd <hi>Specifick's,</hi> operate; and particularly, how the
<hi>Cortex Peruvianus</hi> cures an Intermitting Fever: In a
word, let him tell us how his <hi>own Body</hi> (setting aside
Accidents) decays, <hi>grows old,</hi> and <hi>dies,</hi> when the
same <hi>Digestions</hi> and <hi>Assimulations</hi> are made to Day, as
were Yesterday, and there is no apparent defect in
the Nutriment of any one part of it. He that can
account for these, and many other such like things,
which are obvious to every one's daily Observation,
will certainly approve himself to be a Man of very
curious and acute Thought, and of very deep Insight
into Nature: and when he hath fully convinced me,
that he throughly <hi>comprehends</hi> the Nature of but these
few things, I will allow that he hath some ground to
disbelieve the Existence of whatever appears to him
Incomprehensible. But if a Person will candidly own,
as he that hath any <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> must do,
That there are many things in the History of Nature,
of which he cannot meet with a satisfactory Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Explication; he hath certainly no manner
of reason to disbelieve the Existence of a God, on
the same account; and to say, There is no such
Thing, because his Nature is Incomprehensible to
our finite and imperfect Capacities. <hi>We cannot, by
searching, find out God, nor discover the Almighty unto
perfection,</hi> Job xi. 7.</p>
            <p>But again; There is a vast difference between <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending</hi>
and <hi>Comprehending</hi> of a thing; between
knowing a thing really to be, and knowing all that
is possible to be known about that thing. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
indeed perfectly comprehend the Nature of God,
because we have shallow, limited, finite, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59824:11"/>
Capacities and Faculties; and the Deity contains
in himself all possible Perfection. Every one must
grant, that 'tis impossible the <hi>lesser</hi> should contain
and comprehend the <hi>greater,</hi> especially too when the
Extent and Fulness of one, Infinitely exceeds the
Capacity of the other. From hence therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
that we can have no <hi>Idea</hi> nor <hi>Knowledge at all</hi>
of God, is very absurd and incongruous. 'Tis a
strange Method of Arguing, that I can know nothing
at all of a thing, because I can't know every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
that belongs to it; and he would deservedly be
esteemed a Madman, that should deny that there is
any such thing as the Sun, because he cannot tell
how many Miles he is in Diameter, how far he is
from us, and which way he comes by a supply of
Matter to continue his enlivening Fire and Heat.
When some great and advantageous Revolution is
brought about in any Nation; when the Publick
Good is secured, the Laws and Liberties preserved,
and Confusion, Bloodshed, and Misery of all Kinds,
prevented, by the wise and deep Council and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Him, or Those that are at the Helm of Affairs:
Would it not be gross Stupidity, for a Man to assert,
That all this came about by Chance, and that there
was no Wisdom nor Conduct, that so opportunely
managed all things; only because he cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into all the secret Steps and Methods of it, and
see all the hidden Springs, by which it was moved
regularly on to its intended Perfection? There are
many things whose Existence 'twould be ridiculous to
doubt of, whose Nature and Qualities we are very far
from being able perfectly to Comprehend and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.
And amongst the rest, there is nothing but
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59824:11"/>
our own Existence, that we can be more assured of,
than that there is a God. For as to all Objects of
Sense, we may, as Monsieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> shews, have
some reason to doubt of their actual Existence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
us, till we are first satisfied that our Senses do
not deceive us: Till we know this, for any thing we
can demonstratively prove to the contrary, all sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objects may be meer Phantasms and Delusions, and
nothing but the internal Configurations of our own
Brains, and the result of Imagination and Fancy. But
when once we are assured that there is a God, who
is perfectly Knowing, Wise, and Good, we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that He can be no Deceiver; we shall find that
'tis not suitable to the Idea we have of Him, that He
should delude and cheat us with false Appearances;
and consequently we may well conclude, that he hath
appointed our Senses to be proper Judges of their
own Objects, and that those Things are actually
existing without us, whose Idea's we so plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in our selves, and which we truly judge to be so.</p>
            <p>And if we will impartially consult our own
Thoughts, and reason clearly from those Idea's that
we have within us; I think, we may most demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
be assured of the Existence of a God, and
that He is such a most Perfect or Infinite Being, as
the Sacred Scriptures and Divines describe Him to
be. I will allow that the greatest Certainty that
we can have of the Existence of any thing, is of
our own Being; of which, as I have already said,
no one can possibly doubt: for whatsoever can <hi>Think
reason, doubt, will,</hi> and <hi>determine,</hi> must needs be
<hi>Something,</hi> and have a <hi>true and real Being.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we find by this means, that there is certainly
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59824:12"/>
               <hi>something actually existing;</hi> it will plainly follow, that
something or other must always have been <hi>so:</hi>
for if ever there was a time when there was <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
there never could have been any thing at
all: for absolute <hi>Nothing</hi> could never have <hi>done,</hi> or
<hi>produced any thing.</hi> Something therefore ('tis plain)
must have been always, or eternally existing, and
which never could have had any beginning. For if
it ever had any beginning, tho' never so many
Thousands of Millions of Ages ago, it must have
then began from meer Nothing, which 'tis impossible
for any Man to conceive. Now, if we consider our
selves, or any things else that are round about us in
the world; we shall plainly find, that neither we nor
<hi>they,</hi> can be this thing that always was existent, and
which we have discovered must have been without
beginning; for we know well enough, that it was
but a little while ago when we began to be, and
that 'tis but a short space before we shall die, and
cease to be in this World any more. Besides, we
find in our selves, and discover in things without us,
such Defects, Limitations and Imperfections, as suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
must convince us, that neither we nor they
can be Independent Beings, nor indeed the Cause of
one another's Existence. We must therefore in our
Thoughts have recourse to some <hi>first Cause</hi> or <hi>Origin,</hi>
from whence all things do proceed: And that there
must be some <hi>first Cause,</hi> or some <hi>Being,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
both our selves and the things that are round
about us in the World, we cannot but be assured of,
for we know, nothing can cause, or make it self to
be; and we see that we cannot make or produce each
other; and we perceive that none of our Forms or
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59824:12"/>
Modes of Existence are Indestructible and Eternal;
but that all things are continually flitting and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
some improving and increasing, while others
are decreasing and dying. The <hi>common Matter,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
of all Bodies will remain, and we do not find
it to be perishable, as their forms are; But then,
<hi>this</hi> we may easily know cannot be the first Cause of
all other Things; since we have no Idea of its being
an <hi>Active, Intelligent, Wise,</hi> and <hi>Powerful Being,</hi> as
that must be; but the Notion we have of it is, that
it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>purely Passive, and obsequiously
Capable of all variety of Forms and Motions;</hi> as I shall
hereafter more largely shew. If we farther carefully
consider of this Being, that we have thus found must
have eternally been or existed; we shall find also,
that it must for ever continue <hi>to be for the time to
come;</hi> for we cannot imagine, how a Being that
hath Eternally existed for the time past, should ever
terminate or cease to be for the time to come; since
there is nothing in its <hi>self,</hi> or in any thing <hi>without it,</hi>
that can possibly be the Cause of its Destruction.
Such a Being therefore will be properly Eternal, and
necessarily Self-existent, without Beginning or End,
or any Possibility of Dying or Ceasing to be. Such
a Being also, must on this Account, be the <hi>Creator,
Author,</hi> and <hi>Cause</hi> of all things: because, nothing
can be the Cause of it self; and therefore they must
either be Eternal and Necessarily Self existent, as we
are assured they are not; or else derived from, and
produced by this Eternal and Infinite Being. And as
the Beings themselves are derived from, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by this Eternal and Self existent Being, so
must all their <hi>Perfections</hi> and <hi>Qualifications</hi> too: for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59824:13"/>
they are indeed the most Noble Things in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<hi>Knowledge</hi> therefore, and <hi>Wisdom, Thought</hi>
and <hi>Reasoning,</hi> and all the excellent Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
that are found in any Creatures, must come
from the same Power that produced those Beings
and Natures in which they are inherent. And if
these Excellencies and Perfections are derived from
this Necessarily existent Being, they must certainly
be in Him in the greatest Perfection: for if they
were not in Him, they could not be derived from
him; since 'tis unconceivable that any thing can
give or communicate to another, either what it
hath not it self, or a greater degree of any thing
than it is Master of. This Eternal and Self-existent
Being therefore must have in it, and that in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Perfection, all the Excellencies that we admire
and value in any other things. It must have the
Power of doing all things that are possible to be
done, and therefore be <hi>Almighty;</hi> it must <hi>know</hi> all
things that are possible to be known, and therefore
be <hi>Omniscient:</hi> In a word, it must be <hi>All-Wise</hi> and
<hi>Good, Just</hi> and <hi>True, Merciful</hi> and <hi>Gracious,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
in it all possible Excellencies and Perfections.
Now this may very well pass for a Description of
the Deity; and 'tis such an One as is very Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
and Plain to the meanest Capacity that can but
think at all. And it gives us such an Idea of God,
as we see is easily attainable by an obvious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Chain of Consequences, and which puts our
Minds not at all on the wrack to conceive. As for the
word <hi>Infinite,</hi> which is often applied to God, and
which these Gentlemen quarrel so much at, and of
which they affirm, that it is <hi>impossible to have any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59824:13"/>
Conception or Idea;</hi> I say, that it is groundlessly and
precariously asserted: and that nothing but the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Darkness and Confusion which they have brought
upon their own Minds can make it appear Unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible,
For as the Excellent Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> hath
proved the <hi>Idea</hi> that we have of <hi>Infinite,</hi> is the
same with that which we have of <hi>Perfection.</hi> And
therefore when we say, that God is Infinite in Power,
Wisdom or Goodness, we mean by it, that He is most
perfectly or compleatly so; and that he wants no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which is necessary to render Him most Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and Excellent in that Respect of which we
speak of Him. Now a Being that any way is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
or Imperfect, and that hath not all the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Excellencies that are to be had, is Finite, and
that in the same proportion as it is defective. Thus,
for Instance, those Beings which endure but for a
time, which had a Beginning, and will have an
end, are finite or imperfect, as to their existence:
But GOD, who <hi>is, was,</hi> and <hi>is to come,</hi> who is and
will be from <hi>Everlasting</hi> to <hi>Everlasting,</hi>
He is properly said to be <hi>Infinite</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Sext. Empir. <hi>adv.</hi> Math, <hi>pag.</hi> 150.</note> or <hi>Perfect,</hi> as to Existence or Duration.
For there is no Restriction, Limitation
or Imperfection in His Nature, in this
respect, as there is in that of all Creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
A Being whose Power extends to but a few
things, is very imperfect or finite in Power; and if
there be any Possible thing that it cannot do, 'tis still
so far imperfect in Power. But a Being that can do
all things that are not contradictory to his Nature,
or all possible things, is properly said to be <hi>Infinite</hi> or
<hi>Perfect</hi> in Power, or <hi>Almighty;</hi> so a Being that knows
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59824:14"/>
all things possible to be known, is Infinite or Perfect
in Knowledge: and the like of any other Attributes
or Perfections: In all, the Comparison or Proportion
is the same. A Being that wants no degree of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
or Perfection is God; <hi>Infinite in Power,
Wisdom, Justice, Goodness</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi> But if a Being
want any one, or any degree or proportion of These
Things, it is Finite and Imperfect, and that in the
same degree or Proportion. Now, where is the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivableness,
Confusion, Absurdity,</hi> and <hi>Nonsence</hi> of
all This? is it not as easie to conceive or apprehend
that a Being may have in his Nature all possible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
as it is to have an Idea of one that is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
and Deficient? for how come the Idea of
Imperfection into our Mind? how come we to know
that a Thing is Finite, Defective and Limited, unless
we have also an Idea or Notion of Infinity or Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?
how can we know what is wanting in any
Being, unless we have an Idea of it, that it is in
some other Being? Most certain therefore it is, that
we may have as true and clear an Idea of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of a God, as of any thing in Nature:<note n="b" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Mr.</hi> Lock's Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say of Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. <hi>P. IV. Ch. X,</hi>
               </note>
and in Fact it is most notoriously true, that a clear
and distinct Notion that there is such a Being, hath
and doth still appear in the Minds of all Mankind;
and it is impressed there, I doubt not, by the <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Care</hi> of that Divine and Merciful Being Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>And therefore those that assert, that we have not,
nor can have any Notion or Idea of a God, nor of
his Attributes and Perfections, and that on <hi>that</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
deny his Existence; discover such wretched
Ignorance as well as Obstinacy, that they are really a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59824:14"/>
Disgrace to Human Nature. For pretending to be
<hi>over-Wise,</hi> they <hi>become Fools,</hi> they <hi>are vain in their
Imaginations,</hi> and <hi>their foolish heart is darkened;</hi> Their
vicious Inclinations have debauched their Reason and
Understanding: And <hi>though God be not far from every
one of us,</hi> since <hi>in Him we live, move, and have our
being;</hi> yet their Wickedness and Pride is such, That
<hi>they will not seek after God, neither is God in all their
Thoughts.</hi> From which wilful Blindness and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
may the God of Truth deliver them, by the
gracious Illuminations of his Blessed Spirit; To whom,
