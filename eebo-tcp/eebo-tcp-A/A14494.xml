         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thinking seriously with my selfe, who might most iustly challenge the dedication of this labour at my hands, which I trust shall euer bring some light and comfort to our Grammar Schooles, I could finde none to haue thereunto a better title then your self. Sith God hath indeed made you a worthy light, for the sound loue and true aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vertue and good learning, and that euen from your tender yeares. In as much as you (contrary to the course of the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:4914:3"/>
part of the flower of the Nobilitie and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of our age) haue addicted your selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your studies, for the good (I trust) both of the Church and Commonwealth, in stead of following the excessiue pleasures of the time; and haue moreouer in a singular maner ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested your affection towards them both, and towards all good learning to that end. Whenas out of that maintenance, which in regard of your high birth and noble line might seeme farre too little for your selfe; you haue yet separated and consecrated, as your first fruites, a portion thereof vnto the Lord, towards the maintaining of sundry poore schollers in the Vniuersitie, by whom his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie may be aduanced, and the good of his people perpetually procured. Concerning which, let me craue pardon of you (good Sir) and beare the blame, that (though contrary to your minde) I yet still desire, as I ought, that memorable loue of yours to be knowne, for the good ensample and prouoking of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others to the like: wherein one day they should finde a thousand times more comfort, doing it with vpright hearts, then in all that
<pb facs="tcp:4914:3"/>
they shall bestow, not onely in the ouerhote pursuite of their vaine pleasures and delights, but euen in sundry other kindes, which make the fairest shew. As my selfe am euer bound in all places to acknowledge those great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, which I iustly owe vnto your selfe and that right noble house for my selfe and mine, so I hope our God will enable vs to seek euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to be answerable thereunto, as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty shall vouchsafe vs fit opportunities. What is wanting in vs, his goodnesse (I trust) will fully recompence, that you may be euer ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, walking with him in this world, and liuing with him in blessednesse for euer in the heauens. And in this earnest desire, with my heartie prayers incessantly for you, that God may make you to increase daily in all true ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I commend you to his heauenly grace, resting</p>

            <head>A plaine Direction to the painfull Schoolemaister and others, for the most <hi>profitable vse of this and the like Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall</hi> translations.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the end that all Schollers may find the seuerall benefites of these translations mentioned in my Grammar-schoole, not onely for sound vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, true construing, parsing, getting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out booke, making and prouing the same Latin, speedy turning either into prose or verse, but also for growth in our English tongue together with the Latin; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for causing Schollers to study of themselues, and to prepare their lectures at home, to bring them more perfectly, and keep them more surely; and all this with very much certaintie, pleasure and ease both to maister and scholler, I finde this course most readie.</p>
            <p>1. Cause euery one to be well acquainted with their Grammar rules, and especially to be perfect in the rule of construing, that they may euer follow that direction.</p>
            <p>2. Because the greatest part in euery Forme are commonly of the duller sort of wits and more negligent, and also hardlier drawne to take paines at home, vnlesse they euidently see the way how they may do it with some delight; cause some pregnant scholler of their owne Forme, or of some higher, to reade them their lecture ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, onely construing it ouer once or twice, and shewing them the hard words and phrases briefly.</p>
            <p>3. Direct them either to trie first how they are able to construe of themselues, and finde out a reason of euery thing, why it must be so construed; and after to compare and trie that which they haue done, by the translation. On else if they haue not sufficient leisure, and that they would do it speedily, or be not so well able to do it of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, direct them to reade ouer the translation once or twice; first, that they may fully vnderstand the matter whereby all the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be made most easie, and then aduise them to examine care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by themselues the reason of the whole construction. And so for parsing euery thing in the same order as they construe: for these two
<pb facs="tcp:4914:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so depend one vpon another, that they cannot be separated. In a word, cause them so to studie their lectures out of the Latine books and the translation together, that they may be able with their book vnder their arme, to deliuer and pronounce the whole lecture either Latine or English alone, so also to construe and parse without booke to deliuer their lectures either in the plaine Grammar order, or more elegantly, and so to giue varietie of phrase, and whatsoeuer is obserued in the translation.</p>
            <p>4. Be carefull that they take not ouermuch at a time, and then so many of them as are apt and painful, wil the next day at any time, within an houres space giuen them to meditate, be able to deliuer their lecture (so as I said) viz. pronouncing it without booke both in Latine and English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> construe and parse without booke, giue va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of English phrase, and whatsoeuer can be required for the vnderstanding and knowledge of euery word. Hereby also they will be able to keepe all that they haue learned, not onely to repeate each weekes worke most perfectly vpon the friday, but also their whole quarters worke at each quarters end, if they vse to repeate it now and then, and so to keepe their authors for euery vse, far more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly then by any other meanes.</p>
            <p>For these Eclogues and the booke <hi>de Apibus,</hi> I haue made choise of them to translate thus, as being the most familiar of all <hi>Virgils</hi> workes, and fittest for childrens capacities: and in some of them I haue made a plaine Analysis or resolution, for the more easie and full vnderstanding thereof, as namely of the first and last Eclogues, and so of that excellent booke of the gouernment and ordering of Bees, which is able to draw the very wisest into an admiration, for their policie, and the rare workes of God apparent in them. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the rest I haue omitted, as being for the most part but heardmens talke, or the matter not so fit, and so the translation of the latter part of the sixi Eclogue. In the first Eclogue I haue giuen a litle taste of the Rhetoricke in Tropes and figures: for the rest I referre to <hi>M. Butlers</hi> Rhetoricke, <hi>M.

            <p>I haue onely proceeded thus farre in translating, being fully assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon certaine experience, that children first entred well in Grammar, and hauing gone through but those parts of the authors which I haue thus translated, will be able by Gods blessing (if they proceed in a right order) to take their lectures of themselues, at least with very litle assistance, in all the rest of <hi>Virgil</hi> and the higher Latin authors; by the meanes of the worthy Commentaries and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpes, which the Lord hath in this last age prouided aboue all former times.</p>

Trie aright, and then giue your sentence. The comforts which my selfe haue found herein, without any of the furnised inconueniences, and the same approued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by many learned, do make me confident to desire to commend them to all.
