            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Iriſh,</hi> when the Maſſacre began, perſwaded many of their <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Neighbours to bring their Goods to them, and they would ſecure them and hereby they got abundance peaceably into their hands, whereof they cheated the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> refuſing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Having thus ſeized upon their goods and cattle, ranſackt their houſes, got their perſons, ſtript Man, Woman, and Child naked, and ſo turned them out of doors, ſtrictly prohibiting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> under great penalities, not to give them any relief; by means hereof many miſerably periſht through cold, nakedneſs, and hunger.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Coleraine,</hi> many of theſe poor people that fled thither for ſuccour, many thouſands died in two dayes, ſo that the living could not bury the dead, but laid their Carcaſſes in ranks in waſte and wide holes, piling them up as if they had been Herrings.</p>

            <p>At <hi>Liſſenskeath,</hi> they Hanged and Killed above One hundred of the <hi>Scottiſh Proteſtants.</hi> In the Counties of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Tyrone,</hi> where the <hi>Froteſtants</hi> were more numerous, their Murthers were more multiplied, and with greater cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mac Guire</hi> coming to the Caſtle of <hi>Laſſenskeath,</hi> deſired to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Middleton,</hi> who admitted him in, he firſt burnt the Records of the County, then demanded One thouſand pounds which was in his cuſtody of Sir <hi>Williane Balfores,</hi> which as ſoon as he had, he cauſed Mr. <hi>Middleton</hi> to hear Maſs, and to ſwear that he would never alter from it, and then Hanged him up with his Wife and Children: Hanging and Murdering above One hundred Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in that place.</p>

            <p>In one place an hundred and forty <hi>Engliſh</hi> were taken and driven like Cattle for many miles together. Other companies they carried out to a place fit for execution, and then murthered them. One hundred and fifteen Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Children, they ſent with Sir <hi>Philem Oneal</hi>'s Paſs till they came to <hi>Portendown Bridge,</hi> and there drowned them.</p>

            <p>Some aged <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women</hi> theſe barbarous <hi>Papiſts</hi> inforced their own <hi>Children</hi> to drown them; yea, ſome <hi>Children</hi> were compelled unnaturally to execute their own <hi>Parents, Wives</hi> forced to hang their own <hi>Husbands,</hi> and <hi>Mothers</hi> to caſt their own <hi>Children</hi> into the <hi>Waters,</hi> after which themſelves were <hi>murthered.</hi> In <hi>Sligo</hi> they forced a <hi>young Man</hi> to kill his <hi>Father,</hi> and then hanged him up. In another place they forced a <hi>Woman</hi> to kill her <hi>Husband,</hi> then cauſed her <hi>Son</hi> to kill her, and then hanged the <hi>Son:</hi> yea, ſuch was their malice againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that they taught their <hi>Children</hi> to kill <hi>Engliſh Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh Trulls</hi> that followed the Camp, cried out. <hi>Kill them all, ſpare neither Man, Woman, nor Child.</hi> They took the Child of <hi>Thomas Stratton,</hi> being about twelve years old, and boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in a Caldron. One good wife <hi>Lin</hi> and her Daughter they carried into a Wood, firſt hanged the <hi>Mother,</hi> and then the <hi>Daughter</hi> in the hair of her <hi>Mothers</hi> head.</p>
            <p>In ſome places they plucked out the eyes and cut off the hands of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and turned them into the Fields, where they periſhed. The <hi>Women</hi> in ſome places ſtoned the <hi>Engliſh Women and Children</hi> to death. One man they ſhot through his thighs, digged a hole in the ground, ſet him in upon his feet, fill'd up the hole, left out only his head, where he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64254:3"/>
languiſhed to death. Another man they held his feet in the Fire till he was burnt to death.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Munſter</hi> they hanged up many <hi>Miniſters</hi> in a moſt barbarous manner. One <hi>Miniſter</hi> they ſtripped naked, <hi>and drove him through the Town; pricking him with Darts and Rapiers, till he fell down dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe barbarous Villains vowed, <hi>That if any Parents digged Graves to bury their Children in, they ſhould be buried therein themſelves.</hi> They ſtripped one <hi>William Loverden</hi> naked, then killed him before his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children.</hi> Divers <hi>Miniſters bones</hi> that had been buried ſome years before, they digged up, becauſe they were, as they ſay, <hi>Patrons of Hereſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Children that went out into the fields to eat weeds and graſs, they killed without all pity.</p>
            <p>A poor <hi>Woman</hi> whoſe <hi>Husband</hi> was taken by them, went to them with two <hi>Children</hi> at her feet, and one at her breaſt; hoping to beg her <hi>Husband:</hi> but they ſlew her and her ſucking <hi>Child,</hi> brake the neck of another, and the third hardly eſcaped: and all this wickedneſs they exerciſed upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> without any provocation given them. Alas who can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the fears, terrors, anguiſh, bitterneſs, and perplexity that ſeized upon the poor <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> finding themſelves ſo ſuddenly ſurprized without remedy; and wrapt up in all kind of outward miſeries which could poſſibly by man be inflicted upon humane Creatures? What ſighs and groans, trembling and aſtoniſhment, what ſhrieks cries, and bitter lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of wives, children, ſervants and friends, howling and weeping; finding themſelves without all hope of deliverance from their preſent miſeries. How inexorable were their barbarous <hi>Tormentors,</hi> that compaſſed them in on every ſide, without all bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or the leaſt commiſeration or pity; yea they boaſted upon their ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe mercileſs <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> having ſet a Caſtle on fire, wherein were many <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> they rejoycingly ſaid, <hi>O how ſweetly do they fry!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> when they had committed many cruel murthers, they brought ſeven <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants heads,</hi> one the head of a reverend <hi>Miniſter;</hi> all which they ſet upon the <hi>Market-croſs</hi> on a <hi>Market-day;</hi> triumphing, ſlaſhing, and mangling them: they put a <hi>Gag</hi> in the <hi>Miniſters mouth,</hi> ſlit up his cheeks to his ears, and laid a leaf of a Bible upon it, and bid him, <hi>Preach, for his Mouth was wide enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Kilmore</hi> they put many <hi>Proteſtants, Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> into a thatched Houſe, and there burnt them. They threw Mrs. <hi>Maxwell</hi> into the River, when in labour, the child being half born when the <hi>Mother</hi> was drowned.</p>
            <p>In one place they burnt two <hi>Proteſtant Bibles,</hi> and then ſaid, <hi>It was Hell fire they burnt.</hi> Other Bibles they took, cut in pieces, and then burnt them; ſaying, <hi>They would do the like to all</hi> Puritane <hi>Bibles.</hi> They took the Bible of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> called Mr. <hi>Edward Slack,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening it, they laid it in a puddle of Water, and then ſtamped upon it, ſaying, <hi>A plague on it, this Bible hath bred all the quarrel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Glaſtow,</hi> a Prieſt with ſome others, drew about forty <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scottiſh Proteſtants</hi> to be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then told them, <hi>They were in a good faith, and for fear they ſhould fall from it and turn Hereticks,</hi> he with his companions preſently cut all their throats.</p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> near the <hi>Silver Works,</hi> ſome of theſe barbarous <hi>Papiſts</hi> met with eleven <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> ten <hi>women,</hi> and ſome <hi>children;</hi> whom they firſt ſtript and then with <hi>Stones, Pole-axes, Skeins, Swords, &amp;c.</hi> they moſt barbarouſly maſſacred them all.</p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Mayo</hi> about ſixty <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whereof fifteen were Miniſters, were upon Covenant to be ſafely conveyed to <hi>Galway</hi> by one <hi>Edmond Burk,</hi> and his Souldiers; but by the way, this <hi>Burk</hi> and his company began to maſſacre theſe poor <hi>Proteſtants:</hi> ſome they ſhot to death; ſome they ſtab'd with their Skeins; ſome they thruſt through with their Pikes, ſome they drowned; the Women they ſtript naked, who lying upon their husbands to ſave them, were run through with Pikes; ſo that very few of them eſcaped with life.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Sligo,</hi> forty <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were ſtript and locked up in a Cellar, and about midnight a Butcher provided for the purpoſe, was ſent in amongſt them; who with his axe butchered them all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64254:4"/>
In <hi>Tirawly</hi> thirty or forty <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who had yielded to go to Maſs, were put to their choice, <hi>Whether they would die by the Sword or be drowned?</hi> They choſe the latter, and ſo being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Sea-ſide, theſe barbarous Villains, with their naked ſwords forced them into the Sea; the <hi>Mothers</hi> with their <hi>Children</hi> in their Arms, wading to the Chin, were overcome by the waves; where they all periſhed.</p>
            <p>The Son of Mr. <hi>Montgomery</hi> a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> aged about fifteen years, met with his <hi>School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> who drew his Skein at him; whereupon the Boy ſaid, <hi>Good Maſter whip me as much as you will, but do not kill me.</hi> Yet this mercileſs Tiger barbarouſly murthered him without all pity.</p>
            <p>In the Town of <hi>Sligo</hi> all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were firſt robbed of their Eſtates, then caſt into Goal, and about midnight vvere all ſtript naked, and vvere there moſt cruelly and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murthered vvith Swords, Axes, Skeins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome of them being Women great vvith-child, their Infants thruſt out their Arms and Legs at their Wounds; after vvhich ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrable murthers, theſe Hell-hounds laid the dead naked bodies of the Men upon the naked bodies of the Women, in a moſt immodeſt poſture; vvhere they left them till the next day to be looked upon by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who beheld it with great delight. Alſo <hi>Iſabel Beard,</hi> great with-child, hearing the lamentable cries of thoſe that were murthering, ran out into the ſtreets; where ſhe was murthered, and the next day was found with the Childs feet come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Wounds in her ſides: many others were murthered in the houſes and ſtreets.</p>
            <p>About <hi>Dungannon</hi> were three hundred and ſixteen <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the like barbarous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner murthered: About <hi>Charlemont</hi> above four hundred: About <hi>Tyrone</hi> two hundred and ſix.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Mac Crew</hi> murthered thirty one in one morning.</p>
            <p>Two young Villains murthered 140 poor Women and Children, that could make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. An <hi>Iriſh</hi> Woman with her own hands murthered forty five.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Portendown Bridge</hi> were drowned above three hundred. At <hi>Lawgh</hi> were drowned above two hundred. In an other place were drowned three hundred in one day. In the pariſh of <hi>Killmen,</hi> there were murthered one thouſand and two hundred <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many young children they cut in quarters; eighteen <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Infants they hanged upon a Clothiers Tenter-hooks; one fat man they murthered and made Candles of his greaſe; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Scottiſh</hi> man they ript up his belly, took one end of his ſmall guts, tied it to a Tree, and forced him round about it, till they had drawn them all out of his body, ſaying, <hi>That they would try whether a</hi> dog <hi>or a</hi> Scottiſh <hi>mans Guts were the longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the command of Sir <hi>Philem O Neale,</hi> Maſter <hi>James Maxwell</hi> was drawn out of his bed, being ſick of a Feaver, and murthered, his Wife being in chid-birth, the child being halfborn, they ſtript naked, drove her about a flight ſhot, and drowned her in the black water, the like or worſe they did to another <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman in the ſame Town. One Mr. <hi>Watſon</hi> they roaſted alive. A <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Woman great with-child, they ript up her Belly, cut the Child out of her Womb, and ſo left it crawling on her Body.</p>

            <p>To one <hi>Henry Cowel,</hi> a gallant Gentleman, they proffered his life, if he would marry one of their Trulls, or go to Maſs, but he choſe death rather than to conſent to either.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> they buried alive, ſollacing themſelves, whilſt they were dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging down old Ditches upon them.</p>
            <p>They, brake the Back-bone of a Youth, and left him in the Fields, ſome days after he was found, having eaten the Graſs round about him; neither then would they kill him out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            </p>
            <p>In the County of <hi>Antrim,</hi> they murthered Nine hundred fifty four <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and afterwards about Twelve hundred more in that County. Near <hi>Liſnegarry,</hi> they forced Twenty four <hi>Proteſtants</hi> into a Houſe and burnt them all.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64254:4"/>
Sir <hi>Philem O Neale</hi> boaſted, <hi>That he had ſlain above Six hundred at</hi> Garvah, <hi>and that he had left neither Man, Woman, nor Child alive in the</hi> Barony <hi>of</hi> Munterlong. In other places he murdered above two thouſand Perſons in their Houſes; ſo that many Houſes were filled with dead bodies.</p>
            <p>Above twelve thouſand were ſlain in the High-ways, as they fled towards <hi>Down.</hi> Many died of Famine, many died for want of Cloths, being ſtript naked in a cold ſeaſon; ſome thouſands were drowned; ſo that in the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> there were about one hundred and fifty thouſand murdered by ſundry kinds of torments and deaths.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anne Kinnard</hi> teſtified, <hi>That fifteen</hi> Proteſtants <hi>being impriſoned, and their Feet in the Stocks, a</hi> Popiſh <hi>Boy, being not above fourteen years old, flew them all in one Night with his Skein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman, who was newly delivered of two Children, ſome of theſe Villains violently compelled her, in her great pain and ſickneſs, to riſe out of her Bed, and took one of the Infants that was living, and daſhed his Brains againſt the Stones, and then threw him into the River of <hi>Barrow:</hi> The like they did by many other Infants; many others they hanged up without all pity.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Mont Garret,</hi> cauſed divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Souldiers that he had taken about <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> to be hanged, hardly ſuffering them to pray before their death.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Fitz Patrick,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Papiſt,</hi> enticed a rich Merchant, that was a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> to bring all his Goods to his Houſe, promiſing ſafely to keep them, and to re-deliver them to him, but when he had gotten them into his poſſeſſion, he took the Merchant and his Wife and hanged them both. The like he did by divers others.</p>
            <p>Some <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mens Heads they cut off, and carried them to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> and on the Market-day, ſet them on the Croſs, where many, eſpecially the Women, ſtab'd, cut, and ſlaſhed them.</p>
            <p>A poor <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Woman, with her two Children, going to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> theſe bloody Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants baired them with Dogs, ſtabbed them with Skeins, and pulled out the Guts of one of the Children, whereby they died; and not far off they took divers Men, Women, and Children, and hanged them up; one of the Women being great with-child, they ripped up her Belly as ſhe hanged, ſo that the Child fell out in the Cawl alive. Some after they were hanged, they drew up and down till their Bowels were torn out.</p>
            <p>How many thouſands of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were there thus inhumanely butchered, by ſundry kinds of death, we cannot aſcertain.</p>
            <p>In the Province of <hi>Ulſter,</hi> we find vaſt numbers murdered, as before; what the number of the ſlain was in the three Provinces, I find not upon Record, but certainly it was very great, for you have theſe paſſages in a general Remonſtance of the diſtreſſed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Province of <hi>Miniſter. We may</hi> (ſay they) <hi>compare our woe to the ſaddeſt parallel of any ſtory: Our Churches are prophaned by Sacrifices to Idols; Our Habitations are become ruinous heaps: No Quality, Age, or Sex, priviledged from Maſſacres and lingring Deaths, by being robbed, ſtript naked, and ſo expoſed to cold and famine. The famiſhed Infants of murdered Parents ſwarm-in our ſtreets, and for want of food periſh before our faces,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And all this cruelty that is exerciſed upon us, we know not for what cauſe, offence, or ſeeming provocation it is inflicted upon us (ſin excepted) ſaving that we were</hi> Proteſtants, <hi>&amp;c. We can make it manifeſt, that the depopulations in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of</hi> Munſter, <hi>do well near equal thoſe of the whole Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And thus in part you have heard of the mercileſs cruelties which the bloody <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> exerciſed toward the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> Let us now conſider, at leaſt ſome of Gods Judgments upon the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> whereby he hath not leſt the innocent Blood of his Servants to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unrevenged.</p>
            <p>Theſe bloody Hell-hounds, themſelves confeſſed, <hi>That the Ghoſt of divers of the</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants <hi>which they had drowned at</hi> Portendown Bridge, <hi>were daily ſeen to wall upon the Raves; ſometimes ſinging of Pſalms; ſometimes brandiſhing naked Swords; ſometimes ſhreeking in a moſt hideous and tearful manner.</hi> So that many of the <hi>Popiſh Iriſh,</hi> which dwelt near <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ words">

               <hi>Elizabeth Price,</hi> teſtified upon Oath, <hi>That ſhe and other Women, whoſe Husbands Children were drowned in that place, hearing of thoſe Apparitions, went thither one evening, at which time they ſaw one like a Woman riſe out of the River breaſt-high, her Hair hanging down, which with her Skin, was as white as Snow, often crying out,</hi> Revenge, Revenge, Revenge, <hi>which ſo afrighted them that they went away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divers <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were thrown into the River of <hi>Belterbert,</hi> and when any of them offered to ſwim to the Land, they were knocked on the Head with Poles, after which their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were not ſeen of ſix weeks, but after the end hereof, the murderers coming again that way, the Bodies came floating up to the very Bridge where they were.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Con Mac Gennis,</hi> with his Company, ſlew Mr. <hi>Turge,</hi> Miniſter of the <hi>Newry,</hi> with divers other <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> after which the ſaid <hi>Mac Gennis</hi> was ſo affrighted with the Apparition of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Turge,</hi> his being continually in his preſence, that he commanded his Souldiers not to ſlay any more of them but ſuch as ſhould be ſlain in Battel.</p>
            <p>A young Woman being ſtript almoſt naked, there came a Rogue to her, bidding her, <hi>Give him her money, or he would run her through with his Sword.</hi> Her Anſwer was, <hi>You cannot kill me except God give you leave;</hi> whereupon he ran three times at her naked Body with his drawn Sword, and yet never pierced her Skin; whereat he being confounded went his way and left her. This was atteſted by divers Women that were preſent and ſaw it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters whom they ſurprized, their manner was firſt to ſtrip them, and after bind them to a Tree of Poſt, where they pleaſed, and then to raviſh their Wives and Daughters before their faces (in ſight of all their mercileſs rabble) with the baſeft Villains they could pick out; after they hanged up their Husbands and Parents before their faces, and then cut them down before they were half dead, then quartered them, after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered them, and ſtopped their mouths therewith.</p>
            <p>They baſely abuſed one Mr. <hi>Trafford</hi> a Miniſter in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by theſe bloody Wolves of <hi>Romes-</hi>brood, that know not God, nor any bowels of Mercy. This diſtreſſed Miniſter deſired but ſo much time as to call upon God before he went out of the world; but theſe mercileſs wretches would admit no time, but inſtantly fell upon him, hackt and hewed him to pieces.</p>
