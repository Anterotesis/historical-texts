         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap> effects of an Arbitrary Government, &amp; a high ſtretcht <hi>Prerogative:</hi> for the cure of which diſtempers a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> was held to be the onely good old way of <hi>Phyſick</hi> to cleanſe the Body Politique from oppreſsing Crudities (which was heartily deſir'd) but not by over-ſtrong Purgations to weaken it in the principall Part, charging it to receive a diſpoſition to the like diſtemper, or a Relapſe into the ſame, or a worſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which in ſtead of reſtoring it to its primitive vigour and health, muſt needs drive it to a fatall Period. Such is our miſery, ſuch the juſt judgment of God upon our Sins.</p>
            <p>This wholſome <hi>Phyſick</hi> hath not wrought in us that bleſſed effect, as was either believed by ſome, or hoped for by all men: but as if God had anſwered our importunity for a Parliament, as hee did the old Iſraelites for a King in his anger; we drive on with much more haſte then good ſpeed to the other extream, which portends no leſſe Symptomes of ruine and deſtruction than the former. So that having maturely conſidered what hath proved deſtructive to this or other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, we may the more eaſily avoid thoſe Rocks upon which others have ſplit themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 The venting of particular ends of Avarice and Ambition in the publike Cauſe. 2 Private Combinations or Chamber conventicles to reſolve before-hand what ſhall be done in the Houſe. 3 Hindring the freedom of ſpeech by impriſonment of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. 4 Denying information by the humble way of Petitions from the County, as that moſt excellent Orthodox Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of our Brethren of <hi>Kent,</hi> and of rejecting information of Letters to our Knights and Burgeſſes. 5 The ready ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of informations and jealous rumours againſt his Majeſty, the ſtyling them the malignant party and enemies to the State, which were onely, truly and conſcionably his friends 6 The private if not publike mutinous rabble, which ill Spirit was ready at all times to be raiſed by a whiſper from any of thoſe worthy Members, Emphatically ſo called, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, as if all Juſtice, Reformation, and Government were onely to be expected from them. 7 The now unheard of State-law and Logick to ſtyle and believe that a Parliament that is divided in it ſelfe, is ſevered from the King the Head thereof: if they may be remedied (as we hope they are not paſt cure) we ſhall rather deſire to change ſome of our Phyſicians then Phyſick, there being no better way, nor more neceſſary to preſerve the health of a Common-wealth, than a well temper'd Parliament. Wherefore we as faithfull Subjects to his Majeſty, as free-born Engliſhmen, doe joyn in an unanimous reſolution to maintain.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1 <hi>The Proteſtant Religion,</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the firſt, <hi>The Proteſtant Religion;</hi> we cannot but with grief of heart remember how it hath been aſſaulted in the In-works and skirts of it, the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> and decent <hi>Ceremonies</hi> eſtabliſhed by Law; yea, in the very Body of it the 39 <hi>Articles.</hi> In what a danger this Church of <hi>England</hi> hath been, to be overcome with <hi>Browniſme</hi> and <hi>Anabaptiſme,</hi> let all the World judge. For the ſecond, <hi>The juſt power of the King;</hi> God knows he hath been ſo far unable to defend that from violence, as it was Gods great goodneſſe rather then his own power which ſecured, or rather preſerved his perſon from violence, What their ayme was, who to pleaſe the vulgar Rabble would uphold and not puniſh them for their inſolencies, as wee feare and imagine for the preſent; ſo we cannot but with horror and amazement doubt the conſequence.</p>
            <p>Nor can we conceale our joy of heart, or thanks to his Majeſties good Subjects of the County of <hi>York,</hi> for endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſecure his perſon with a Guard (being of much more value then many thouſand of us) and putting him in a poſture of defence, which ſome have ignorantly or maliciouſly interpoſed by ſuggeſting it an intenſion of War againſt his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, whereby it is plaine enough his Majeſties deſires are onely to ſecure himſelf and ſervants from prodigious tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and diſorders as have indangered his ſacred perſon: Nor can we blame him conſidering Sir <hi>Iohn Hothams</hi> Act at <hi>Hull,</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Ludlowes</hi> Speech in Parliament.</p>
            <p>For the two laſt, <hi>The Laws of the Land,</hi> and <hi>The Liberty of the Subject,</hi> which muſt not be ſeparated, how have they beene violated after by ſome of thoſe who were choſen to be Conſervators of them, by impriſonment of mens perſons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Petition of <hi>Right?</hi> aſsiſting of the Clergy without a Body of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> ſhuffling the Convocation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Synod,</hi> or an Aſſembly, or Conventicle, without the choice, conſent, or election of the Clergy; as if they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings Subjects, nor Gods ſervants.</p>
            <p>As wee conceive our ſelves obliged by the Law of God, the Law of the Land, by the Dictates of Nature and reaſon to maintaine all theſe; ſo by Gods grace aſſiſting us, we hope we ſhall not be terrified or compelled to yeeld any active obedience to any diſ-joyned part of <hi>Parliament</hi> without the conſent of the whole (which we heartily deſire may be united) or to any uncertaine Debates, Votes or Ordinances, that are not digeſted or ſetled into Lawes: nay which ſeemes to contradict former Lawes, and yet are tender'd to us with ſo much earneſtnes, as ſome dare hardly deny them with ſafety, or obey with Conſcience.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall we ever yeeld our ſelves ſuch Slaves, or ſo betray the liberty purchaſed by our Forefathers blood, and bequeathed unto us as to ſuffer our ſelves to be ſwayed by any Arbytrary Government whatſoever, or ſtand with too much contention of Spirit to caſt off the yoake of our Tyrany to endure many worſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſeeing his Maieſtie is gratiouſly pleaſed to maintaine the true</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Religion; His owne</hi> juſt Power, <hi>The</hi> Lawes <hi>of the</hi> Land, <hi>The</hi> Liberty <hi>of the</hi> Subjects <hi>and that theſe waters of</hi> Reformation, <hi>having beene long ſtirred; we want onely the favour of his Princly</hi> Majeſtie <hi>to let us in and heale us: So we doe reciprocally declare that we conceive our ſelves bound to maintaine him in all the Premiſſes with our lives and Fortunes</hi>
