            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is a general Belief, that the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> was at first an Imitation of the Assembly of the Three Estates in <hi>France:</hi> therefore in order to prepare the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Recerche we have in hand, it is proper to give a brief Accompt of the mode of <hi>France</hi> in those Assemblies: <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> being also under the Dominion of the King of <hi>England;</hi> a touch of the manner of their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments shall be by way of Preface.</p>
            <p>1. In <hi>France,</hi> the Kings Writ goeth to the Bailiffs, Seneschals, or Stewards of Liberties, who issue out Warrants to all
<pb facs="tcp:104419:3"/>
such as have Fees and Lands within their Liberties, and to all Towns, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all such as have any <hi>Complaints,</hi> to meet in the Principal City, there to choose two or three Delegates, in the name of that Province, to be present at the General Assembly.</p>
            <p>At the day appointed, they meet at the Principal City of the Bailiwick. The King's Writ is read, and every man called by name, and sworn to choose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, for the Good of the King and Commonwealth, to be present at the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Assembly as Delegates, faithfully to deliver their <hi>Grievances,</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of the Province. Then they choose their Delegates, and swear them. Next, they consult what is necessary to be complained of, or what is to be desired of the King: and of these things they make a Catalogue or <hi>Index.</hi> And because every man should freely propound his <hi>Complaint</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> there is a Chest placed in the
<pb facs="tcp:104419:3"/>
Town-Hall, into which every man may cast his Writing. After the Catalogue is made and Signed, it is delivered to the Delegates to carry to the General As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.</p>
            <p>All the Bailiwicks are divided into twelve Classes. To avoid confusion, and to the end there may not be too great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the Assembly, by the Gathering of all the Votes, every Classis compiles a Catalogue or Book of the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of all the Bailiwicks within that Classis, then these Classes at the Aslembly compose one Book of the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of the whole Kingdom. This being the order of the Proceedings of the third Estate; the like order is observed by the Clergy and Nobility. When the three Books for the three Estates are perfected, then they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them to the King by their Presidents. First, the President for the Clergy begins his Oration on his knees, and the King
<pb facs="tcp:104419:4"/>
commanding, he stands up bare-headed, and proceeds. And so the next President for the Nobility doth the like. But the President for the Commons begins and ends his Oration on his knees. Whilst the President for the Clergy speaks, the rest of that Order rise up, and stand bare, till they are bid by the King to sit down, and be covered, and so the like for the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But whilst the President of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons speaks, the rest are neither bidden to sit, or be covered. Thus the <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> being delivered, and left to the King and His Counsel, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Assembly of the three Estates endeth, <hi>Atque ita totus actus concluditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus it appears, the General Assembly was but an orderly way of presenting the Publick <hi>Grievances</hi> and <hi>Demands</hi> of the whole Kingdom, to the consideration of the King: Not much unlike the antient Usage of this Kingdom for a long time, when all Laws were nothing else but the
<pb facs="tcp:104419:4"/>
King's Answers to the Petitions presented to Him in Parliament, as is apparent by very many Statutes, Parliament-Rolls, and the Confession of Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In <hi>Scotland,</hi> about twenty dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament begins, Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made throughout the Kingdom, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver in to the King's Clerk or Master of the Rolls, all Bills to be exhibited that Sessions, before a certain day: then are they brought to the King, and perused by Him: and onely such as he allows are put into the Chancellour's hand, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in Parliament, and none others: And if any man in Parliament speak of another matter, than is allowed by the King, the Chancellour tells him, there is no such Bill allowed by the King. When they have passed them for Laws, they are presented to the King, who, with his Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter put into His hand by the Chancellor, ratifies them, and if there be any thing the King dislikes, they raze it out before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:104419:5"/>3. In <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Parliament, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a Statute made in the Tenth year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>c. 4.</hi> is to be after this manner: No Parliament is to be holden but at such Season as the King's Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Councel there, do first certifie the King, under the Great Seal of that Land, the Causes and Considerations, and all such Acts as they think fit should pass in the said Parliament. And such Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Considerations, and Acts affirmed by the King and his Councel to be good and expedient for that Land: And His Licence thereupon as well in affirmation of the said Causes and Acts, as to summon the Parliament under His Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> had and obtained. That done, a Parliament to be had and holden after the Form and Effect afore rehearsed, and if any Parliament be holden in that Land contrary to the Form and Provision afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, it is deemed void, and of none Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in Law. It is provided, that all such
<pb facs="tcp:104419:5"/>
Bills as shall be offered to the Parliament there; shall first be transmitted hither under the Great Seal of that Kingdom, and having received Allowane and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation here, shall be put under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither to be preferred to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. By a Statute of 3 and 4 of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> for the expounding of <hi>Poynings</hi> Act, it is ordered, for the King's Passing of the said Acts in such Form and Tenor as they should be sent into <hi>England,</hi> or else for the Change of them, or any part of them.</p>
            <p>After this shorter Narrative of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Parliaments in our Neighbour and Fellow Kingdoms, it is time the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitio magna</hi> of our own be offered to the Verdict or Iudgment of a moderate and intelligent Reader.</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>By this Writ we do not find that the Commons are called to be any part of the <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the Kingdom, or of the <hi>Supream Court of Iudicature,</hi> or to have any part of the <hi>Legislative Power,</hi> or to Consult <hi>de arduis regni negotiis,</hi> of the difficult Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Kingdom. The Writ only sayes, the King would have <hi>Conference,</hi> and <hi>Treat</hi> with the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Great men,</hi> and <hi>Peers:</hi> but not a word of Treating or Conference with the Commons; The House of Commons which doth not minister an Oath, nor fine, nor imprison any, but their own Members (and that but of late in some Cases) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not properly be said to be a Court at all; much less to be a part of the Supream Court, or highest Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature of the Kingdom: The constant Custom, even to this day, for the Members of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to stand bare, with their Hats in their Hands in the Presence of the Lords, while the Lords sit covered at all Conferences, is a visible argument, that the Lords and Commons are not fellow Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, or fellow Counsellors of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The Duty of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, mentioned in the Writ, is only <hi>ad Faciendum, &amp; Consentiendum,</hi> to <hi>Perform</hi> and to <hi>Consent</hi> to such things as should be ordained by the <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the Kingdom; there is not so much mentioned in the Writ as a Power in the Commons to dissent. When a man is bound to appear in a Court of Justice, the words are, <hi>ad Faciendum &amp; recipiendum quod ei per curiam injungetur:</hi> which shews, that this word <hi>Faciendum</hi> is used as a Term in Law to signifie <hi>to give Obedience:</hi> For this, we meet with a Precedent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104419:11"/>
even as ancient as the Parliament-Writ it self, and it is concerning Proceedings in Parliament. 33. Ed. 1. <hi>Dominus Rex mandavit vicecom' quod &amp;c. summon' Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaum de Segrave, &amp; ex parte Domini regis firmiter ei injungeret, quod esset coram Domino Rege in proximo Parl. &amp;c. ad audiendum voluntatem ipsius Domini Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis &amp;c. Et ad Faciendum &amp; recipiendum ulterius quod curia Domini Regis consideraret in Praemissis:</hi> 
                     <q>Our Lord the King commands the Sheriff to summon <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Segrave</hi> to appear before the Lord our King in the next Parliament to hear the Will of the Lord our King himself, and to Perform and receive what the Kings Court shall further consider of the Premises.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> to prove the Clergy hath no Voice in Parliament; saith, that by the Words of their Writ <hi>their Consent was only to such things as were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Common Councel of the Realm.</hi> If this argument of his be good, it will deny also Voices to the Commons in Parliament, for in their Writ are the self-same words, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>consent to such things as were ordained by the Common Councel</hi> of the Kingdom. Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> concludes, that the <hi>Procuratores Cleri, have many times appeared in Parliament,</hi> as <hi>Spiritual Assistants, to Consider, Consult, and to Consent;</hi> but never had voice there; how they could consult, and Consent without Voices he doth not shew: Though <hi>the Clergy</hi> (as he saith) <hi>oft appeared in Parliament,</hi> yet was it only <hi>ad consentiendum,</hi> as I take it, and not <hi>ad faciendum,</hi> for the Word <hi>Faciendum</hi> is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their Writ; the cause, as I conceive is, the Clergy, though they were to <hi>assent,</hi> yet by reason of <hi>Clerical Exemptions,</hi> they were not required to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> all the Ordinances or Acts of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But some may think, though the Writ doth not express a Calling of the Knights, Citizens, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104419:11"/>
Burgesses to be part of the <hi>Common Councel of the Kingdom;</hi> yet it supposeth it a thing granted, and not to be questioned, but that they are a part of the <hi>Common Councel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed if their Writ had not mentioned the Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Prelates, Great men, and Peers to Councel, there might have been a little better colour for such a Supposition: but the Truth is, such a Supposition doth make the Writ it self vain and idle; for it is a senseless thing to bid men assent to that which they have already ordained: since ordaining is an Assenting; and more than an Assenting.</p>
                  <p>For clearing the meaning and sense of the Writ, and Satisfaction of such as think it impossible but that the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have alwayes been a part of the <hi>Common Councel of the Kingdom,</hi> I shall insist upon these Points. 1. That anciently the <hi>Barons of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land were the Common Councel of the Kingdom.</hi> 2. That until the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. the Commons were not called to Parliament. 3. Though the Commons were called by <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. yet they were not constantly called, nor yet regularly elected by Writ until <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. time.</p>
                  <p>For the first point M. <hi>Cambden</hi> in his <hi>Britania,</hi> doth teach us, that <hi>in the time of the English Saxons, and in the ensuing Age, a Parliament was called, Commun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The Author of the Chronicle of the<note place="margin">Apud Selden.</note> Church of <hi>Lichfield,</hi> cited by M. <hi>Selden,</hi> saith, <hi>Postquam Rex Edvardus, &amp;c.

                  <p>For fuller Manifestation of what hath been said touching the Calling, Election, and Power of the Commons in Parliament, it is behooful to observe some Points delivered by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the Jurisdiction of Parliaments; where,</p>
                  <p>First, he fairly begins, and lays his Foundation, that <hi>the High Court of Parliament consisteth of the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty sitting there, and of the three Estates;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The Lords Spiritual.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The Lords Temporal.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104419:20"/>3. <hi>And the Commons.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Hence it is to be gathered, that truly and properly it cannot be called the <hi>High Court of Parliament,</hi> but whilst the King is sitting there in Person: so that the Question now a days, whether the <hi>Parliament be above the King,</hi> is either false or idle: false, if you exclude, and idle if you include the King's Person in the word <hi>Parliament:</hi> The case truly put, and as it is meant, is, whether the three Estates (o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> which is all one, the Lords and Commons) assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Parliament be above the King: and not whether the King with the three Estates be above the King: It appears also that they are much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, who reckon the King one of the three Estates as Mr. <hi>Pryn, pag.</hi> 20. and many others do; for the three Estates make the Body, and the King is <hi>Caput<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Principium, &amp; finis Parliamentor,</hi> as confesseth Sir <hi>Edw. Coke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> delivers, That <hi>certain it is, both Houses at first sate together, and that it appears in</hi> Edward <hi>the Third's time, the Lords and Commons sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> together, and the Commons had no continual Speaker.</hi> If he mean, the Lords and Commons did sit, and Vote together in one Body; few there be that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, because the Commons never were wont to lose, or forego any of their Liberties, or Privileges; and for them to stand now with their Hats in their hands (which is no Magistratical Posture) there, where they were wont to sit and Vote, is an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not imaginable to be indured by the Commons. It may be, in former times, when the <hi>Commons</hi> had no constant Speaker, they were oft, and perhaps for the most part, in the same Chamber, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lords, to hear the Debates and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulations
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104419:20"/>
of the <hi>Great Councel,</hi> but not to sit, and Vote with them: for when the Commons were to Advise among themselves, the Chapter-house of the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> was oft-times their place to meet in, before they had a settled House, and their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings not being very frequent, may be the reason, I conceive, why the name of the House of Commons is not of such great Antiquity, or taken notice of; but the House of Lords was only called the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-House: and the Treatise called, <hi>Modus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi Parliamentum,</hi> speaks of the <hi>Parliament</hi> as but of one House only. The House, where now the <hi>Commons</hi> sit in <hi>Westminster,</hi> is but of late Use, or Institution: for in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's dayes<note place="margin">Stow.</note> it was a Chappel of the Colledge of Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> and had a Dean, Secular Canons and Chorists, who were the Kings Quire at his Palace at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and at the dissolution were translated to the Kings Chappel at <hi>White-hall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also I read, that <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> being out of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. caused a large House to be builded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Clock-tower, and the Gate of the great old Hall in the midst of the Palace Court: the House was long and large, made of Timber, covered with Tiles, open on both sides, that all might see and hear what was both said and done: four thousand Archers of <hi>Cheshire,</hi> which were the Kings own Guard, attended on that House, and had <hi>bouche a Court,</hi> and 6 <hi>d.</hi> by the day.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he saith, <hi>The Commons are to chuse their Speaker, but seeing after their Choice the King may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse him, the Use is (as in the</hi> conge d'eslire <hi>of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop) that the King doth name a Discreet, Learned man whom the Commons Elect: when the Commons have</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, he informs us, That <hi>the first day of the Parliament four Iustices assistants, and two Civilian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Queen: whereupon, Sir <hi>Henry Knivet</hi> said, <hi>it should be a thing answerable at the Bar for any man to report any thing of Speeches, or Matters done in the House. Sir</hi> John Wolley <hi>liked the Motion of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; except only the Queen, from whom,</hi> he said, <hi>there is no reason to keep any thing:</hi> And <hi>Sir</hi> Robert Cecil <hi>did allow, that the Councel of the House should be secretly kept, and nothing reported</hi> in malam partem. <hi>But if the meaning be, that they might not report any thing done here to the Queen, he was altogether against it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, he voucheth <hi>an Enditement or Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Kings Bench against 39 of the Commons, for departing without License from Parliament, contrary to the Kings Inhibition: whereof six submitted to their Fines, and</hi> Edmund Ployden <hi>pleaded, he remained continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the beginning to the end of the Parliament:</hi> Note, he did not plead to the Jurisdiction of the Court of Kings Bench, but pleaded his constant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance in Parliament, which was an Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and submitting to the Jurisdiction of that Court: and had been an unpardonable betraying of the Privileges of Parliament by so learned a Lawyer, if his Case ought only to be tryed in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, he resolves, that <hi>the House of Lords in their House have Power of Iudicature, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in their House: and both Houses together.</hi> He brings Records to prove the Power of Judicature of both Houses together, but not of either of them by it self.

                  <p>In the case of the Lord <hi>de la Ware,</hi> the Judgment of the Lords was, <hi>that he should have place next after the Lord</hi> Willoughby <hi>of</hi> Erisbe, by consent of all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord <hi>Windsor:</hi> and the <hi>Lord Keeper was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to acquaint Her Majesty with the Determination of the Peers, and to know her Pleasure concerning the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Inference from these Precedents, is, that the <hi>Decisive</hi> or <hi>Iudicial</hi> Power exercised in the <hi>Chamber of Peers,</hi> is merely derivative, and subservient to the Supreme Power, which resides in the King, and is grounded solely upon his <hi>grace</hi> and favour: for howsoever the House of Commons do alledge their Power to be founded on the Principles of Nature, in that they are the Representative Body of the Kingdom (as they say) and so being the whole, may take care, and have power by Nature to preserve themselves: yet the House of <hi>Peers</hi> do not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104419:27"/>
make any such the least Pretence, since there is no reason in Nature, why amongst a company of men who are all equal, some few should be picked out to be exalted above their Fellows, and have power to Govern those who by Nature are their companions. The difference between a <hi>Peer</hi> and a <hi>Commoner,</hi> is not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by the <hi>grace of the Prince:</hi> who creates Honours, and makes those Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to be hereditary (whereas he might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them for life onely, or during pleasure, or good behaviour) and also annexeth to those Honours the Power of having Votes in Parliament, as hereditary Counsellours, furnished with ampler Privileges than the Commons: All these Graces conferred upon the Peers, are so far from being derived from the Law of Nature, that they are contradictory and destructive of that natural equality and freedom of mankind, which many conceive to be the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Privileges and Liberties of the House of Commons: there is so strong an opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the liberties of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Nature,</hi> that it had never been possible for the two Houses of Parliament to have stood together without mortal Enmity, and eternal jarring, had they been raised upon such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite foundations: But the truth is, the Liberties and Privileges of both Houses have but one, and the self same foundation, which is nothing else but the meer and sole Grace of Kings.</p>
                  <p>Thus much may serve to shew the Nature and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the <hi>deliberative</hi> and <hi>decisive</hi> Power of the Peers of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The matter about which the <hi>deliberative</hi> power is conversant, is generally the Consulting and Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

                  <p>The main Question in these our dayes is, <hi>Where this Power Legislative remains?</hi> or is placed; upon conference of the Writs of Summons for both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, with the Bodies and Titles of our Ancient Acts of Parliament, we shall find the Power of making Laws rests solely in the King. Some affirm, that a part of the <hi>Legislative</hi> Power is in either of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but besides invincible reason from the Nature of Monarchy it self, which must have the Supreme Power Alone; the constant Antient Declaration of this Kingdom is against it. For howsoever of later years in the Titles and Bodies of our Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it be not so particularly expressed who is the Author and Maker of our Laws, yet in almost all our elder Statutes it is precisely expressed, that they

are made by the <hi>King Himself:</hi> The general words used of later times, that <hi>Laws are made by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Parliament,</hi> are particularly explained in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Statutes, to mean, <hi>That the King Ordains, the Lords Advise, the Commons Consent,</hi> as by comparing the Writs with the Statutes that expound the Writs, will evidently appear.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For further proof that the Legislative Power is proper to the King, we may take notice, that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient time, as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> saith, <hi>All Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were in form of Petitions:</hi> if the Petitions were from the Commons, and the Answer of them the King's, it is easie thereby to judge who made the Act of Parliament: Also Sir <hi>Io. Glanvil</hi> affirms, that in former times the course of Petitioning the <hi>King</hi> was this, <hi>The Lords and Speaker, either by Words or Writing, preferr'd their Petition to the King; this then was called the Bill of the Commons, which being received by the King, part He received, part He put out, and part he ratified; for as it came from Him, it was drawn into a Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also it appears, that <hi>Provisions, Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>Proclamations,</hi> made heretofore out of Parliament, have been alwayes acknowledged for Laws and Statutes: We have amongst the printed Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,<note place="margin">Chanc.</note> one called the <hi>Statute of Ireland,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">Egerton.</note> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> 9 <hi>Feb.</hi> 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. which is nothing but a <hi>Letter of the King to</hi> Gerard <hi>Son of</hi> Maurice Justicer <hi>of Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Explanations of the Statute of</hi> Gloucester <hi>made by the King and His Iustices only,</hi> were received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for Statutes, and are still printed with them.</p>
                  <p>Also the Statute made for the correction of the twelfth Chapter of the Statute of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> was Signed under the Great Seal, and sent to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of the Bench after the manner of a Writ Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, with a certain Writ closed, dated by the Kings hand at <hi>Westminster,</hi> 2 <hi>Maii</hi> 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. requiring that <hi>they should do and execute all and every thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained</hi>

                     <hi>in it, though the same do not accord with the Stat. of</hi> Gloucester <hi>in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Provisions</hi> of <hi>Merton</hi> made by the King at an Assembly of Prelates, and the greater part of the <hi>Earls</hi> and <hi>Barons,</hi> for the Coronation of the <hi>King,</hi> and his Queen <hi>Elinor,</hi> are in the form of a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and begin <hi>Provisum est in Curia domini Regis apud Merton.</hi>

                  <p>In the old Statutes it is hard to distinguish what Laws were made by Kings <hi>in</hi> Parliament, and what <hi>out</hi> of Parliament: when Kings called <hi>Peers</hi> only to Parliament, and of those how many, or whom they pleased, (as it appears anciently they did) it was no easie matter to put a difference between a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel-Table, and a Parliament: or between a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and a Statute: Yet it is most evident, that in old times there was a distinction between the <hi>Kings special</hi> or <hi>Privy Councel,</hi> and His <hi>Common Councel</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom:</hi> and His special Councel did sit with the Peers in Parliament, and were of great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Authority there.</p>
                  <p>In the Stat. of <hi>Westm.</hi> 1. it is said, <hi>These are the Acts of K.</hi> Edw. 1. <hi>made at His first Parliament by</hi> His Councel, <hi>and by the Assent of Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and all the Commonalty of the Realm.</hi>

even in the case of <hi>Treason,</hi> which is the Kings own Cause, as, <hi>whereas a man doth compass, or imagine the Death of Our Lord the King, or a man do wage War against Our Lord the King in His Realm, or be adherent to the Kings Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid or Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> in all these cases it is the <hi>Kings Declaration onely</hi> that makes it to be Treason: and though it be said, that <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult points of Treason shall be brought and shewed to the King, and His Parliament, yet</hi> it is said, it <hi>is the mind of the King and his Councel, that determines what shall be adjudged Treason, and what Felony, or Trespass.</hi>

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104419:37"/>In the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. an <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>Provision</hi> was made by the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> and it was pleaded at the Common Law in Bar to a Writ of Dower; the Plaintifs Atturney could not deny it, and thereupon the Judgment was, <hi>ideo sine die.</hi> It seems in those days an Order of the Kings Councel, was either parcell of the Common Law, or above it.</p>
                  <p>Also we may find, the Judges have had Regard, that before they would resolve or give Judgment in new Cases, they consulted with the Kings Privy Councel.</p>
                  <p>In the case of <hi>Adam Brabson</hi> who was assaulted by <hi>R. W.</hi> in the Presence of the Justices of Assise at <hi>Westminster,</hi> the Judges would have the <hi>Advice of the Kings Councel:</hi> for in a like Case, because <hi>R. C.</hi> did strike a Juror at <hi>Westminster</hi> which passed against one of his Friends, <hi>It was adjudged by all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel that his right hand should be cut off, and his Lands and Goods forfeited to the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Thorp</hi> were sent by the Judges to the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> to demand of them whether by the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 14 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 16. a word may be amended in a Writ, and it was answered that a word may be well amended, although the <hi>Stat.</hi> speaks but of a Letter or Syllable.</p>
                  <p>In the Case of Sir <hi>Thomas Ogthred,</hi> who brought a <hi>Formedon</hi> against a poor man and his Wife; they came and yielded to the Demandant, which seemed suspitious to the Court; whereupon Judgment was staid, and <hi>Thorp</hi> said that in the like case of <hi>Giles Blacket</hi> it was spoken of in Parliament, and we were commanded that when any like should come we should not go to Judgment without good Advice; therefore the Judges Conclusion was, <hi>Sues an coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seil</hi>

                  <p>Thus we see the Judges themselves were gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> and yet the Opinions of Judges have guided the Lords in Parliament in Point of Law.</p>
                  <p>All the Judges of the Realm, Barons of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, of the Quoif; the Kings learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, and the Civilians, Masters of Chancery, are called Temporal Assistants by Sir <hi>Edw. Coke,</hi> and though he deny them Voices in Parliament, yet lie confesseth, that by their Writ they have Power both to <hi>treat, and to give Councel.</hi> I cannot find that the Lords have any other Power by their Writ: the Words of the Lords Writ are, <hi>That you be present with Us the Prelates, Great men, and Peers, to treat and give your Counsel:</hi> The words of the Judges Writ are, <hi>that you be present with Us, and others of the Counsel</hi> (and sometimes with <hi>Us</hi> only) <hi>to treat and give your Counsel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Judges usually joyned in Committees with the Lords in all Parliaments, even in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> Reign, untill her 39th Year; and then upon the 7th of <hi>November,</hi> the Judges were appointed to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Lords.</hi> And whereas the Judges have Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the upper House it self, upon Leave given them by the L. Keeper, to cover themselves, now at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees they sit always uncovered.</p>
                  <p>The Power of Judges in Parliament is best understood, if we consider how the judicial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Peers</hi> hath been exercised in matter of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature: we may find it hath been the Practice,

that though the Lords in the Kings Absence give Judgment in Point of Law, yet they are to be directed and regulated by the Kings Judges, who are best able to give Direction in the difficult Points of the Law; which ordinarily are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Lords. And therefore, if any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour be committed in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> which is the highest ordinary Court of Common Law in the Kingdom, that Errour must be redressed in Parliament. And the Manner is, saith the Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton, If a Writ of Errour be sued in Parl. upon a Iudgment given by the Iudges in the Kings Bench, the Lords of the higher House alone, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Commons) are to examine the Errours. The Lords are to proceed according to the Law, and for their Iudgments therein they are to be informed by the Advice and Councel of the Iudges, who are to inform them what the Law is, and to direct them in their Iudgment; for the Lords are not to follow their own Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or Opinion otherwise.</hi>

But as <hi>Moses</hi> by chusing Elders to judge in small Causes, did not thereby lose his Authority to be Judge himself when he pleased, even in the smallest matters; much less in the greatest, which he reserved to himself: so Kings by delegating others to judge under them, do not thereby denude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of a Power to judge when they think good.</p>
                  <p>There is a Distinction of these times, that <hi>Kings themselves may not judge, but they may see and look to the Iudges, that they give Iudgment according to Law,</hi> and for this Purpose only (as some say) Kings may sometimes sit in the Courts of Justice. But it is not possible for Kings to see the Laws ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, except there be a Power in Kings both to judge when the Laws are duely executed, and when not; as also to compell the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es if they do not their Duty. Without such Power a King sitting in Courts is but a Mockery, and a Scorn to the Judges. And if this Power be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Kings, then their Judgments are supream in all Courts.

But where a King by Oath binds his Conscience to <hi>protect just Laws,</hi> it concerns him to be satisfied in his own Conscience, that they be just, and not by an implicite Faith, or blind Obedience: no man can be so proper a Judge of the Justness of Laws, as he whose Soul must lie at the Stake for the Defence and Safeguard of them.</p>
                  <p>Besides, in this very Oath the King doth swear, to do <hi>equal and right Iustice and Discretion, in Mercy and Truth in all His Iudgments: facies fieri in omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus judiciis tuis aequam &amp; rectam justitiam &amp; discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem in Misericordia &amp; Veritate:</hi> if we allow the King <hi>Discretion</hi> and <hi>Mercy in his Iudgments,</hi> of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity he must judge of the Justness of the Laws.</p>
                  <p>Again, the clause of the Oath, <hi>quas vulgus ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerit,</hi> doth not mention the assenting unto, or <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any new Laws,</hi> but of <hi>holding, protecting, and strengthning with all his Might, the just Laws that were already in Being:</hi> there were no need of Might or Strength, if assenting to new Laws were there meant.</p>
                  <p>Some may wonder, why there should be such La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to <hi>deny the King a negative Voice,</hi> since a negative Voice is in it self so poor a thing; that if a man had all the Negative Voices in the Kingdom, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:104419:44"/>
any thing; but a Power only to hinder the Power of another. <hi>Negatives</hi> are of such a malignant or destructive Nature, that if they have nothing else to destroy, they will, when they meet, destroy one another, which is the reason why two Negatives make an Affirmative, by destroying the Negation which did hinder the Affirmation: A King with a <hi>Negative Voice</hi> only, is but like a Syllogisme of <hi>pure negative Propositions,</hi> which can conclude nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It must be an <hi>Affirmative Voice</hi> that makes both a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Law,</hi> and without it there can be no imaginable Government.</p>
                  <p>The reason is plain why the <hi>Kings negative Voice</hi> is so eagerly opposed: for though it give the King no Power to do any thing; yet it gives him a Power to hinder others: though it cannot make Him a King, yet it can help him to keep others from being Kings.</p>
                  <p>For Conclusion of this Discourse of the <hi>negative Voice of the King,</hi> I shall oppose the Judgment of a <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to the Opinion of him that calls himself an <hi>utter Barister of Lincolns Inn,</hi> and let others judge who is the better Lawyer of the two: the words are <hi>Bracton's,</hi> but concern Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> to lay them to heart; <hi>Concerning the Charters and Deeds of Kings, the Iustices nor private men neither ought, nor can dispute; nor yet if there rise a Doubt in the Kings Charter, can they interpret it; and in doubtful and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Points, or if a word contain two Senses, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and Will of Our Lord the King is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, seeing it is his part to interpret; who makes the Charter:</hi> full well Mr. <hi>Pryn</hi> knows, that when <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> writ, the Laws that were then made, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for, were called the <hi>Kings Charters,</hi> as <hi>Magna Charta, Charta de Foresta,</hi> and others: so that in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104419:44"/>
                     <hi>Bracton's</hi> Judgment the <hi>King</hi> hath not only a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice</hi> to hinder, but an <hi>Affirmative,</hi> to make a Law, which is a great deal more than Master <hi>Pryn</hi> will allow him.</p>
                  <p>Not only the <hi>Law-maker,</hi> but also the <hi>sole Iudge of the People is the King,</hi> in the Judgment of <hi>Bracton;</hi> these are his words: <hi>Rex &amp; non alius debet judicare, si solus ad id sufficere possit,</hi> the King and no other ought to judge, if He alone were able. Much like the words of <hi>Bracton,</hi> speaketh <hi>Briton,</hi> where, after that he had shewed that the <hi>King is the Viceroy of God,</hi> and that He hath distributed his Charge into sundry portions, because He alone is not sufficient to hear all Complaints of His People, then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth these words, in the Person of the King: <hi>Nous volons que nostre jurisdiction soit sur touts Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. We Will that Our Iurisdiction be above all the Iurisdictions of Our Realm, so as in all manner of Felonies, Trespasses, Contracts, and in all other actions Personal or Real We have Power to yield, or cause to be yielded, such Iudgments as do appertain without other Process, wheresoever we know the right Truth as Iudges.</hi>

                     <p>First, The End or Scope of Privilege of Parliament is not to give any Power to do any publick Act, not warranted by the Writ: but they are intended as Helps only to enable to the Performance of the Duty enjoyned, and so are subservient to the Power comprised in the Writ: For Instance, the <hi>grand Privilege of Freedom from Arrests</hi> doth not give any Power at all to the <hi>House of Commons</hi> to do any act; but by taking away from the Free-holders and other Subjects the Power of Arrests, the Commons are the better inabled to attend the Service to which they are called by the King.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104419:46"/>
Servants in houshold to the King may not be arrested without special Licence: Also the Officers of the Kings Courts of Justice, have a Privilege not to be sued in any other Court but where they serve and attend; and to this Purpose they are allowed a <hi>Writ of Privilege.</hi> Likewise all such as serve the King in his Wars, or are imployed on forreign Affairs for him, are protected from Actions and Sutes. Nay the Kings Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction descends to the privileging even of <hi>Laundresses, Nurses, and Midwives,</hi> if they attend upon the Camp, as Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> saith, <hi>quia Lotrix, seu Nutrix, seu obstetrix.</hi> Besides the King protects his Debtors from Arrests of the Subject till his own Debts be paid.</p>
                     <p>These sorts of Protections are Privileges the Common Law takes notice of, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: and hath several Distinctions of them; and some are <hi>Protections, quia profecturus,</hi> and others are, <hi>quia moraturus:</hi> some are with a Clause of <hi>volumus</hi> for stay of Suits: others with a Clause of <hi>Nolumus</hi> for the safety of mens Persons, Servants, and Goods: and the Kings Writs do vary herein according to the Nature of the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.</p>
                     <p>But none of these Privileges or Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do give any Power; they are not <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,</hi>

but <hi>privative:</hi> they take away and deprive the Subject of the Power, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to arrest, or sue, in some cases only: no Protection or Privilege doth defend in point of <hi>Treason, Felony,</hi> or <hi>Breach</hi> of the <hi>Peace:</hi> Privileges are directly contrary to the Law, for otherwise they should not be Privileges, and they are to be interpreted in the strictest manner, as being <hi>odious and contrary</hi> to Law: we see the Use of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges; they do but serve as a Dispensation against Law, intended originally, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for the expediting of the Kings Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; though secondarily, and by accident there do sometimes redound a Benefit by them to the Parties themselves that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected. Strictly, and properly every Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege must be against a publick or common Law, for there is no Use or Need of a <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Law</hi> to protect, where there is no <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Law</hi> to the contrary: Favours and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are only <hi>besides,</hi> and <hi>not against</hi> the Law, do not properly go under the name of <hi>Privileges,</hi> though common Use do not distinguish them: I know no other Privilege that can be truly so called, and to belong to the House of Commons, which is so vast and great, as this Privilege of their <hi>Persons, Servants,</hi> and <hi>Goods:</hi> this being indeed against the Common Law,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104419:47"/>
and doth concern the whole Kingdom to take notice of it, if they must be bound by it.</p>
                     <p>Touching this grand Privilege of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Arrests, I read that in the 33 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. the Commons did not proceed to the Punishment of Offenders for the breach of it, untill the Lords referred the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof to the Lower House. The Case is thus reported, <hi>George Ferrers</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Servant to the King, and Burgesse for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> going to the Parliament House was arrested in <hi>London,</hi> by Process out of the Kings Bench for Debt, wherein he had before been condemned as Surety for one <hi>Welden</hi> at the Sute of one <hi>White:</hi> which Arrest signified to Sir <hi>Thomas Moyl</hi> Speaker, and to the rest; the Serjeant (called <hi>Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iohns</hi>) was sent to the Counter in <hi>Bread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street</hi> to demand <hi>Ferrers:</hi> The Officer of the Counter refused to deliver him, and gave the Serjeant such ill Language that they fall to an Affray: the Sheriff coming, taketh the Officers part, the Serjeant returned without the Prisoner: This being related to the Speaker and Burgesses, they would sit no more without their Burgess; and rising, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to the Upper House, where the Case was declared by the Speaker before Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Audley Chancellor, and the Lords and</hi>

                        </gap> is the only Privilege which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> finds to belong to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; he cannot, or at least he doth not, so much as name any other in his Section of the <hi>Privileges of Parliament:</hi> neither doth he bring so much as one Precedent for the Proof of this one Privilege for the House of Commons; which may cause a Doubt that this sole Privilege is not so clear as many do imagine. For in a Parliament in the 27 <hi>Eliz. Richard Coke,</hi> a Member, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing served with a <hi>Subpoena of Chancery, the Lord Chancellor thought the House had no such Privilege for Subpoena's as they pretended;</hi> neither would he allow of any Precedents of the House committed unto them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used in that Behalf, unless the House of Commons could also prove the same to have been likewise thereupon allowed, and ratified also by Precedents in the Court of Chancery.</p>
                     <p>In the 39 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> Sir <hi>Edw. Hobby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Brograve,</hi> Attorney of the Dutchy, were sent by the House to the Lord Keeper, in the name of the whole House, to <hi>require</hi> his Lordship to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:104419:48"/>
revoke two Writs of <hi>Subpoena's,</hi> which were served upon M. <hi>Th. Knevit,</hi> a Member of the House, since the Beginning of Parliament. The Lord Keeper demanded of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were appointed by any advised Consideration of the House, to deliver this Message unto him with the word <hi>Required,</hi> in such manner as they had done, or no: they answered his Lordship, yea: his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then said, as he thought reverently and honourably of the House, and of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and Privileges of the same, so <hi>to revoke the said Subpoena's in that sort, was to restrain Her Majesty in Her greatest Power, which is, Iustice in the Place wherein he serveth under Her,</hi> and therefore he concluded, as they had <hi>required</hi> him to revoke his Writ, so he did <hi>require to deliberate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the 22 of <hi>February,</hi> being Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Report was made by Mr. Attorney of the Dutchy, upon the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee, for the delivering of one Mr. <hi>Hall's</hi> man; that the Committee found <hi>no Precedent for setting at large by the Mace any Person in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest but only by Writ,</hi> and that by divers Precedents of Records perused by the said Committee, it appeareth that every Knight, Citizen or Burgess which doth require Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, hath used in that case to take a Corporal Oath before the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104419:49"/>
or Lord Keeper, that <hi>the party</hi> for whom such Writ is prayed, <hi>Came up with him, and was his Servant at the time of the Arrest made.</hi> Thereupon M. <hi>Hall</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the House to repair to the Lord Keeper, and make Oath, and then take a Warrant for a Writ of Privilege for his Servant.</p>
                     <p>It is accounted by some to be a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Parliament to have power to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <hi>Misdemeanours</hi> of Courts of Justice, and Officers of State: yet there is not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Subjest but hath liberty, upon just cause, to question the misdemeanour of any Court or Officer, if he suffer by them; there is no Law against him for so doing; so that this cannot properly be called a Privilege, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not against any publick Law: It hath been esteemed a great Favour of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to permit such Examinations: For, when the Lords were displeased with the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Pierce Gaveston,</hi> it is said, that in the next Parliament, <hi>the whole Assembly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the King to draw Articles of their Grievances,</hi> which they did.

                        <hi>and Reasoning, any man in the Commons House should speak more largely than of duty they ought to do, that all such Offences should be pardoned, and to be entred of Record; which was granted.</hi> It is observable in this Petition, that liberty or freedom of Speech is not a power for men to speak what they will, or please, in Parliament; but a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege not to be punished, but pardoned for the offence of speaking <hi>more largely than in duty ought to be;</hi> which in an equitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction must be understood of rash, unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, ignorant, or negligent Escapes, and Slips in Speech: and not for wilful, malicious Offences in that kind; And then the Pardon of the King was desired to be upon Record, that it might be pleaded in Bar to all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And it seemeth that <hi>Ric. Strood</hi> and his Complices, were not thought sufficiently protected for their free Speech in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unless their Pardon were confirmed by the King in Parliament, for there is a printed <hi>Statute</hi> to that purpose in <hi>H.</hi> 8<hi rend="sup">ths</hi> time.</p>
                     <p>Touching the freedom of Speech, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were warned in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> dayes not to meddle with the <hi>Queens Person, the State, or Church-government.</hi> In her time the Discipline of the Church was so strict, that the <hi>Litany</hi> was read every morning in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, during the Parliament, and when the

of the Realm; thereupon their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships did look to have something from the Houses, touching those Causes before this time (and yet the Parliament had sate but three dayes, for it began <hi>Feb.</hi> 26.) and therefore their Lordships had hitherto omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do any thing therein themselves. And thereupon their Lordships desired, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former laudable Usages between both Houses in such like Cases, a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Commons may have Conference with a Committee of Lords, touching Provision of Treasure against the great Dangers of the Realm, which was presently resolved by the whole House, and they signified to their Lordships the willing, and ready Assent of the whole House. At the Meeting, the Lords negatively affirm, not to assent to less than three Subsidies, and do insist for a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conference. M. <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Subsidy, but opposed the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Lords, as contrary to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of the House of Commons; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the House resolved to have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Lords, but to give their Lordships most humble and dutiful Thanks with all Reverence for their favourable and courteous Offer of Conference, and to signifie that the Commons cannot in those Cases of Benevolence, or Contribution joyn
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:104419:54"/>
in conference with their Lordships, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to the Liberties and Privileges of the House: and to request their Lordships to hold the Members of this House excused in their not-assenting to their Lordships said Motion for Conference, for that so to have As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented without a Bill, had been contrary to the Liberties and Privileges of this House<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also contrary to the former Precedents of the same House in like cases had. This Answer delivered to the Lords by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, their Lordships said, they well hoped to have had a Conference accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their former Request, and desir'd to see those Precedents by which the Commons seem to refuse the said Conference. But in conclusion it was agreed unto, upon the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> who moved, that without naming a Subsidy, it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in general words, to have a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence touching the Dangers of the Realm, and the necessary Supply of Treasure to be provided speedily for the same, according to the Proportion of the Necessity.</p>

Coke</hi> delivers in his <hi>Institutes,</hi> where he saith, <hi>the first Kings of this Realm had all the Lands of</hi> England <hi>in Demesne, and the great Manors &amp; Royalists they reserved to themselves, &amp; of the remnant for the defence of the Kingdom enfeoffed the Barons:</hi> from whence it appears, that no man holds any <hi>Lands</hi> but under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to defend the Realm; and upon the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Ground also the Kings Prerogative is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as being a Preheminence, in cases of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, above, &amp; before the Law of Property, or Inheritance. Certain it is, before the Commons were ever chosen to come to Parliament, Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Subsidies were raised and paid without their gift. The great and long continued Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidy of <hi>Dane-gelt</hi> was without any Gift of the Commons, or of any Parliament at all, that can be proved. In the 8 <hi>H.</hi> 3. a Subsidy of 2 Marks in Silver upon every Knights fee was granted to the <hi>King</hi> by the <hi>Nobles,</hi> without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

                     </p>
                     <p>The second Point is, that the Free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or Counties do not, nor cannot give Privilege to the Commons in Parliament. They that are under the Law cannot protect against it, they have no such Privilege them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as to be free from Arrests, and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for if they had, then it had been no Privilege, but it would be the Common Law: And what they have not, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give; <hi>Nemo dat quod non habet,</hi> neither do the Free-holders pretend to give any such Privilege, either at their Election, or by any subsequent Act; there is no mention of any such thing in the return of the Writ; nor in the Indentures between the Sheriff, and the Free-holders.</p>
                     <p>The third Point remains, That Privilege of Parliament is granted by the <hi>King.</hi> It is a known Rule, <hi>that which gives the Form gives the Consequences of the Form;</hi> the <hi>King</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:104419:55"/>
by his Writ gives the very Essence, and Form to the Parliament: therefore Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which are but Consequences of the Form, must necessarily flow from Kings.</p>
                     <p>All other Privileges and Protections are the Acts of the King; and by the Kings Writ. Sir <hi>Edw. Coke</hi> saith, that the <hi>Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mens Persons, Servants, and Goods, is done by a Writ of Grace from the King.</hi> At the presentment of the Speaker of the House of Commons to the King upon the first day of Parliament, The Speaker in the Name and Behoof of the Commons, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly craveth that his Majesty would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to grant them their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed Liberties and Privileges; which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of theirs, is a fair Recognition of the Primitive Grace and Favour of Kings in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of Privilege, and it is a shrewd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument against any other Title: For our Ancestors were not so ceremonious nor so full of Complement as to beg that by <hi>Grace,</hi> which they might claim by <hi>Right.</hi> And the Renewing of this Petition every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment argues the Grant to be but tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, during only the present Parliament; and that they have been accustomed, when they have been accustomably sued, or petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.

touching his Proceedings in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 1621. resolves, <hi>that most Privileges of Parliament grew from Precedents which rather shew a Toleration than an Inheritance; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not allow of the Style, calling i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>IN every Alteration of Government there is something new, which none can either Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or Iudge of, till time hath tried it: we read of many several wayes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but they have all, or most of them, been of particular Cities, with none, or very small Territories at first belonging to them. At this present the Government of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and of <hi>Swisserland,</hi> are not appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted either of them to any one City, for they are compounded of several petty Principalities, which have special and different Laws and Privileges each of them; insomuch that the United Provinces, and united Cantons are but Confederacies and Leaguers, and not two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Commonweals; Associates onely for mutual Defence. Nay, the Cantons of <hi>Swisserland</hi> are not only several Republicks, but reputed to have different Forms of Commonweals; some being said to be Aristocratically governed, and
<pb facs="tcp:104419:58"/>
others Democratically<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Mountaineers: and some of the Cantons are Papists, and some Protestants, and some mixt of both: we do not find that any large or great Dominion or Kingdom united in one Government, and under the same Laws, was ever reduced at once to any kind of Popular Government, and not confined to the subjection of one Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: This being a thing not yet done, requires the abler men to settle such a Peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as is to be desired: there being no Precedent in the case; all that can be done in it, is, at first to enquire into such other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as have been existent in the World. As a Preface to such an Enquiry, the Sacred Scripture (if it be but for the Antiquity of it) would be consulted; and then <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the grand Master of Politiques; and after him the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Historians that lived in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular times, would be diligently examined. To excite others of greater Abilities to an exacter Disquisition, I presume to offer a Taste of some Doctrines of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> which are usher'd in with a briefer Touch of the Holy Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>It is not probable, that any sure direction of the beginning of Government, can be found ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, Polybius,</hi> or in any other of the Heathen Authors, who were ignorant of the manner of the Creation of the World: we must not neglect the Scriptures, and
<pb facs="tcp:104419:58"/>
search in Philosophers for the grounds of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Property, which are the main Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Government and Iustice. The first Government in the World was Monarchical, in the Father of all Flesh. <hi>Adam</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to multiply, and People the Earth, and to subdue it, and having Dominion given him over all Creatures, was thereby the Monarch of the whole World; none of his Posterity had any Right to possess any thing, but by his Grant or Permission, or by Succession from him: <hi>the Earth</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist) hath he given to the Children of men:</hi> which shews, the Title comes from Fatherhood. There never was any such thing as an Independent Multitude, who at first had a natural Right to a Community: this is but a Fiction, or Fancy of too many in these dayes, who please themselves in running after the Opinions of <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> to find out such an Original of Government, as might promise them some title to Liberty, to the great Scandal of Christianity, and bringing in of Atheism, since a natural freedom of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cannot be supposed without the denial of the Creation of <hi>Adam.</hi> And yet this conceit of Original Freedom is the only Ground upon which not only the Heathen Philosophers, but also the Authors of the Principles of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law; and <hi>Grotius, Selden, Hobs, Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>I cannot find any one place, or Text in the Bible, where any Power or Commission is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a People either to govern themselves, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>That there is a ground in Nature for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, <hi>Aristotle himself</hi> affirmeth, saying, the <hi>first Kings were Fathers of Families;</hi> as for any ground of any other Form of Government, there hath been none yet alleged, but a supposed natural Freedom of Mankind; the Proof where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I find none do undertake, but only beg it to be granted: We find the Government of Gods own People varied under the several Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of Patriarchs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Captains, Iudges, and Kings; but in all these the Supreme Power rested still in one Person onely: We no where find any Supreme Power given to the People, or to a Multitude in Scripture, or ever exercised by them. The People were never <hi>the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of Majesty, cannot be divided among, or set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled upon a Multitude. God would have it fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one Person, not sometimes in one part of the People, and sometimes in another; and sometimes, and that for the most part, no where as when the Assembly is dissolved, it must rest in the Air, or in the walls of the Chamber when they were Assembled.</p>
                  <p>If there were any thing like a Popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among Gods People, it was about the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> when there was <hi>no King in Israel;</hi> for they had then some small Show of Government, such as it was, but it was so poor and beggarly, that the Scripture brands it with this note, that <hi>every man did what was right in his own eyes, because there was no King in Israel;</hi> it is not said, because there was no Government, but because there was no <hi>King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the higher Powers,</hi> and said no more: then men might have disputed, whether Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>higher Powers,</hi> had not meant as well other Governours as Kings; or other Forms of Government, as Monarchy; but the good luck is, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath been his own Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Comment: for, after the general Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Obedience to be given by all men to the <hi>higher Powers,</hi> he proceeds next to charge it home, and lay it to the Conscience under pain of Damnation, and applies it to each particular mans Conscience; saying, <hi>Wilt thou not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Power?</hi> which Power he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds in the singular number, restraining it to one Person, saying, <hi>He is the Minister of God to thee;</hi> it is not, <hi>They are the Ministers to thee;</hi> and then again, <hi>He beareth not the Sword in vain;</hi> and then a third time in the same verse, lest thou should'st forget it, he saith, <hi>for He is the Minister of God, a Revenger to Wrath &amp;c. upon thee:</hi> if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had said, <hi>They are the Ministers of God,</hi> or <hi>They bear not the Sword in vain,</hi> it might be doubted, whether [they] were meant of Kings onely, or of other Governours also; but this Scruple is taken away by the Apostle himself. And as <hi>St. Paul</hi> hath expounded what he means by <hi>Higher Powers,</hi> so <hi>St. Peter</hi> also doth the like: for the self-same Word that <hi>St. Paul</hi> useth
<pb facs="tcp:104419:61"/>
for <hi>Higher,</hi> in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is translated <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme;</hi> so that though in our <hi>English</hi> Bibles the words differ, yet in the Original they are both the same; so that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might have been Englished, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the Supreme Power;</hi> or St. <hi>Peter</hi> might have been translated, <hi>whether to the King as to the higher;</hi> yet there is this difference, that whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> useth the word in the Plural number, St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath it in the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and with application to the King.</p>
                  <p>It will be said, Though St. <hi>Peter</hi> make the King Supreme, yet he tells us the King is a <hi>humane Ordinance,</hi> or a Creature of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's. But it is answered, Kings may be called an humane Ordinance, for being made of one of the People, and not by the People; and so are humane in Regard of their <hi>material</hi> Cause, not of their <hi>efficient.</hi> If St. <hi>Peter</hi> had meant that Kings had been made by the People, he must also have meant that Governours had been made by the People, for he calls the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours as well an Ordinance of Man, as the King; for his woods are, <hi>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be to the King as Supreme or whether it be to Governours: but</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> sheweth, that Governours are not made by the People; for he saith, <hi>they that are sent by Him</hi> (not by them) <hi>for the punishment</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104419:61"/>
                     <hi>of Evil doers:</hi> so that the Governours are sent by the King, and not by the People: some would have <hi>sent by him,</hi> to be <hi>sent by God;</hi> but the Relative must be referr'd to the next Antecedent, which is the King, and not God. Besides, if Governours be sent by God, and Kings by the People, then Governours would be Supreme, which is contrary to Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> Doctrine; and it will follow, that the People have not the power of choosing Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters to Govern, if Governours must be sent of God.</p>
                  <p>The safest sense of Saint <hi>Peter's</hi> words is, <hi>Submit your selves to all Humane Laws, whether made by the King, or by his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Governours.</hi> So the King may be called a Humane Ordinance, as being all one with a <hi>Speaking Law:</hi> the word in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal is, <hi>Be subject to every humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> it is more proper to call a Law made by a King a creation of an Ordinance, than the Peoples choosing or declaring of a King, a Creation of him.</p>
                  <p>But take the words in what sense soever you will, it is most evident, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in this place, takes no notice of any Government or Governours, but of a King, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours sent by him, but not by the People.

his <hi>Oligarchy</hi> would not be for the Benefit of a few, and those the best men; for they cannot be the best men, that seek onely their private Profit. In this Chapter, the mind of <hi>Aristotle</hi> about the several kinds of Government, is clearliest delivered, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation of all his Books of Politiques, it is the more necessary to make a curious Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these his Doctrines. In the first place, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Government of <hi>one man,</hi> or of a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and that is a perfect Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Monarchy, <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth us the beginning of it; for, saith he, the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus he deduced the Original of Government from the Power of the Fatherhood, not from the Election of the People.

                  <p>Lastly, in the third Book of his <hi>Politiques,</hi> and the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter concerning Monarchy, he saith, that <note n="d" place="margin">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>A perfect Kingdom is that wherein the King rules all things according to his own Will; for he that is called a King accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law makes no kind of Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he saith there is a Government of a <hi>few men,</hi> but doth not tell us how many those few men may, or must be; only he saith they must be more than one man, but how many, that he leaves uncertain.</p>
                  <p>This perfect Government of a few, any man would think <hi>Aristotle</hi> should have called an <hi>Oligarchy,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But not to insist longer on the name of this name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Form of Government, let Inquiry be made into the thing it self, that we may know what <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith is the <hi>Government of many, or of a Multitude, for the Common Good.</hi>

                     <hi>in ancient times among some men, no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Workman did partake of the Government, untill the worst of Democraties were brought in.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again <hi>Aristotle</hi> will have his best popular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consist of <hi>Free men,</hi> and accounts the poorer sort of People to be free men; how then will he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude poor Artificers, who work for the Publick, from participating of the Government?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:104419:67"/>Further it is observable in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Signification of the <hi>Greek</hi> names, the Government of a Multitude may be termed an <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy</hi> if they be rich, and the Rule of a few a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratie</hi> if they be poor and free.</p>
                  <p>After much Incertainty of the Nature of this Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique Government, which wants a name; <hi>Aristotle</hi> at last resolves that this general Commonweal or <hi>Politia</hi> is compounded of a <hi>Democratie and Oligarchy;</hi> for, <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>to speak plainly, a Polity is a Mixture of a Democratie and an Oligarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is, one perfect Form is made of two imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ones; this is rather a confounding than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of Government, to patch it up of two corrupt ones, by appointing an <hi>Oligarchical Penalty</hi> for the rich Magistrates that are chosen <hi>by Election,</hi> and a <hi>Democratical Fee</hi> for the poor Magistrates that are chosen <hi>by Lot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly it is to be noted, That <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to name any one City or Commonweal in the World, where ever there was any such Government as he calls a <hi>Politie:</hi> for him to reckon it for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Form of Government, and of such Excellency as to carry the Name from all other, and yet never to have been extant in the World, may seem a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and a man may be excused for doubting, or for denying any such Form to be possible in Nature, if it cannot be made manifest what it is, nor when, nor where it ever was.</p>
                  <p>In Conclusion, since <hi>Aristotle</hi> reckons but three kinds of perfect Government, which are, First, <hi>a</hi>

As for an <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> or a <hi>Policy</hi> which he mentions, they are only Speculative Notions, or Airy Names, invented to delude the World, and to perswade the People, that under those quaint Terms, there might be found some subtile Government, which might at least equal, if not excell <hi>Monarchy:</hi> And the Inventers of those fine Names were all but Rebels to <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> by <hi>Aristotles</hi> confession, where he saith, <hi>the first Commonweals of</hi> Greece <hi>after Kings were left, were made of those that waged War.</hi> l. 4. c. 13.</p>

seek in describing his imperfect Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well <hi>Oligarchies</hi> as <hi>Democracies,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is driven to invent several forts of them, and to confound himself with Subdivisions: we will alledge some of his words. <hi>The cause why there be many kinds of Commonweals is, for that there are many parts of every City. Sometimes all these parts are in a Commonweal, sometimes more of them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fewer: whence it is manifest, that there are many Commonweals differing from each other in kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the parts of them differ after the same manner. For a Commonweal is the Order of Magistrates distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, either according to the Power of them that an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>

It is therefore necessary, that then be so many Commonweals as there are Orders, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the excellencies and differences of Parts. But it seemeth principally there are but two chief kinds of Commonweals; the</hi> Democracy <hi>and the</hi> Oligarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>for they make the</hi> Aristocracy <hi>a branch of</hi> Oligarchy, <hi>as if it were a kind of</hi> Oligarchy; <hi>and that other which is properly a</hi> Policy, <hi>to be a branch of</hi> Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy. <hi>So they are wont to esteem of Commonweales, but it is both truer and better; that there being two right Forms, or one, that all the other be transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Here we find <hi>Aristotle</hi> of several minds, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he is for many Commonweales, sometimes for two, or sometimes for one. As for his many Commonweals, if he allow them according to the several parts of a City, he may as well make three thousand kinds of Commonweals, as three: if two Artificers and three Souldiers should govern, that should be one kind of Commonweal: if four Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104419:69"/>
and five Merchants, that would be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sort; or six Taylors, and ten Carpenters, a third sort, or a dozen Saylors, and a dozen Porters, a fourth; and so in <hi>infinitum,</hi> for <hi>Aristotle</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved how many parts to make of a City, or how many Combinations of those Parts; and therefore in his Reckoning of them, he differs from himself, sometimes makes more, sometimes fewer Parts: and oft concluding at the end of his Accompt with <hi>et caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's:</hi> and confessing that one and the same man may act several Parts; as he that is a Souldier, may be a a Husbandman &amp; an Artificer: and in his fourth Book and fourth Chapter, he seems to reckon up eight parts of a City, but in the Tale of them, he misses or forgets the sixth. 1.

                  <p>Though <hi>Aristotle</hi> allow so many several Forms of corrupted Governments; yet he insists upon no one Form of all those that he can define or describe, in such sort, that he is able to say that any one City in all <hi>Greece</hi> was governed just according to such a Form; his diligence is only to make as many Forms as the giddy or inconstant Humour of a City could happen upon; he freely gives the People Liberty to invent as many Kinds of Government as they please, provided he may have Liberty to find Fault with every one of them; it proved an easier Work for him to find Fault with every Form, then to tell how to amend any one of them; he found so many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in all sorts of Commonweals, that he could not hold from reproving them before ever he tells us what a Commonweal is, or how many sorts there are; and to this Purpose he spends his whole second Book in setting out, and correcting the chief Commonweals of <hi>Greece,</hi> and among others the <hi>Lacedemonian, the Cretan,</hi> and <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Commonweals; which three he esteems to be much alike, and better than any other, yet he spares not to lay open their Imperfections, and doth the like to the <hi>Athenian;</hi> wherein he breaks the Rule of Method, by delivering the Faults of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, before he teach us what a Commonweal is; for in his first Book, he speaks only of the Parts of which a City, or a Commonweal is made, but tells <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>This one Benefit I have found by Reading <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> that his Books of <hi>Politiques</hi> serve for an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Commentary upon that Text of Scripture, which saith, <hi>In those dayes there was no King in Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el; every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</hi> For he grants a liberty in every City, for any man, or multitude of men, either by Cunning, or Force, to set up what Government they please; and he will allow some name or other of a Commonweal, which in effect is to allow every man to do what he lists, if he be able; hence it is, that by the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Aristotle, the first Commonweals in</hi> Greece, <hi>after Kings were given over, were made of those that waged War;</hi> those several kinds of Commonweals, were all summed up into the government of an Army; for (<hi>a) it is,</hi> saith<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> for the Incertainty, and Contrariety in him about the sorts of Government, if we consider him as a Heathen; for it is not possible for the Wit of man to search out the first Grounds or Principles of Government, (which necessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the original of Property) except he know that at the Creation one man alone was made, to whom the Dominion of all things was given, and from whom all men derive their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. This Point can be learnt only from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: as for the imaginary Contract of People, it is a Fancy not improbable only, but impossible, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a <hi>multitude of men at first had sprung out,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 2. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>and were engendred of the Earth, which Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle knows not whether he may believe, or no:</hi> If Justice (which is to give every man his Due) be the End of Government, there must necessarily be a Rule to know how any man at first came to have a Right to any thing to have it truly called his. This is a Point <hi>Aristotle</hi> disputes not; nor so much as ever dreamt of an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract among People: he looked no farther in every City, than to a Scambling among the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, whereby every one snatcht what he could get: so that a violent Possession was the first, and best Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that he knew.</p>
                  <p>The main Distinction of <hi>Aristotle</hi> touching perfect or Right Forms of Government from those that are imperfect or corrupt, consists solely in this Point, that where the Profit of the governed is respected, there is a right Government, but where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Governours is regarded, there is a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or Transgression of Government.

No Example can be shewed of any such Government that ever was in the World, as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> describes a <hi>Tyranny</hi> to be; for under the worst of Kings, though many particular men have unjustly suffered, yet the Multitude, or the People in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have found Benefit and Profit by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>It being apparent that the different kinds of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> arise onely from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the number of Governours, whether <hi>one, a few, or many:</hi> there may be as many several Forms of Governments as there be several Numbers, which are infinite; so that not onely the several Parts of a City or Commonweal, but also the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Numbers of such Parts may cause multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Forms of Government by <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

Thus in a Commonweal, one part of the Publick Affairs shall be ordered by one Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and another part by another Form, and a third part by a third Form, and so <hi>in infinitum.</hi> How can that have the Denomination of a Form of Government, which lasts but for a moment onely, about one fraction of Business? for in the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, as it were in the Twinkling of an eye, while their Vote lasteth, the Government must begin and end.</p>

                  <p>It is a false and improper Speech to say that a whole Multitude, Senate, Councel, or any Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude whatsoever doth govern where the major part only rules; because many of the Multitude that are so assembled, are so far from having any part in the Government, that they themselves are governed against and contrary to their Wills; there being in all Government various and different Debates and Consultations, it comes to pass oft-times, that the major part in every Assembly, differs according to the several Humours or Fancies of men; those who agree in one Mind, in one Point, are of different Opinions in another; every Change of Business, or new Matter begets a new major part, and is a Change both of the Government and Governours; the Difference in the Number, or in the Qualities of the Persons that govern, is the only thing that causes different Governments, according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who divides his Kinds of Government to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one, a few, or many. As amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> their Tribunitial Laws had several Titles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Names of those Tribunes of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that preferr'd and made them. So in other Governments, the Body of their Acts and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104419:74"/>
is composed of a Multitude of momentary Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, who by the Strength and Power of their Parties or Factions are still under a kind of a civil War, fighting and scratching for the legislative miscellany, or medly of several Governments. If we consider each Government according to the nob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Part of which it is composed, it is nothing else but a Monarchy of Monothelites, or of many men of one Will, most commonly in one Point only: but if we regard only the baser part, or Bodies of such Persons as govern, there is an interrupted Succession of a Multitude of short-lived Governments, with as many Intervalls of Anarchy; so that no man can say at any time, that he is under any Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for in a shorter time than the word can be spoken, every Government is begun and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Furthermore in all Assemblies, of what Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity soever they be, whether <hi>Aristocratical</hi> or <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical,</hi> as they call them, they all agree in this one Point, to give that honourable Regard to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, that they do interpret the major, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing part in every Assembly to be but as one man, and so do feign to themselves a kind of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
                  <p>Though there be neither Precept nor Practice in Scripture, nor yet any Reason alledged by <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> for any Form of Government, but only Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; yet it is said that it is evident to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sense, that of old time <hi>Rome,</hi> and in this present Age <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a Form of Government different from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: Hereunto it may be answered, That a People may live together in Society, and help one another; and yet not be under any Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104419:74"/>
as we see Herds of Cattel do, and yet we may not say they live under Government. For Government is not a Society only to live, but to live well and vertuously. This is acknowledged by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who teacheth that <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <p>Now there be two things principally required to a blessed and honest life: <hi>Religion towards God,</hi> and <hi>Peace towards men:</hi> that is, <hi>a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godliness and Honesty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. Here then will be the Question, Whether Godliness and Peace can be found under any Government but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> or whether <hi>Rome, Venice,</hi> or the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> did enjoy these under any popular Government. In these two Points, let us first briefly examine the Roman Government, which is thought to have been the most glorious.</p>
                  <p>For Religion, we find presently after the Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the City by <hi>Romulus,</hi> the next King, <hi>Numa,</hi> most devoutly established a Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Kingdom with the Service of the Gods; he forbad the Romans to make any Images of God, which Law lasted and was observed 170 Years, there being in all that time no Image or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of God, in any Temple or Chappel of <hi>Rome;</hi> also he erected the Pontifical Colledge, and was himself the first Bishop or <hi>Pontifex;</hi> These Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104419:75"/>
were to render no Account either to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Commonalty. They determined all Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Religion, as well between Priests as between private men: They punished inferiour Priests, if they either added or detracted from the established Rites, or Ceremonies, or brought in any new thing into Religion. The chief Bishop, <hi>Pontif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> Maximus,</hi> taught every man how to honour and serve the Gods. This Care had Monarchy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>But after the Expulsion of Kings, we do not find during the Power of the People, any one Law made for the Benefit or Exercise of Religion: there be two Tribunitian Laws concerning Religion, but they are meerly for the Benefit of the Power of the People, and not of Religion. <hi>L. Papirius,</hi> a Tribune, made a Law called <hi>Lex Papiria,</hi> that it <hi>should not be lawful for any to consecrate either Houses, Grounds, Altars, or any other things without the Determinatin of the People. Domitius Aenobarbus</hi> another Tribune enacted a Law called <hi>Domitia Lex,</hi> that <hi>the Pontifical Colledge should not, as they were wont, admit whom they would into the Order of Priesthood, but it should be in the Power of the People;</hi> and because it was contrary to their Religion, that Church-Dignities should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed by the common People; hence for very Shame he ordained, that the lesser part of the People, namely seventeen Tribes should elect whom they thought fit, and afterwards the Party elected should have his Confirmation or admission from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: thus by a Committee of seven Tribes taken out of thirty five, the ancient Form of Religion was alter'd and reduced to the Power of the lesser part of the People. This was the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104419:75"/>
great Care of the People to bring Ordination and Consecration to the Laity.</p>
                  <p>The Religion in <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> is sufficiently known, much need not be said of them: they admirably agree under a seeming contrariety; it is commonly said, that one of them hath all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, and the other no Religion; the Atheist of <hi>Venice</hi> may shake hands with the Sectary of <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi> This is the Liberty that a popular estate can brag of, every man may be of any Religion, or no Religion, if he please; their main Devotion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised only in opposing and suppressing Monarchy. They both agree to exclude the Clergy from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Government, whereas in all Monarchies both before the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and under it, and ever since: all Barbarians, Graecians, Romans, Infidels, Turks, and Indians, have with one Consent given such Respect and Reverence to their Priests, as to trust them with their Laws; and in this our Nation, the first Priests we read of before Christianity, were the <hi>Druides,</hi> who as <hi>Caesar</hi> saith, <hi>decided and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Controversies, in Murder, in Case of Inheritance, of Bounds of Lands, as they in their Discretion judged meet; they grant Rewards and Punishments.</hi> It is a Wonder to see what high Respect even the great <hi>Turk</hi> giveth to his <hi>Mufti,</hi> or chief Bishop, so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is Religion to strengthen and direct Laws.</p>
                  <p>To consider of the Point of Peace, It is well known, that no People ever enjoyed it without Monarchy. <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>the Lacedemonians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served themselves by Warring; and after they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to themselves the Empire, then were they presently undone, for that they could not live at Rest, nor do any better Exercise, than the Exercise of War,</hi> l. 2. c. 7.

After <hi>Rome</hi> had expelled Kings, it was in perpetual War, till the time of the Emperours: once only was the Temple of <hi>Ianus</hi> shut, after the end of the first <hi>Punique War,</hi> but not so long as for one year, but for some Moneths.

                     </hi> proves to have been most unjustly undertaken by the <hi>Romans,</hi> in confederating with the <hi>Mamertines,</hi> and Aiding of Rebels, under the Title of protecting their Confederates; whereas Kings many times may have just Cause of War, for recovering and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Rights to such Dominions as fall to them by Inheritance or Marriage; a Popular Estate, that can neither marry, nor be Heir to another, can have no such Title to a War in a Foreign Kingdom; and to speak the Truth, if it be rightly considered, the whole time of the Popularity of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> were no other than the only prosperous and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thieves, and Robbers of the World.</p>
                  <p>If we look more narrowly into the Roman Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it will appear, that in that very Age, wherein <hi>Rome</hi> was most victorious, and seemed to be most popular, she owed most of her Glory to an apparent kind of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> For it was the Kingh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Power of the <hi>Consuls, who</hi> (as <hi>Livy</hi> saith) <hi>had the same Royal Iurisdiction, or absolute Power that the Kings had, not any whit diminished or abated, and held all the same Regal Ensignes of supreme Dignity,</hi> which helpt <hi>Rome</hi> to all her Conquests: whiles the Tribunes of the People were strugling at home with the Senate about Election of Magistrates, enacting of Laws, and calling to Account, or such other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Affairs, the Kingly Consuls gained all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories abroad: Thus <hi>Rome</hi> at one and the same time was broken and distracted into two Shewes of Government; the Popular, which served only to raise Seditions and Discords within the Walls, whilest the Regal atchieved the Conquests of Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations and Kingdomes. <hi>Rome</hi> was so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Benefit and Necessity of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that in her most desperate Condition and Danger, when all other Hopes failed her, she had still Resort to the Creation of a Dictator, who for the time was an absolute King; and from whom no Appeal to the People was granted, which is the royallest Evidence for <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the World; for they who were drawn to swear, they would suffer no King of <hi>Rome,</hi> found no Security but in Perjury, and breaking their Oath by admitting the Kingly Power in spight of their Teeth, under a new name of a Dictator or Consul: a just Reward for their wanton expelling their King for no other Crime they could pretend but Pride, which is most tolerable in a King of all men: and yet we find no particular Point of Pride charged upon him, but that he enjoyned the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to labour in cleansing, and casting of Ditches, and paving their Sinks: an Act both for the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Ornament of the City, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable

in the King: But the Citizens of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had been Conquerours of all Nations round about them, could not endure of Warriers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Quarriers, and Day-labourers. Whereas it is said, that <hi>Tarquin</hi> was expelled for the Rape com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by his Son on <hi>Lucrece;</hi> it is unjust to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Father for the Crime of his Son; it had been fit to have petitioned the Father for the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of the Offender: The Fact of young <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin</hi> cannot be excused, yet without wrong to the Reputation of so chaste a Lady as <hi>Lucrece</hi> is reputed to be, it may be said, she had a greater Desire to be thought chaste, than to be chaste; she might have died untouched, and unspotted in her Body, if she had not been afraid to be slandered for Inchastity; both <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus,</hi> and <hi>Livie,</hi> who both are her Friends, so tell the Tale of her, as if she had chosen rather to be a Whore, than to be thought a Whore. To say Truth, we find no other Cause of the Expulsion of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> than the Wantonness, and Licentiousness of the People of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is further to be considered in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, that all the time between their Kings, and their Emperours, there lasted a continued strife, between the Nobility and Commons, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by Degrees the Commons prevailed at last, so to weaken the Authority of the Consuls and Senate, that even the last sparks of <hi>Monarchy</hi> were in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner extinguished, and then instantly began the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, which lasted till the Regal Power was quickly brought home, and setled in <hi>Monarchy.</hi> So long as the Power of the Senate stood good for the Election of Consuls, the Regal Power was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104419:77"/>
in them, for the Senate had their first Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from <hi>Monarchy:</hi> It is worth the noting, that in all those places that have seemed to be most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, that weak Degree of Government, that hath been exercised among them, hath been founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and been beholden unto <hi>Monarchical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, both for the Power of assembling, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of consulting: for the entire and gross Body of any People, is such an unweildy and diffused thing as is not capable of uniting, or congregating, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberating in an entire Lump, but in broken Parts, which at first were regulated by <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore it is observable, that <hi>Rome</hi> in her chief Popularity, was oft beholden for her Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Monarchical Power of the Father over the Children: by means of this Fatherly Power, saith <hi>Bodin,</hi> the Romans flourished in all Honour and Vertue, and oftentimes was their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal thereby delivered from most imminent Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when the Fathers drew out of the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, their Sons being Tribunes publishing Laws tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sedition. Amongst others <hi>Cassius</hi> threw his Son headlong out of the Consistory, publishing the Law <hi>Agraria</hi> (for the Division of Lands) in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof of the People, and after by his own private Judgment put him to Death, the Magistrates, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeants, and People standing thereat astonied, and not daring to withstand his Fatherly Authority, although they would with all their Power have had that Law for Division of Lands; which is sufficient Proof, this Power of the Father not only to have been sacred and inviolable, but also to have been lawful for him, either by Right or Wrong to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104419:78"/>
dispose of the Life and Death of his Children, even contrary to the Will of the Magistrates and People.</p>
                  <p>It is generally believed that the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the Expulsion of Kings, was popular; <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> endeavours to prove it, but I am not satisfied with his Arguments, and though it will be thought a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, yet I must maintain, it was never truly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular.</p>
                  <p>First it is difficult to agree, what a popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is, <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith it is where <hi>Many or a Multitude do rule;</hi> he doth not say where <hi>the People,</hi> or the <hi>major part of the People,</hi> or <hi>the Representors of the People govern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bodin</hi> affirms <hi>if all the People be interessed in the Government, it is a Popular Estate,</hi> Lib. 2. c. 1. but after in the same Chapter he resolves, that <hi>it is a Popular Estate, when all the People, or the greater part thereof hath the Sovereignty,</hi> and he puts the Case that if there be threescore thousand Citizens, and forty thousand of them have the Sovereignty, and twenty thousand be excluded, it shall be called a popular Estate: But I must tell him, though fifty nine thousand, nine hundred, ninety nine of them govern, yet it is no popular Estate, for if but one man be excluded, the same reason that excludes that one man, may exclude many hundreds, and many thousands, yea, and the major part it self; if it be admitted, that the People are or ever were free by Nature, and not to be governed, but by their own Consent, it is most unjust to exclude any one man from his Right in Government; and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the People so unnatural, as at the first to have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104419:78"/>
all consented to give away their Right to a major part, (as if they had Liberty given them only to give away, and not to use it themselves) is not onely improbable, but impossible; for the whole People is a thing so uncertain and changeable, that it alters every moment, so that it is necessary to ask of every Infant so soon as it is born its Consent to Government, if you will ever have the Consent of the whole People.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if the Arbitrary Tryal by a Jury of twelve men, be a thing of that admirable Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Justice as is commonly believed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Negative Voice</hi> of every single Person is preserved, so that the dissent of any of the twelve frustrates the whole Judgment: How much more ought the natural freedom of each man be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, by allowing him his <hi>Negative</hi> Voice, which is but a continuing him in that estate, wherein, it is confessed, Nature at first placed him; Justice requires that no one Law should bind all, except all consent to it, there is nothing more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and contrary to Nature, than to allow a major part, or any other greater part less than the whole to bind all the People.</p>
                  <p>The next difficulty to discovering what a Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Estate is, is to find out where the Supreme Power in the <hi>Roman</hi> Government rested; it is <hi>Bodin</hi>'s opinion, that <hi>in the</hi> Roman <hi>state the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was in the Magistrates, the Authority and Counsel in the Senate, but the Sovereign Power and Majesty in the People.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 1. So in his first Book his Doctrine is, that <hi>the ancient</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>said, Imperium in Magistratibus, Authoritatem</hi>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:104419:79"/>
                     <hi>in Senatu, Potestatem in plebe, Majestatem in Populi jure esse dicebant.</hi> These four words <hi>Command, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Power,</hi> and <hi>Majesty</hi> signifie ordinarily, one and the same thing, to wit, the Sovereignty, or supreme Power, I cannot find that <hi>Bodin</hi> knows how to distinguish them; for they were not distinct Faculties placed in several Subjects, but one and the same thing diversly qualified, for <hi>Imperium, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, Potestas,</hi> and <hi>Majestas</hi> were all originally in the Consuls; although for the greater shew the Consuls would have the Opinion, and Consent of the Senate who were never called together, nor had their Advice asked, but when and in what Points only it pleased the Consuls to propound: so that properly <hi>Senatus consultum</hi> was only a Decree of the Consuls, with the Advice of the Senators: And so likewise the Consuls, when they had a mind to have the Countenance of an ampler Councel, they assembled the <hi>Centuries,</hi> who were reckoned as the whole People, and were never to be assembled, but when the Consuls thought fit to propound some Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of great weight unto them; so that <hi>jussus popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> the Command of the People which <hi>Bodin</hi> so much magnifies, was properly <hi>jussus Consulum,</hi> the Command of the Consuls, by the Advice or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Assembly of the Centuries, who were a Body composed of the Senators, and the rest of the Patritians, Knights, and Gentlemen, or whole No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility together with the Commons: for the same men who had Voices in Senate, had also their Votes allowed in the Assembly of the Centuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to their several Capacities.</p>
                  <p>It may further appear, that the Roman Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104419:79"/>
was never truly popular, for that in her greatest Show of Popularity, there were to be found above ten Servants for every Citizen or Freeman, and of those Servants, not one of them was allowed any Place, or Voice in Government: If it be said that the <hi>Roman</hi> Servants were Slaves taken in War, and therefore not fit to be Freemen; to this it may be answered, that if the Opinion of our modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians be good, which holds that <hi>all men are born Free by Nature,</hi> or if but the Opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> be found, who saith that <hi>by Nature some men are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and some are Masters,</hi> then it may be unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or unjust to make all Prisoners in War Servants or (as they are now called) <hi>Slaves,</hi> a Term not used in the Popular Governments, either of <hi>Rome or Greece;</hi> for in both Languages, the usual word that doth answer to our late Term of <hi>Slave,</hi> is but <hi>Servus</hi> in Latin, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Greek. Besides, if the Wars of the <hi>Romans,</hi> by which they gained so many Servants were unjust, as I take all offensive War to be without a special Commission from God, and as I believe all the Roman Wars were, that were made for the Enlargement of their Empire, then we may conclude, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were the notablest Plagiaries, or Men-stealers in the World.</p>
                  <p>But to allow the lesser part of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> who called themselves Citizens, to have had a just Right to exclude all Servants from being a part of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us enquire whether the major part of those, whom they allowed to be Citizens, had the Government of <hi>Rome;</hi> whereby we may discover easily how notoriously the poorer and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104419:80"/>
greater part of the Citizens were guld of their Share in Government; There were two famous manners of their assembling the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> the first was by <hi>Classes,</hi> as they called them, which were divided into <hi>Centuries;</hi> the second was by <hi>Tribes, or Wards;</hi> the former of these was a Ranking of the People, according to their Abilities or Wealth; the latter according to the Place or Ward, wherein every Citizen dwelt: In the Assemblies of neither of these, had the major part of the People the Power of Government, as may thus be made appear.</p>
                  <p>First, for the Assembly of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> there were six Degrees or <hi>Classes</hi> of men according to their Wealth; the first <hi>Classis</hi> was of the richest men in <hi>Rome,</hi> none whereof were under 200 <hi>l.</hi> in Value: The Valuation of the second Classis was not under fourscore Pounds; and so the 3. the 4. and the fifth Classis were each a Degree one under another. The sixth Classis contained the poorer sort, and all the Rabble. These six Classes were subdivided into Hundreds, or Centuries.</p>

                  <p>The Classes, and Centuries being thus ordered when the Assembly came to give their Votes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104419:80"/>
they did not give their Voices by the Poll, which is the true popular way: but each Century Voted by it self, each Century having one Voice, the major part of the Centuries carried the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Now there being fourscore and eighteen Centuries in the first Classis, in which all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricians, Senators, Noblemen, Knights, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Rome,</hi> were inrolled, being more in Number, and above half the Centuries, must needs have the Government, if they agreed all together in their Votes, because they Voted first, for when 97 Centuries had agreed in their Votes, the other Centuries of the inferiour Classis, were never called to Vote; thus the Nobles, and richer men who were but few in Comparison of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People did bear the chief Sway, because all the poorer sort, or proletarian Rabble, were clap'd into the sixth Classis, which in reckoning were allowed but the single Voice of one Century, which never came to Voting: whereas in Number they did far exceed all the five other Classes or Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and if they had been allowed the Liberty of other Citizens, they might have been justly num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred for a thousand Centuries, or Voices in the Assembly; This Device of packing so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands into one Century, did exclude far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part of the People from having a part in the Government.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the Assembly of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> by Tribes, it must be considered, that the Tribes did not give their Voices by the Poll altogether, which is the true way of popular Voting, but each Tribe or Ward did Vote by it self, and the Votes of the major part (not of the People but) of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104419:81"/>
Tribes did sway the Government, the Tribes being unequal, as all Divisions by Wards usually are, because the Number of the People of one Tribe, is not just the same with the Number of the People of each other Tribe; whence it followed, that the major Number of the Tribes might possibly be the minor Number of the People, which is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of the Power of the major Part of the People.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereunto, that the Nobility of <hi>Rome</hi> were excluded from being present at the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Tribes; and so the most considerable part of the People was wanting, therefore it could not be the Voices of the major part of the People, where a great part of the People were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no Voices at all, for it must be the major part of the whole, and not of a Part of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that must denominate a popular Government.</p>
                  <p>Moreover it must be noted, that the Assembly of the Tribes was not originally the Power of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> for it was almost 40 years after the Rejection of Kings before an Assembly of Tribes were thought on, or spoken of; for it was the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the People by Centuries, that agreed to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion of Kings, &amp; creating of Consuls in their Room, also the Famous Laws of the twelve Tables were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the Assembly of the Centuries. This As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly by Centuries, as it was more Ancient, than that by Tribes; so it was more truly popular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all the Nobility, as well as the Commons, had Voices in it: The Assembly by Tribes, was pretended at first, only to elect Tribunes of the People, and other inferiour Magistrates, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of lesser Crimes that were not Capital, but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:104419:81"/>
only finable; and to decree that Peace should be made; but they did not meddle with denouncing War to be made, for that high Point did belong on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Assembly of the Centuries; and so also did the judging of Treason, and other Capital Crimes. The Difference between the Assembly of the Tribes, and of the Centuries, is very material; for though it be commonly thought, that either of these two Assemblies were esteemed to be the People, yet in Reality it was not so, for the Assembly of the Centuries only could be said to be the People, because all the Nobility were included in it as well as the Commons, whereas they were excluded out of the Assembly of the Tribes; and yet in Effect, the Assembly of the Centuries was but as the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Lords, or Nobles only, because the lesser, and richer part of the People had the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, as the Assembly of the Tribes was, but the Commons only.</p>
                  <p>In maintenance of the popular Government of <hi>Rome, Bodin</hi> objects, that there could be no regal Power in the two Consuls, who could neither make Law, nor Peace, nor War. The Answer is, though there were two Consuls, yet but one of them had the Regality; for they governed by Turns, one Consul one Moneth, and the other Consul ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moneth; or the first one day, and the second another day. That the Consuls could make no Laws is false, it is plain by <hi>Livy,</hi> that they had the Power to make Laws, or War, and did execute that Power, though they were often hindered by the Tribunes of the People; not for that the Power of making Laws or War, was ever taken away from the Consuls, or communicated to the Tribunes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104419:82"/>
but onely the Exercise of the Consular Power was suspended by a seeming humble way of <hi>intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Tribunes; The Consuls by their first Institution had a lawful Right to do those things, which yet they would not do by reason of the shortness of their Reigns, but chose rather to countenance their actions with the title of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Senate (who were their private Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel) yea, and sometimes with the Decree of the Assembly of the Centuries (who were their Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Counsel) for both the Assembling of the Senate, and of the Centuries, was at the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Consuls, and nothing was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in either of them, but at the Will of the Consuls: which argues a Sovereignty in them over the Senate and Centuries; the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> was like the House of Lords, the Assembly of the Tribes resembled the House of Commons, but the Assembling of the <hi>Centuries,</hi> was a Body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of Lords and Commons united to Vote to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>The Tribunes of the People bore all the Sway among the Tribes, they called them together when they pleased, without any Order, whereas the Centuries were never Assembled without Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and Religious observation of the Birds by the Augurs, and by the Approbation of the Senate, and therefore were said to be <hi>auspicata,</hi> and <hi>ex authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Patrum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These things considered, it appears, that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of the Centuries was the only legitimate, and great Meeting of the People of <hi>Rome:</hi> as for any Assembling, or Electing of any Trustees, or Representors of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> in nature of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:104419:82"/>
the modern Parliaments, it was not in Use, or ever known in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Above two hundred and twenty years after the expulsion of Kings, a sullen humour took the Commons of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they would needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the City to <hi>Ianiculum,</hi> on the other side of <hi>Tybur,</hi> they would not be brought back into the City, until a Law was made, That a <hi>Plebisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or a Decree of the Commons might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for a Law; this Law was made by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator <hi>Hortensius,</hi> to quiet the Sedition, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Legislative Power to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in such inferiour matters only, as by Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Usurpation had been practised by the Commons. I find not that they desired an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the Points which were the Object of their Power, but of the Persons, or Nobility that should be subject to their Decrees: the great Power of making War, of creating the greater Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, of judging in Capital Crimes, remained in the Consuls, with the Senate, and Assembly of the Centuries.</p>
                  <p>For further manifestation of the broken and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> it is fit to consider the original Power of the Consuls, and of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the Commons, who are ordinarily called the Tribunes of the People.</p>
                  <p>First, it is undeniable, that upon the expulsion of Kings, Kingly power was not taken away, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made Annual and changeable between two Consuls; who in their Turns, and by course had the Sovereignty, and all Regal power; this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plainly in <hi>Livy,</hi> who tells us, that <hi>Valerius Publicola</hi> being Consul, he himself alone ordained
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:104419:83"/>
a Law, and then assembled a general Session.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Turemillus Arsa</hi> inveighed and complained against <hi>the Consul's Government, as being so absolute, and in Name only less odious than that of Kings, but in Fact more cruel; for instead of one Lord the City had receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed twain, having Authority beyond all Measure, unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and infinite. Sextius</hi> and <hi>Licinus</hi> complain, that <hi>there would never be any indifferent Course, so long as the Nobles kept the Sovereign Place of Command, and the Sword to strike, whiles the poor Commons have only the Buckler;</hi> their Conclusion was, that <hi>it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that the Commons bear the Office of Consuls too, for that were a Fortress of their Liberty, from that day forward, shall the Commons be Partakers of those things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein the Nobles now surpass them, namely Sovereign Rule and Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Law of the twelve Tables affirms, <hi>Regio imperio duo sunto, iique Consules appellantor.</hi> Let <hi>two have regal Power, and let them be called Consuls: also the</hi> Judgment of <hi>Livy</hi> is, that <hi>the Sovereign Power was translated from Consuls to Decemvirs, as before from Kings to Consuls.</hi> These are proofs sufficient to shew the Royal Power of the Consuls.</p>
                  <p>About sixteen years after the first Creation of Consuls, the Commons finding themselves much run into Debt, by wasting their Estates in following the Wars; and so becoming, as they thought, oppressed by Usury, and cast into Prison by the Judgment, and Sentence of the Consuls, they grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously complained of Usury, and of the Power of the Consuls, and by Sedition prevailed, and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Leave to choose among themselves Magistrates called Tribunes of the People, who by their <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> might preserve the Commons from being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:104419:83"/>
and suffering Wrong from the Consuls: and it was further agreed, that the Persons of those Tribunes should be sacred, and not to be touched by any. By means of this Immunity of the Bodies of the Tribunes from all Arrests or other Violence, they grew in time by Degrees to such Boldness, that by stopping the legal Proceedings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls (when they pleased to intercede) they raised such an Anarchy oft times in Government, that they themselves might act, and take upon them, what Power soever they pleased (though it belonged not to them.) This Gallantry of the Tribunes was the Cause, that the Commons of <hi>Rome,</hi> who were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Pretenders to Liberty, and the great Masters of this part of Politiques, were thought the only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Preservers, and Keepers of the Liberty of <hi>Rome.</hi> And to do them right, it must be confessed, they were the only men that truly understood the Rights of a <hi>Negative Voice;</hi> if we will allow every man to be naturally free till they give their Consent to be bound, we must allow every particular Person a Negative Voice; so that when as all have equal Power, and are as it were fellow-Magistrates or Officers, each man may impeach, or stop his Fellow-Officers in their Proceedings, this is grounded upon the general Reason of all them, which have any thing in Common, where he which forbiddeth, or denyeth, hath most Right; because his Condition in that Case is better than his which commandeth, or moveth to proceed; for every Law or Command, is in it self an Innovation, and a Diminution of some part of popular Liberty; for it is no Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it restrain Liberty; he that by his negative Voice doth forbid or hinder the Proceeding of a new

Law, doth but preserve himself in that Condition of Liberty, wherein Nature hath placed him, and whereof he is in present Possession; the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him thus in Possession being the better, the stronger is his Prohibition, any single man hath a juster Title to his <hi>Negative Voice,</hi> than any Multitude can have to their Affirmative; to say the People are free, and not to be governed, but by their own Consent, and yet to allow a major part to rule the whole, is a plain Contradiction, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of natural Freedom. This the Commons of <hi>Rome</hi> rightly understood, and therefore the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent Power of the Negative Voice of any one Tribune, being able of it self to stay all the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not of the Consuls and Senate only, and other Magistrates, but also of the rest of his fellow-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, made them seem the powerfullest men in all <hi>Rome;</hi> and yet in Truth they had no Power or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction at all, nor were they any Magistrates, nor could they lawfully call any man before them, for they were not appointed for Administration of Justice, but only to oppose the Violence, and Abuse of Magistrates, by interceeding for such as appealed, being unjustly oppressed; for which Purpose at first they sate only without the Door of the Senate, and were not permitted to come within the Doors: this Negative Power of theirs was of Force only to hinder, but not to help the Proceedings in Courts of Justice; to govern, and not to govern the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And though they had no Power to make Laws, yet they took upon them to propound Laws and flattered and humoured the Commons by the <hi>Agrarian</hi> and <hi>Frumentarian</hi> Laws, by the first they divided the Common fields, and conquered Lands
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104419:85"/>
among<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Common People; and by the latter, they afforded them Corn at a cheaper or lower price: by these means these Demagogues or Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the Commons led the Vulgar by the Noses, to allow whatsoever Usurpations they pleased to make in Government.</p>
                  <p>The Royal Power of the Consuls was never ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them by any Law that I hear of, but continued in them all the time of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed popular Government, to the very last, though repined at, and opposed in some particulars by the Commons.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>No-Power,</hi> or <hi>Negative Power</hi> of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, did not long give content to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and therefore they desired, that one of the Consuls might be chosen out of the Commonalty: the eager propounding of this point for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and the diligent opposing of it by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or Senate, argues how much both parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the Sovereign power of a Consul; the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute lasted fourscore years within two: the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes pressing it upon all advantages of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, never gave over till they carried it by strong hand, or stubbornness, hindring all Elections of the <hi>Curule,</hi> or greater Magistrates, for five years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby the Nobles were forced to yield the Commons a Consul's place, or else an <hi>Anarchy</hi> was ready to destroy them all; and yet the Nobility had for a good while allowed the Commons <hi>Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Tribunes with Consular Power,</hi> which, in effect or substance, was all one with having one of the Consuls a Commoner, so that it was the bare Name of a Consul which the Commons so long strived for with the Nobility: In this contention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

Years Consuls were chosen, some years <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Tribunes in such Confusion, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians cannot agree among themselves, what Consuls to assign, or name for each Year, although they have <hi>Capitoline</hi> Tables, <hi>Sicilian</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters, and Kalenders, Fragments of <hi>Capitoline Marbles, linen Books or Records</hi> to help them: a good while the Commons were content with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of having one of the Consuls a Commoner; but about fourscore years after they enjoyed this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, a Desire took them to have it enacted, that a Decree of the Commons called a <hi>plebiscitum</hi> might be observed for a Law, <hi>Hortensius</hi> the Dictator yielded to enact it, thereby to bring back the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Commons, who departed to <hi>Ianiculum</hi> on the other side of <hi>Tybur,</hi> because they were deeply engaged in Debt in regard of long Seditions and Dissensions. The eleventh Book of <hi>Livy,</hi> where this Sedition is set down, is lost; we have only a touch of it it in <hi>Florus</hi> his Epitome, and St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> mentions the Plundring of many Houses by the Commons at their departing: this Sedition was above 220 years after the Expulsion of Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all which time, the People of <hi>Rome</hi> got the Spoil of almost all <hi>Italy,</hi> and the wealth of very many rich Cities: and yet the Commons were in so great Penury, and over whelmed with Debts that they fell to plunder the rich Houses of the Citizens, which sounds not much for the Honour of a popular Government. This communicating of a legislative Power to the Commons, touching Power of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchising Allies, Judgments Penal, and Fines, and those Ordinances that concerned the Good of the Commons called <hi>Plebiscita,</hi> was a dividing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104419:86"/>
of the Supreme Power, and the giving a Share of it to others, as well as to the Consuls, and was in effect to destroy the legislative Power, for to have two Supremes is to have none, because the one may destroy the other, and is quite contrary to the indivisible nature of Sovereignty. The Truth is, the Consuls, having but annual Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were glad for their own Safety, and Ease in Matters of great Importance, and Weight, to call together sometimes the Senate, who were their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Councel, and many times the Centuries of the People, who were their Councel extraordinary, that by their Advice they might countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and strengthen such Actions as were full of Danger and Envy: and thus the Consuls by weakening their original Power brought the Government to Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, civil Dissension, and utter Ruine: so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a thing it is to shew Favour to Common People, who interpret all Graces and Favours for their Rights, and just Liberties: the Consuls fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Advice of the Senate or People, did not take away their Right of Governing no more than Kings lose their Supremacy by taking Advice in Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Not only the Consuls, but also the Pretors and Censors (two great Offices, ordained only for the ease of the Consuls, from whom an Appeal lay to the Consuls) did in many things exercise an arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary or legislative Power in the Absence of the Consuls, they had no Laws to limit them: for many Years after the Creation of Consuls, ten men were sent into <hi>Greece</hi> to choose Laws; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the 12 Tables were confirmed, whatsoever the Pretors, who were but the Consuls Substitutes, did

                  <p>What Peace the Low-Countries have found since their Revolt is visible; it is near about an hundred Years since they set up for themselves, of all which time only twelve years they had a Truce with the Spaniard, yet in the next year, after the Truce was agreed upon, the War of <hi>Iuliers</hi> brake forth, which engaged both Parties; so that upon the matter, they have lived in a continued War, for almost 100 Years: had it not been for the Aid of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they had been long ago swallowed up, when they were glad humbly to offer their new hatch'd Commonweal, and themselves Vassals to the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> after that the French King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. had refused to accept them as his Subjects; That little Truce they had, was almost as costly as a War; they being forced to keep about thirty thousand Souldiers continually in Garrison. Two things they say they first fought about, Religion and Taxes; and they have prevailed it seems in both, for they have gotten all the Religions in Christendome, and pay the greatest Taxes in the World; they pay Tribute half in half for Food, and most necessary things, paying as much for Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute as the price of the thing sold; Excise is paid by all Retailers of Wine, and other Commodities; for each Tun of Beer six Shillings, for each Cow for the Pail two Stivers every week: for Oxen, Horses, Sheep, and other beasts sold in the Market
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104419:87"/>
the twelfth part at least, be they never so oft sold by the year to and fro, the new Master still pays as much: they pay five Stivers for every Bushel of their own Wheat, which they use to grinde in publick Mills: These are the Fruits of the Low-Country War.</p>
                  <p>It will be said that <hi>Venice</hi> is a Commonwealth that enjoys Peace. She indeed of all other States hath enjoyed of late the greatest Peace; but she owes it not to her kind of Government, but to the natural Situation of the City, having such a Banck in the Sea of neer threescore Miles, and such Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes towards the Land, as make her unapproachable by Land, or Sea; to these she is indebted for her Peace at home, and what Peace she hath abroad she buys at a dear Rate; and yet her Peace is little better than a continued War; The City always is in such perpetual Fears, that many besieged Cities are in more Security; a Senator or Gentleman dares not converse with any Stranger in <hi>Venice,</hi> shuns Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, or dares not own it: they are no better than Banditos to all humane Society. Nay, no People in the World live in such Jealousie one of another; hence are their intricate Solemnities, or rather Lotteries in Election of their Magistrates, which in any other Place, would be ridiculous and useless. The Senators or Gentlemen are not only jealous of the Common People, whom they keep disarmed, but of one another; they dare not trust any of their own Citizens to be a Leader of their Army, but are forced to hire, and entertain Foreign Princes for their Generals, excepting their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens from their Wars, and hiring others in their Places; it cannot be said, that People live

At first they lived under a kind of <hi>Oligarchy;</hi> for several Islands had each a Tribune, who all met, and governed in common: but the dangerous Seditions of their Tribunes, put a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity upon them to choose a Duke for Life, who, for many hundreds of years, had an Absolute Power; under whose Government <hi>Venice</hi> flourished most, and got great Victories, and rich Possessions. But by insensible degrees, the Great Councel of the Gentlemen have for many years been lessening the Power of their Dukes, and have at last quite taken it away. It is a strange Errour for any man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Government of <hi>Venice</hi> hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the same that it is now: he that reads but the History of <hi>Venice,</hi> may find for a long time a Sovereign Power in their Dukes: and that for these last two hundred years, since the diminishing of that Power, there hath been no great Victories and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests obtained by that Estate.</p>
                  <p>That which exceeds admiration is, that <hi>Contare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> hath the confidence to affirm the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Venice</hi> to be a mixed Form of <hi>Monarchy, Democratie,</hi> and <hi>Aristocratie:</hi> For, whereas he makes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104419:88"/>
the Duke to have the Person and Shew of a King; he after confesseth, that the Duke can do nothing at all alone, and being joyned with other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, he hath no more Authority than any of them: also the power of the Magistrates is so small, that no one of them, how great soever he be, can determine of any thing of moment, without the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Councel. So that this Duke is but a man dressed up in Purple, a King only in Pomp and Ornament, in Power but a Senator, within the City a Captive, without a Traytor, if he go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Leave. As little reason is there to think a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Estate is to be found in the great Councel of <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>S. P. Q. U.</hi> for it doth not consist of the fortieth part of the People, but only of those they call Patritians or Gentlemen; for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, neither by themselves, nor by any chosen by them for their Representors, are admitted to be any part of the Great Councel: and if the Gentlemen of <hi>Venice</hi> have any Right to keep the Government in their own hands, and to exclude the Commons, they never had it given them by the People, but at first were beholding to <hi>Monarchy</hi> for their Nobility. This may further be noted, that though <hi>Venice</hi> of late enjoyed Peace abroad, yet it had been with that Charge, either for Fortification and Defence, or in Bribery so excessive, whereby of late upon any terms they purchased their Peace, that it is said their Taxes are such, that Christians generally live better under the <hi>Turk,</hi> than under the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for there is not a grain of Corn, a spoonful of Wine, Salt, Eggs, Birds, Beasts, Fowl, or Fish sold, that payeth not a certain Custom: upon occasions the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Crafts-men pay a Rate by the Poll monthly,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104419:89"/>
they receive incredible Gains by Usury of the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in every City they keep open Shops of Interest' taking pawns after fifteen in the hundred, and if at the years end it be not redeemed, it is forfeited, or at the least, sold at great loss. The Revenues which the very Courtizans pay for Toleration, maintains no less than a dozen of Gallies.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been said, it may be judged how unagreeable the popular Government of <hi>Rome</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces</hi> at present, are, either for Religion or Peace (which two are principal ingredients of Government) and so consequently not fit to be reckoned for Forms, since whatsoever is either good or tolerable in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Governments, is borrowed or patch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up of a broken, and distracted <hi>Monarchy.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though <hi>Venice</hi> and the <hi>Low Countreys</hi> are the only remarkable places in this age that reject <hi>Monarchy;</hi> yet neither of them pretend their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to be founded upon any original Right of the People, or have the Common people any power amongst them, or any chosen by them. Never was any popular Estate in the World famous for keeping themselves in peace; all their glory hath been for Quarrelling and Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Those that are willing to be perswaded, that the power of Government is originally in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, finding how impossible it is for any people to exercise such power, do surmise, that though the people cannot govern, yet they may choose Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentors or Trustees, that may manage this power for the People, and such Representors must be surmised to be the People. And since such Representors can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:104419:89"/>
truly be chosen by the People, they are fain to divide the People into several parts, as of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Cities, and Burrough-Towns, and to allow to every one of those parts to choose one Representor or more of their own: and such Representors, though not any of them be chosen by the whole, or major part of the People, yet still must be surmised to be the People; nay, though not one of them be chosen either by the People, or the major part of the People of any Province, City, or Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, for which they serve, but onely a smaller part, still it must be said to be the People. Now when such Representors of the People do Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or meet, it is never seen that all of them can at one time meet together; and so there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appears a true, or full Representation of the whole People of the Nation, the Representors of one part or other being absent, but still they must be imagined to be the People. And when such imperfect Assemblies be met, though not half be present, they proceed: and though their number be never so small, yet it is so big, that in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of any Business of moment, they know not how to handle it, without referring it to a fewer number than themselves, though themselves are not so many as they should be. Thus those that are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to represent the People, are necessitated to choose others, to represent the Representors themselves; a Trustee of the North doth delegate his power to a Trustee of the South; and one of the East may sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute one of the West for his Proxy: hereby it comes to pass, that Publick Debates which are imagined to be referred to a general Assembly of a Kingdom, are contracted into a particular or private
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104419:90"/>
Assembly, than which nothing can be more destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, or contrary to the nature of Publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. Each company of such Trustees hath a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor, or Speaker; who, by the help of three or four of his fellows that are most active, may easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comply in gratifying one the other, so that each of them in their turns may sway the Trustees, whilst one man, for himself or his friend, may rule in one Business, and another man for himself or his friend prevail in another cause, till such a number of Trustees be reduced to so many petty Monarchs as there be men of it. So in all Popularities, where a General Councel, or great Assembly of the People meet, they find it impossible to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch any great Action, either with Expedition or Secrecy, if a publick free Debate be admitted; and therefore are constrained to Epitomize, and sub-epitomise themselves so long, till at last they crumble away into the Atomes of <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> which is the next degree to <hi>Anarchy;</hi> for <hi>Anarchy</hi> is nothing else but a broken <hi>Monarchy,</hi> where every man is his own <hi>Monarch,</hi> or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Power of the People in choosing both their Government and Governours, is of late highly magnified, as if they were able to choose the best and excellentest men for that purpose. We shall find it true what <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath affirmed, that <hi>to choose well is the office of him that hath Knowledge; none can choose a</hi> Geometrician <hi>but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:104419:90"/>A great deal of talk there is in the World of the Freedom and Liberty that they say is to be found in Popular Commonweals; it is worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry how far, and in what sense this Speech of Liberty is true. <hi>True Liberty is for every man to do what he list, or to live as he please, and not to be tied to any Laws.</hi> But such Liberty is not to be found in any Commonweal; for there are more Laws in Popular Estates than any where else; and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently less Liberty: and Government many say was invented to take away Liberty, and not to give it to every man; such Liberty cannot be; if it should, there would be no Government at all: therefore <hi>Aristotle,</hi> l. 6. cap. 4. <hi>It is profitable not to be lawful to do every thing that we will, for pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do what one will, cannot restrain that Evil that is in every man;</hi> so that true Liberty cannot, nor should not be in any Estate. But the onely Liberty that the talkers of Liberty can mean, is a Liberty for some men to <hi>Rule and to be Ruled,</hi> for so <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> expounds it; one while to Govern, another while to be Governed; to be a King in the forenoon, and a Subject in the afternoon; this is the onely Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that a Popular Estate can brag of, that where a <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath but one King, their Government hath the liberty to have many Kings by turns. If the Common People look for any other Liberty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their Persons or their Purses, they are pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived, for a perpetual Army and Taxes are the principal materials of all Popular Regiments: never yet any stood without them, and very seldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with them; many popular Estates have start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, but few have lasted; <hi>It is no hard matter for any kind of Government to last one, or two, or</hi>

For all such as out of hope of Liberty, attempt to erect new Forms of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he gives this prudent Lesson. <hi>We must look well into the continuance of Time, and remembrance of many Years, wherein the means tending to establish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity had not lain hid, if they had been good and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; for almost all things have been found out, albeit some have not been received, and other some have been rejected, after men have had experience of them;</hi> l. 2. c. 5.</p>
                  <p>It is believed by many, that at the very first As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling of the People, it was unanimously agreed in the first place, that the Consent of the major part should bind the whole; and that though this first Agreement cannot possibly be proved, either how, or by whom it should be made; yet it must necessarily be believed or supposed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause otherwise there could be no lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. That there could be no lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, except a general Consent of the whole People be first surmised, is no sound proposition; yet true it is, that there could be no popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment without it. But if there were at first a Government without being beholden to the People for their Consent, as all men confess there was, I find no reason but that there may be so still, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking Leave of the Multitude.</p>
                  <p>If it be true, that men are by nature free-born, and not to be governed without their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents, and that Self-preservation is to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the first place, it is not lawful for any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment but <hi>Self-government</hi> to be in the World, it were sin in the People to Desire, or attempt to Consent to any other Government: if the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104419:91"/>
will promise for themselves to be Slaves, yet for their Children they cannot, who have alwayes the same Right to set themselves at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which their Fathers had to Enslave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>To pretend that a major part, or the silent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of any part, may be interpreted to bind the whole People, is both unreasonable and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; it is against all Reason for men to bind o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where it is against Nature for men to bind themselves. Men that boast so much of natural Feeedom, are not willing to consider how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory and destructive the Power of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part is to the natural Liberty of the whole People; the two grand Favourites of the Subjects, <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> (for which most men pretend to strive) are as contrary as Fire to Water, and cannot stand together. Though by humane Laws in <hi>Voluntary Actions,</hi> a major part may be tolerated to bind the whole Multitude, yet in <hi>Necessary Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> such as those of Nature are, it cannot be so. Besides, if it were possible for a whole People to choose their Representors, then either every, each one of those Representors ought to be particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chosen by the whole People, and not one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentor by one part, and another Representor by another part of the People, or else it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that continually the entire Number of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentors be present, because otherwise the whole People is never represented.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is impossible for the People, though they might and would choose a Government, or Governours, ever to be able to do it: for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to speak truly and properly, is a thing or Body
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104419:92"/>
in continual Alteration and Change, it never conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues one Minute the same, being composed of a Multitude of Parts, whereof divers continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and perish, and others renew and succeed in their places; they which are the People this Minute, are not the People the next Minute. If it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that it is impossible to stand so strictly, as to have the Consent of the whole People; and therefore that which cannot be, must be supposed to be the Act of the whole People: This is a strange Answer, first to affirm a Necessity of having the Peoples Consent, than to confess an Impossibility of having it. If but once that Liberty, which is esteemed so sacred, be broken, or taken away but from one of the meanest or basest of all the People; a wide Gap is thereby opened for any Multitude whatsoever, that is able to call themselves, or whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they please, the People.</p>
                  <p>Howsoever men are naturally willing to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that all Sovereignty flows from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the People, and that without it no true Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be made to any Supremacy; and that it is so <hi>currant an Axiome of late, that it will certainly pass without Contradiction</hi> as a late <hi>Exercitator</hi> tells us: yet there are <hi>many and great Difficulties</hi> in the Point never yet determined, not so much as dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, all which the <hi>Exercitator</hi> waves and declines, professing he will not insist upon the Distinctions, touching <hi>the manner of the Peoples passing their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, nor determine which of them is sufficient, and which not to make the Right or Title; whether it must be Antecedent to Possession, or may be consequent: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, or Tacite: Collective, or Representative: Absolute, or conditionated: Free, or Inforced: Revocable, or Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable.</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:104419:92"/>
All these are material Doubts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Peoples Title, and though the <hi>Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator</hi> will not himself determine what Consent is sufficient, and what not, to make a Right or Title, yet he might have been so courteous, as to have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, to whom we might go for Resolution in these Cases. But the Truth is, that amongst all them that plead the Necessity of the Consent of the People, not one of them hath ever toucht upon these so necessary Doctrines; it is a Task it seems too difficult, otherwise surely it would not have been neglected, considering how necessary it is to resolve the Conscience, touching the manner of the Peoples passing their Consent; and what is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and what not, to make, or derive a Right, or Title from the People.</p>
                  <p>No Multitude or great Assembly of any Nation, though they be all of them never so good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, can possibly govern; this may be evidently discovered by considering the Actions of great and numerous Assemblies, how they are necessitated to relinquish that supreme Power, which they think they exercise, and to delegate it to a few. There are two Parts of the Supreme Power, the <hi>legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> and the <hi>Executive,</hi> neither of these can a great Assembly truly act. If a new Law be to be made it may in the General receive the Proposal of it from one or more of the General Assembly, but the forming, penning, or framing it into a Law is committed to a few, because a great number of persons cannot without tedious, and dilatory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, examine the Benefits and Mischiefs of a Law. Thus in the very first Beginning the Intention of a general Assembly is frustrated; then after a Law is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:104419:93"/>
penned or framed, when it comes to be question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it shall pass or nay; though it be Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a full Assembly, yet by the Rules of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, they are all so tyed up, and barred from a free and full Debate; that when any man hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Reasons of his Opinion; if those Reasons be argued against, he is not permitted to reply in Justification or Explanation of them, but when he hath once spoken, he must be heard no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is a main Denial of that Freedome of Debate, for which the great Assembly is alleaged to be ordained in the high Point of <hi>Legislative</hi> Power.</p>
                  <p>The same may be said, touching the <hi>executive</hi> Power; if a cause be brought before a great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the first thing done, is to referr, or commit it to some few of the Assembly, who are trusted with the examining the Proofs, and Witnesses, and to make Report to the general Assembly; who upon the Report proceed to give their Judgments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any publick hearing, or interrogating the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, upon whose Testimonies diligently exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man that will pass a conscientious judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to rely. Thus the <hi>legislative</hi> and <hi>executive</hi> Power are never truly practised in a great Assembly; the true Reason whereof is, if Freedom be given to Debate, never any thing could be agreed upon without endless Disputes; meer Necessity compels to refer main Transactions of Business to particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and Committees.</p>

the other, <hi>mutuò se ponunt &amp; auferunt;</hi> where a Command or Law proceeds from a major part, there those individual Persons that concurred in the Vote, are the Governours, because the Law is only their Will in particular: the Power of a major Part being a contingent, or casual thing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires in the very Act it self of voting, which Power of a major part is grounded upon a Supposition, that they are the stronger part; when the Vote is past, these Voters, which are the major part, return again, and are incorporated into the whole Assembly, and are buried as it were in that Lump, and no otherwise considered; the Act or Law ordained by such a Vote, loseth the Makers of it, before it comes to be obeyed; for when it comes to be put in Execution, it becomes the Will of those who enjoyn it, and force Obedience to it, not by Virtue of any Power derived from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Law. No man can say, that during the Reign of the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> or <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth did govern, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that many of the Laws that were made in those two former Princes times, were observed, and executed under her Government; but those Laws, though made by her Predecessours, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Laws of her present Government; who willed and commanded the Execution of them, and had the same Power to correct, interpret, or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them, which the first makers of them had; every Law must always have some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent known Person in Being, whose Will it must be to make it a Law for the Present; this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said of the major part of any Assembly, because that major part instantly ceaseth, as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104419:94"/>
soon as ever it hath voted: an infallible Argument whereof is this, that the same major part after the Vote given; hath no Power to correct, alter, or mitigate it, or to Cause it to be put in Execution; so that he that shall act, or cause that Law to be executed, makes himself the Commander, or willer of it, which was originally the Will of others: It is said by Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan</hi> page 141. <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is Law, where the Legislator cannot be known; for there must be manifest Signs, that it proceedeth from the Will of the Sovereign; there is requisite, not only a Declaration of the Law, but also sufficient Signs of the Author and the Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Senate or great Councel, wherein it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the supreme, or legislative Power doth rest, consists of those Persons who are actually Subjects at the very same time, wherein they exercise their legislative Power, and at the same Instant may be guilty of breaking one Law, whilest they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king another Law; for it is not the whole and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Will of every particular Person in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but that part onely of his Will, which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally falls out to concurr with the Will of the greater part: So that the Sharers of the legislative Power have each of them, perhaps not a hundreth part of the legislative Power (which in it self is indivisible) and that not in <hi>Act,</hi> but in <hi>Possibility,</hi> only in one particular Point for that Moment, whilst they give their Vote. To close this Point which may seem strange and new to some, I will produce the Judgment of <hi>Bodin,</hi> in his sixth Book of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal, and the fourth Chapter; his words are, <hi>The chief Point of a Commonweal, which is the Right of Sovereignty, cannot be, nor insist, to speak properly,</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:104419:94"/>
                     <hi>but in Monarchy; for none can be Sovereign in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweal, but one alone; if they be two or three or more, no one is Sovereign, for that no one of them can give or take a Law from his Companion: and although we imagine a Body of many Lords, or of a whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to hold the Sovereignty, yet hath it no true Ground nor Support, if there be not a Head with absolute Power to unite them together, which a simple Magistrate without Sovereign Authority cannot do. And if it chance that the Lords, or Tribes of the People be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided (as it often falls out) then must they fall to Arms one against another: and although the greatest part be of one Opinion, yet may it so happen, as the lesser part, having many Legions, and making a Head, may oppose it self against the greater Number, and get the Victory. We see the Difficulties which are, and always have been in popular Estates, whereas they hold contrary Parts and for divers Magistrates, some demand Peace, others War; some will have this Law, others that; some will have one Commander, others another; some will treat a League with the King of</hi> France, <hi>others with the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>corrupted or drawn, some one Way, some another, making open War, as hath been seen in our Age amongst the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons &amp;c.</hi>

                  <head>DIRECTIONS FOR Obedience to Government IN Dangerous or Doubtful Times.</head>
                  <p>ALL those who so eagerly strive for an original Power to be in the People, do with one Consent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that originally the Supreme Power was in the Fatherhood; and that the first Kings were Fathers of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: This is not only evident, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by <hi>Aristotle;</hi> but yielded unto by <hi>Grotius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ascam;</hi> and all others of that Party, not one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, that I know of.</p>
                  <p>Now for those that confess an original Subjection in Children, to be governed by their Parents, to dream of an original Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:104419:96"/>
in Mankind, is to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and to make Subjects to be Free, and Kings to be Limited; to imagine such Pactions and Contracts between Kings and People, as cannot be proved ever to have been made, or can ever be described or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, how it is possible for such Contracts ever to have been, is a boldness to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> confesseth, that <hi>Adam, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from God, was made the general Lord of all things, not without such a private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to himself, as (without his Grant) did exclude his Children. And by Donation, or Assignation, or some kind of Concession (before he was dead, or left any Heir to succeed him) his Children had their distinct Territories, by Right of Private Dominion.</hi> Abel <hi>had his Flocks, and Pastures for them:</hi> Cain <hi>had his Fields for Corn, and the Land of</hi> Nod, <hi>where he built himself a City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is confessed, that in the Infancy of the World, the Paternal Government was Monarchical; but when the World was replenished with multitude of people, then the Paternal Government ceased, and was lost; and an Elective kind of Government by the People, was brought into the World. To this it may be answered, That the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power cannot be lost; it may either
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104419:96"/>
be <hi>transferr'd</hi> or usurped; but never lost, or ceaseth. God, who is the giver of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, may transferr it from the Father to some other; he gave to <hi>Saul</hi> a Fatherly power over his Father <hi>Kish.</hi> God also hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Father a Right or Liberty to alien his Power over his Children, to any other; whence we find the Sale and gift of Children, to have been much in Use in the beginning of the World, when men had their Servants for a possession and an Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance as well as other Goods: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we find the power of Castrating, and making Eunuchs much in Use in old times. As the power of the Father may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transferr'd or aliened, so it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly usurped: And in Usurpation, the Title of an Usurper is before, and better than the Title of any other than of him that had a former Right: for he hath a possession by the permissive Will of God, which permission, how long it may endure, no man ordinarily knows. Every man is to preserve his own Life for the Service of God, and of his King or Father, and is so far to obey an Usurper, as may tend not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the preservation of his King and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but sometimes even to the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Usurper himself, when proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he may thereby be reserved to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104419:97"/>
or Mercy of his true Superiour; though by Humane Laws, a long Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may take away Right, yet Divine Right never dies, nor can be lost, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                  <p>Every man that is born, is so far from being Free-born, that by his very Birth he becomes a Subject to him that begets him: under which Subjection he is always to live, unless by immediate Appointment from God, or by the Grant or Death of his Father, he become possessed of that power to which he was subject.</p>
                  <p>The Right of Fatherly Government was ordained by God, for the preservation of Mankind; if it be usurped, the Usurper may be so far obeyed, as may tend to the preservation of the Subjects, who may thereby be enabled to perform their Duty to their true and right Sovereign, when time shall serve: in such Cases to obey an Usurper, is properly to obey the first and right Governour, who must be presumed to desire the Safety of his Subjects: the Command of an Usurper is not to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any thing tending to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Person of the Governour, whose Being in the first place is to be looked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been said, that there have been
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104419:97"/>
so many Usurpations by Conquest in all Kingdoms, that all Kings are Usurpers, or the Heirs or Successors of Usurpers; and therefore any Usurper, if he can but get the possession of a Kingdom, hath as good a Title as any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer.</hi> The first Usurper hath the best Title, being, as was said, in possession by the Permission of God; and where an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper hath continued so long, that the knowledge of the right Heir be lost by all the Subjects, in such a case an Usurper in possession is to be taken and reputed by such Subjects for the true Heir, and is to be obeyed by them as their Father. As no man hath an infallible Certitude, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a moral Knowledge, which is no other than a probable perswasion grounded upon a peaceable possession, which is a warrant for subjection to Parents and Governours; for we may not say, because Children have no infallible, or necessary certainty who are their true Parents, that therefore they need not obey, because they are uncertain: it is sufficient, and as much as Humane Nature is capable of, for Children to rely upon a credible perswasion; for otherwise the Commandement of <hi>Honour thy Father,</hi> would be a vain Commandment, and not possible to be observed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:104419:98"/>By Humane positive Laws, a Possession time out of mind takes away, or barrs a former Right, to avoid a general Mischief, of bringing all Right into a disputation not decideable by proof, and consequently to the overthrow of all Civil Government, in Grants, Gifts, and Contracts, between man and man: But in Grants and Gifts that have their original from God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as the Power of the Father hath, no Inferiour power of man can limit, nor make any Law of Prescription against them: upon this ground is built that common Maxim, that <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit regi,</hi> No time bars a King.</p>
                  <p>All Power on Earth is either <hi>derived</hi> or <hi>usurped</hi> from the Fatherly power, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other original to be found of any Power whatsoever; for if there should be granted two sorts of power without any subordination of one to the other, they would be in perpetual strife which should be Supreme, for two Supremes cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; if the Fatherly power be supreme, then the power of the People must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, and depend on it; if the power of the People be supreme, then the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power must submit to it, and cannot be exercised without the Licence of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which must quite destroy the frame
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104419:98"/>
and course of Nature. Even the Power which God himself exerciseth over Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is by Right of Fatherhood; he is both the King and Father of us all; as God hath exalted the Dignity of Earthly Kings, by communicating to them his own Title, by saying <hi>they are gods;</hi> so on the other side, he hath been pleased as it were to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself, by assuming the Title of a King, to express his Power, and not the Title of any popular Government; we find it is a punishment to have <hi>no King,</hi> Hosea, <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 4. and promised, as a Blessing to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 17. 6. <hi>that Kings shall come out of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every man hath a part or share in the preservation of Mankind in general, he that usurps the Power of a Superiour, thereby puts upon himself a Necessity of acting the Duty of a Superiour in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of them over whom he hath usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unless he will aggravate one heinous Crime, by committing another more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid; he that takes upon him the Power of a superiour sins sufficiently, and to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: but he that proceeds to destroy both his Superiour, and those under the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Protection, goeth a Strain higher, by adding Murther to Robbery; if Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be hindered, mankind perisheth, an
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104419:99"/>
Usurper by hindering the Government of another, brings a Necessity upon himself to govern, his Duty before Usurpation was only to be ministerial, or instrumental in the preservation of others by his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but when he denies his own, and hinders the Obedience of others, he doth not only not help, but is the Cause of the Distraction in hindering his Superiour to perform his Duty, he makes the Duty his own: if a Superiour cannot protect, it is his part to desire to be able to do it, which he cannot do in the Future if in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent they be destroyed for want of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: therefore it is to be presumed, that the Superiour desires the preservation of them that should be subject to him; and so likewise it may be presumed, that an Usurper in general doth the Will of his Superiour, by preserving the People by Government, and it is not improper to say, that in obeying an Usurper, we may obey primarily the true Superiour, so long as our Obedience aims at the preservation of those in Subjection, and not at the Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the true Governour. Not only the Usurper, but those also over whom Power is usurped, may joyn in the preservation of themselves, yea, and in the preservation sometimes of the Usurper himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:104419:99"/>Thus there may be a conditional Duty, or Right in an Usurper to govern; that is to say, supposing him to be so wicked as to usurp, and not willing to surrender or forego his Usurpation, he is then bound to protect by Government, or else he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, and multiplyeth his Sin.</p>
                  <p>Though an Usurper can never gain a Right from the true Superiour, yet from those that are Subjects he may; for if they know no other that hath a better Title than the Usurper, then as to them the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in Possession hath a true Right.</p>
                  <p>Such a qualified Right is found at first in all Usurpers, as is in Theives who have stolen Goods, and during the time they are possessed of them, have a Title in Law against all others but the true Owners, and such Usurpers to divers Intents and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses may be obeyed.</p>
                  <p>Neither is he only an Usurper who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Government, but all they are Partakers in the Usurpation, who have either failed to give Assistance to their lawful Sovereign, or have given Aid ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by their Persons, Estates or Counsels for the Destroying of that Governour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose Protection they have been born and preserved; for although it should be granted, that <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:104419:100"/>
reciprocal, so that where the first fails, the latter ceaseth; yet it must be remembred; that where a man hath been born under the Protection of a long and peaceable Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he owes an Assistance for the preservation of that Government that hath protected him, and is the Author of his own Disobedience.</p>
                  <p>It is said by some, that an usurped Power may be obeyed in things that are lawful: but it may not be obeyed not only in lawful things, but also in things indifferent: Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience in things indifferent, is necessary; not indifferent. For in things necessarily good God is immediately obeyed, Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours only by Consequence: If men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand things evil, Obedience is due only by <hi>tolerating</hi> what they inflict: not by <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming</hi> what they require: in the first they declare what God commands to be <hi>done,</hi> in the latter what to be <hi>suffered,</hi> so it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that things indifferent only are the proper Object of humane Laws. Actions are to be considered <hi>simply</hi> and alone, and so are good as being Motions depending on the first Mover; or <hi>jointly</hi> with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances: And that in a double Manner. 1. In Regard of the <hi>Ability</hi> or <hi>Possibility</hi> whilest they may be done. 2. In the <hi>Act</hi> when they be performed: Before they be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:104419:100"/>
done they be indifferent, but once break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into Act, they become distinctly Good or Evil according to the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which determine the same. Now an Action commanded, is supposed as not yet done (whereupon the Hebrews call the Imperative Mood the first Future) and so remaineth many times indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Some may be of Opinion, that if Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may be given to an Usurper in things indifferent, as well as to a lawful Power; that then there is as much Obedience due to an usurped Power, as to a lawful. But it is a Mistake; for though it be granted that in things indifferent, an Usurper may be obeyed, as well as a lawful Governour; yet herein lyeth a main Difference, that some things are indifferent for a lawful Superiour, which are not indifferent, but unlawful to an Usurper to enjoyn. Usurpation is the resisting, and taking away the Power from him, who hath such a former Right to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Usurper, as cannot lawfully be taken away: so that it cannot be just for an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper, to take Advantage of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Act, or create himself a Title by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of his own Injustice, which ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates, and never extenuates his Crime: and if it never can be an Act indifferent for the Usurper himself to disobey his Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:104419:101"/>
Sovereign, much less can it be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent for him to command another to do that to which he hath no Right himself. It is only then a matter indifferent for an Usurper to command, when the Actions enjoyned are such; as the lawful Superiour is commanded by the Law of God, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the benefit of his Subjects, by the same, or other like Restriction of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things; and it is to be presumed, if he had not been hindred, would have commanded the same, or the like Laws.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WITH no small Content I read Mr. <hi>Hobs'</hi>s Book <hi>De Cive,</hi> and his <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan,</hi> about the Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, which no man, that I know, hath so amply and judiciously handled: I consent with him about the Rights of <hi>exercising</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but I cannot agree to his means of <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> it. It may seem strange I should praise his Building, and yet mislike his Foundation; but so it is, his <hi>Jus Naturae,</hi> and his <hi>Regnum In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutivum,</hi> will not down with me: they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear full of Contradiction and Impossibilities; a few short Notes about them, I here offer, wishing he would consider, whether his Building would not stand firmer upon the Principles of <hi>Regnum Patrimoniale</hi> (as he calls it) both according to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi> Since he confesseth, the <hi>Father, being before the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of a Commonwealth, was Originally an Absolute Sovereign, with power of Life</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104419:103"/>
                     <hi>and Death,</hi> and that <hi>a great Family, as to the Rights of Sovereignty, is a little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> If, according to the order of Nature, he had handled <hi>Paternal Government</hi> before that by <hi>Institution,</hi> there would have been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle liberty left in the Subjects of the Family to consent to Institution of Government.</p>
                  <p>In his pleading the Cause of the People, he arms them with a very large Commission of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray;</hi> which is, a Right in Nature for every Man, to war against every Man when he please: and also a Right for all the People to govern. This latter Point, although he affirm in Words, yet by Consequence he denies, as to me it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>He saith, a <hi>Representative</hi> may be of <hi>All,</hi> or but of a <hi>Part</hi> of the People. If it be of <hi>All,</hi> he terms it a <hi>Democratie,</hi> which is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People. But how can such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth be generated? for if every man Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with every man, who shall be left to be the <hi>Representative?</hi> if <hi>All</hi> must be <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives,</hi> who will remain to Covenant? for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e that is Sovereign makes no Covenant by his Doctrine. It is not <hi>All that will come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> that makes the <hi>Democratie,</hi> but <hi>All that have power</hi> by Covenant; thus his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratie</hi> by <hi>Institution</hi> fails.</p>
                  <p>The same may be said of a <hi>Democratie by acquisition;</hi> for if all be <hi>Conquerours,</hi> who
<pb facs="tcp:104419:103"/>
shall Covenant for Life and Liberty? and if all be not Conquerours, how can it be a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie</hi> by Conquest?</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Paternal Democratie</hi> I am confident he will not affirm; so that in conclusion the poor People are deprived of their Government, if there can be no <hi>Democratie,</hi> by his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                  <p>Next, If a <hi>Representative Aristocratical</hi> of a Part of the People be free from Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then that whole Assembly (call it what you will) though it be never so great, is in the state of Nature, and every one of that Assembly hath a Right not only to kill any of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that they meet with in the streets, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they all have a natural Right to cut one anothers throats, even while they sit together in Councel, by his Principles. In this miserable condition of War is his <hi>Representative Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocratical</hi> by Institution.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Commonwealth by Conquest,</hi> he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is then <hi>acquired,</hi> when the Vanquished, to avoid present Death, Covenanteth, that so long as his Life, and the liberty of his Body is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, the Victor shall have the Use of it at his pleasure. Here I would know how the Liberty of the Vanquished can be allowed, if the Victor have the Use of it at pleasure, or how it is possible for the Victor to perform his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, except he could alwayes stand by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:104419:104"/>
particular man to protect his Life and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?</p>
                  <p>In his Review and Conclusion he resolves, that an ordinary Subject hath liberty to submit, when the means of his Life is within the Guards and Garisons of the Enemy. It seems hereby that the Rights of Sovereignty by Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be forfeited, for the Subject cannot be at liberty to submit to a Conquerour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his former Subjection be forfeited for want of Protection.</p>
                  <p>If his Conquerour be in the state of nature when he conquers, he hath a Right without any Covenant made with the conquered: If Conquest be defined to be the <hi>acquiring of Right of Sovereignty by Victory,</hi> why is it said, <hi>the Right is acquired in the Peoples Submission, by which they contract with the Victor, promising Obedience for Life and Liberty?</hi> hath not every one in the state of Nature a Right to Sovereignty before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, which onely puts him in possession of his Right?</p>
                  <p>If his Conquerour be not in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but a Subject by Covenant, how can he get a Right of Sovereignty by Conquest, when neither he himself hath Right to Conquer, nor Subjects a liberty to Submit? since a former Contract lawfully made, cannot lawfully be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by them.</p>

                     <p>But if it be allowed (which is yet most false) that a Company of men were at first without a common Power to keep them in Awe; I do not see why such a Condition must be called <hi>a State of War of all men against all men:</hi> indeed if such a Multitude of men should be created as the Earth could not well nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, there might be Cause for men to destroy one another rather than perish for want of Food; but God was no such Niggard in the Creation, and there being Plenty of Sustenance and Room for all men, there is no Cause or Use of War till men be hindred in the Preservation of Life, so that there is no absolute Necessity of War in the State of pure Nature, it is the Right of Nature for every man to live in Peace, that so he may tend the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his life, which whilst he is in actual War he cannot do. War of it self as it is War preserves no mans Life, it only helps us to preserve and obtain the Means to live: if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man tend the Right of preserving Life, which

                     <p>Pag. 87. <hi>The only way to erect a Common Power or a Commonwealth; is for men to confer all their Power and Strength upon one man, or one Assembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills by Plurality of Voices to one Will; which is to appoint one man or an Assembly of men to bear their Person, to submit their Wills to his Will: this is a real Unity of them all in one Person, made by Covenant of every man with every man, as if every man should say to every man, I authorise, and give up my Right of Governing my self to this man, or this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of men, on this Condition, that thou give up thy Right to him, and authorise all his Actions. This done, the Multitude so united in one Person, is called a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To authorise and give up his Right of Governing himself, to confer all his Power and Strength, and to submit his Will to another, is to lay down his Right of resisting: for if Right of Nature be a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to use Power for Preservation of Life, laying down of that Power must be a Relinquishing of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104419:108"/>
to preserve or defend Life, otherwise a man relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisheth nothing.</p>
                     <p>To reduce all the Wills of an Assembly by Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Voices to one Will, is not a proper Speech, for it is not a Plurality but a Totality of Voices which makes an Assembly be of one Will, otherwise it is but the one Will of a major part of the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Negative Voice of any one hinders the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the one Will of the Assembly, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more destructive to the true Nature of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Assembly, than to allow a major part to prevail when the whole only hath Right. For a man to give up his Right to one that never Covenants to protect, is a great Folly, since it is neither <hi>in Consideration of some Right reciprocally transferred to himself, nor can he hope for any other Good, by standing out of the way, that the other may enjoy his own original Right without hinderance from him by reason of so much Diminution of Impediments. pag.</hi> 66.</p>

Also where he saith <hi>pag.</hi> 121. the <hi>Father and Master being before the Institution of Commonweals absolute Sovereigns in their own Families,</hi> how can it be said that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children or Servants were in the State of <hi>jus naturae</hi> till the Institutions of Commonweals? It is said by Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> in his Book <hi>De Cive, cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Section</hi> 7. <hi>the Mother originally hath the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her Children, and from her the Father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives his Right, because she brings forth and first nourisheth them.</hi> But we know that God at the Creation gave the Sovereignty to the man over the Woman, as being the nobler and principal
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104419:109"/>
Agent in Generation. As to the Objection, that <hi>it is not known who is the Father to the Son, but by the discovery of the Mother,</hi> and that <hi>he is his Son whom the Mother will, and therefore he is the Mother's:</hi> The answer is, that it is not at the Will of the Mother to make whom she will the Father, for if the Mother be not in possession of a Husband, the Child is not reckoned to have any Father at all; but if she be in the possession of a man, the Child, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatsoever the Woman discovereth to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is still reputed to be his in whose possession she is. No Child naturally and infallibly knows who are his true Parents, yet he must obey those that in common reputation are so, otherwise the Commandement of <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> were in vain, and no Child bound to the obedience of it.</p>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> puts a case by way of Question. <hi>A great many men together have already resisted the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power unjustly, or committed some Capital Crime, for which every one of them expecteth death: whether have they not the liberty then to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and assist and defend one another? Certainly they have; for they but defend their Lives, which the Guilty man may as well do as the Innocent: There was indeed Injustice in the first breach of their Duty, their bearing of Arms subsequent to it, though it be to maintain what they have done, is no new unjust Act; and if it be only to defend their Persons, it is not Unjust at all.</hi> The only reason here alleged for the Bearing of Arms, is this; That there is no new unjust Act: as if the beginning only of a Rebellion were an unjust Act, and the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it none at all. No better Answer can be given to this case, than what the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath delivered in the beginning of the same Paragraph, in these words; <hi>To resist the Sword of the Commonwealth in defence of another man, Guilty or Innocent, no man hath liberty: because such Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty takes away from the Sovereign the Means of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting us, and is therefore destructive of the very Essence of Government.</hi> Thus he first answers the question, and then afterwards makes it, and gives it a contrary Answer: other Passages I meet with to the like purpose. He saith, Page 66. <hi>A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lay down the Right of Resisting them that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault him by Force to take away his Life: The same may be said of Wounds, Chains, and Imprisonment.</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104419:111"/>
Page 69. <hi>A Covenant to defend my self from Force by Force, is void.</hi> Pag. 68. <hi>Right of Defending Life and Means of living, can never be abandoned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These last Doctrines are destructive to all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whatsoever, and even to the <hi>Leviathan</hi> it self: hereby any Rogue or Villain may murder his Sovereign, if the Sovereign but offer by force to whip or lay him in the Stocks, since Whipping may be said to be wounding, and Putting in the Stocks an Imprisonment: so likewise every mans Goods being a Means of Living, if a man cannot abandon them, no Contract among men, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so just, can be observed: thus we are at least in as miserable condition of War, as Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> at first by Nature found us.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>The Kingdom of God signifies,</hi> (saith Master <hi>Hobs,</hi> page 216.) <hi>a Kingdom constituted by the Votes of the People of</hi> Israel <hi>in a peculiar manner, wherein they choose God for their King, by Covenant made with him, upon God's promising them</hi> Canaan. If we look upon Master <hi>Hob's</hi> Text for this, it will be found that the People did not Constitute by Votes, and choose God for their King; But by the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment first of God himself, the Covenant was to be a God to them: they did not contract with God, that if he would give them <hi>Canaan,</hi> they would be his Subjects, and he should be their King; It was not in their power to choose whether God should be their God, yea, or nay: for it is confessed, <hi>He reigned naturally over all by his Might.</hi> If God Reigned naturally, he had a Kingdom,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104419:112"/>
and Sovereign Power over his Subjects, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by their own Consent. This Kingdom, said to be constituted by the Votes of the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> is but the Vote of <hi>Abraham</hi> only; his single Voyce carried it; he was the Representative of the People. For at this Vote, it is confessed, that the Name of <hi>King</hi> is not given to God, nor of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> to <hi>Abraham;</hi> yet the thing, if we will believe Master <hi>Hobs,</hi> is all one. If a Contract be the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual transferring of Right, I would know what Right a People can have to transferr to God by Contract. Had the People of <hi>Israel</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> a Right not to obey God's Voice? If they had not such a Right, what had they to transferr?</p>
                     <p>The Covenant mentioned at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was but a Conditional Contract, and God but a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional King; and though the People promised to obey Gods word, yet it was more than they were able to perform, for they often disobeyed Gods Voice, which being a breach of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Covenant was void, and God not their King by Contract.</p>
                     <p>It is complained by God, <hi>They have rejected me that I should reign over them:</hi> but it is not said, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Contract; for I do not find that the Desiring of a King was a breach of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Covenant, or disobedience to the Voice of God: there is no such Law extant.</p>
                     <p>The People did not totally reject the Lord, but in part onely, out of timorousness, when they saw <hi>Nahash</hi> King of the Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> come against them; they distrusted that God would not suddenly provide for their Deliverance, as if they had had alwayes a King in readiness to go up pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104419:112"/>
to fight for them: This Despair in them who had found so many miraculous deliverances under Gods Government, was that which offended the Lord so highly: they did not desire an Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government, and to cast off Gods Laws, but hoped for a certainer and speedier deliverance from danger in time of War. They did not peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they might choose their King themselves, that had been a greater sin; and yet if they had, it had not been a total rejection of Gods Reigning over them, as long as they desired not to depart from the Worship of God their King, and from the Obedience of his Laws. I see not that the Kingdom of God was cast off by the Election of <hi>Saul,</hi> since <hi>Saul</hi> was chosen by God himself, and governed according to Gods Laws. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> is no where called the Kingdom of God, nor is it said, that the Kingdom of God was cast off at the Election of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> allows, that <hi>Moses alone had, next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, the Sovereignty over the Israelites,</hi> p. 252. but he doth not allow it to <hi>Ioshua,</hi> but will have it descend to <hi>Eleazar</hi> the High-Priest, <hi>Aaron's</hi> son. His Proof is, God expresly saith concerning <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua, He shall stand before</hi> Eleazar, <hi>who shall ask Counsel for him before the Lord,</hi> (after the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Urim,</hi> is omitted by Mr. <hi>Hobs) at his word they shall go out,</hi> &amp;c. therefore the <hi>Supreme Power of making Peace and War was in the Priest.</hi> Answ. The Work of the High-Priest was onely <hi>Ministerial,</hi> not <hi>Magisterial;</hi> he had no power to Command in War, or to Judge in Peace; onely when the Sovereign or Governour did go up to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104419:113"/>
War, he enquired of the Lord by the Ministry of the High Priest, and, as the <hi>Hebrews</hi> say, the Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer with a soft voice, as one that prayeth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, asked: and forthwith the Holy Ghost came upon the Priest, and he beheld the Brest-plate, and saw therein by the Vision of Prophecy, <hi>Go up,</hi> or <hi>go not up,</hi> in the letters that shewed forth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the Brest-plate before his face: then the Priest answered him, <hi>Go up,</hi> or <hi>Go not up.</hi> If this Answer gave the Priest Sovereignty, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King <hi>Saul</hi> nor King <hi>David</hi> had the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who both asked Counsel of the Lord by the Priest.</p>

                     <p>AMong the many Printed Books, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Discourses touching the Right of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the Liberty of the <hi>People,</hi> I cannot find that as yet the first and chief Point is agreed upon, or indeed so much as once disputed. The word <hi>King</hi> and the word <hi>People</hi> are familiar, one would think every simple man could tell what they signified; but upon Examination it will be found, that the learnedst cannot agree of their Meaning.</p>
                     <p>Ask <hi>Salmasius</hi> what a King is, and he will teach us, that <hi>a King is he who hath the Supreme Power of</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:104419:114"/>
                        <hi>the Kingdom, and is accountable to none but God, and may do what he please, and is free from the Laws.</hi> This Definition <hi>I. M.</hi> abominates as being the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finion of a Tyrant: And I should be of his Mind, if he would have vouchsafed us a better, or any other Definition at all, that would tell us how any King can have a Supreme Power, without being freed from humane Laws: To find fault with it, without producing any other, is to leave us in the Dark: but though Mr. <hi>Milton</hi> brings us neither Definition nor Description of a King, yet we may pick out of several Passages of him, something like a Definition, if we lay them together. He teacheth us that <hi>Power was therefore given to a King by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he might see by the Authority to him commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that nothing be done against Law: and that he keeps our Laws, and not impose upon us his own: Therefore there is no Regal Power but in the Courts of the Kingdom, and by them, pag.</hi> 155.</p>
                     <p>And again he affirmeth, <hi>the King cannot Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Fine or punish any man, except he be first cited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some Court; where not the King, but the usual Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es give Sentence,</hi> pag. 168. and before we are told, <hi>not the King, but the Authority of Parliament doth set up and take away all Courts,</hi> pag. 167.</p>
                     <p>Lo here the Description of a King, He is <hi>one to whom the People give Power, to see that nothing be done against Law:</hi> and yet he saith there is <hi>no Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er but in the Courts of Iustice and by them, where not the King, but the usual Iudges give Sentence.</hi> This Description not only strips the King of all Power whatsoever, but puts him in a Condition below the meanest of his Subjects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="19" facs="tcp:104419:114"/>Thus much may shew, that all men are not agreed what a King is. Next, what the word <hi>People</hi> means is not agreed upon: ask <hi>Aristotle</hi> what the People is, and he will not allow any Power to be in any but in free Citizens. If we demand, who be free Citizens? That he cannot resolve us; for he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that <hi>he that is a free Citizen in one City, is not so in another City.</hi> And he is of Opinion that <hi>no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer should be a free Citizen, or have Voice in a well ordered Commonwealth;</hi> he accounts a <hi>Democratie</hi> (which word signifies the Government of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) <hi>to be a corrupted sort of Government;</hi> he thinks <hi>many men by Nature born to be Servants, and not fit to govern as any part of the People.</hi> Thus doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> curtal the People, and cannot give us any certain Rule to know who be the People: Come to our Modern Politicians, and ask them who the People is, though they talk big of the People, yet they take up, and are content with a <hi>few Representors</hi> (as they call them) <hi>of the whole People;</hi> a Point <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> was to seek in, neither are these Representors stood upon to be the whole People, but the <hi>major part of these Representors must be reckoned for the whole People;</hi> nay <hi>I. M.</hi> will not allow the major part of the Representors to be the People, but the <hi>sounder and better part only</hi> of them; and in right down terms he tells us pag. 126. <hi>to determine who is a Tyrant, he leaves to Magistrates, at least to the uprighter sort of them and of the People,</hi> pag. 7. <hi>though in number less by many, to judge as they find cause.</hi> If the <hi>sounder, the better, and the uprighter</hi> Part have the Power of the People, how shall we know, or who shall judge who they be?</p>

                     <p>One Text is urged by Mr. <hi>Milton,</hi> for the Peoples Power: Deut. 17. 14. <hi>When thou art come into the Land which thy Lord thy God giveth thee, and shalt say, I will set a King over me, like as all the Nations about me.</hi> It is said, by the Tenure of Kings <hi>these words confirm us that the Right of Choosing, yea of Changing their own Government, is by the Grant of God himself in the People:</hi> But can the foretelling or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warning of the <hi>Israelites</hi> of a wanton and wicked Desire of theirs, which God himself condemned, be made an Argument that God gave or granted them a Right to do such a wicked thing? or can the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reproving of a Future Fact, be a Donati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and approving of a present Right, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of a Sin be made a Commission for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it? The Author of his Book against <hi>Salmasius,</hi> falls so far from making God the Donor or Grantor, that he cites him only for a Witness, <hi>Teste ipso Deo penes populos arbitrium semper fuisse, vel ea, quae placer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>That</hi> here in this Text <hi>God himself being Witness, there was always a Power in the People, either to use what Form of Government they pleased, or of changing it into another: God saith this expresly of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>and denies it not of others.</hi> Can any man find that God in this Text expresly saith, that there was always a Right in the People to use what Form of Government they please? The Text not warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Right of the People, the Foundation of the

                        <hi>Ius Regni</hi> is much stumbled at, and the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a King which saith <hi>His Power is supreme in the Kingdom, and he is accountable to none but to God, and that he may do what he please, and is not bound by Laws:</hi> it is said if this Definition be good, no man is or ever was, who may be said to be a Tyrant; <hi>p.</hi> 14. for <hi>when he hath violated all divine and humane Laws, nevertheless he is a King, and guiltless jure Regio,</hi> To this may be answered, That the Definition confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth he is accountable to God, and therefore not guiltless if he violate Divine Laws: Humane Laws must not be shuffled in with Divine, they are not of the same Authority: if humane Laws bind a King, it is impossible for him to have Supreme Power amongst men. If any man can find us out such a kind of Government, wherein the supreme Power can be, without being freed from humane Laws, they should first teach us that; but if all sorts of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government that can be invented, cannot be one Minute, without an Arbitrary Power, freed from all humane Laws: what reason can be given why a Royal Government should not have the like Freedom? if it be Tyranny for one man to govern arbitrarily, why should it not be far greater Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny for a multitude of men to govern without being accountable or bound by Laws? It would be further enquired how it is possible for any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all to be in the World without an arbitrary Power; it is not Power except it be arbitary: a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power cannot be without being absolved from humane Laws, it cannot be shewed how a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104419:117"/>
King can have any Power at all but an arbitrary Power. We are taught, that <hi>Power was therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a King by the People, that he might see by the Authority to him committed, that nothing be done against Law; and that he keep our Laws, and not impose upon us his own: therefore there is no Royal Power, but in the Courts of the Kingdom, and by them,</hi> pag. 155. And again it is said, <hi>the King cannot Imprison, Fine or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish any man except he be first cited into some Court, where not the King but the usual Iudges give Sentence,</hi> pag. 168. and before, we are told, <hi>not the</hi> King, <hi>but the Authority of</hi> Parliament <hi>doth set up and take away all Courts,</hi> pag. 167.</p>
                     <p>Lo here we have Mr. <hi>Milton</hi>'s perfect Definition of a King: He is one to whom the People gave <hi>Power to see that nothing be done against Law, and that he keep our Laws, and not impose his own.</hi> Whereas all other men have the Faculty of Seeing by Nature, the King only hath it by the Gift of the People, other Power he hath none; he may see the Judges keep the Laws if they will; he cannot compell them, for he may not Imprison, Fine, nor punish any man; the Courts of Justice may, and they are set up and put down by the Parliament: yet in this very Definition of a King, we may spy an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power in the King; for he may wink if he will: and no other Power doth this Description of a King give, but only a Power to see: whereas it is said <hi>Aristotle doth mention an absolute Kingdom, for no other Cause, but to shew how absurd, unjust and most tyrannical it is.</hi> There is no such thing said by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but the contrary, where he saith, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>We are taught, that <hi>a Father and a King are things most diverse.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ans.</hi> Father and King are not so diverse; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that at first they were all one, for there is confessed <hi>Paternum imperium &amp; haereditarium,</hi> p. 141. and this Fatherly Empire, as it was of it self <hi>heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> so it was <hi>alienable</hi> by Patent, and <hi>seizable</hi> by an Usurper, as other goods are: and thus every King that now is, hath a Paternal Empire, either by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, or by Translation, or Usurpation; so a Father and a King may be all one.</p>
                     <p>A Father may dye for the Murther of his Son, where there is a Superiour Father to them both, or the Right of such a Supreme Father; but where there are onely Father and Sons, no Sons can questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Father for the death of their Brother: the reason why a King cannot be punished, is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is excepted from Punishment, or doth not deserve it, but because there is no Superiour to judge him, but God onely, to whom he is reserved.</p>

                     <p>Kings have been, and may be vitious men, and the Government of one, not so good as the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another; yet it doth not follow, that the Form of Government is, or can be in its own nature ill, because the Governour is so: it is Anarchy, or want of Government, that can totally destroy a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

After such time as the Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> practised to shake off Monarchy, then, and not till then, (which was after <hi>Homer</hi>'s time) the name of Tyrant was taken up for a word of Disgrace, for such men as by craft or Force wrested the Power of a City from a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to one man onely; and not for the <hi>exercising,</hi> but for the <hi>ill-obtaining</hi> of the Government: but now every man that is but thought to govern ill, or to be an ill man, is presently termed a Tyrant, and so judged by his Subjects.

                     <hi>Civilians, Canonists, Politicians</hi> and <hi>Divines,</hi> are not a little perplexed in distinguishing between the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Nations;</hi> about <hi>Ius Naturae,</hi> and <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> there is much Dispute by such as handle the Original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Community.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Civil Law in one Text allows a threefold Division of <hi>Law,</hi> into <hi>Ius Naturae, Ius Gentium,</hi> and <hi>Ius Civile.</hi> But in another Text of the same Law, we find only a twofold Division, into <hi>Ius Civile,</hi> and <hi>Ius Gentium.</hi> This latter Division the Law takes from <hi>Gaius,</hi> the former from <hi>Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian,</hi> who will have <hi>Ius Naturale</hi> to be <hi>that which Nature hath taught all Creatures, quod Natura om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia animalia Docuit,</hi> but for this he is confuted by <hi>Grotius, Salmasius,</hi> and others, who restrain the Law of Nature only to <hi>men using Reason;</hi> which makes it all one with the <hi>Law of Nations;</hi> to which the Canon Law consents, and saith, That <hi>Ius Naturale est commune omnium nationum: That which Natural Reason appoints all men to use, is the Law of Nations,</hi> saith <hi>Theophilus</hi> in the Text of the Civil Law: and in the second Book of the <hi>Instit. cap.</hi> 1. <hi>Ius Naturae</hi> is confounded with <hi>Ius Gentium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the <hi>Civilians</hi> sometimes confound and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times separate the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> and the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> so other-whiles they make them also contrary one to the other. <hi>By the Law of Nature all men are born free; Iure naturali omnes liberi nascuntur.</hi> But <hi>Servitude is by the Law of Nations: Iure Gentium Servitus invasit,</hi> saith <hi>Ulpian.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:104419:122"/>And the Civil Law not only makes the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> and of <hi>Nations</hi> contrary, but also will have the Law of Nations contrary to it self. <hi>War,</hi> saith the Law, <hi>was brought in by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Ex jure gentium introducta bella,</hi> and yet the Law of Nations saith, <hi>Since Nature hath made us all of one Kindred, it follows it is not lawful for one man to lye in Wait for another. Cùm inter nos cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitionem quandam natura constituit, consequens est ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem homini insidiari nefas esse,</hi> saith <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Civil Law teacheth, that <hi>from the Law of Nature proceeds the Conjunction of man and women, the Procreation and Education of Children.</hi> But as for <hi>Religion to God, and Obedience to Parents</hi> it makes it to be <hi>by the Law of Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To touch now the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> we may find in one place that <hi>men are governed either by the Law of Nature, or by Customs. Homines reguntur Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali jure, aut moribus.</hi> The <hi>Law of Nations</hi> they call a Divine Law, <hi>the Customs a humane Law; Leges aut divinae sunt aut humanae; divinae naturâ, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manae moribus constant.</hi> But in the next place the Canon Law makes <hi>Ius</hi> to be either <hi>Naturale, aut Civile, aut Gentium.</hi> Though this Division agree in Terms with that of <hi>Ulpian</hi> in the Civil Law, yet in the Explication of the Terms there is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity; for what one Law makes to belong to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> the other refers to the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> as may easily appear to him that will take the Pains to compare the Civil and Canon Law in these Points.</p>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:104419:123"/>A principal Ground of these Diversities and Contrarieties of Divisions, was an Error which the Heathens taught, that <hi>all things at first were common,</hi> and that <hi>all men were equal.</hi> This Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake was not so heinous in those Ethnick Authors of the Civil Laws, who wanting the Guide of the History of <hi>Moses,</hi> were fain to follow Poets and Fables for their Leaders. But for Christians, who have read the Scriptures, to dream either of a <hi>Community of all things,</hi> or <hi>an Equality of all Persons,</hi> is a Fault scarce pardonable.</p>
                  <p>To salve these apparent Contrarieties of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity</hi> and <hi>Property;</hi> or <hi>Equality</hi> and <hi>Subjection:</hi> the Law of <hi>Ius Gentium</hi> was first invented; when that could not satisfie, to mend the matter, this <hi>Ius Gentium,</hi> was divided into a <hi>Natural Law of Nations,</hi> and <hi>an Humane Law of Nations;</hi> and the Law of Nature into a <hi>Primary</hi> and a <hi>Secondary</hi> Law of Nature; Distinctions which make a great sound, but edifie not at all if they come under Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
                  <p>If there hath been a time when all things were common, and all men equal, and that it be otherwise now; we must needs conclude that the Law by which all things were common, and men equal, was contrary to the Law by which now things are proper, and men subject.</p>
                  <p>If we will allow <hi>Adam</hi> to have been Lord of the World and of his Children, there will need no such Distinctions of the Law of Nature and of Nations: For the Truth will be, that whatsoever the Heathens comprehended under these two Laws, is comprised in the Moral Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:104419:123"/>That the Law of Nature is one and the same with the Moral, may appear by a Definition gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Grotius. The Law of Nature</hi> (saith he) <hi>is the Dictate of Reason, shewing that in every Action by the agreeing or disagreeing of it with natural Reason, there is a moral Honesty or Dishonesty, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that such an Action is commanded or forbidden by God the Author of Nature.</hi> I cannot tell how <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> would otherwise have defined the Moral Law. And the <hi>Canon</hi> Law grants as much; teaching that <hi>the Law of Nature is contained in the Law and the Gospel: Whatsoever ye will that men do,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>The Term of <hi>Ius Naturae</hi> is not originally to be found in Scripture, for though <hi>T. Aquinas</hi> takes upon him to prove out of the 2. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that there is a <hi>Ius Naturae,</hi> yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not use those express Terms; his words are, <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles which have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law, these having not the Law are a Law unto themselves:</hi> He doth not say, Nature is a Law unto them, but they are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. As for that which they call the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> it is not a Law distinct, much less op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> but it is a small Branch or Parcel of that great Law; for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Law of Nature, or the moral Law between Nations. The same Commandment that forbids one Private man to rob another, or one Corporation to hurt another Corporation, obliges also one King not to rob another King, and one Commonwealth not to spoil another: the same Law that enjoyns Charity to all men, even to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104419:124"/>
binds Princes and States to shew Charity to one another, as well as private Persons.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>Common, or Civil Laws</hi> of each Kingdom which are made against Treason, Theft, Murder, Adultery, or the like, are all and every one of them grounded upon some particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the moral Law; so all the Laws of Nations must be subordinate and reducible to the moral Law.</p>
                  <p>The Law of Nature, or the moral Law is like the main Ocean, which though it be one entire Body, yet several Parts of it have distinct Names, according to the diversity of the Coasts on which they border. So it comes to pass that the Law of Nations which is but a part of the Law of Nature, may be sub-divided almost <hi>in infinitum,</hi> according to the Variety of the Persons, or Matters about which it is conversant.</p>
                  <p>The Law of Nature or the divine Law is general, and doth only comprehend some Principles of Morality notoriously known of themselves, or at the most is extended to those things which by necessary and evident Inference are consequent to those Principles. Besides these, many other things are necessary to the well-governing of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and therefore it was necessary that by Humane Reason something more in particular should be determined concerning those things which could not be defined by Natural Reason alone; hence it is that Humane Laws be necessary, as Comments upon the Text of the Moral Law: and of this Judgment is <hi>Aquinas,</hi> who teacheth, that <hi>necessitas legis humanae manat ex eo, quod Lex</hi>

Ludo. Molin de Iust.</hi> Thus much may suffice to shew the Distractions in and between the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Common Laws</hi> about the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations.</hi> In the next place we are to consider how <hi>Grotius</hi> distinguisheth these Laws.</p>
                  <p>To maintain the Community of things to be Natural, <hi>Grotius</hi> hath framed new Divisions of the law of Nature. First, in his Preface to his Books <hi>De Iure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> he produceth a Definition of the Law of Nature, in such doubtful, obscure and reserved Terms, as if he were diffident of his Undertaking: Next in his first Book and first Chapter he gives us another Distribution, which differs from his Doctrine in his Preface.</p>
                  <p>In his Preface his Principle is, that the <hi>Appetite of Society, that is to say, of Community, is an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proper to man.</hi> Here he presently corrects him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with an Exception, that <hi>some other Creatures are found to desire Society;</hi> and withal he answers the Objections thus, that <hi>this Desire of Society in brute Beasts, comes from some external Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> What he means by <hi>Principium intelligens ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecum,</hi> I understand not, nor doth he explain, nor is it material, nor is the Argument he useth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104419:125"/>
to any purpose; for, admitting all he saith to be true, yet his Principle fails; for the Question is not, from what Principle this Desire of Society proceeds in Beasts, but whether there be such a Desire or no. Besides, here he takes the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Society and Community to be all one, whereas many live in Society, which live not in Community.</p>
                  <p>Next he teacheth, that <hi>the keeping of Society (custodia Societatis) which in a rude manner</hi> (saith he) <hi>we have now expressed, is the fountain of that Law which is properly so called.</hi> I conceive by the Law properly so called, he intends the Law of Nature, though he express not so much: And to this appetite of <hi>Sociable Community</hi> he refers <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Abstinentia;</hi> but herein it may be he forgets himself, for where there is <hi>Community</hi> there is neither <hi>meum</hi> nor <hi>tuum,</hi> nor yet <hi>alienum;</hi> and if there be no <hi>alienum,</hi> there can be no <hi>alieni absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentia.</hi> To the same purpose he saith, that by <hi>the Law of Nature</hi> men must <hi>stand to bargains, Iuris naturae sit stare pactis.</hi> But if all things were common by Nature, how could there be any bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Grotius</hi> tells us, that <hi>from this significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Law there hath flowed another larger,</hi> which consists (saith he) <hi>in Discerning what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights us or hurts us, and in judging how things should be wisely distributed to each one.</hi> This latter he calls the <hi>looser Law of Nature;</hi> the former, <hi>Ius Sociale, the Law of Nature, strictly, or proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken. And these two Laws of Nature should have place</hi> (saith he) <hi>though men should deny there were</hi>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:104419:125"/>

                  <p>In the Definition of <hi>Ius Naturale</hi> he omits those Subtilties of <hi>Ius Naturae propriè dictum,</hi> and <hi>quod laxius ita dicitur,</hi> which we find in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, and gives such a plain Definition, as may fitly agree to the Moral Law. By this it seems the Law of Nature and the Moral Law are one and the same.</p>

                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:104419:126"/>Whereas he affirmeth, that <hi>the Actions about which the Law of Nature is conversant, are lawful or unlawful of themselves, and therefore are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily commanded or forbidden by God: by which mark this Law of Nature doth not onely differ from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law, but from the Divine voluntary Law, which doth not command or forbid those things, which of themselves, and by their own nature are lawful or unlawful, but makes them unlawful by forbidding them, and due by commanding them.</hi> In this he seems to make the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from <hi>Gods Voluntary Law;</hi> whereas, in God, <hi>Necessary</hi> and <hi>Voluntary</hi> are all one. <hi>Salmasius de Usuris,</hi> in the twentieth Chapter, condemns this opinion of <hi>Grotius;</hi> though he name him not, yet he means him, if I mistake not.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, I observe his saying, that some things are by the Law of Nature, not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè,</hi> but <hi>reductivè;</hi> and that the <hi>Law of Nature deals not onely with those things which are beside the Will of Man, but also with many things which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the act of Mans Will: so Dominion, such as is now in Use, mans Will brought in: but now that it is brought in, it is against the Law of Nature, to take that from thee against thy Will, which is in thy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet for all this <hi>Grotius</hi> maintains that the <hi>Law of Nature is so immutable, that it cannot be changed by God himself.</hi> He means to make it good with a Distinction, <hi>Some things</hi> (saith he) <hi>are by the Law of Nature, but not simply, but according to the certain State of things; so the common use of things was natural as long as Dominion was not</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:104419:126"/>
                     <hi>brought in; and Right for every man to take his own by Force, before Laws were made.</hi> Here if <hi>Grotius</hi> would have spoken plain, in stead of <hi>but not simply, but according to the certain State of Things,</hi> he would have said, <hi>but not immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but for a certain Time.</hi> And then this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction would have run thus; <hi>Some things are by the Law of Nature, but not immutably, but for a certain time.</hi> This must needs be the naked Sense of his Distinction, as appears by his Explication in the Words following, where he saith, that <hi>the Common Use of Things was natural so long as domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was not brought in:</hi> Dominion he saith was brought in by the will of man, whom by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <hi>Grotius</hi> makes to be able to change that Law which God himself cannot change, as he saith. He gives a double ability to man; first, to make that no Law of Nature, which God made to be the Law of Nature: And next, to make that a Law of Nature which God made not; for now that Dominion is brought in, he maintains, it is against the Law of Nature to take that which is in another mans dominion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ius Humanum voluntarium latius patens,</hi> he makes to be <hi>the Law of Nations, which</hi> (saith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e) <hi>by the Will of All, or Many Nations, hath received a power to bind,</hi> he adds, <hi>of Many, because</hi>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:104419:127"/>
                     <hi>there is,</hi> as he grants, <hi>scarce any Law to be found common to all Nations, besides the Law of Nature; which also is wont to be called the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being common to all Nations.</hi> Nay, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth <hi>often, that is the Law in one part of the World, which in another part of the World is not the Law of Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By these Sentences, it seems <hi>Grotius</hi> can scarce tell what to make to be the Law of Nations, or where to find it.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he makes the Law of Nations to have a binding Power from the Will of men, it must be remembred, that it is not sufficient for men to have a Will to bind, but it is necessary also to have a Power to bind: Though several Nations have one and the same Law.</p>
                  <p>For instance, Let it be granted that Theft is punished by Death in many Countreys, yet this doth not make it to be a Law of Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause each Nation hath it but as a Natural, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Law of their own Countrey; and though it have a binding Power from the Will of many Nations, yet because each Nation hath but a Will and Power to bind themselves, and may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice consent, or, consulting of any Neighbour-Nation, Alter this Law, if they find Cause, it cannot properly be called <hi>the Law of Nations.</hi> That which is the foundation of the Law of Nations, is, to have it concern <hi>such things as belong to the mutual Society of</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 4. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Nations among themselves,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> confesseth; and not of such things as have no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther relation than to the particular Benefit of each Kingdom: For, as private men must neglect
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:104419:127"/>
their own Profit for the Good of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; so particular Nations must sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit part of their Benefit, for the Good of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that in particular Kingdomes and Common-wealths there be Civil and National Laws, and also Customs that obtain the Force of Laws: But yet such Laws are ordained by some supreme Power, and the Customs are examined judged and allowed by the same supreme Power. Where there is no Supreme Power that extends over all or many Nations but only God himself, there can be no Laws made to bind Nations, but such as are made by God himself: we cannot find that God made any Laws to bind Nations, but only the Moral Law; as for the Judicial Law, though it were ordained by God, yet it was not the Law of Nations, but of one Nation only, and fitted to that Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>If any think that the Customs wherein many Nations do consent, may be called the Law of Nations, as well as the Customs of any one Nation may be esteemed for national Laws: They are to consider that it is not the being of a Custom that makes it lawful, for then all Customs, even evil Customs, would be lawful; but it is the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the supreme Power that gives a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the Custom: where there is no Supreme Power over many Nations, their Customs cannot be made legal.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Grotius</hi> is, that <hi>God immediately after the Creation did bestow</hi>

                  <p>How repugnant this Assertion of <hi>Grotius</hi> is to the Truth of Holy Scripture, Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 1. c. 4.</note> teacheth us in his <hi>Mare Clausum,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Adam <hi>by Donation from God,</hi> Gen. 1. 28. <hi>was made the general Lord of all things, not without such a private Dominion to himself, as (without his Grant) did exclude his Children: and by Donation and Assignation, or some kind of Cession (before he was dead, or left any Heir to succeed him) his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had their distinct Territories by Right of private Dominion:</hi> Abel <hi>had his Flocks, and Pastures for them;</hi> Cain <hi>had his Fields for Corn, and the Land of</hi> Nod <hi>where he built himself a City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>This Determination of Mr. <hi>Selden's</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to the History of the Bible, and to natural Reason, doth contradict the Doctrine of <hi>Grotius:</hi> I cannot conceive why Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards affirm, that <hi>neither the Law of Nature, nor the Divine Law, do cammand or forbid either Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of all things or private Dominion, but permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth both.</hi>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:104419:128"/>As for the general Community between <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> will have to be granted to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 2. the Text doth not warrant it; for although the Sons are there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with <hi>Noah</hi> in the Blessing, yet it may best be understood with a Subordination or a Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Succession, the Blessing might truly be fulfilled, if the Sons either under, or after their Father enjoyed a Private Dominion: it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the private Dominion which God gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> and by his Donation, Assignation or Cession to his Children was abrogated, and a Community of all things instituted between <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, at the time of the Flood: <hi>Noah</hi> was left the sole heir of the World, why should it be thought that God would dis-inherit him of his Birth-right, and make him of all the men in the World, the only Tenant in Common with his Children? If the Blessing given to <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 1. 28. be compared to that given to <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 2. there will be found a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difference between those two Texts: In the Benediction of <hi>Adam,</hi> we find expressed a <hi>subduing of the Earth, and a Dominion over the Creatures,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which are expressed in the Blessing of <hi>Noah</hi> nor the Earth there once named, it is only said, <hi>The Fear of you shall be upon the Creatures, and into your hands are they delivered;</hi> then immediately it follows, <hi>Every moving thing shall be meat for you, as the green Herb:</hi> The first Blessing gave <hi>Adam Dominion</hi> over the Earth and all Creatures, the latter allows <hi>Noah</hi> Liberty to use the living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for Food: here is no Alteration or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104419:129"/>
of his Title to a Propriety of all things but an Enlargement onely of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
                  <p>But, whether, with <hi>Grotius,</hi> Community came in at the Creation, or, with Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> at the Flood, they both agree it did not long continue; <hi>Sed veri non est simile hujusmodi communionem diu ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuisse,</hi> is the confession of Mr. <hi>Selden.</hi> It seems strange that <hi>Grotius</hi> should maintain, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of all things should be by the Law of Nature, of which God is the Author; and yet such Community should not be able to continue: Doth it not derogate from the Providence of God Almighty, to ordain a Community which could not continue? or doth it make the Act of our Fore-fathers, in Abrogating the natural Law of Community, by introducing that of Propriety, to be a Sin of a high presumption?</p>
                  <p>The prime Duties of the Second Table are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about the Right of Propriety: but if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be brought in by a Humane Law (as <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> teacheth) then the Moral Law depends upon the Will of man. There could be no Law against Adultery or Theft, if Women and all things were common.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith, that the Law of Nature, or of God, <hi>nec vetuit, nec jubebat, sed permisit utrumque, tam nempe rerum communionem quàm privatum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium.</hi> And yet for Propriety (which he terms <hi>primaeva rerum Dominia</hi>) he teacheth, that <hi>Adam received it from God, à Numine acceperat:</hi> And for Community, he saith, <hi>We meet with evident foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of the Community of things in that donation of God, by which</hi> Noah <hi>and his three Sons are made</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:104419:129"/>
                     <hi>Domini pro indiviso rerum omnium.</hi> Thus he makes the private Dominion of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as the common Dominion of <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, to be both by the Will of God. Nor doth he shew how <hi>Noah,</hi> or his Sons, or their Posterity, had any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to alter the Law of Community which was given them by God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In distributing Territories</hi> (Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> saith) <hi>the Consent, as it were, of Mankind (passing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which should also bind their Posterity) did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, so that men departed from their common Right of Communion of those things which were so distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to particular Lords or Masters.</hi> This Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Consent of Mankind, we must take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Credit; for there is not the least proof offered for it out of Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>How the Consent of Mankind could bind Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity when all things were common, is a Point not so evident: where Children take nothing by Gift or by Descent from their Parents, but have an equal and common Interest with them, there is no reason in such cases, that the Acts of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should bind the Sons.</p>
                  <p>I find no Cause why Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> should call <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity a pristine Right;</hi> since he makes it but to begin in <hi>Noah,</hi> and to end in <hi>Noah's</hi> Children, or Grand-children at the most; for he confesseth the Earth, <hi>à Noachidis seculis aliquot post diluvium esse divisam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ancient Tradition, which by Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> acknowledgment hath obtained Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every where, seems most reasonable, in that it tells us, that <hi>Noah himself, as Lord of all, was Author of the distribution of the</hi>

                     <hi>World, and of private Dominion, and that by the appointment of an Oracle from God, he did confirm this Distribution by his last Will and Testament, which at his Death he left in the hands of his eldest Son</hi> Sem, <hi>and also warned all his Sons, that none of them should invade any of their Brothers Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or injure one another, because from thence Discord and Civil War would necessarily follow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many conclusions in <hi>Grotius</hi> his Book <hi>de Iure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> are built upon the foundation of these two Principles.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>The first is, That</hi> Communis rerum usus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis fuit.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>The second is, that</hi> Dominium quale nune in usu est, voluntas humana introduxit.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Upon these two Propositions of natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity and voluntary Propriety, depend divers Dangerous and Seditious conclusions, which are dispersed in several places. In the fourth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the first Book, the Title of which Chapter is, <hi>Of the War of Subjects against Superiours; Grotius</hi> handleth the Question, <hi>Whether the Law of not resisting Superiours, do bind us in most grievous and most certain danger?</hi> And his Determination is, that <hi>this Law of not resisting Superiours, seems to depend upon the Will of those men who at first joyned themselves in a Civil Society, from whom the Right of Government doth come to them that govern; if those had been at first asked, if their Will were to impose this burthen upon all, that they should choose rather to dye, than in any case by Arms to repell the force of Superiours; I know not whether they would answer, that it was their Will, unless perhaps with</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:104419:130"/>
                     <hi>this addition, if Resistance cannot be made but with the great disturbance of the Commonwealth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of many Innocents.</hi> Here we have his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that in great and certain danger, men may resist their Governours, if it may be without disturbance of the Commonwealth: if you would know who should be Judge of the greatness and certainty of the Danger, or how we may know it, <hi>Grotius</hi> hath not one word of it, so that for ought appears to the contrary, his Mind may be that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private man may be Judge of the Danger, for other Judge he appoints none; it had been a foul Fault in so desperate a Piece of Service, as the resisting of Superiors, to have concealed the lawful Means, by which we may judge of the Greatness or Certainty of publick Danger, before we lift up our hands against Authority, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how prone most of us are, to censure and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake those things for great and certain Dangers, which in Truth many Times are no dangers at all, or at the most but very small ones; and so flatter our selves, that by resisting our Superiours we may do our Country laudible Service, without Disturbance of the Commonwealth, since the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Sedition cannot be certainly judged of but by the Events only.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> proceeds to answer an Objection against this Doctrine of resisting Superiors. <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>any man shall say that this rigid Doctrine of dying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rather then resisting any Injuries of Superiours, is no humane, but a divine Law: It is to be noted, that men at first, not by any Precept of God, but of their own Accord, led by Experience of the Infirmities of</hi>
                     <pb n="52" facs="tcp:104419:131"/>
                     <hi>separated Families against Violence, did meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Civil Society, from whence Civil Power took beginning, which therefore St.</hi> Peter <hi>calls an humane Ordinance, although elsewhere it be called a divine Ordinance, because God approveth the wholsome Institutions of men; God in Approving a humane Law is to be thought to approve it as humane, and in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again in another place he goeth further, and teacheth us, that <hi>if the Question happen to be concerning the Primitive Will of the People, it will not be amiss for the People that now are, and which are accounted the same with them that were long ago, to express their Meaning, in this matter, which is to be followed, unless it cetainly appear, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple long ago willed otherwise.</hi> lib. 2. c. 2.</p>
                  <p>For fuller Explication of his Judgment about resisting Superiours, he concludes thus: <hi>The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the thing is which is to be preserved, the greater is the Equity which reacheth forth an Exception against the words of the Law: yet I dare not</hi> (saith <hi>Grotius) without Difference condemn either simple men or a lesser part of the People, who in the last Refuge of Necessity, do so use this Equity, as that in the mean time, they do not forsake the Respect of the common Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Doctrine of <hi>Grotius</hi> is, that <hi>the Empire which is exercised by Kings, doth not cease to be the Empire of the People; that Kings who in a lawful Order succeed those who were elected, have the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power by an usufructuary Right only, and no Propriety.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Furthermore he teacheth, that <hi>the People may choose what Form of Government they please, and their</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:104419:131"/>
                     <hi>Will is the Rule of Right.</hi> Populus eligere potest qualem vult gubernationis formam, neque ex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia formae, sed ex voluntate jus metiendum est. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Also, that <hi>the People choosing a King may reserve some Acts to themselves, and may bestow others upon the King, with full Authority, if either an express Partition be appointed, or if the People being yet free do command their future King, by way of a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Command, or if any thing be added by which it may be understood, that the King may be compelled or else punished.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these Passages of <hi>Grotius</hi> which I have cited, we find evidently these Doctrines.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That Civil Power depends on the Will of the People.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>That private men or petty Multitudes may take up Arms against their Princes.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That the lawfullest Kings have no Propriety in their Kingdoms, but an usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuary Right only: as if the People were the Lords, and Kings but their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>That the Law of Not resisting Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, is a humane Law, depending on the Will of the People at first.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>5. <hi>That the Will of the first People, if it be not known, may be expounded by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that now are.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:104419:132"/>No Doubt but <hi>Grotius</hi> foresaw what Uses the People might make of these Doctrines, by conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if the chief Power be in the People, that then it is lawful for them to compel and punish Kings as oft as they misuse their Power: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us, he <hi>rejects the Opinion of them, who every where and without Exception will have the chief Power to be so the Peoples, that it is lawful for them to compel and punish Kings as oft as they misuse their Power;</hi> and <hi>this Opinion</hi> he confesseth <hi>if it be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether received, hath been and may be the Cause of many Evils.</hi> This cautelous Rejection qualified with these Terms of <hi>every where without Exception,</hi> and <hi>altogether,</hi> makes but a mixt Negation, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>negative,</hi> and partly <hi>affirmative</hi> (which our Lawyers call a <hi>negative Repugnant</hi>) which brings forth this modal Proposition, <hi>that in some Places with Exception, and in some sort the People may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and punish their Kings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let us see how <hi>Grotius</hi> doth refute the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion, <hi>that People may correct</hi> Kings. He frames his Argument in these words, <hi>It is lawful for every man to yield himself to be a private Servant to whom he please. What should hinder, but that also it may be lawful for a free People so to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to one or more, that the Right of governing them be fully set over without retaining any part of the Right? and you must not say, That this may not be presumed, for we do not now seek, what in a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful case may be presumed, but what by Right may be done.</hi> Thus far is the Argument, in which the most that is proved (if we gratifie him, and yield his whole Argument for good) is this, that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104419:132"/>
                     <hi>the People may grant away their Power without retaining any part.</hi> But what is this to what the People have done? for though the People may give away their Power without Reservation of any part to themselves; yet if they have not so done, but have reserved a part, <hi>Grotius</hi> must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that the People may compel and punish their Kings if they transgress: so that by his Favour, the Point will be, not what by Right may be done, but what in this doubtful case hath been done, since by his own Rule <hi>it is the Will and Meaning of the first People that joyned in Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> that must regulate the Power of their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours.</p>
                  <p>But on <hi>Grotius</hi> side it may be urged, that in all Presumption the People have given away their whole Power to Kings, unless they can prove they have reserved a part; for if they will have any Benefit of a Reservation or Exception, it lies on their part to prove their Exception, and not on the Kings Part who are in Possession.</p>
                  <p>This Answer, though in it self it be most just and good; yet of all men <hi>Grotius</hi> may not use it. For he saves the People the Labour of proving the primitive Reservation of their Forefathers, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the People that now are competent Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the meaning of those first Ancestors, who may justly be presumed, not to have been either so improvident for themselves, or so negligent of all their Posterity, when by the Law of Nature they were free and had all things common, at an Instant with any Condition or Limitation to give away that Liberty and Right of Community,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:104419:133"/>
and to make themselves and their Children eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally subject to the Will of such Governours as might misuse them without Controul.</p>
                  <p>On the behalf of the People, it may be further answered to <hi>Grotius,</hi> that although our Ancestors had made an absolute Grant of their Liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Condition expressed, yet it must be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily implyed, that it was upon condition to be well-governed, and that the Non-performance of that implyed Condition, makes the Grant void; Or, if we will not allow an implicit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, then it may be said, that the Grant in it self was a void Grant, for being unreasonable, and a violation of the Law of Nature, without any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Consideration. What sound Reply <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> can return to such Answers, I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if he keep himself to his first Principle of natural Community. As <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Argument against the People is not sound, so his Answer to the Argument that is made for the People, is not satisfactory. It is objected, that <hi>he that ordains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is above him that is ordained. Grotius</hi> answers, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum duntaxat est in ea constitutione cujus effectus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuò pendet à voluntate constituentis, non etiam in ea quae ab initio est voluntatis, postea verò effectum habet necessitatis, quomodo mulier virum sibi constituit, cui parere semper habet necesse.</hi> The Reply may be, that by <hi>Grotius</hi>'s former Doctrine the very Effect of the Constitution of Kings by the People, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends perpetually upon the Will of them that Constitute, and upon no other Necessity: he will not say, that it is by any necessity of the Law of Nature, or by any positive Law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

By this we may judge how improperly he useth the instance of a Woman, that appoints her self a Husband, whom she must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes necessarily obey, since the necessity of the continuance of the Wives obedience depends upon the Law of God, which hath made the Bond of Matrimony indissolvable. <hi>Grotius</hi> will not say the like for the continuance of the Subjects obedience to the Prince, neither will he say that Women may choose Husbands, as he tells us the People may choose Kings, by giving their Husbands as little Power, and for as little a Time as they please.</p>
                  <p>Next, it is objected, that <hi>Tutors who are set over Pupils may be removed, if they abuse their Power. Grotius</hi> answers, <hi>In tutore hoc procedit qui superiorem habet, at in imperiis quia progressus non datur in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum</hi>

                  <p>Thus we find but two means acknowledged by <hi>Grotius,</hi> whereby <hi>a King may obtain a full Right of Propriety in a Kingdome: That is, either by a just War, or by Donation of the People.</hi>

other Right can be obtained by War, than what the Title bringeth; for a just War doth onely put the Conquerour in possession of his old Right, but not create a New. The like which <hi>Grotius</hi> saith of Succession, may be said of War. <hi>Succession</hi> (saith he) <hi>is no Title of a Kingdome, which gives a Form to the Kingdom, but a Continuation of the Old; for the Right which began by the Election of the Family, is continued by Succession<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore, so much as the first Election gave, so much the Succession brings.</hi> So to a Conquerour that hath a Title, War doth not give, but put him in possession of a Right: and except the Conquerour had a full Right of Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety at first, his Conquest cannot give it him: for if originally he and his Ancestors had but an usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fructuary Right, and were outed of the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Kingdom by an Usurper: here, though the Re-conquest be a most just War, yet shall not the Conquerour in this case gain any full Right of Propriety, but must be remitted to his usufru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary Right onely: for what Justice can it be, that the Injustice of a third Person, an Usurper, should prejudice the People, to the devesting of them of that Right of Propriety, which was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in their first Donation to their Elected King, to whom they gave but an usufructuary Right, as <hi>Grotius</hi> conceiveth? Wherefore it seems impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that there can be a just War, whereby a full Right of Propriety may be gained, according to <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Principles. For if a King come in by Conquest, he must either conquer them that have a Governour, or those People that have none: if they have no Governour, then they are a free
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:104419:137"/>
People, and so the War will be unjust to conquer those that are Free, especially if the Freedom of the People be by the primary Law of Nature, as <hi>Grotius</hi> teacheth: But if the People conquered have a Governour, that Governour hath either a Title or not; If he have a Title, it is an unjust War that takes the Kingdom from him: If he have no Title, but only the Possession of a Kingdom, yet it is unjust for any other man, that wants a Title also, to conquer him that is but in possession; for it is a just Rule, that where <hi>the Cases are alike, he that is in Possession is in the better condition; In pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri causa possidentis melior conditio.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 23. And this by the Law of Nature, even in the judgment of <hi>Grotius.</hi> But if it be admitted, that he that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to conquer have a Title, and he that is in possession hath none: here the Conquest is but in nature of a possessory Action, to put the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in possession of a primer Right, and not to raise a new Title; for War begins where the Law fails: <hi>Ubi Iudicia deficiunt incipit Bellum.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 1. And thus, upon the matter, I cannot find in <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Book <hi>de Iure Belli,</hi> how that any Case can be put wherein <hi>by a just War a man may become a King,</hi> pleno Jure Proprietatis.</p>
                  <p>All Government and Supreme Power is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon publick Subjection, which is thus defined by <hi>Grotius. Publica Subjectio est, qua se Populus homini alicui, aut pluribus hominibus, aut etiam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo alteri in ditionem dat.</hi> Lib. 2. c. 5. If Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the Gift of the People, how can Supreme Power, <hi>pleno Iure,</hi> in full Right, be got by a just War?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:104419:138"/>As to the other means whereby Kings may get Supreme Power in full Right of Propriety, <hi>Grotius</hi> will have it to be, <hi>when some People, for avoiding a greater Evil, do so yield themselves into anothers Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as that they do except nothing.</hi> It would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered how, without War, any People can be brought into such danger of Life, as that because they can find no other wayes to defend themselves, or because they are so pressed with Poverty, as they cannot otherwise have means to sustain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they are forced to renounce all Right of Governing themselves, and deliver it to a King.</p>
                  <p>But if such a Case cannot happen, but by a War onely, which reduceth a People to such terms of Extremity, as compells them to an absolute Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renuntiation of all Sovereignty: then War, which causeth that necessity, is the prime means of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting such Sovereignty, and not the free Gift of the People, who cannot otherwise choose but give away that Power which they cannot keep.</p>
                  <p>Thus, upon the Reckoning, the two ways pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by <hi>Grotius,</hi> are but one way; and that one way, in conclusion, is no way whereby Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power may be had in full Right of Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. His two ways are, a <hi>Iust War,</hi> or a <hi>Donation of the People;</hi> a just War cannot be without a Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, no Title without the Donation of the People, no Donation without such a Necessity as nothing can bring upon the Donors but a War. So that howsoever <hi>Grotius</hi> in words acknowledges that Kings may have a full Right of Propriety, yet by consequence he denies it, by such circular Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as by coincidence destroy each other, and in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:104419:138"/>
effect he leaves all People a Right to plead in Bar against the Right of Propriety of any Prince, either <hi>per minas,</hi> or <hi>per dures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times, saith <hi>Grotius,</hi> it happens, that War is grounded upon <hi>Expletive Iustice, Iustitiam Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletricem,</hi> which is, <hi>when a man cannot obtain what he ought, he takes that which is as much in value, which in moral Estimation is the same.</hi> For in War, when the same Province cannot be recovered, to the which a man hath a Title, he recovers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the like value. This recovery cannot give a full right of Propriety: because the Justice of such a War reacheth no farther than to a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for a former Right to another thing, and therefore can give no new Right.</p>
                  <p>I am bound to take notice of a Case put by <hi>Grotius,</hi> amongst those Causes which he thinks should move the People to renounce all their Right of Governing, and give it to another. <hi>It may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so happen</hi> (saith he) <hi>that a Father of a Family possessing large Territories, will not receive any man to dwell within his Land upon any other condition.</hi> And in another place, he saith, that <hi>all Kings are not made by the People, which may be sufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the Examples of a Father of a Family receiving Strangers under the Law of Obedience.</hi> In both these Passages we have a close and curt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, that a <hi>Father of a Family may be an absolute King over Strangers, without Choice of the People;</hi> now I would know whether such Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families have not the same absolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over their own Children, without the Peoples Choice, which he allows them over Strangers:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:104419:139"/>
if they have, I cannot but call them Absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary Kings, though <hi>Grotius</hi> be not willing to give them that Title in plain terms: for indeed to allow such Kings, were to condemn his own Principle, that <hi>Dominion came in by the Will of the People;</hi> and so consequently to overthrow his <hi>Usufructuary Kings,</hi> of whom I am next to speak.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, that <hi>the Law of Obeying, or Resisting Princes, depends upon the Will of them who first met in Civil Society, from whom Power doth flow to Kings:</hi> And, that <hi>men of their own accord came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into Civil Society, from whence springs Civil Power, and the People may choose what Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they please.</hi> Upon these Suppositions, he concludes, that Kings, elected by the People, have but an <hi>Usufructuary Right,</hi> that is, a Right to take the Profit or Fruit of the Kingdom, but not a Right of Propriety or Power to alienate it. But why doth he call it an <hi>Usufructuary Right?</hi> It seems to me a term too mean or base to express the Right of any King, and is derogatory to the Dignity of Supreme Majesty. The word <hi>Usufru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> is used by the Lawyers, to signifie him that hath the Use, Profit or Fruit of some Corporal thing, that may be used without the Property; for of <hi>fungible things (res fungibiles,</hi> the <hi>Civilians</hi> call them) that are spent or consumed in the Use, as Corn, Wine, Oyl, Money, there cannot be an <hi>Usufructuary Right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to make a Kingdom all one with a Farm, as if it had no other Use but to be let out to him that can make most of it: whereas, in truth, it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:104419:139"/>
the Part and Duty of a King to govern, and he hath a Right so to do, and to that End Supreme Power is given unto him; the taking of the Profit, or making Use of the Patrimony of the Crown, is but as a means onely to enable him to perform that great work of Government.</p>
                  <p>Besides, <hi>Grotius</hi> will not onely have an elected King, but also his lawful Successors, to have but an <hi>Usufructuary Right,</hi> so that though a King hath a Crown to him and to his Heirs, yet he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him no Propriety, because he hath no Power to alienate it; for he supposeth the primary Will of the People to have been to bestow Supreme Power to go in Succession, and not to be alienable; but for this he hath no better proof than a naked presumption: <hi>In Regnis quae Populi voluntate delata sunt concedo non esse praesumendum eam fuisse Populi voluntatem, ut alienatio Imperii sui Regi permitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But though he will not allow Kings a Right of Propriety in their Kingdoms, yet a Right of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety there must be in some body, and in whom but in the People? for he saith, <hi>the Empire which is exercised by Kings, doth not cease to be the Empire of the People.</hi> His meaning is, the Use is the King's, but the Property is the Peoples.</p>
                  <p>But if the Power to alienate the Kingdom be in him that hath the Property, this may prove a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Doctrine to the People: but yet to allow a Right of Succession in Kings, and still to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a Right of Property in the People, may make some contradiction: for the Succession must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hinder the Right of Alienation which is in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:104419:140"/>
People, or the Alienation must destroy that Right of Succession, which, by <hi>Grotius</hi>'s confession, may attend upon elected Kings.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Grotius</hi> confess, that Supreme Power be <hi>Unum quiddam, and in it self indivisible,</hi> yet he saith, <hi>Sometimes it may be divided either by parts po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential, or subjunctive.</hi> I take his meaning to be, that the Government or the Governed may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided: an Example he gives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, which was divided, into the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West:</hi> but whereas he saith, <hi>fieri potest,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>It may be, the People choosing a King, may reserve some Actions to themselves, and in others they may give full power to the King:</hi> The Example he brings out of <hi>Plato</hi> of the <hi>Heraclides</hi> doth not prove it, and it is to dream of such a Form of Government as never yet had name, nor was ever found in any settled Kingdom, nor cannot possibly be without strange Confusion.</p>
                  <p>If it were a thing so voluntary, and at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of men, when they were free, to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under Subjection, why may they not as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily leave Subjection when they please, and be free again? If they had a liberty to change their Natural Freedom, into a voluntary Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is stronger reason that they may change their voluntary Subjection into natural Freedom, since it is as lawful for men to alter their Wills as their Judgments.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, it was a rare felicity, that all the men in the World at one instant of time should agree together in one mind, to change the Natural Community of all things into Private Dominion:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:104419:140"/>
for without such an unanimous Consent, it was not possible for Community to be altered: for, if but one man in the World had dissented, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration had been unjust, because that Man by the Law of Nature had a Right to the common Use of all things in the World; so that to have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Propriety of any one thing to any other, had been to have robbed him of his Right to the common Use of all things. And of this Judgment the Jesuit <hi>Lud. Molina</hi> seems to be, in his Book <hi>De Iustitia,</hi> where he saith, <hi>Si aliquis de cohabit an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If one of the Neighbours will not give his Consent to it, the Commonwealth should have no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over him, because then every other man hath no Right or Authority over him, and therefore can they not give Authority to the Commonwealth over him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If our first Parents, or some other of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers did voluntarily bring in Propriety of Goods, and Subjection to Governours, and it were in their power either to bring them in or not, or having brought them in, to alter their minds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store them to their first condition of Community and Liberty; what reason can there be alleged that men that now live should not have the same power? So that if any one man in the World, be he never so mean or base, will but alter his Will, and say, he will resume his Natural Right to Community, and be restored unto his Natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and consequently take what he please, and do what he list; who can say that such a man doth more than by Right he may? And then it will be lawful for every man, when he please,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:104419:141"/>
to dissolve all Government, and Destroy all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, <hi>That by the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all things were at first Common;</hi> and yet teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>after Propriety was brought in, it was against the Law of Nature to use Community;</hi> He doth thereby not onely make the Law of Nature changeable, which he saith God cannot do, but he also makes the Law of Nature contrary to it self.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>WE do but flatter our selves, if we hope ever to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned without an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power. No: we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, the Question is not, Whether there shall be an Arbitrary Power; but the only point is, Who shall have that Arbitrary Power, whether one man or many? There never was, nor ever can be any People go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd without a Power of making Laws, and every Power of making Laws must be Arbitrary: For to make a Law according to Law, is <hi>Contradictio in adjecto.</hi> It is generally confessed, that in a Democracy the Supreme or Arbitrary Power of making Laws is in a multitude; and so in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristocracy the like Legislative or Arbitrary Power is in a few, or in the Nobility. And therefore by a necessary Consequence, in a Monarchy the same Legislative Power must be in one; according to the Rule of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104419:143"/>
who saith, <hi>Government is in One, or in a Few, or in Many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This antient Doctrine of Government, in these latter days hath been strangely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by the Romanists, and wonderfully improved since the Reformation, especially in point of Monarchy, by an Opinion, <hi>That the People have Originally a Power to create several sorts of Monarchy, to limit and compound them with other Forms of Government, at their pleasure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for this natural Power of the People, they finde neither Scripture, Reason, or Practice to justifie it: For though several Kingdoms have several and distinct Laws one from another; yet that doth not make several sorts of Monarchy: Nor doth the difference of obtaining the Supreme Power, whether by Conquest, Election, Succession, or by any other way, make different sorts of Government. It is the difference only of the Authors of the Laws, and not of the Laws themselves, that alters the Form of Government; that is, whether one man, or more than one, make the Laws.</p>
                  <p>Since the growth of this new Doctrine, <hi>Of the Limitation and Mixture of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> it is most apparent, that <hi>Monarchy</hi> hath been crucified (as it were) between
<pb facs="tcp:104419:143"/>
two Thieves, the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>People;</hi> for what <hi>Principles</hi> the <hi>Papists</hi> make use of for the Power of the <hi>Pope</hi> above Kings, the very same, by blotting out the word <hi>Pope,</hi> and putting in the word <hi>People,</hi> the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bists</hi> take up to use against their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns.</p>
                  <p>If we would truely know what <hi>Popery</hi> is, we shall finde by the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, that the main, and indeed the only Point of <hi>Popery, is the alienating and withdrawing of Subjects from their Obedience to their Prince, to raise Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Rebellion:</hi> If <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity</hi> agree in this Point, the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Christendome,</hi> that have shaken off the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> have made no great bargain of it, if in place of one Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they get many Lords at home within their own Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>I cannot but reverence that Form of Government which was allowed and made use of for God's own People, and for all other Nations. It were Impiety, to think that God, who was careful to appoint Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial Laws for his chosen People, would not furnish them with the best Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: or to imagine that the Rules given in divers places in the Gospel, by
<pb facs="tcp:104419:144"/>
our blessed Saviour and his Apostles, for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Kings, should now, like Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks out of date, be of no use to us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is pretended, <hi>We have a Form of Government now,</hi> not once thought of in those days. It is a shame and scandal for us Christians, to seek the Original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment from the Inventions or Fictions of Poets, Orators, Philosophers, and Heathen Historians, who all lived thousands of Years after the <hi>Creation,</hi> and were (in a manner) ignorant of it: and to neglect the Scriptures, which have with more Authority most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly given us the <hi>true Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles of Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These Considerations caused me to scruple this Modern piece of Politicks, touching <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> and <hi>Mixed Monarchy:</hi> and finding no other that presented us with the nature and means of <hi>Limitation</hi> and <hi>Mixture,</hi> but an <hi>Anonymus</hi> Authour; I have drawn a few brief Observations upon the most consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of his <hi>Treatise,</hi> in which I desire to receive satisfaction from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour himself, if it may be, according to his promise in his <hi>Preface;</hi> or if not from him, from any other for him.</p>

                  <head>THE ANARCHY. Of a Limited or Mixed MONARCHY.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is scarce the meanest man of the multitude, but can now in these days tell us that the Government <hi>of the Kingdome of</hi> England <hi>is a</hi> LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITED <hi>and</hi> MIXED <hi>Monarchy:</hi> And it is no marvail, since all the disputes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of these distracted times both from the Pulpit and the Presse to tend and end in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
                  <p>The Author of the Treatise of Monarchy hath copiously handled the nature and manner of <hi>Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>Mixed</hi> Monarchy, and is the first and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man (that I know) hath undertaken the task of describing it; others onely mention it, as taking it for granted.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> gives the Author of this Treatise of Monarchy this testimony, that <hi>the Mixture of Government is more accurately delivered</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and urged by this Treatise than by the Author</hi>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:104419:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>of the Fuller Answer.</hi> And in another place Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> saith, he allows his <hi>distinction of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy into Limited and Mixed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have with some diligence looked over this Treatise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but cannot approve of these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions which he propounds; I submit the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of my dislike to others judgements. I am somewhat confident that his doctrine of <hi>Limited and Mixed Monarchy</hi> is an opinion but of yesterday, and of no antiquity, a meer innovation in policy, not so old as <hi>New England,</hi> though calculated pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for that Meridian. For in his first part of the Treatise which concerns Monarchy in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, there is not one proof, text, or example in Scripture that he hath produced to justifie his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of <hi>Limited</hi> and <hi>Mixed</hi> Monarchy. Neither doth he afford us so much as one passage or reason out of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whose books of <hi>Politicks,</hi> and whose natural reasons are of greatest authority and credit with all rational men, next to the sacred Scripture: Nay, I hope I may affirm, and be able to prove, that <hi>Arist.</hi> doth confute both <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy, howsoever Doctor <hi>Ferne</hi> think these new opinions to be raised upon<note place="margin">P. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Arist.</hi> principles. As for other Polititians or Historians, either divine or humane, ancient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, our Author brings not one to confirm his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; nor doth he, nor can he shew that ever any Nation or people were governed by a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Machivel</hi> is the first in Christendome that I can find that writ of a <hi>Mixed Government,</hi> but not one syllable of a <hi>Mixed Monarchy:</hi> he, in his discourses or disputations upon the Decades of <hi>Livy,</hi> falls so
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:104419:145"/>
enamored with the Roman Common-wealth, that he thought he could never sufficiently grace that popular government, unless he said, there was something of Monarchy in it: yet he was never so impudent as to say, it was a <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy. And what <hi>Machivel</hi> hath said for <hi>Rome,</hi> the like hath <hi>Contarene</hi> for <hi>Venice.</hi> But <hi>Bodin</hi> hath layed open the errors of both these, as also of <hi>Polybius,</hi> and some few others that held the like opinions. As for the Kingome of <hi>England,</hi> if it have found out a form of Government (as the Treatise layeth it down) of such perfection as never any people could; It is both a glory to the Nation, and also to this Author, who hath first decipher'd it.</p>
                  <p>I now make my approach to the Book it self: The title is, <hi>A Treatise of Monarchy.</hi> The first part of it is, of <hi>Monarchy in General:</hi> Where first, I charge the Author, that he hath not given us any definition or description of Monarchy in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: for by the rules of method he should have first defined, and then divided: for if there be several sorts of Monarchy, then in something they must agree, which makes them to be Monarchies; and in something they must disagree and differ, which makes them to be several sorts of Monarchies. In the first place he should have shewed us in what they all agreed, which must have been a definition of Monarchy in General, which is the foundation of the Treatise; and except that be agreed upon, we shall argue upon we know not what. I press not this main omission of our Author out of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of wrangling, but because I am confident that had he pitched upon any definition of Monarchy in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:104419:146"/>
General, his own definition would have confuted his whole Treatise: Besides, I find him pleased to give us a handsome definition of <hi>Absolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,</hi> from whence I may infer, that he knew no other definition that would have fitted all his other sorts of Monarchy; it concerned him to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it, lest it might be thought there could be no Monarchy but Absolute.</p>
                  <p>What our Author hath omitted, I shall attempt to supply, and leave to the scanning. And it shall be a real as well as nominal definition of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. <hi>A Monarchy is the Government of one alone.</hi> For the better credit of this definition, though it be able to maintain it self, yet I shall deduce it from the principles of our Author of the Treatise of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>We all know that this word <hi>Monarch</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two Greek words, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> signifies <hi>one alone.</hi> The understanding of these two words may be picked out of our Author. First, for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he teacheth us, it is <hi>Potestatis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>the exercise of a moral power;</hi> next he grants us, that <hi>every Monarch</hi> (even his <hi>limited</hi> Monarch) <hi>must have the Supream power of the State in him, so that his power must no way be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>by any power above his; for then he were not a Monarch, but a subordinate Magistrate.</hi> Here we have a fair confession of a supream unlimited power in his <hi>limited Monarch:</hi> if you will know what he means by these words <hi>supream power,</hi> turn to his 26 page, there you will finde, <hi>Supream power is either Legislative, or Gubernative, and that the Legislative power is the chief of the two;</hi> he makes
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:104419:146"/>
both supream, and yet one chief: the like distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he hath before, where he saith, <hi>The pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Magistracy, in respect of its degrees, is</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Nomothetical or Architectonical;</hi> and <hi>Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native or Executive:</hi> by these words of <hi>Legislative, Nomothetical,</hi> and <hi>Architectonical</hi> power, in plain English, he understands <hi>a power of making Laws;</hi> and by <hi>Gubernative</hi> and <hi>Executive,</hi> a <hi>power of putting those Laws in execution, by judging and punishing offenders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The result we have from hence is, that by the Authors acknowledgment, every Monarch must have the supream power, and that supream power is, a power to make laws: and howsoever the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes the Gubernative and Executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a part of the supream power; yet he confesseth <hi>the Legislative to be chief, or the highest degree of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> for he doth acknowledge degrees of supream power; nay, he afterwards teacheth us, that <hi>the Legislative power is the height of power, to</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>which the other parts are subsequent and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient:</hi> if Gubernative be subservient to Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, how can Gubernative power be supream?</p>
                  <p>Now let us examime the Authors <hi>Limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> by these his own rules; he tells us, that in a <hi>moderated, limited, stinted, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate,</hi>

When the Law must rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Monarch, and not the Monarch the Law, he hath at the most but a Gubernative or Executive power: <hi>If his authority transcends</hi>

                  <p>The other word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>solus, one alone:</hi> the Monarch must not only have the supream power unlimited, but he must have it alone (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any companions.) Our Author teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">P. 15.</note> us, <hi>He is no Monarch if the Supream power be not in one.</hi> And again he saith, <hi>if you put</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now let us see if his mixed Monarchy be framed according to these his own principles: First, he saith, <hi>in a mixed Monarchy the soveraign power must be originally in all three Estates.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, his words are, <hi>The three Estates are all sharers in the supream power—the primity of share in the supream power is in One.</hi> Here we find, that he that told us the supream power must be in one, will now allow his mixed Monarch but one share only of the supream power, and gives other shares to the Estates: thus he destroys the being of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, by putting the <hi>supream power, or</hi> culmen po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatis, <hi>or a part of it, in the whole body, or a part thereof;</hi> and yet formerly he confesseth, that <hi>the power of Magistracy cannot well be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>for it is one simple thing, or indivisable beam of divine perfection:</hi> but he can make this indivisable beam to be divisable into three shares. I have done with the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>solus, alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have dwelt the longer upon this definition of Monarchy, because the apprehending of it out of the Authors own grounds, quite overthrows both his <hi>Monarch Limited by Law,</hi> and <hi>his Monarch Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the States.</hi> For to Govern, is to give a law to others, and not to have a Law given to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and limit him that Governs: And to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern alone, is not to have sharers or compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mixed with the Governor. Thus the two words of which Monarchy is compounded, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the two sorts of Monarchy which he pleads for; and by consequence his whole Treatise: for these two sorts of <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:104419:148"/>
Monarchy take up (in a manner) his whole Book.</p>
                  <p>I will now touch some few particular passages in the Treatise.</p>
                  <p>Our Author first confesseth, <hi>it is Gods</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>express ordinance there should be Government;</hi> and he proves it by <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16. where God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained <hi>Adam to rule over his Wife, and her desires were to be subject to his;</hi> and as hers, so all theirs that should come of her. Here we have the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal grant of Government, and the fountain of all power placed in the <hi>Father</hi> of all mankind; accordingly we finde the <hi>law</hi> for obedience to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment given in the terms of <hi>honour thy Father:</hi> not only the constitution of power in general, but the limitation of it to one kind (that is, to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or the government of one alone) and the determination of it to the individual person and line of <hi>Adam,</hi> are all three ordinances of God. Neither <hi>Eve</hi> nor her Children could either limit <hi>Adams</hi> power, or joyn others with him in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and what was given unto <hi>Adam,</hi> was given in his person to his posterity. This pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power continued monarchical to the Floud, and after the Floud to the confusion of <hi>Babel:</hi> when Kingdoms were first erected, planted, or scattered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the face of the world, we finde <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 11. it was done by Colonies of whole families, over which the prime Fathers had supream power, and were Kings, who were all the sons or grand-children of <hi>Noah,</hi> from whom they derived a fatherly and regal power over their families. Now if this supream power was setled and founded by God himself in the fatherhood, how is it possible for the people
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:104419:148"/>
to have any right or title to alter and dispose of it otherwise? what commission can they shew that gives them power either of <hi>limitation or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> It was Gods ordinance, that Supremacy should be unlimited in <hi>Adam,</hi> and as large as all the acts of his will: and as in him, so in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that have supream power, as appears by the judgement and speech of the people to <hi>Ioshuah</hi> when he was supream Governour, these are their words to him, <hi>All that thou commandest us we will do; whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death:</hi> we may not say that these were evil Councellours or flattering Courtiers of <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> or that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was a Tyrant for having such arbitrary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Our Author, and all those who affirm that <hi>power is conveyed to persons by publick consent,</hi> are forced to confess, that it is the fatherly power that first inables a people to make such conveyance; so that admitting (as they hold) that our Ancestors did at first convey power, yet the reason why we now living do submit to such power, is, for that our Fore-fathers every one for himself, his family, and posterity, had a power of resigning up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and us to a supream power. As the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth us that <hi>supream power was originally in the fatherhood without any limitation,</hi> so likewise Reason doth evince it, that if God ordained that Supremacy should be, that then Supremacy must of necessity be unlimited: for the power that limits must be above that power which is limited; if it be limited, it cannot be supream: so that if our Author will grant supream power to be the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:104419:149"/>
of God, the supream power will prove it self to be unlimited by the same ordinance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a supream limited power is a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>The Monarchical power of <hi>Adam</hi> the Father of all flesh, being by a general binding ordinance setled by God in him and his posterity by right of fatherhood, the form of Monarchy must be preferr'd above other forms, except the like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance for other forms can be shewed: neither <hi>may men according to their relations to the form they live under, to their affections and judgments in divers respects, prefer or compare any other form with Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</hi> The point that most perplexeth our Author and many others, is, that if Monarchy be allowed to be the ordinance of God, <hi>an absurdity would follow, that we should uncharitably condemn all the Communities which have not that form, for violation of Gods ordinance, and pronounce those other powers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> If those who live under a Monarchy can justifie the form they live under to be Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they are not bound to forbear their own justification, because others cannot do the like for the form they live under; let others look to the defence of their own Government: if it cannot be provd or shewd that any other form of government had ever any lawful beginning, but was brought in or erected by Rebellion, must therefore the lawful and just obedience to Monarchy be denied to be the ordinance of God?</p>
                  <p>To proceed with our Author; in the 3 <hi>page</hi> he saith, <hi>the Higher Power is Gods ordinance: That it resideth in One or more, in such or such a way, is from humane designment; God by no word binds any people to this or that form, till they by their own act bind themselves.</hi> Because the power and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:104419:149"/>
of the people in government is the burden of the whole Book, and our author expects it should be admitted as a magisterial postulation, without any other proof than a naked supposition; and since others also maintain that <hi>originally Power was, or now is in the People,</hi> &amp; that <hi>the first Kings were chosen by the People:</hi> they may not be offended, if they be asked in what sence they understand the word [<hi>People</hi>] because this, as many other words, hath different acceptions, being sometimes taken in a larger, otherwhiles in a stricter sence. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and in the largest sence, the word <hi>People</hi> signifies the <hi>whole multitude of mankind;</hi> but <hi>figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

the people of the world at one instant, <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> Nay, if it be true that <hi>nature</hi> hath made all men free; though all mankind should concur in one vote, yet it cannot seem reasonable, that they should have power to alter the law of nature; for if no man have power to take away his own life without the guilt of being a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of himself, how can any people confer such a power as they have not themselves upon any one man, without being accessories to their own deaths, and every particular man become guilty of being <hi>felo de se?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this general signification of the word <hi>people</hi> be disavowed, and men will suppose that the <hi>people</hi> of particular Regions or Countries have power and freedome to chuse unto themselves Kings; then let them but observe the consequence: Since na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath not distinguished the habitable world into Kingdomes, nor determined what part of a <hi>people</hi> shall belong to one Kingdome, and what to another, it follows, that the original freedome of mankind being supposed, every man is at liberty to be of what Kingdome he please, and so every petty company hath a right to make a Kingdom by it self; and not onely every City, but every Village, and every Family, nay and every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man, a liberty to chuse himself to be his own King if he please; and he were a madman that being by nature free, would chuse any man but himself to be his own Governour. Thus to avoid the having but of one King of the whole world, we shall run into a liberty of having as many Kings as there be men in the world, which upon the matter, is to have no King at all, but to leave
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:104419:150"/>
all men to their natural liberty, which is the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief the Pleaders for <hi>natural liberty</hi> do pretend they would most avoid.</p>
                  <p>But if neither the whole people of the world, nor the whole people of any part of the world be meant, but only the <hi>major part,</hi> or some other part of a part of the world; yet still the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection will be the stronger. For besides that nature hath made no partition of the world, or of the people into distict Kingdomes, and that without an universal consent at one and the same instant no partition can be made: yet if it were lawful for particular parts of the world by consent to chuse their Kings, nevertheless their elections would bind none to subjection but only such as consented; for the <hi>major part</hi> never binds, but where men at first either agree to be so bound, or where a higher power so commands: Now there being no higher power than nature, but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; where neither nature nor God appoints the <hi>major part</hi> to bind, their consent is not binding to any but only to themselves who consent.</p>
                  <p>Yet, for the present to gratifie them so far as to admit that either by nature, or by a general consent of all mankind, the world at first was divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to particular Kingdomes, and the <hi>major part</hi> of the people of each Kingdome assembled, allowed to chuse their King: yet it cannot truly be said that ever the <hi>whole people,</hi> or the <hi>major part,</hi> or indeed any considerable part of the whole people of any nation ever assembled to any such purpose. For except by some secret miraculous instinct they should all meet at one time, and place, what one man, or company of men less than the whole
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:104419:151"/>
people hath power to appoint either time or place of elections, where all be alike <hi>free by nature?</hi> and without a lawful summons, it is most unjust to bind those that be absent. The whole people cannot summon it self; one man is sick, another is lame, a third is aged, and a fourth is under age of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: all these at some time or other, or at some place or other, might be able to meet, if they might chuse their own time and place, as men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally free should.</p>
                  <p>In Assemblies that are by humane politique constitution, the superior power that ordains such assemblies, can regulate and confine them, both for time, place, persons, and other circumstances: but where there is an equality by nature, there can be no superior power; there every Infant at the hour it is born in, hath a like interest with the greatest and wisest man in the world. Mankind is like the sea, ever ebbing or flowing, every minute one is born, another dies; those that are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple this minute, are not the people the next mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, in every instant and point of time there is a variation no one time can be indifferent for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to assemble; it cannot but be mischievous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the least to all Infants, and others under age of discretion; not to speak of women, especially Virgins, who by birth have as much <hi>natural free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> as any other, and therefore ought not to lose their liberty without their own consent.</p>
                  <p>But in part of salve this, it will be said that Infants and Children may be concluded by the votes of their Parents. This remedy may cure some part of the mischief, but it destroys the whole cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at last stumbles upon the true
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:104419:151"/>
original of government. For if it be allowed, that the acts of Parents bind the Children, then farewel the doctrine of the <hi>natural freedome of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;</hi> where subjection of Children to Parents is natural, there can be no natural freedome. If any reply, that not all Children shall be bound by their Parents consent, but onely those that are under age: It must be considered, that in nature there is no <hi>nonage;</hi> if a man be not born free, she doth not assign him any other time when he shall attain his freedome: or if she did, then Children attaining that age, should be discharged of their Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. So that in conclusion, if it be imagined that the people were ever but once free from sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection by nature, it will prove a meer impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ever lawfully to introduce any kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatsoever, without apparent wrong to a multitude of people.</p>
                  <p>It is further observable, that ordinarily Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants are far a greater number than Parents and Masters; and for the major part of these to be able to vote and appoint what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Governours their Fathers and Masters shall be subject unto, is most unnatural, and in effect to give the Children the government over their Parents.</p>
                  <p>To all this it may be opposed, What need dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute how a people can chuse a King, since there be multitude of examples that Kings have been, and are now adays chosen by their people? The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, 1. The question is not of the <hi>fact,</hi> but of the <hi>right,</hi> whether it have been done by a <hi>natural,</hi> or by an <hi>usurped</hi> right. 2. Many Kings are, and have bin chosen by some small part of a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:104419:152"/>
people; but by the <hi>the whole,</hi> or <hi>major part</hi> of a Kingdom not any at all. Most have been elected by the Nobility, Great men, and Princes of the blood, as in <hi>Poland, Denmarke,</hi> and in <hi>Sweden;</hi> not by any <hi>collective</hi> or <hi>representative</hi> body of any Nation: sometimes a sactious or seditious City, or a mutinous Army hath set up a King, but none of all those could ever prove they had <hi>right</hi> or just title either by <hi>nature,</hi> or any otherwise, for such elections. We may resolve upon these two propositions: 1. <hi>That the people have no power or right of themselves to chuse Kings.</hi> 2. <hi>If they had any such right, it is not possible for them any way law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to exercise it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You will say, <hi>There must necessarily be a right in somebody to elect, in case a King die without an Heir.</hi> I answer, <hi>No King can die without an Heir, as long as there is any one man living in the world.</hi> It may be the Heir may be unknown to the people; but that is no fault in nature, but the negligence or ignorance of those whom it concerns. But if a King could die without an Heir, yet the Kingly power in that case shall not escheat to the whole people, but to the supream Heads and Fathers of Families; not as they are the <hi>people,</hi> but <hi>quatenus</hi> they are Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of people, over whom they have a supream power devolved unto them after the death of their soveraign Ancestor: and if any can have a right to chuse a King, it must be these Fathers, by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their distinct fatherly powers upon one man alone. Chief fathers in Scripture are accounted as all the people, as <hi>all the Children of Israel,</hi> as <hi>all the Congregation,</hi> as the Text plainly expounds it self, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 1. 2. where <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks to <hi>All</hi>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:104419:152"/>
                     <hi>Israel,</hi> that is, <hi>to the Captains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Iudges, and to every Governour, the</hi> CHIEF OF THE FATHERS: and so the <hi>Elders of Israel</hi> are expounded to be <hi>the chief of the Fathers of the Children of Israel,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 1. and the 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That Kings are not now (as they were at the first planting or peopling of the world) the Fathers of their People or Kingdoms, and that the fatherhood hath lost the right of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning; An answer is, That all Kings that now are, or ever were, are, or were either Fathers of their people, or the Heirs of such Fathers, or Usurpers of the right of such Fathers. It is a truth undeniable, that there cannot be any multitude of men whatsoever, either great, or small, though gathered together from the several corners and remotest regions of the world, but that in the same multitude, considered by it self, there is one man amongst them that in nature hath a right to be the King of all the rest, as being the next Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the others subject unto him: every man by nature is a King, or a Subject: the obedience which all Subjects yeild to Kings, is but the paying of that duty which is due to the supream fatherhood: Many times by the act either of an Usurper himself, or of those that set him up, the true Heir of a Crown is dispossessed, God using the ministry of the wickedest men for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and setting up of Kings: in such cases the Subjects obedience to the fatherly power must go along and wait upon Gods providence, who only hath right to give and take away King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and thereby to adopt Subjects into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of another fatherly power: according to

                  <p>However the <hi>natural freedome of the people</hi> be cried up as the sole means to determine the kind Government and the Governours: yet in the close, all the favourers of this opinion are constrained to grant that the obedience which is due to the fatherly power is the true and only cause of the subjection which we that are now living give to Kings, since none of us gave consent to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only our Fore-fathers act and consent hath concluded us.</p>
                  <p>Whereas many confess that Government only in the <hi>abstract</hi> is the ordinance of God, they are not able to prove any such ordinance in the Scripture, but only in the fatherly power, and therefore we find the Commandment that enjoyns obedience to superiours, given in the terms of <hi>Honour thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> so that not onely the <hi>power or right of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but the <hi>form of the power of governing,</hi> and <hi>the person having that power,</hi> are all the ordinance of God: the first Father had not only simply pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but power Monarchical, as he was a Father, immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as soon as <hi>Adam</hi> was created he was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the World, though he had no subjects; for though there could not be actual government until there were Subjects, yet by the right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it was due to <hi>Adam</hi> to be Governour of his posterity: though not in <hi>act,</hi> yet at least in <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, Adam</hi> was a King from his Creation: And in the state of innocency he had been Governour of his Children; for the <hi>integrity</hi> or <hi>excellency</hi> of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:104419:153"/>
the subjects doth not take away the <hi>order</hi> or <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency</hi> of the Governour. <hi>Eve</hi> was subject to <hi>Adam</hi> before he sinned; the Angels, who are of a pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are subject to God: which confutes their saying, who in disgrace of civil Government or power say it was brought in by sin: Government as to <hi>coactive power</hi> was after sin, because coaction sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth some disorder, which was not in the state of innocency: But as for <hi>directive power,</hi> the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane nature requires it, since civil society cannot be imagined without power of Government: for although as long as men continued in the state of innocency they might not need the direction of <hi>Adam</hi> in those things which were <hi>necessarily</hi> and <hi>morally</hi> to be done; yet things <hi>indifferent,</hi> that depended meerly on their free will, might be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the power of <hi>Adams</hi> command.</p>
                  <p>If we consider the first plantations of the world which were after the building of <hi>Babel</hi> when the confusion of tongues was, we may find the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the earth into distinct Kingdomes and Countries, by several families, whereof the Sons or Grand-children of <hi>Noah</hi> were the Kings or Governours by a fatherly right; and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of this power and right in the Fathers, God was pleased upon several Families to bestow a Language on each by it self, the better to unite it into a Nation or Kingdom; as appears by the words of the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. <hi>These are the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Sons of</hi> Noah, <hi>after their generations in their Nations, and by these were the Nations divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the earth after the floud: Every one after</hi> HIS TONGUE, AFTER THEIR FAMILIES <hi>in their Nations.</hi>

I do the rather mention these passages of our Author, because very many in these days do not stick to maintain, that an arbitrary or Absolute Monarch not limited by law, is all one with a Tyrant; and to be governed by one mans will, is to be made a slave. It is a question whether our Author be not of that minde, when he saith, <hi>absolute subjection is servitude:</hi> and thereupon a late friend to limited Monarchy affirms in a discourse upon the question in debate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>between<note place="margin">P. 54.</note> the King and Parliament, That <hi>to make a King by the standard of Gods word, is to make the Subjects slaves for conscience sake.</hi> A hard saying, and I doubt whether he that gives this censure can be excused from blasphemy.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:104419:155"/>
certainly the man doth not know neither what a Tyrant is, or what a Slave is: indeed the words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <list>
                     <item>1. Where the Monarch, whose will is the law, doth set himself no law to rule by, but by commands of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ily govern, reserving to himself a liberty to vary from it as oft as in his discretion he thinks <hi>FIT;</hi> and in this the Soveraign is as free as the former.</item>
                     <item>3. Where he not onely sets a rule, but promiseth in many cases not to alter it; but this promise or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement is an after-condescent or act of grace, not dissolving the absolute Oath of subjection which went before it.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the first of these three, there is no question but it is a pure absolute Monarchy; but as for
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:104419:156"/>
the other two, though he say <hi>they be absolute,</hi> yet in regard they set themselves limits or laws to govern by, if it please our Author to term them <hi>limited Monarchs,</hi> I will not oppose him; yet I must tell him, that his third degree of absolute Monarchy is such a kind, as I believe, never hath been, nor ever can be in the world. For a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch to promise and engage in many cases not to <hi>alter a law,</hi> it is most necessary that those many cases should be particularly expressed at the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain making. Now he that understands the nature and condition of all <hi>humane laws,</hi> knows that particular cases are infinite, and not comprehensible within any rules or laws: and if many cases should be comprehended, and many omitted, yet even those that were comprehended would admit of variety of interpretations and disputations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Author doth not, nor can tell us of any such reserved cases promised by any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</p>
                  <p>Again, where he saith, <hi>An after-condescent or Act of grace doth not dissolve the absolute Oath of subjection which went before it;</hi> though in this he speak true, yet still he seems to insinuate, that <hi>an Oath onely binds to subjection,</hi> which Oath, as he would have us believe, was at first <hi>arbitrary:</hi> whereas Subjects are bound to obey Monarchs though they never <hi>take oath</hi> of <hi>subjection,</hi> as well as childen are bound to obey their parents, though they never swear to do it.</p>
                  <p>Next, his distincton between <hi>the rule of power, and the exercise of it,</hi> is vain; for <hi>to rule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 7. P. 1.</note> is <hi>to exercise</hi> power: for himself saith, that <hi>Government is</hi> potestatis exercitium, <hi>the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a moral power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="281" facs="tcp:104419:156"/>Lastly, whereas our Author saith, <hi>a Monarch cannot break his promise without sin;</hi> let me add, that if the safety of the people, <hi>salus populi,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a breach of the Monarchs promise, then the sin, if there be any, is rather in the <hi>making,</hi> than <hi>breaking of the promise;</hi> the <hi>safety of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> is an exception implied in every Monarchical promise.</p>
                  <p>But it seems these three degrees of Monarchy do not satisfie our Author; he is not content to have a Monarch have a Law or rule to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by, but he must have <hi>this limitation or</hi>

                     <hi>law to be</hi> ab externo, <hi>from somebody else, and not from the determination of the Monarchs own will;</hi> and therefore he saith, <hi>By original constitution the society publick confers on one man a power by limited contract, resigning themselves to be governed by such a Law:</hi> also before he told us, <hi>the</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 13.</note>

If he either <hi>formally, or virtually</hi> (as our Author supposeth) <hi>desert his absolute</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And if it be from the free will of the Monarch, why doth he say the limitation must be <hi>ab externo?</hi> he told us before, that <hi>subjection</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>cannot be dissolved or lessen'd by an Act of grace coming afterwards:</hi> but he hath better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himself, and now he will have <hi>acts of grace to be of two kinds, and the latter kind may amount</hi> (as he saith) <hi>to a resignation of absolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> But can any man believe that a Monarch who by conquest or other right hath an absolute arbitrary power, will voluntarily resigne that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluteness, and accept so much power onely as the people shall please to give him, and such laws to govern by as they shall make choice of? can he shew that ever any Monarch was so gracious or kind-hearted as to lay down his lawful power freely at his Subjects feet? is it not sufficient grace if such an absolute Monarch be content to set down a Law to himself by which he will ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily govern, but he must needs relinquish his old independent commission, and take a new one from his Subjects, clog'd with limitations?</p>
                  <p>Finally, I observe, that howsoever our Author speak big of the radical, fundamental, and original power of the people as the root of all Soveraignty: yet in a better moode he will take up, and be contented with a Monarchy limited by an after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condescent and act of grace from the Monarch himself.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have briefly touched his grounds of <hi>Limited Monarchy;</hi> if now we shall ask, what proof or examples he hath to justifie his doctrine,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:104419:157"/>
he is as mute as a fish: onely <hi>Pythagoras</hi> hath said it, and we must believe him; for though our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor would have Monarchy to be limited, yet he could be content his opinion should be absolute, and not limited to any rule or example.</p>
                  <p>The main Charge I have against our Author now remains to be discussed; and it is this, That instead of a Treatise of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> he hath brought forth a Treatise of <hi>Anarchy,</hi> and that by his own confessions shall be made good.</p>
                  <p>First, he holds, <hi>A limited Monarch transcends his bounds if he commands beyond the law; and the Subject legally is not bound to subjection in such cases.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you ask the Author who shall be judge whether the Monarch transcend his bounds, and of the excesses of the soveraign power; His answer is, <hi>There is an impossibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting</hi>

There can be no Iudge legal and constituted within that form of government.</hi> In these answers it appears, there is no Judge to determine the Soveraigns or the Monarchs transgressing his fundamental li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits: yet our Author is very cautelous, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth onely a fundamental variance betwixt the Monarch and the Community; he is ashamed to put the question home. I demand of him if there be a variance betwixt the Monarch and any of the meanest persons of the Community, who shall be the Judge? for instance, <hi>The King commands me,</hi>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:104419:158"/>
                     <hi>or gives judgement against me:</hi> I reply, <hi>His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are illegal, and his judgment not according to Law:</hi> who must judge? <hi>if the Monarch himself judge, then you destroy the frame of the State, and make it absolute,</hi> saith our Author; and he gives his reason: for, <hi>to define a Monarch to a Law, and then to make him judge of his own deviations from that Law, is to absolve him from all Law.</hi> On the other side, <hi>if any, or all the people may judge, then you put the Soveraignty in the whole body, or part of it, and destroy the being of Monarchy.</hi> Thus our Author hath caught himself in a plain <hi>dilemma:</hi> If the King be judge, then he is no limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; If the people be judge, then he is no Monarch at all. So farewell <hi>limited Monarchy,</hi> nay farewell <hi>all government</hi> if there be no Judge.</p>
                  <p>Would you know what help our Author hath found out for this mischief? First, he saith, that <hi>a Subject is bound to yield to a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,</hi>

For if the Monarch be to govern onely according to Law, no transgression of his can be of so small moment if he break the bounds of Law, but it is a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the government it self, and may be made a leading case, and so bring on a prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against publick liberty; it strikes at the very being of the Government, and brings with it such an evil, as the party that suffers, or the publick cannot be accessory to: let the case be never so small, yet if there be illegality in the act, it strikes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:104419:159"/>Whereas my Author requires, that the <hi>destructive nature of illegal commands should be set open:</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his mind is, That each private man in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular case should make a publick remonstrance to the world of the illegal act of the Monarch; and then if upon his Petition he cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved according to his desire, he ought, or it is his duty to make resistance. Here I would know, who can be the judge whether the illegality be made apparent? it is a main point, since every man is prone to flatter himself in his own cause, and to think it good, and that the wrong or injustice he suffers is apparent, when other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and indifferent men can discover no such thing: and in this case the judgement of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people cannot be gathered or known by any possible means; or if it could, it were like to be various and erronious.</p>
                  <p>Yet our Author will have <hi>an appeal made to the conscience of all Man-kind,</hi> and that being made, he concludes, <hi>The fundamental Laws must judge, and pronounce sentence in every mans conscience.</hi> Whereas he saith, <hi>The Fundamental Laws</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>must judge;</hi> I would very gladly learn of him, or of any other for him, what a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law is, or else have but any one Law named me that any man can say is a Fundamental Law of the Monarchy. I confess he tells us, that <hi>the Common Laws are the foundation, and</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>the Statute Laws are superstructive;</hi> yet I think he dares not say that there is any one branch or part of the Common Law, but that it may be taken away by an act of Parliament: for many points of the Common Law <hi>(de facto)</hi> have, and
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:104419:159"/>
                     <hi>(de jure)</hi> any point may be taken away. How can that be called Fundamental, which hath and may be removed, and yet the Statute-Laws stand firm and stable? It is contrary to the nature of Fundamental, for the building to stand when the foundation is taken away.</p>
                  <p>Besides, the Common Law is generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be nothing else but common usage or custome, which by length of time onely obtains authority: So that it follows in time after Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but cannot go before it, and be the rule to Government, by any original or radical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
                  <p>Also the Common Law being unwritten, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and difficult, cannot but be an uncertain rule to govern by; which is against the nature of a rule, which is and ought to be certain.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, by making the common Law onely to be the foundation, <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is excluded from being a Fundamental Law, and also all other Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes from being limitations to Monarchy, since the Fundamental Laws onely are to be judge.</p>
                  <p>Truly the conscience of all Man-kind is a pretty large Tribunal for the Fundamental Laws to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce sentence in. It is very much that Laws which in their own nature are dumb, and always need a Judge to pronounce sentence, should now be able to speak, and pronounce sentence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: such a sentence surely must be upon the hearing of one party onely; for it is impossible for a Monarch to make his defence and answer, and produce his witnesses, in every mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in each mans cause, who will but question the legality of the Monarchs Government. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:104419:160"/>
the sentence cannot but be unjust, where but one mans tale is heard. For all this, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is, <hi>Every man must oppose or not oppose the Monarch according to his own conscience.</hi> Thus at the last, every man is brought, by this Doctrine of our Authors, to be his own judge. And I also appeal to the consciences of all man-kind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the end of this be not utter confusion, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
                  <p>Yet after all this, the Author saith, <hi>This power of every mans judging the illegal</hi>

                     <hi>acts of the Monarch, argues not a superiority of those who judge over him who is judged;</hi> and he gives a profound reason for it; his words are, <hi>It is not authoritative and civil, but moral, residing in reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures, and lawful for them to execute.</hi> What our Author means by these words, <hi>(not authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and civil, but moral)</hi> perhaps I understand not, though I think I do; yet it serves my turn that he saith, that <hi>resistance ought to be made, and every man must oppose or not oppose, according as in conscience he can acquit or condemn the acts of his Governour;</hi> for if it enable a man to resist and oppose his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, without question 'tis authoritative and civil. Whereas he adds, that <hi>moral judgment is residing in reasonable creatures, and lawful for them to execute;</hi> he seems to imply, that authoritative, and civil judgement doth not reside in reasonable creatures, nor can be lawfully executed: Such a conclusion fits well with Anarchy; for he that takes away all Government, and leaves every man to his own conscience, and so makes him an independent in State, may well teach that authority resides not in reasonable creatures, nor can be lawfully executed.</p>

                     <pb n="289" facs="tcp:104419:160"/>I pass from his absolute and limited Monarchy, to his division or partition (for he allows no divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) of Monarchy into <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>mixed, viz.</hi> of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Community.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>of equality; he rather thinks there must be a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of order in one of the three, or else there can be no unity.</hi> He must know, that priority of order doth not hinder, but that there may be an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mixture, if the shares be equal; for he that hath the first share may have no more than the others: so that if he will have an inequality of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a primity of share will not serve the turn: the first share must be greater or better than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or else they will be equal, and then he cannot call it a mixed Monarchy, where onely a primity of share in the Supream power is in one: but by his own confession he may better call it a mixed Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy or mixed Democracy, than a mixed Monarchy, since he tells us, <hi>the Houses of</hi>

                     <hi>Parliament sure have two parts of the greatest legislative authority;</hi> and if the King have but a third part, sure their shares are equal.</p>
                  <p>The first step our Author makes, is this, <hi>The soveraign power must be originally in all three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> next he finds, that <hi>if there be an equality of shares in three Estates, there can be no ground to denominate a Monarch;</hi> and then his mixed Monarch might be thought but an empty title: Therefore in the third place he resolves us, that <hi>to salve all, A power must be sought out wherewith the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>must be invested, which is not so great as to destroy the mixture, nor so titular as to destroy the</hi>

                     <hi>Monarchy;</hi> and therefore he conceives it may be in these particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>a Monarch in a mixed Monarchy may be said to be a Monarch</hi> (as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives)<note place="margin">P. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>if he be the head and fountain of the power which governs and executes the established Laws;</hi> that is, a man may be a Monarch, though he do but give power to others to govern and execute the established Laws: thus he brings his Monarch one step or peg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lower still than he was before: at first he made us believe his Monarch should have the supream power, which is the legislative; then he falls from that, and tells us, A limited Monarch must govern according to Law onely; thus he is brought from the legislative to the gubernative or executive power onely; nor doth he stay here, but is taken a hole lower, for now he must not govern, but <hi>he must constitute Officers to govern by Laws;</hi> if chusing Officers to govern be governing, then our Author will allow his Monarch to be a Governour, not else: and therefore he that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Supream power</hi> into <hi>legislative</hi> and <hi>gubernative,</hi> doth now divide it into <hi>legislative,</hi> and <hi>power of constituting Officers</hi> for governing by Laws; and <hi>this</hi> he saith <hi>is left to the Monarch.</hi> Indeed you have left him a fair portion of power, but are we sure he may enjoy this? it seems our Author is not confident in this neither, and some others do deny it him: our Author speaking of the government of this Kingdome, saith, <hi>The choice of the Officers is intrusted to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Monarch for ought I know:</hi> he is not resolute in the point; but for ought he knows, and for ought I know, his Monarch
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:104419:161"/>
is but titular, an empty title, certain of no power at all.</p>
                  <p>The power of chusing Officers onely, is the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest of all powers. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (as I remember) saith, <hi>The common people are fit for nothing but to chuse Officers, and to take accompts:</hi> and indeed, in all <hi>popular governments</hi> the multitude perform this work: and this work in a King puts him below all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and makes him the onely subject in a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or the onely man that cannot Govern: there is not the poorest man of the multitude but is capable of some Office or other, and by that means may sometime or other perhaps govern according to the Laws; onely the King can be no Officer, but to chuse Officers; his Subjects may all Govern, but he may not.</p>
                  <p>Next, I cannot see how in true sence our Author can say, <hi>his Monarch is the head and fountain of power,</hi> since his doctrine is, that <hi>in a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the publick society by original constitution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on one man power:</hi> is not then the publick so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety the head and fountain of power, and not the King?</p>
                  <p>Again, when he tells us of his Monarch, that <hi>both the other States, as well conjunctim as divisim, be his sworn subjects, and owe obedience to his commands:</hi> he doth but flout his poor Monarch; for why are they called his Subjects and his Commons? he (without any complement) is their Subject; for they, as Officers, may govern and command according to Law: but he may not, for he must judge by his judges in Courts of Justice onely: that is, he may not judge or govern at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:104419:162"/>2. As for the second particular, <hi>The sole or chief power in capacitating persons for the Supream power.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>3. As to this third particular, <hi>The power of convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such persons,</hi> they are both so far from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Monarch, that they are the onely way to make him none, by choosing and calling others to share in the Supream power.</p>
                  <p>4. Lastly, concerning <hi>his Authority being the last and greatest in the establishing every Act,</hi> it makes him no Monarch, except he be sole that hath that Authority; neither his <hi>primity</hi> of share in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream power, nor <hi>his Authority being last,</hi> no, nor <hi>his having the greatest Authority,</hi> doth make him a Monarch, unless he have that Authority alone.</p>
                  <p>Besides, how can he shew that in his mixed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy the Monarchs power is the greatest? The greatest share that our Author allows him in the Legislative power, is a Negative voice, and the like is allowed to the Nobility and Commons: And truely, a Negative voice is but a base term to express a Legislative power; a Negative voice is but a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, or indeed, no power at all to do any thing, onely a power to hinder an Act from being done.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I conclude, not any of his four, nor all of them put into one person,<note place="margin">P. 26.</note> makes the State Monarchical.</p>
                  <p>This mixed Monarchy, just like the limited, ends in confusion and destruction of all Government: you shall hear the Authors confession, <hi>That one inconvenience must necessarily be in all mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                  <p>Thus have I picked out the flowers out of his Doctrine about limited Monarchy, and presented them with some brief Annotations; it were a tedious work to collect all the learned contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and ambiguous expressions that occur in every page of his Platonick Monarchy; the Book hath so much of fancy, that it is a better piece of Poetry then Policy.</p>
                  <p>Because many may think, that the main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>limited</hi> and <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy may in it self be most authentical, and grounded upon strong and evident reason, although our Author perhaps have failed in some of his expressions, and be lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to exceptions: Therefore I will be bold to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether <hi>Aristotle</hi> could find either reason or example, of a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy; and the rather, because I find our Author altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon a rational way of justifying his opinion. No man I think will deny, but that <hi>Aristotle</hi> was sufficiently curious in searching out the several forms of Common-wealths and Kingdoms; yet I do not find, that he ever so much as dreamed of either a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>mixed</hi> Monarchy. Several other sorts of Monarchies he reckons up: in the Third Book of his Politicks, he spends three whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:104419:163"/>
together, upon the several kinds of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>First, in his fourteenth Chapter he mentions four kinds of Monarchy.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> Barbarique <hi>King</hi> (saith <hi>Aristotle) had a power very near to Tyranny; yet they were lawful and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, because the</hi> Barbarians <hi>are of a more servile nature than the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and the</hi> Asiatiques <hi>than the</hi> Europeans; <hi>they do willingly, without repining, live under a Masterly Government; yet their Government is stable and safe, because they are Paternal and lawful Kingdoms, and their Guards are Royal and not Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical: for Kings are guarded by their own Subjects, and Tyrants are guarded by Strangers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Aesymnetical <hi>King</hi> (saith <hi>Arist.) in old time in</hi> Greece, <hi>was an Elective Tyrant, and differed onely from the</hi> Barbarian <hi>Kings, in that he was Elective and not Paternal; these sorts of Kings, because they were Tyrannical, were Masterly; but because they were over such as voluntarily Elected them, they were Regal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Heroique were those</hi> (saith <hi>Aristotle) which flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the Heroical times, to whom the people did willingly obey; and they were Paternal and lawful, because these Kings did deserve well of the multitude,</hi>
                     <pb n="295" facs="tcp:104419:163"/>
                     <hi>either by teaching them Arts, or by Warring for them, or by gathering them together when they were dispersed, or by dividing Lands amongst them: these Kings had Supreme power in War, in Sacrifices, in Iudicature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These four sorts of Monarchy hath <hi>Aristotle</hi> thus distinguished, and after sums them up together, and concludes his Chapter as if he had forgot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and reckons up a fifth kind of Monarchy; which is, saith he, <hi>When one alone hath Supream pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all the rest: for as there is a domestical Kingdom of one house, so the Kingdom of a City, or of one or many Nations, is a Family.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These are all the sorts of Monarchy that <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> hath found out, and he hath strained hard to make them so many: first, for his <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King, himself confesseth that he was but a kind of Military Commander in War, and so in effect no more a King than all Generals of Armies: And yet this No-king of his was not limited by any Law, nor mixed with any companions of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: when he was in the Wars out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> he was, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> stiles him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of full and absolute command, no Law, no companion to govern his Army but his own will.</p>
                  <p>Next, for <hi>Aristotles Aesymnetical</hi> King, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, he was out of date in <hi>Aristotles</hi> time, for he saith, he was <hi>amongst the antient Greeks,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> might well have spared the naming him, (if he had not wanted other sorts) for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his own Nation: for he that but now told us the <hi>Barbarians</hi> were of a more servile nature than the <hi>Grecians,</hi> comes here, and tells us, that these old <hi>Greek</hi> Kings were Elective Tyrants. The <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> did but suffer Tyrants in shew, but the old
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:104419:164"/>
                     <hi>Grecians</hi> chose Tyrants indeed; which then must we think were the greater slaves, the <hi>Greeks</hi> or the <hi>Barbarians?</hi> Now if these sorts of Kings were Tyrants, we cannot suppose they were limited either by Law, or joyned with companions: Indeed <hi>Arist.</hi> saith, some of these Tyrants were limited to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times and actions, for they had not all their power for term of life, nor could meddle but in certain businesses; yet during the time they were Tyrants, and in the actions whereto they were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, they had absolute power to do what they list according to their own will, or else they could not have been said to be Tyrants.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Aristotles Heroick</hi> King, he gives the like note upon him, that he did upon the <hi>Aesymnet,</hi> that he was in old time <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the Heroick times. The thing that made these Heroical King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms differ from other sorts of Kingdoms, was only the means by which the first Kings obtained their Kingdoms, and not the manner of Government, for in that they were as absolute as other Kings were, without either limitation by Law, or mixture of companions.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, as for <hi>Arist. Barbarick</hi> sort of Kings, since he reckoned all the world <hi>Barbarians</hi> except the <hi>Grecians,</hi> his <hi>Barbarick</hi> King must extend to all other sorts of Kings in the world, besides those of <hi>Greece,</hi> and so may go under <hi>Aristotles</hi> fifth sort of Kings, which in general comprehends all other sorts, and is no special form of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Thus upon a true accompt it is evident, that the five several sorts of Kings mentioned by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> are at the most but different and accidental means of the first obtaining or holding of Monarchies,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:104419:164"/>
and not real or essential differences of the manner of Government, which was always absolute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either limitation or mixture.</p>
                  <p>I may be thought perhaps to mistake, or wrong <hi>Aristotle,</hi> in questioning his diversities of Kings; but it seems <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself was partly of the same mind; for in the very next Chapter, when he had better considered of the point, he confessed, that <hi>to speak the truth, there were almost but two sorts of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies worth the considering, that is, his first or</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conique <hi>sort, and his fifth or last sort, where one alone hath Supream power over all the rest:</hi> thus he hath brought his five sorts to two. Now for the first of these two, his <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King, he hath confessed before, that <hi>he was no more than a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimo</hi> of an Army, and so upon the matter no King at all: and then there remains onely his last sort of Kings, <hi>where one alone hath the Supream power.</hi> And this in substance is the final resolution of <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself: for in his sixteenth Chapter, where he delivers his last thoughts touching the kinds of Monarchy, he first dischargeth his <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> King from being any sort of Monarchy, and then gives us two exact rules about Monarchy; and both these are pointblank against limited and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Monarchy; therefore I shall propose them to be considered of, as concluding all Monarchy to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Arbitrary.</p>
                  <p>1. The one Rule is, that <hi>he that is said</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arist. pol. l. 3. c. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>to be a King according to Law, is no sort of Government or Kingdom at all:</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The second rule is, that <hi>a true King is he that ruleth all according to his own will,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:104419:165"/>This latter frees a Monarch from the mixture of partners or sharers in Government, as the former rule doth from limitation by Laws.</p>
                  <p>Thus in brief I have traced <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and broken passages, touching diversities of Kings; where he first finds but four sorts, and then he stumbles upon a fifth; and in the next Chapter contents himself onely with two sorts of Kings, but in the Chapter following concludes with one, which is the true perfect Monarch, who rules all by his own will: in all this we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for a regulated or mixed Monarchy, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, whereas the Author of the Treatise of Monarchy affirms it as a prime principle, <hi>That all Monarchies,</hi> (except that of the <hi>Iews) depend upon humane designment, when the consent of a society of men, and a fundamental contract of a Nation, by original or radical constitution confers power;</hi> He must know that <hi>Arist.</hi> searching into the original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, shews himself in this point a better Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine than our Author; and as if he had studied the Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> teacheth, That Monarchies fetch their Pedigree from the right of Fathers, and not from the gift or contract of people; his words may thus be Englished. <hi>At the first, Cities were Governed by Kings, and so even to this day are Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also: for such as were under Kingly Government did come together; for every House is governed by a King, who is the eldest; and so also Colonies are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned for kindred sake.</hi> And immediately before, he tells us, <hi>That the first society made of many Houses is a Village, which naturally seems to be a Colony of a House, which some call foster-brethren, or Children, and Childrens Children.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:104419:165"/>So in conclusion we have gained <hi>Aristotles</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in three main and essential points.</p>
                  <list>

                     </item>

                  </list>
                  <p>What <hi>Aristotles</hi> judgment was two thousand years since, is agreeable to the Doctrine of the great modern Politician <hi>Bodin:</hi> Hear him touching limited Monarchy: <hi>Unto Majesty or Soveraignty</hi> (saith he) <hi>belongeth an absolute power, not subject to any Law—Chief power given unto a Prince with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is not properly Soveraignty, or power absolute, except such conditions annexed to the Soveraignty, be directly comprehended within the Laws of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.—Albeit by the sufferance of the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>controversies between the King and his people are sometimes determined by the high Court of Parliament, and sometimes by the Lord Chief Iustice of</hi> England; <hi>yet all the Estates remain in full subjection to the King, who is no ways bound to follow their advice, neither to consent to their requests.—It is certain, that the Laws, Priviledges, and Grants of Princes, have no force but during their life, if they be not ratified by the express consent, or by sufferance of the Prince following, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Priviledges.—Much less should a Prince be bound unto the Laws he maketh himself; for a man may well receive a Law from another man, but impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is in nature for to give a Law unto himself, no more than it is to command a mans self in a matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending of his own will.</hi> The Law saith, <hi>Nulla ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatio consistere potest, quae à voluntate promittentis sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum capit. The Soveraign Prince may derogate unto</hi>
                     <pb n="300" facs="tcp:104419:166"/>
                     <hi>the Laws that he hath promised and sworn to keep, if the equity thereof be ceased; and that of himself, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of his Subjects.—The Majesty of a true Soveraign Prince is to be known, when the Estates of all the people assembled, in all humility present their requests and supplications to their Prince, without having power in any thing, to command, determine, or give voice, but that that which it pleaseth the King to like or dislike, to command or bid, is holden for Law: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they which have written of the duty of Magistrates have deceived themselves, in maintaining that the power of the people is greater than the Prince; a thing which causeth oft true Subjects to revolt from their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Prince, and ministreth matter of great troubles in Common-wealths; of which their opinion there is neither reason nor ground: for if the King be subject unto the Assemblies and Decrees of the people, he should neither be King nor Soveraign, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth neither Realm nor Monarchy, but a meer Aristocracie. So we see the principal point of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Majesty, and absolute power, to consist principally in giving Laws unto the Subjects in general without their consent.</hi> Bodin de Rep. l. 1. c. 8.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To confound the state of Monarchy with the Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar or Aristocratical estate, is a thing impossible, and in effect incompatible, and such as cannot be imagined: for Soveraignty being of it self indivisible, how can it at one and the same time be divided betwixt one Prince, the Nobility, and the people in common? The first mark of Soveraign Majesty, is to be of power to give Laws, and to command over them unto the Subjects; and who should those Subjects be, that should yield their obedience to the Law, if they should have also power to make the Laws? who should he be that could give the Law?</hi>
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:104419:166"/>
                     <hi>being himself constrained to receive it of them, unto whom himself gave it? so that of necessity we must conclude, That as no one in particular hath the power to make the Law in such a State, that then the State must needs be a State popular.—Never any Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth hath been made of an Aristocracy and popular Estate, much less of the three Estates of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal.—Such States wherein the rights of Soveraignty are divided, are not rightly to be called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weals, but rather the corruption of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weals, as</hi> Herodotus <hi>has most briefly but truly written.—Common-weals which change their state, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign right and power of them being divided, find no rest from Civil wars and broils, till they again recover some one of the three Forms, and the Soveraignty be wholly in one of the states or other. Where the rights of the Soveraignty are divided betwixt the Prince and his Subjects, in that confusion of state there is still endless stirs and quarrels for the superiority, until that some one, some few, or all together, have got the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty.</hi> Id. lib. 2. c. 1.</p>
                  <p>This Judgment of <hi>Bodin</hi>'s touching Limited and Mixed Monarchy, is not according to the mind of our Author, nor yet of the Observator, who useth the strength of his Wit to overthrow Absolute and Arbitrary Government in this Kingdom; and yet in the main body of his discourse, lets fall such Truths from his pen, as give a deadly wound to the Cause he pleads for, if they be indifferently weighed and considered. I will not pick a line or two here and there to wrest against him, but will present a whole Page of his Book, or more toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that so we may have an entire prospect upon the Observators mind: <hi>Without society</hi> (saith the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:104419:167"/>
Observator) <hi>men could not live; without Laws men could not be sociable; and without Authority some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to judge according to Law, Law was vain: It was soon therefore provided, that Laws according to the dictate of Reason, should be ratified by common consent; when it afterward appeared, that man was yet subject to unnatural destruction, by the Tyranny of entrusted Magistrates, a mischief almost as fatal, as to be without all Magistracy. How to provide a whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remedy therefore, was not so easie to be invented: it was not difficult to invent Laws for the limiting of Supream Governours; but to invent how those Laws should be executed, or by whom interpreted, was almost impossible,</hi> Nam quis Custodiet ipsos Custodes, <hi>to place a Superiour above a Supream, was held unnatural; yet what a lifeless thing would Law be without any Iudge to determine and force it? If it be agreed upon, that limits should be prefixed to Princes and Iudges to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree according to those limits, yet another inconvenience will presently affront us: for we cannot restrain Princes too far, but we shall disable them from some good: long it was ere the world could extricate it self out of all these extremities, or find out an orderly means whereby to avoid the danger of unbounded Prerogative on this hand, and to excessive liberty on the other; and scarce has long experience yet fully satisfyed the minds of all men in it. In the Infancy of the world, when man was not so artificial and obdurate in cruelty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression as now, and Policy most rude, most Nations did choose rather to subject themselves to the meer dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of their Lords, than rely upon any limits; and so be ruled by Arbitrary Edicts, than written Statutes. But since Tyranny being more exquisite, and Policy more perfect, especially where Learning and Religion flourish,</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:104419:167"/>
                     <hi>few Nations will endure the thraldome which usually accompanies unbounded and unconditionate Royalty; Yet</hi> long it was <hi>ere the bounds and conditions of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Lords was so wisely determined, or quietly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as now they are: for at first, when as</hi> Ephori, Tribuni, Curatores, &amp;c. <hi>were erected to poise against the scale of Soveraignty, much blood was shed about them, and States were put into new broils by them, and some places the remedy proved worse than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease. In all great distresses, the body of the people were ever constrained to rise, and by force of the major par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put an end to all intestine strifes, and make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress of all publick grievances: But many times cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities grew to a strange height, before so cumbersome a body could be raised; and when it was raised, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it were so distracted and irregular, that after much spoil and effusion of blood, sometimes only one Tyranny was exchanged for another, till some was invented to regulate the motions of the peoples molimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous body. I think Arbitrary rule was most safe for the World: but</hi> Now, <hi>since most Countries have found an art and peaceable order for publick Assemblies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the people may assume its own power to do it self right, without disturbance to it self or injury to Princes; he is very unjust that will oppose this art or order. That Princes may not be</hi> Now <hi>beyond all limits and Laws, nor yet to be tyed upon those limits by any private par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the whole Community, in its underived Majesty, shall convene to do justice; and that the Convention may not be without intelligence, certain times, and places, and forms, shall be appointed for its reglement; and that the vastness of its own bulk may not breed confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by vertue of election and representation, a few shall act for many, the wise shall consent for the simple,</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:104419:168"/>
                     <hi>the vertue of all shall redound to some, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of some shall redound to all; and surely as this admirably-composed Court, which is now called a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, is more regularly and orderly formed, than when it was called mickle Synod of</hi> Wittena-gemot, <hi>or when this real body of the people did throng together at it: so it is</hi> not yet <hi>perhaps without some defects, which by art and policy might receive farther amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: some divisions have sprung up of late between both Houses, and some between the King and both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, by reason of incertainty of Iurisdiction; and some Lawyers doubt how far the Parliament is able to create new forms and presidents, and has a Iurisdiction over it self; all these doubts would be solemnly solved: but in the first place, the true priviledges of Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing not only to the being and efficacy of it, but to the honour and complement of it, would be clearly declared: for the very naming of priviledges of Parliament, as if they were chimera's to the ignorant sort, and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown unto the Learned, hath been entertained with scorn since the beginning of this Parliament.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, he acknowledgeth that <hi>the Iurisdiction is uncertain, and the priviledges not clearly declared of limited Monarchy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These two evident truths delivered by him, he labours mainly to disguise. He seems to insinuate that <hi>Arbitrary Government was but in the infancy of</hi>
                     <pb n="305" facs="tcp:104419:168"/>
                     <hi>the World,</hi> for so he terms it; but if we enquire of him, how long he will have this infancy of the world to last, he grants it continued above three thousand years, which is an unreasonable time for the world to continue under-age: for the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers he doth finde of Arbitrary power, were the <hi>Ephori, Tribuni, Curatores, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Ephori</hi> were above three thousand years after the Creation, and the <hi>Tribuni</hi> were later; as for his <hi>Curatores,</hi> I know not whom he means, except the <hi>Master of the Court of Wards,</hi> I cannot English the word <hi>Curator</hi> better. I do not believe that he can shew that any <hi>Curatores</hi> or <hi>&amp; caetera</hi>'s which he mentions were so antient as the <hi>Ephori.</hi> As for the <hi>Tribuni,</hi> he mistakes much if he thinks they were erected to limit and bound Monarchy; for the State of <hi>Rome</hi> was at the least <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocratical</hi> (as they call it) <hi>if not popular,</hi> when <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the people were first hatched. And for the <hi>Ephori,</hi> their power did not limit or regulate Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, but quite take it away; for a <hi>Lacedemonian King in the judgment of</hi> Aristotle <hi>was no King indeed, but in name onely, as Generalissimo of an Army;</hi> and the best Politicians reckon the <hi>Spartan</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to have been <hi>Aristocratical,</hi> and not <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical;</hi> and if a limited Monarchy cannot be found in <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> I doubt our <hi>Observator</hi> will hardly find it any where else in the whole World; and in substance he confesseth as much, when he saith, Now <hi>most Countries have found out an art and peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble order for publick Assemblies;</hi> as if it were a thing but new done, and not before; for so the word <hi>Now</hi> doth import.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Observator</hi> in confessing <hi>the Iurisdiction to be incertain, and the priviledges undetermined of that</hi>
                     <pb n="306" facs="tcp:104419:169"/>
                     <hi>Court that should bound and limit Monarchy,</hi> doth in effect acknowledge there is no such Court at all: for every Court consists of <hi>Iurisdictions</hi> and <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges;</hi> it is these two that create a Court, and are the essentials of it: <hi>If the admirably composed Court of Parliament have some defects which may receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,</hi> as he saith, <hi>and if those defects be such as cause divisions both between the Houses, and between the King and both Houses, and these divisions be about</hi> so main a matter as <hi>Iurisdictions and Priviledges, and power to create new Priviledges,</hi> all which are the Fundamentals of every Court, (for until they be agreed upon, the act of every Court may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be uncertain, but invalid, and cause of tumults and sedition:) And <hi>if all these doubts and divisions have need to be solemnly solved,</hi> as our <hi>Observator</hi> confesseth: Then he hath no reason at all to say, that <hi>Now the conditions of Supream Lords are wisely determined and quietly conserved,</hi> or that Now <hi>most Countries have found out an art, and peaceable order for publick affairs, whereby the people may resume its own power to do it self right without injury unto Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> for how can the <hi>underived Majesty of the people by assuming its own power,</hi> tell how to do <hi>her self right,</hi> or how <hi>to avoid doing injury to the Prince, if her Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction be uncertain, and Priviledges undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He tells us Now <hi>most Countries have found an art, and peaceable order for publick Assemblies: and to the intent that Princes may not be</hi> Now <hi>beyond all limits and Laws, the whole community in its unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Majesty shall convene to do Iustice.</hi> But he doth not name so much as one Country or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that hath found out this art, where the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:104419:169"/>
whole Community in its underived Majesty did ever convene to do Justice. I challenge him, or any other for him, to name but one Kingdome that hath either <hi>Now</hi> or heretofore found out this art or peaceable order. We do hear a great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor in this age, of moderated and limited Kings; <hi>Poland, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> are talked of for such; and in these Kingdomes, or nowhere, is such a moderated Government, as our <hi>Observator</hi> means, to be found. A little enquiry would be made into the manner of the Government of these Kingdoms: for these Northern people, as <hi>Bodin</hi> observeth, <hi>breath after liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First for <hi>Poland, Boterus</hi> saith, that <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it is elective altogether, and representeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Aristocracie than a Kingdome: the Nobility, who have great authority in the Diets, chusing the King, and limiting His Authority, making His So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty but a slavish Royalty: these diminutions of Regality began first by default of King</hi> Lewis, <hi>and</hi> Jagello, <hi>who to gain the succession in the Kingdom contrary to the Laws, one for his daughter, and the other for his son, departed with many of his Royalties and Prerogatives, to buy the voices of the Nobility.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Author of the book called <hi>the Estates of the world,</hi> doth inform us that the <hi>Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was more free, not being subject to any Laws, and having absolute Power, not onely of their estates, but also of life and death. Since Christian Religion was received, it began to be moderated, first by holy admonitions of the Bishops and Clergy, and then by services of the Nobility in war: Religious Princes gave many Honours, and many liberties to the Clergy and Nobility, and quit much of their Rights, the</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:104419:170"/>
                     <hi>which their successors have continued. The superiour dignity is reduced to two degrees, that is, the</hi> Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>and the</hi> Chastelleine, <hi>for that Kings in former times did by little and little call these men to publike consultations, notwithstanding that they had absolute power to do all things of themselves, to command, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, recompence, and punish, of their own motions: since they have ordained that these Dignities should make the body of a Senate, the King doth not challenge much right and power over His Nobility, nor over their estates, neither hath he any over the Clergy. And though the Kings Authority depends on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for His election, yet in many things it is absolute after He is chosen: He appoints the Diets at what time and place He pleaseth; He chooseth Lay-Councellors, and nominates the Bishops, and whom He will have to be His Privy Councel: He is absolute disposer of the Revenues of the Crown: He is absolute establisher of the Decrees of the Diets: It is in His power to advance and reward whom he pleaseth. He is Lord immediate of His Subjects, but not of His Nobility: He is Soveraign Iudge of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in criminal causes. The power of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty daily increaseth, for that in respect of the Kings electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they neither have Law, rule, nor form to do it, neither by writing nor tradition. As the King governs His Subjects which are immediately His, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Authority; so the Nobility dispose immediately of their vassals, over whom every one hath more than a Regal power, so as they intreat them like slaves. There be certain men in</hi> Poland <hi>who are called</hi> EARTHLY MESSENGERS <hi>or</hi> Nuntio's, <hi>they are as it were Agents of Iurisdictions or Circles of the Nobility: these have a certain Authority, and, as</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:104419:170"/>
                     <hi>saith, in the time of their Diets these men as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble in a place neer to the Senate-House, where they chuse two Marshals, by whom (but with a Tribune-like authority) they signifie unto the Council what their requests are. Not long since, their authority and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation grew so mightily, that they now carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as Heads and Governours, rather than officers and ministers of the publick decrees of the State: One of the Councel refused his Senators place, to become one of these officers. Every Palatine, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, calls together all the Nobility of His Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate; where having propounded unto them the matters whereon they are to treat, and their will being known, they chuse four or six out of the company of the</hi> EARTHLY MESSENGERS; these deputies meet and make one body, which they call the order of Knights.</p>
                  <p>This being of late years the manner and order of the government of <hi>Poland,</hi> it is not possible for the <hi>Observator</hi> to finde among them that the <hi>whole Community in its underived Majesty doth ever convene to do Iustice:</hi> nor any election or representation of the Community, or that the people assume its own power to do it self right. The EARTHLY MESSENGERS, though they may be thought to represent the Commons, and of late take much upon them, yet they are elected and chosen by the Nobility, as their agents and officers. The Community are either vassals to the King, or to the Nobility, and enjoy as little freedom or liberty as any Nation. But it may be said perhaps, that though the Community do not limit the King, yet the Nobility do, and so he is a limited Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy. The Answer is, that in truth, though
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:104419:171"/>
the Nobility at the chusing of their King do limit his power, and do give him an Oath; yet afterwards they have always a desire to please him, and to second his will; and this they are forced to do, to avoid discord: for by reason of their great power, they are subject to great dissentions, not onely among themselves, but between them and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Knights, which are the <hi>Earthly Messengers:</hi> yea, the Provinces are at discord one with another: and as for Religion, the diversity of Sects in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> breed perpetual jars and hatred among the people, there being as many Sects as in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> it self, or any popular government can desire. The danger of sedition is the cause, that though the Crown depends on the election of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; yet they have never rejected the Kings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour, or transferred the Realm to any other family, but once, when deposing <hi>Ladislaus</hi> for his idleness (whom yet afterward they restored) they elected <hi>Wencelaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> But if the Nobility do agree to hold their King to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which is, not to conclude any thing but by the advice of his Councel of Nobles, nor to choose any wife without their leaves, then it must be said to be a Common-weal, not a Royalty; and the King but onely the mouth of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or as Queen <hi>Christina</hi> complained, that <hi>Her Husband was but the shadow of a Soveraign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next, if it be considered how the Nobility of <hi>Poland</hi> came to this great power; it was not by any <hi>original contract,</hi> or <hi>popular convention:</hi> for it is said <hi>they have neither Law, Rule, nor Form written or unwritten, for the election of their King;</hi> they may thank the Bishops and Clergy: for by their holy
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:104419:171"/>
admonitions and advice, good and Religious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to shew their piety, were first brought to <hi>give much of their Rights and Priviledges to their Subjects, devout Kings were meerly cheated of some of their Royalties.</hi> What power soever general Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Estates claim or exercise over and above the bare naked act of Councelling, they were first beholding to the Popish Clergy for it: it is they first brought Parliaments into request and power: I cannot finde in any Kingdom, but onely where Popery hath been, that Parliaments have been of reputation; and in the greatest times of Superstition they are first mentioned.</p>
                  <p>As for the Kingdom of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> I read that the Senators, who are all chosen out of the Nobility, and seldom exceed the number of 28, with the chief of the Realm, do chuse their King. They have always in a manner set the Kings eldest Son upon the Royal Throne. The Nobility of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke</hi> withstood the Coronation of <hi>Frederick</hi> 1559, till he sware not to put any Noble-man to death until he were judged of the Senate; and that all Noble-men should have power of life and death over their Subjects without appeal; and the King to give no Office without consent of the Councel. There is a Chancelour of the Realm, before whom they do appeal from all the Provinces and Islands, and from him to the King himself. I hear of nothing in this Kingdom that tends to Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; no Assembly of the Commons, no elections, or representation of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sweden</hi> is governed by a King <hi>heretofore elective,</hi> but now made hereditary in <hi>Gustavus</hi> time: it is divided into Provinces: an appeal lieth from the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:104419:172"/>
Vicount of every territory to a Soveraign Judge called a <hi>Lamen;</hi> from the <hi>Lamens,</hi> to the Kings Councel; and from this Councel, to the King himself.</p>
                  <p>Now let the <hi>Observator</hi> bethink himself, whether all, or any of these three Countries have found out any art at all whereby the <hi>people or community may assume its own power:</hi> if neither of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes have, most Countries have not, nay none have. The people or Community in these three Realms are as absolute vassals as any in the world; the regulating power, if any be, is in the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: Nor is it such in the Nobility as it makes shew for. The election of Kings is rather a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, than any real power: for they dare hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chuse any but the Heir, or one of the blood Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: if they should chuse one among the Nobility, it would prove very factious; if a stranger, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, neither safe. For the Government, though the Kings be sworn to raign according to the Laws, and are not to do any thing without the consent of their Councel in publick affairs: yet in regard they have power both to advance and reward whom they please, the Nobility and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators do comply with their Kings. And <hi>Boterus</hi> concludes of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> who seem to be most moderated, that <hi>such as is their valour, dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and wisdome, such is their Power, Authority, and Government.</hi> Also <hi>Bodin</hi> saith, that <hi>these three Kingdoms are States changable and uncertain, as the Nobility is stronger than the Prince, or the Prince than the Nobility;</hi> and the people are so far from liberty, that he saith, <hi>Divers particular Lords exact not onely Customs, but Tributes also; which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and grow stronger, both by long prescription of time, and use of Iudgments.</hi>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT To the JURY-MEN OF ENGLAND.</head>
                  <p>THE late Executon of Witches at the Summer Assises in <hi>Kent,</hi> occasioned this brief Exercitation, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses it self to such as have not delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately thought upon the great difficulty in discovering, <hi>what,</hi> or <hi>who</hi> a Witch is. To have nothing but the publick Faith of the present Age, is none of the best Evidence, unless the universality of elder times do concur with these Doctrines, which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the times of darkness brought forth, and credulity in these days of light hath continued.</p>
                  <p>Such as shall not be pleased with this Tractate, are left to their liberty to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether all those Proofs and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions number'd up by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:104419:174"/>
for the Conviction of a Witch, be not all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, or confessed by himself to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient or uncertain.</p>
                  <p>He brings no less than eighteen signs or proofs, whereby a <hi>Witch</hi> may be discovered, which are too many to be all true: his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven first he himself confesseth to be insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for Conviction of a <hi>Witch;</hi> His eight next proofs (which he saith men in place have used) he acknowledgeth to be false or insufficient. Thus of his Eighteen proofs, which made a great shew, fifteen of them are cast off by himself; there remains then his sixteenth, which is the Confession of a <hi>Witch;</hi> yet presently he is forced to yield, That a bare Confession is not a sufficient proof, and so he cometh to his seventeenth proof, which is, two credible witnesses; and he here grants, that the League between the Devil and the <hi>Witch</hi> is closely made, and the practices of <hi>Witches</hi> be very secret, that hardly a man can be brought, which upon his own knowledge can aver such things. Therefore at last, when all other proofs fail, he is forced to fly to his eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth proof, and tells us, that yet there is a way to come to the knowledge of a <hi>Witch,</hi> which is, that <hi>Satan</hi> useth all means to discover a <hi>Witch;</hi> which how it can be
<pb facs="tcp:104419:174" rendition="simple:additions"/>
well done, except the Devil be bound over to give in evidence against the Witch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be understood.</p>
                  <p>And as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> weakens and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credits all his own proofs, so he doth the like for all those of King <hi>James,</hi> who, as I remember, hath but Three Arguments for the discovery of a <hi>Witch.</hi> First, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Mark of a <hi>Witch,</hi> of which Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> saith, it hath no power by Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance. Secondly, The discovery by a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-<hi>Witch;</hi> this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> by no means will allow to be a good proof. Thirdly, the swimming of a <hi>Witch,</hi> who is to be flung cross ways into the water, that is, as <hi>Wierus</hi> interprets it, when the Thumb of the right Hand is bound to the great Toe of the left Foot, and the Thumb of the left Hand to the great Toe of the right Foot, Against this Tryal by water, together with a disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in a <hi>Witch</hi> to shed Tears, (which King <hi>James</hi> mentions) <hi>Delrio</hi> and Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> both argue; for it seems they both write after King <hi>James,</hi> who put forth his Book of Daemonologie in his youth, being in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> about his age of thirty years.</p>
                  <p>It concerns the people of this Nation to be more diligently instructed in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Witch-craft, than those of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb facs="tcp:104419:175"/>
Countries, because here they are tyed to a stricter or exacter Rule in giving their sentence than others are: for all of them must agree in their Verdict, which in a case of extream difficulty is very dangerous; and it is a sad thing for men to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to that extremity, that they must ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard their Consciences or their Lives.</p>

                  <p>THE Point in Question is briefly this; Whether such a Witch as is Condemned by the Laws and Statutes of this Land, be one and the same with the Witch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>

                     <head>In this Statute, these Points are observable.</head>
                     <item>1. That this Statute was first framed in 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and onely the penalties here a little altered, and the last clause concerning provoking of persons to love, and destroying of Cattle and Goods, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is so changed, that I cannot well make sence of it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be rectified according to the words of the former Statute which stands repealed.</item>
                     <item>2. Although the Statute runs altogether in the disjunctive <hi>Or,</hi> and so makes every single crime capital, yet the Judges usually by a favourable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:104419:176"/>
take the disjunctive <hi>Or,</hi> for the copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>And;</hi> and therefore ordinarily they condemn none for Witches, unless they be charged with the Murdering of some person.</item>
                     <item>3.

                     <p>FOr the better discovery of the qualities of these crimes, I shall spend some discourse upon the Definition of those Arts by Divines: for both those of the Reformed Churches, as well as these of the Roman, in a manner, agree in their definition of the sin of Witch-craft. I shall instance in two late Writers, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>William Perkins</hi> in his Discourse of Witch-craft, and in <hi>Martin Delrio,</hi> a Jesuit of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Magical Disquisitions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our English word <hi>Witch,</hi> is derived from the Dutch word <hi>Wiechelen,</hi> or <hi>Wijchelen,</hi> which doth properly signifie <hi>whinying</hi> or <hi>neying</hi> like a Horse, and doth also signifie to foretel or prophecy; and <hi>Weicheler</hi> signifies a <hi>Southsayer;</hi> for that the <hi>Germans,</hi> from whom our Ancestors the <hi>Saxons</hi> descended, usually and principally did, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> tells us, <hi>divine and fore-tell things to come, by the whinying and neying of their Horses. Hinnitu &amp; fremitu</hi> are his words.</p>
                     <p>For the Definition Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Witch-craft is an Art serving for the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delrio</hi> defineth it to be <hi>an Art, which by the power of a Contract entred into with the</hi>

                        <hi>Devil, some wonders are wrought which pass the common understanding of men. Ars qua vi pacti cum Daemonibus initi mira quaedam communem hominum captum superantia officiuntur.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these two Definitions, some Points are worth the noting.</p>
                     <p>1. They both agree in the main Foundation, which is a Contract with the Devil, and therefore Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> thought it most necessary, that this main point should be proved; to which purpose he promiseth to define a Witch, by <hi>opening the nature of Witch-craft, as it is delivered</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>in the old and new Testament;</hi> and yet after he confesseth a <hi>manifest Covenant is not so</hi>

                        <hi>fully set down in Scripture:</hi> And out of the <hi>New Testament</hi> he offers no proof at all, though he promised it; nevertheless, he resolves us that a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is a most evident and certain truth, that may not be called in question.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For proof of a Covenant, he produceth onely one Text out of the old Testament; neither doth he say, that the Text proveth a Contract with the Devil, but onely that it <hi>intimateth</hi> so much: Thus at the first he falls from a proof to an intimation onely. The Text is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. <hi>v.</hi> 5. of which his words are these: <hi>Howsoever the</hi>

                        <hi>common Translation runneth in other terms, yet the words are properly to be read thus: Which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the voice of the mutterer joyning Societies cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly—the main Foundation of the Charm, Societies</hi>

                        <hi>or Confederacies cunningly made, not between man and man, but, as the words import, between the Enchanter and the Devil,</hi> Deut. 18. 11.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> Though there be neither mention of Spirit or Devil in this Psalm, yet Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would have us believe that there can be no <hi>conjoyning or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociating</hi> but with the Devil: but Mr. <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> as great a <hi>Rabby</hi> as Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> finds other Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of this Text; and though he mentions fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the Devil, yet he puts it in the third and last place, as the newest and latest Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for he teacheth us, that the <hi>Enchanter had his title both in Psalm</hi> 58. <hi>and in</hi> Deut. 18. <hi>either because be associates Serpents, making them tame and familiar that they hurt not, or because such persons use to bind and tye bonds, or things about the body, to heal or hurt by Sorcery.</hi> Also he teacheth us, that a <hi>Charmer</hi> doth joyn or <hi>speak words of a strange language, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sence, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delrio</hi> it seems puts no confidence in this Text of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> for he doth not cite it to prove a Contract; yet he hath also one Text of his own to that purpose, it is <hi>Esay</hi> 28. 15. where it is said, <hi>We have made a Covenant with</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Qu. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Death, and with Hell we are at an agreement; Percussimus foedus cum morte, &amp; cum inferno fecimus pactum:</hi> and <hi>Delrio</hi> tells us, that <hi>Tho. Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> did apply this Text to Witches, <hi>magis satis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babili interpretatione.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answer.</hi> If this Text be considered, it proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: for it doth not charge the proud and drunken <hi>Ephraimites,</hi> of whom it is spoken, that they had made an agreement with Hell, but it is onely a false brag of their own, to justifie their
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:104419:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wickedness by a lye: for it is not possible to make a Covenant with Death, which in it self is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a meer not being; and whereas it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an agreement with Hell, it may be translated as well, if not better in this place, an <hi>agreement with the Grave;</hi> and so the Interlineary Bible hath it; and <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Iunius</hi> render it, <hi>Pepigimus foedus cum morte, &amp; cum sepulchro egimus cautum;</hi> which they term a <hi>Thrasonical hyperbole:</hi> and <hi>Deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datus his Italian Bible hath, Habbiamo fatto lega col sepolcro;</hi> so likewise the <hi>Spanish Bible</hi> translates it, <hi>Concierto tenemos hecho con la muerte, è con la sepultura hazimos acuerdo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be wondered that neither Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> nor the Jesuit have any other or better Texts to prove this Contract between the Witch and the Devil. But the truth is, it is very little that either of them say of this great point, but pass it over perfunctorily. Perhaps it may be thought that King <hi>Iames</hi> hath said, or brought more and better proofs in this point; but I do not finde that he doth meddle with it at all, but takes it for granted that if there be Witches, there must needs be a Covenant, and so leaves it without further proof.</p>
                     <p>A second note is, that the agreement between the Witch and the Devil they call a Covenant, and yet neither of the parties are any way bound to perform their part; and the Devil, without doubt, notwithstanding all his craft, hath far the worst part of the bargain. The bargain runs thus in Mr. <hi>P.</hi> the <hi>Witch as a slave</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>binds himself by Vow to believe in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and to give him either Body, or Soul, or both, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                        <pb n="320" facs="tcp:104419:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>his hand-writing, or some part of his Blood. The Devil promiseth to be ready at his vassals com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to appear in the likeness of any Creature, to consult, and to aid him for the procuring of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, Honour, Wealth, or Preferment; to go for him, to carry him any whither, and do any command.</hi> Whereby we see the Devil is not to have benefit of his bargain till the Death of the Witch; in the mean time he is to appear always at the Witches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to go for him, to carry him any whither, and to do any command: which argues the Devil to be the Witches slave, and not the Witch the Devils.</p>
                     <p>Though it be true which <hi>Delrio</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that the Devil is at liberty to perform or break his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, for that no man can compel him to keep his promise;</hi> yet on the other side, it is as possible for the Witch to frustrate the Devils Contract, if he or she have so much grace as to repent; the which there may be good cause to do, if the Devil be found not to perform his promise: Besides, a Witch may many times require that to be done by the Devil, which God permits not the Devil to do; thus against his will the Devil may lose his credit, and give occasion of repentance, though he endeavour to the utmost of his power to bring to pass whatsoever he hath promised; and so fail of the benefit of his bargain, though he have the hand-writing, or some part of the blood of the Witch for his security, or the solemnity before witnesses, as <hi>Delrio</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineth.</p>
                     <p>I am certain they will not say that Witch-craft is like the sin against the Holy Ghost, unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:104419:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confesseth the contrary, and <hi>Delrio</hi> denies it not; for he allows the <hi>Sacrament of the Eucharist</hi> to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred<note place="margin">Lib. 5. Sect. 18.</note> to a condemned Witch, with this limitation, that there may be about four hours space between the Communion, and the Execution, in which time it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably thought that the <hi>Sacramental Species</hi> (as they call it) may be consumed.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>Delrio</hi> in his second Book, and fourth Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gives this Rule, which he saith <hi>is common to all Contracts with the Devil, That first they must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Faith, and Christianism, and Obedience to God, and reject the patronage of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile her.</hi> To the same purpose Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> affirms that <hi>Witches renounce God and their Baptism.</hi> But if this be common to all Contracts with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, it will follow that none can be Witches but such as have first been Christians, nay and <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> if <hi>Delrio</hi> say true; for who else can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the patronage of the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> And what shall be said then of all those Idolatrous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of <hi>Lapland, Finland,</hi> and of divers parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and many other Heathenish Nations, which our Travellers report to be full of Witches? and indeed, what need or benefit can the Devil gain by contracting with those Idolaters, who are surer his own, than any Covenant can make them?</p>
                     <p>4. Whereas it is said that <hi>Witchcraft is an Art working wonders,</hi> it must be understood that the art must be the Witches Art, and not the Devils, otherwise it is no Witch-craft, but Devils<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft. It is confessed on all hands, that the Witch doth not work the wonder, but the Devil onely.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:104419:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
It is a rare Art for a Witch by her Art to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do nothing her self, but to command an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to practise the Art. In other Arts, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confesseth <hi>that the Arts Master is able by himself to practise his Art, and to do things belonging thereunto without the help</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 1. Sect. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>of another; but in this it is otherwise—the power of effecting strange works doth not flow from the skill of the Witch, but is derived wholly from Satan.</hi> To the same purpose he saith, that the <hi>means of working wonders</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 4. Sect. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>are Charms used as a Watch-word to the Devil to cause him to work wonders:</hi> so that the Devil is the worker of the wonder, and the Witch but the Counsellour, Perswader, or Commander of it, and onely accessary before the Fact, and the Devil onely principal. Now the difficulty will be, how the <hi>accessary</hi> can be <hi>duely and lawfully convicted and attainted</hi> according as our Statute requires, unless the Devil, who is the Principal, be first convicted, or at least outlawed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which cannot be, because the Devil can never be lawfully summoned according to the rules of our Common-law. For further proof that the Devil is the principal in all such wonders, I shall shew it by the testimony of King <hi>Iames,</hi> in a case of Murther, which is the most capital crime our Laws look upon. First, he tells us that <hi>the Devil teaches Witches how to make Pictures of Wax and Clay, that by the rosting thereof the persons that they bear the Name of may be continually melted, or dried away by continual sickness—not that any of these means which he teacheth them (except poysons, which are composed of things natural) can of themselves help</hi>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:104419:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>anything to these turns they are imployed in.</hi> Secondly, King <hi>Iame</hi> affirms that <hi>Witches</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Cap. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>can bewitch, and take the life of Men or Women by rosting of the Pictures, which is very possible to their Master to perform: for although that instrument of Wax have no vertue in the turn doing, yet may he not very well, by that same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that his conjured Slave melts that Wax at the fire, may he not I say at these same times, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly as a spirit, so weaken and scatter the spirits of life of the patient, as may make him on the one part for faintness to sweat out the humours of his body; and on the other part, for the not concurring of these spirits which cause his digestion, so debilitate his stomack, that his humour radical continually sweating out on the one part, and no new good Suck being put in the place thereof for lack of digestion on the other, he at last shall vanish away even as his Picture will do at the Fire.</hi> Here we see the Picture of Wax, roasted by the Witch, hath no vertue in the Murdering, but the Devil onely. It is necessary in the first place that it be duly proved that the party Murther'd be Murthered by the Devil: for it is a shame to bely the Devil; and it is not possible to be proved, if it be <hi>Subtilely done as a Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. Our Definers of Witch-craft dispute much, whether the Devil can work a Miracle: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve he can do a <hi>Wonder,</hi> but not a <hi>Miracle; Mirum,</hi> but not <hi>Miraculum.</hi> A Miracle, saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, is that which is above or against nature sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; a Wonder is that which proceeds not from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course of nature. Delrio</hi> will have a Miracle to be <hi>praeter,</hi> or <hi>supra naturae creatae vires:</hi> both seem to agree in this, that he had need be an admirable
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:104419:180"/>
or profound Philosopher, that can distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Wonder and a Miracle; it would pose <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> himself, to tell us every thing that can be done by the power of Nature, and what things cannot; for there be daily many things found out, and daily more may be, which our Fore-fathers never knew to be possible in Nature. Those that were converted by the Miracles of our Saviour, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stayed to enquire of their Philosophers what the power of Nature was; it was sufficient to them, when they saw things done, the like whereof they had neither seen nor heard of, to believe them to be Miracles.</p>
                     <p>6. It is commonly believed and affirmed by Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> that the cause which moves the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to bargain with a Witch, is a desire to obtain thereby the Soul and Body of the Witch. But I cannot see how this can agree with another Doctrine of his, where he saith, <hi>The Precepts of Witch-craft are not delivered indifferently to every Man, but to his own subjects the wicked; and not to them all, but to special and tried ones, whom he most betrusteth with his secrets, as being the fittest to to serve his turn, both in respect of their willingness to learn and practise, as also for their ability to become In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of the mischief he intendeth to others.</hi> All this argues, the end of the Devils rules of Witch-craft is not to gain <hi>Novices</hi> for new Subjects, but to make use of old ones to serve his turn.</p>
                     <p>7. The last clause of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> definition is, that <hi>Witch-craft doth work wonders so far as God shall permit.</hi> I should here desire to have known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> had thought that God doth permit farther power to the Devil upon his contracting
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:104419:181"/>
with the Witch, than he had before the Contract: for if the Devil had the same permission before the Contract, then he doth no more mischief upon the Contract, than he would have gladly done before, seeing, as Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> saith, <hi>The Devils malice towards all Men is of so high a degree, that he cannot endure they</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>should enjoy the World, or the benefits of this life (if it were possible) so much as one hour.</hi> But yet afterward I finde Master <hi>Perkins</hi> is more favourable to the Devil, where he writes, <hi>that if the Devil were not stirred up and provoked by the Witch, he would never do so much hurt as he doth.</hi>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>Of the Discerning and Discovery of a Witch.</head>
                     <p>A <hi>Magistrate,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, may not take upon him to examine whom</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 7. Sect. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>and how he willeth of any Crime, nor to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon slight causes, or to shew his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or upon sinister respects, or to revenge his malice, or to bring parties into danger and suspition; but he must proceed upon special presumptions.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He calls those <hi>presumptions, which do at</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>least probably and conjecturally note one to be a Witch, and are certain signs whereby the Witch may be discovered.</hi> I cannot but wonder that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> should say, that presumptions do at least probably and conjecturally note, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain signs to discover a Witch; when he confesseth, that though <hi>presumptions give occasion to examine, yet they are no sufficient causes of conviction: and though presumptions be never so strong, yet they are not proofs sufficient for Conviction, but onely for Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi>
                        <pb n="325" facs="tcp:104419:181"/>
Therefore no credit is to be given to those presumptions he reckons up. 1. For common fame, <hi>it falls out many times,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the innocent may be suspected, and some of the better sort notoriously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed.</hi> 2. <hi>The testimony of a fellow-Witch,</hi> he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, <hi>doth not probably note one to be a Witch.</hi> The like may be said of his third and fourth presumption, <hi>if after cursing, or quarrelling, or threatning, there follow present mischief.</hi> And the fifth presumption is more frivolous, which is, <hi>if the party be the Son or Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Servant, or Friend, neer neighbour, or old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of a Witch.</hi> The sixth presumption Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> dares not, or is loath to own, but saith, <hi>Some add, if the party suspected have the Devils Mark; and yet be resolves, if such a Mark be descried, whereof no evident reason in nature can be given, the Magistrate may cause such to be examined, or take the matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his own hands, that the truth may appear;</hi> but he doth not teach how the truth may be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. The last presumption he names, is, <hi>if the party examined be unconstant, or contrary to himself;</hi> here he confesseth, <hi>a good man may be fearful in a good cause, sometimes by nature, sometimes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the presence of the Iudge, or the greatness of the Audience; some may be suddenly taken, and others want that liberty of speech which other men have.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching Examination, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> names two kinds of proceedings, either by <hi>simple Question,</hi> or <hi>by Torture: Torture, when besides the enquiry by words, the Magistrate useth the Rack, or some other violent means to urge Confession;</hi> this he saith, <hi>may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully used, howbeit not in every case, but onely upon strong and great presumptions, and when the party is obstinate.</hi> Here it may be noted, that it is not
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:104419:182" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lawful for any person, but the Judge onely, to allow Torture: suspitious Neighbours may not, of their own heads, use either Threats, Terrors, or Tortures. I know not any one of those presumptions before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, to be sufficient to warrant a Magistrate to use Torture; or whether when the party constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies the Fact, it must be counted obstinacy. In case of Treason sometimes, when the main Fact hath been either confessed, or by some infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible proofs manifested, the Magistrate, for a farther discovery of some circumstance of the Time, the Place, and the Persons, or the like, have made use of the Rack: and yet that kind of torture hath not been of antient usage in this Kingdom; for if my memory fail not, I have read, that the Rack hath been called <hi>the Duke of</hi> Exeters <hi>Daughter, and was first used about</hi> Hen. 6. <hi>days.</hi>

                     <p>From presumptions, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proceeds to proofs of a Witch; and here he hath a neat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of proofs, <hi>less sufficient,</hi> or <hi>more sufficient;</hi> by less sufficient he meaneth insufficient, but gives them this mild and strange phrase of less sufficient, that it may not displease such friends (as I conceive) allow those less sufficient proofs for sufficient, though he reckons them for no better than Witch-craft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Those unsufficient sufficient proofs are weaker and worse than his presumptions, which he confesseth are no proofs at all; yet we must reckon them up. His first less sufficient proof is, <hi>The antient trial by taking red-hot Irons, or putting the hand in hot scalding water;</hi> this, he saith, <hi>hath been condemned for Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and wicked, as in truth it is: for an innocent man may thereby be condemned, and a rank Witch scape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished.</hi> A second insufficient proof is, <hi>Scratching</hi>
                        <pb n="327" facs="tcp:104419:182"/>
                        <hi>of the suspected party, and the present recovery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</hi> A third is, <hi>the burning the thing bewitched, is a Hog, an Ox, or other Creature, it is imagined a forcible means to cause the Witch to discover her self.</hi> A fourth, <hi>is the burning the Thatch of the suspected parties House.</hi> The fifth less<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sufficient proof is, <hi>the binding of the party hand and foot, and casting cross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways into the water; if she sinks, she is counted inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; if she float on the water and sink not, she is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Witch, convicted, and punished.</hi> The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> used this Tryal by cold water; and it was imagined, that the Devil being most light, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating more of Air than of Water, would hold them up above the water, either by putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self under the Witch, and lifting her up, as it were with his back, or by uniting himself, and possessing her whole body.</p>
                     <p>All these less sufficient proofs, saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, are so far from being sufficient, that some of them, if not all, are after a sort practices of Witch-craft, having no power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Gods Ordinance.</hi> Hereby he condemns point-blank King <hi>Iames</hi>'s judgment, as savouring of Witchraft, in allowing of the Tryal of a Witch by swimming as a principal proof. And as I take it, he condemns himself also, except he can find any Ordinance of God, that the having of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable and insensible mark or sore, shall be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, or certain sign of a Witch.</p>
                     <p>A sixth less sufficient proof, is the <hi>Testimony of a Wizard, Witch, or cunning man, who is gone or sent unto, and informs that he can shew in a glass the Face of the Witch.</hi> This accusation of a Witch by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Witch, Mr. <hi>Perkins denies to be sufficient; and he puts this case: If the Devil appear to a grand Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
                        <pb n="328" facs="tcp:104419:183"/>
                        <hi>in the likeness of some known man, and offer to take his Oath that the person in question is a Witch, should the Enquest receive his Oath or accusation to condemn the party? He answers, Surely no; and yet that is as much as the Testimony of another Witch, who onely by the help of the Devil revealeth the Witch: if this should be taken for a sufficient proof, the Devil would not leave one good man alive in the world.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This discrediting of the Testimony of a Witch, takes away the other (for he hath but two) of King <hi>Iames</hi> main proofs for the discovery of a Witch; for he saith, <hi>Who but Witches can be provers, and so witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the doings of Witches?</hi> and to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> himself confesseth, that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Witch-craft are not delivered, but to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils own Subjects, the wicked.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A seventh less sufficient proof is, <hi>when a man in open Court affirms, such a one fell out with me, and cursed me, threatning I should smart for it in my person or goods; upon these threats, such Evils and Losses pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently befel me; this is no sure ground for Conviction,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, for it pleaseth God many times to lay his Hands upon mens persons and goods, without the procurement of Witches;</hi> and yet saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, Experience shews, that ignorant people will make strong proofs of such presumptions, whereupon sometimes Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors do give their Verdict against parties innocent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last less sufficient proof is, <hi>if a man being sick, upon suspition will take it on his death, that such a one hath bewitched him, it is of no moment,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins; it is but the suspition of one man for himself, and is of no more force than another mans word against him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>All these proofs,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, which men in place have ordinarily used, be either false or insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent signs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="329" facs="tcp:104419:183"/>At the last Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> comes to his <hi>more suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proofs,</hi> which are in all but two. The confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Witch, or the proof of two witnesses. Against the confession of a Witch, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, <hi>it is objected, that one may confess against himself an untruth, being urged by</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Chap. 7. Sect. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>force or threatning, or by desire upon some grief to be out of the World; or at least be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in trouble, and perswaded it is the best course to save their lives and obtain their liberty, they may upon simplicity be induced to confess that they never did, even against themselves.</hi> The truth of this Allegation Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> doth not deny, but grants it, in that his Answer is, <hi>That he doth not say a bare Confession is sufficient, but a Confession after due Examination ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon pregnant presumptions.</hi> But if a bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession be not a sufficient proof, a pregnant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption can never make it such; or if it could, then it would not be a sufficient proof. For the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weakning of the confession of a suspected Witch, we may remember what Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath formerly answered, when it was alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>upon a melancholy humour, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 7. Sect. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>confess of themselves things false and impossible, That they are carried through the Air in a moment, that they pass through key-holes and cleffs of Doors; that they be sometimes turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cats, Hares, and other Creatures, and such like; all which are meer fables, and things impossible.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> answers, that <hi>when Witches begin to make a League, they are sober and sound in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; but after they be once in the League, their reason and understanding may be depraved, memory weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and all the powers of their Soul blemished; they</hi>
                        <pb n="330" facs="tcp:104419:184"/>
                        <hi>are deluded, and so intoxicated, that they will run into a thousand of phantastical imaginations, holding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be transformed into the shapes of other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be transported in the Air, to do many strange things which in truth they do not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> will confess, that the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Confession of a suspected Witch, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways after such time as her Covenant is made; when she is by his Confession deluded, and not fit to give testimony against her self.</p>
                     <p>His second <hi>more sufficient proof</hi> (he saith, <hi>if the party will not confess, as commonly it falleth out) is two witnesses avouching upon their own knowledge, either that the party accused hath made League with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or hath done some known practices of Witch-craft, or hath invocated the Devil, or desired his help.</hi> But if every man that hath invocated the Devil, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired his help, must have formerly made a League with him, then whole Nations are every man of them Witches; which I think none will say.</p>
                     <p>As for the League, and proof of Witchraft, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confesseth, <hi>Some may say, If these be the onely strong proofs for the Conviction of a Witch, it will be then impossible to put any one to death; because the League with Satan is closely made, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Witch-craft are also very secret, and hardly can a man be brought, which upon his own knowledge can aver such things.</hi> To this Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> answer is a confession: that <hi>howsoever the ground and practice be secret, and be to many unknown, yet there is a way to come to the knowledge thereof.—Satan endeavoreth the discovery, and useth all means to disclose Witches.</hi> This means he speaks of should be in the power of the Judge, or else it is no help for the Discovery of
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:104419:184"/>
a Witch, but onely when the Devil pleaseth. I do not find he proves that it is usual with Satan to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour any such Discovery; neither do I see how it is practicable by the Devil: for either he must do it by his own relation or report; which as it cannot be proved he ever did, so it is vain, and to no purpose if he do it; for Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the testimony of the Devil, as invalid, and of no force for conviction: or else the Devil must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it by some second means; and if there had been any such second means usual, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> would have taught us what they are, and not have left us onely to his two more sufficient proofs, which he confesseth are not infallible.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> tells us, that the <hi>Devils first discovering of himself for the gaining of a</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lib. 2. Cap. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Witch, is either upon their walking solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fields, or else lying pausing in their bed, but always without the company of any other; and at the making of Circles and Conjurations, none of that craft will permit any others to behold;</hi> when the Devil and his Subjects are thus close and secret in their actions, it cannot be imagined that he will use all means to discover his most special and trusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Subjects: and though Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> tells us, that <hi>by vertue of the Precontract, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cap. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>is cock-sure of his instruments;</hi> yet within a few lines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he changeth his note, and saith, <hi>Though he have good hope of them, yet he is not certain of their continuance, because some by the mercy of God have been reclaimed and freed from his Covenant.</hi> Besides, he confesseth, <hi>the Devil suffereth some to live long undisclosed, that they may exercise the greater measure of his malice in the world.</hi> It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:104419:185"/>
that if the two true proofs of Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> which are the Witches Confession, or sufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, fail, <hi>we have not warrant,</hi> as he saith, <hi>in the word, to put such an one to death.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I conclude this point in the words of Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins; I advise all Iurors, that as they be diligent in the zeal of Gods glory, so they would be careful what they do, and not to condemn any party suspected upon bare presumptions, without sound and sufficient proofs, that they be not guilty through their own rashness, of shedding innocent blood.</hi>

                     <p>IN <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. The Witch is named with divers other sorts of such as used the like unlawfull Arts; as the Diviner, the Observer of times, an Inchanter, a Charmer, a Consulter with a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirit, a Wisard, or a Necromancer. The Text addeth, <hi>All that do these things are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lord, and because of these abominations, the Lord thy God doth drive them</hi> [the Nations] <hi>out from before thee.</hi> If we desire to know what those abominations of the Nations were, we are told in general in the 14. Verse of the same Chapter: <hi>These Nations hearkened unto observers of times, and unto Diviners.</hi> There is no other crime in this Chapter laid to the charge of all, or any of these practisers of such unlawful Arts, but of <hi>lying Prophesies;</hi> and therefore the Text addeth, <hi>The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy Brethren, like unto me, unto him shall ye hearken, and not to the Diviners, Wisards, Charmers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Setting aside the case of <hi>Iob</hi> (wherein God gave a special and extraordinary Commission) I do not finde in Scripture that the Devil, or Witch, or any other, had power ordinarily permitted them, either to kill or hurt any man, or to meddle with the Goods of any: for though, for the trial of the hearts of men, God doth permit the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ordinarily to tempt them; yet he hath no
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:104419:186"/>
Commission to destroy the Lives or Goods of men; it is little less than blasphemy to say any such thing of the admirable providence of God, whereby he preserves all his Creatures.</p>
                     <p>It was crime sufficient for all those practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of unlawful Arts, to delude the people with false and lying Prophesies, thereby to make them forget to depend upon God, and <hi>to have their Souls turn after such as have Familiar Spirits, and after Wisards, to go a whoring after them,</hi> as the Lord saith, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 6. This spiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is flat Idolatry, in the common phrase of the Old Testament; and those that be enticers to it, thereby endeavour to destroy the Souls of the People, and are by many degrees more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, than those that onely destroy the Bodies or Goods of men.</p>
                     <p>If there were a Law that every one should be put to Death, or punished, that should advisedly endeavour to perswade men that they are skilful in those forbidden Arts, or in foretelling of things to come, or that they have contracted with the Devil, and can thereby murther or destroy mens Goods; I should never deny such a Law to be most consonant and agreeing with the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But because I may be thought by some a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of these forbidden Arts, through want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding the Scripture about the quality of them; I have made choice of a Man who is no friend to Witches, and whose learning in this
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:104419:186"/>
point will not be denied. In his own words I shall set down, what either<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the Hebrew Names of those prohibited Arts, or out of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Jewish Doctors can be gathered for the understanding of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>A Diviner, in Hebrew,</hi> a Foreseer, or<note place="margin">Ainsworth <hi>upon</hi> Deut. 18.</note> Presager, a Foreteller of things to come, as doth a Prophet—The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews take a Diviner to be one that doth things whereby he may foretel things to come, and say, Such a thing shall be, or not be, or say, It is good to do such a thing—The means of Divining; some doing it with Sand, some with Stones, some by lying down on the Ground, some with Iron, some with a Staff—He that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Diviner, is chastised with stripes.</p>
                     <p>2. <hi>An observer of times,</hi> or Soothsayer, an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server of the Clouds, a Planetary, or an observer of the flying of Fowls, an Augur. As the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners were carried much by inward and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Motions, so these by outward Observations in the Creatures. The Hebrews say, they were such as did set times for the doing of things, saying, Such a day is good, and such a day is naught.</p>
                     <p>3. <hi>An Observer of Fortunes,</hi> one that curiously searcheth signs of good or evil luck, which are learned by Experience: the <hi>Hebrew</hi> is, to finde out by Experience; Whereupon the word here used is one that too curiously observeth, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buseth things that do fall out, as lucky or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky.
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:104419:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Hebrews describe it thus, as if one should say, Because the morsel of Bread is fallen out of my mouth, or my Staff out of my hand, I will not go to such a place: because a Fox passed by on my right hand, I will not go out of my House this day. Our new Translation renders this word an Inchanter.</p>
                     <p>4. <hi>A Witch,</hi> a Sorcerer, such as do bewitch the Senses or minds of Men, by changing the forms of things to another hew. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word for a Witch properly signifies a Jugler, and is derived from a word which signifies <hi>changing or turning;</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> teacheth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7. that Witches wrought by Enchantments, that is, <hi>by secret Sleights, Iuglings, Close conveyance, or of Glistering like the flame of Fire, or a Sword, wherewith Mens Eyes were dazled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. <hi>A Charmer,</hi> or one that conjureth Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; the <hi>Hebrew</hi> signifies <hi>conjoyning or consoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi>—The Charmer is said to be he, that speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth words of a strange Language, and without sense; that if one say so or so unto a Serpent, it cannot hurt him; he that whispereth over a wound, or that readeth over an Infant that it may not be frighted, or layeth the Bible upon a Child that it may sleep.</p>
                     <p>6. <hi>A Wisard</hi> or cunning Man, in Hebrew named of his knowledge or cunning—The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> describe him thus, That he put in his mouth a bone of a Bird, and burned incense, and did other things until he fell down with shame, and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:104419:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spake with his mouth things that were to come to pass.</p>
                     <p>7. <hi>A Necromancer,</hi> one that seeketh unto the Dead: of him they say, he made himself hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and went and lodged among the Graves, that the dead might come unto him in a Dream, and make known unto him that which he asked of him; and others there were that clad themselves with Cloaths for that purpose<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and spake certain words, and burned Incense, and slept by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; that such a dead person might come and talk with them in a dream.</p>
                     <p>8. Lastly, <hi>The Consulter with Familiar Spirits,</hi> in Hebrew, a <hi>Consulter with Ob,</hi> applied here to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who possessed with an evil Spirit, spake with a hollow voice as out of a bottle.—The <hi>Hebrews</hi> explain it thus, That he which had a Familiar spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit stood and burned Incense, and held a rod of Mirtle-tree in his hand, and waved it, and spake certain words in secret, until he that enquired did hear one speak unto him, and answer him touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he enquired, with words from under the Earth, with a very low voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Likewise, one took a dead mans Skull and burnt Incense thereto, and inchanted thereby till he heard a very low voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Text in our English Translation being expounded a Familiar Spirit, and seconded by the History of the Woman of <hi>Endor,</hi> may seem a strong evidence that the Devil convenanted with Witches: but if all be granted that can be desired, that this Familiar Spirit signifies a Devil, yet it comes not home to prove the main point; for it is no proof
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:104419:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the Familiar Spirit enter'd upon Covenant, or had or could give power to others to kill the persons, or destroy the Goods of others. King <hi>Iames</hi> confesseth, <hi>the Devil can make some to be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, and so become very Daemoniaques; and that she who had the spirit of</hi> Python <hi>in</hi> Acts 16. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by she conquested such gain to her Master; that Spirit was not of her own raising or commanding, as she plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to appoint, but spake by her Tongue as well privately as publickly.</hi> We do not find the <hi>Pythonesse</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or reproved, but the unclean Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>in the Name of Iesus Christ to come out of her. The Child which was</hi> too young to make a Covenant with the Devil, was <hi>possessed with a dumb and deaf Spirit, and the Devil charged to come out, and enter no more into him,</hi> Mark 9. <hi>A Daughter of Abraham</hi> (that is, of the Faith of <hi>Abraham) was troubled with a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and bowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that she could not lift her self up,</hi> Luke 13. 10, 16.</p>
                     <p>It is observable, that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. where all the unlawful Arts are reckoned up, and most fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, the crime of them is charged upon the practisers of those Arts; but the crime of having a Familiar Spirit is not there condemned, but the consulter of a Familiar Spirit; so in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 31. the prohibition is, <hi>Regard not them that have Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Spirits;</hi> and so in <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>The Soul that turneth after such as have Familiar Spirits;</hi> so that it was not the having, but the consulting, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>
                     <p>If we draw nearer to the words of the Text, it

will be found, that these words, <hi>a Consulter with a Familiar Spirit,</hi> are no other than a <hi>Consulter with Ob;</hi> where the question will be what <hi>Ob</hi> signifieth. Expositors agree, that originally <hi>Ob</hi> signifieth a Bottle, and they say is applyed here to one posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with an evil Spirit, and speaketh with a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low voice as out of a Bottle: but for this I find no proof they bring out of Scripture, that saith, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth that <hi>Ob</hi> signifieth one possessed with a Familiar Spirit in the Belly; the onely proof is, that the Greek Interpreters of the Bible Translate it <hi>Engastromuthi,</hi> which is, speaking in the Belly; and the word anciently, and long before the time of the Septuagint Translators, was properly used for one that had the cunning or slight to shut his mouth, and seem to speak with his Belly; which that it can be done without the help of a Familiar Spirit, experience of this Age sheweth in an Irish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. We do not find it said, that the Woman of <hi>Endor</hi> did fore-tell any thing to <hi>Saul,</hi> by the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low voice of a Familiar Spirit in her Belly; neither did <hi>Saul</hi> require, nor the Woman promise so to answer him; but he required, <hi>Bring me him up who I shall name unto thee; and she undertook to do it;</hi> which argues a desire in <hi>Saul</hi> to consult with the dead, which is called <hi>Necromancy,</hi> or <hi>consulting with the dead.</hi>

                     <p>But it hath been said, she raised the Devil in <hi>Samuels</hi> likeness, yet there is no such thing said in the Text; when the Woman went about her work, the first thing noted is, that <hi>when she saw</hi> Samuel, <hi>she cryed out with a loud voice:</hi> An Argument she was frighted with seeing something she did not expect

to see: it is not said, that when she knew <hi>Saul,</hi> but when she saw <hi>Samuel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she cryed out with a lowd voice;</hi> when she knew <hi>Saul,</hi> she had no reason to be afraid, but rather comforted, for that she had his Oath for her security.</p>
                     <p>It may well be, that if either she had a Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar Spirit, or the Art of hollow-speaking, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to deceive <hi>Saul,</hi> and by her secret voice to have made him believe, that <hi>Samuel</hi> in another room had answered him; for it appears that <hi>Saul</hi> was not in the place where she made a shew of raising <hi>Samuel:</hi> for when she cryed out with a loud voice, <hi>Saul</hi> comforted her, and bid her not be afraid, and asked her <hi>what she saw? and what form is he of?</hi> which questions need not have been, if <hi>Saul</hi> had been in the Chamber with the Witch. King <hi>Iames</hi> confesseth, that <hi>Saul was in another chamber at the conjuration;</hi> and it is likely the woman had told <hi>Saul</hi> she had seen some fearful sight, which made him ask her what she saw? and her answer was, <hi>she saw gods ascending out of the Earth;</hi> and it may be understood, that Angels waited upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> who was raised by God, and not any Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets or Devils that she conjured up; otherwise, the words may be Translated as <hi>Deodat</hi> in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of his <hi>Italian</hi> Bible hath it, <hi>She saw a Man of Majesty or Divine Authority ascend, un' huomo di Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesta è d' Authorita Divina,</hi> which well answers the question of what form is he of? which is in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, not in the plural number.</p>
                     <p>We find it said in <hi>Esay</hi> 29. 4. <hi>Thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground,</hi>
                        <pb n="341" facs="tcp:104419:189"/>
                        <hi>and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be as one that hath a Fimiliar Spirit out of the ground, and thy speech shall wisper out of the Earth;</hi> which argues, the voice of <hi>Ob</hi> was out of the Earth, rather than out of the Belly; and so the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Exposition which I cited before affirms. Some learned have been of Opinion that a natural reason may be given why in some places certain exhalations out of the earth may give to some a prophetical spirit. Add hereunto, that some of the Heathen Oracles were said to speak out of the Earth: and among those five sorts of <hi>Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy,</hi> mentioned by Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> in his 76 Lecture of his censure of the <hi>Apocryphals,</hi> not any of them is said to have any Spirit in their Belly. The Romanists, who are all great affirmers of the power of Witches, agree, that the soul of <hi>Samuel</hi> was sent by God to the Woman of <hi>Endor:</hi> to this not onely <hi>Delrio,</hi> but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> before him agrees. That true <hi>Samuel</hi> did appear as sent by God, as he sent <hi>Elias</hi> to <hi>Ochosias King of Israel, who being sick sent to consult with Beelzebub the God of Echron,</hi> may appear, for that <hi>Samuel</hi> is so true and certain in his prediction to <hi>Saul;</hi> which no Witch, no Devil could ever have told: for though the Wisdome and Experience of the Devil do enable him to conjecture probably of many events, yet positively to say, <hi>To morrow thou and thy Sons shall die,</hi> is more than naturally the Devil could know.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> confesseth the Devil could not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel the exact time of <hi>Sauls</hi> death; and therefore he answers, that God revealed to the Devil as
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:104419:190"/>
his Instrument <hi>Sauls</hi> overthrow, by which means, and no other, the Devil was enabled to foretel the death of <hi>Saul.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> proves not that Satan was appointed by God to work <hi>Sauls</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, or that it was made known to him when it should be done.</p>
                     <p>As the rest of the Speech of <hi>Samuel</hi> is true, so these words of his, <hi>Why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up?</hi> may be also true; which cannot be, if it be spoken by the Devil; or why should the Devil tell truths in all other things else, and lie onely in this, I know no reason. Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> presseth these words against the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Samuel,</hi> thus: <hi>If Samuel had said them, he had lied; but Samuel could not lie, for Samuel could not be disquieted, nor raised by Saul.</hi> It is true, God onely raised <hi>Samuel effectually,</hi> but <hi>occasionally Saul</hi> might raise him. But, saith Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> though Saul <hi>was the occasion, yet</hi> Samuel <hi>could not truly say that</hi> Saul <hi>had disquieted him; for blessed are they that die in the Lord, saith the Spirit, because they rest from their labours; and</hi> Samuel <hi>was no more to be disquieted (if he were sent by God) than</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>were when they appeared to shew the Glory of Christ, Mat.</hi> 17. Answer. It did not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please <hi>Samuel</hi> to be employed in the Office of an Angel, but he obeyed God gladly; yet since the occasion of his appearing displeased God, it might for that cause displease also <hi>Samuel.</hi> Besides, we need not understand the disquieting of <hi>Samuels</hi> mind, but of his body, by not suffering it to rest in peace after death, according to the common and usual condition of Mankind: this sense the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:104419:190"/>
Original will well bear. Again, it cannot be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Devil would ever have preached so Divine and excellent a Sermon to <hi>Saul,</hi> which was able to have converted, and brought him to Repentance; this was not the way for the devil to bring either <hi>Saul</hi> or the woman to renounce God. Lastly, the Text doth not say that the woman raised <hi>Samuel;</hi> yet it calls him <hi>Samuel,</hi> and saith that <hi>Saul perceived or understood that it was Samuel.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> &amp; many others esteem <hi>Balaam</hi> to have been a Witch or Conjurer, but I find no such thing in the Text; when he was required to curse the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> his answer was, <hi>I will bring you word as the Lord shall speak unto me,</hi> Numb. 22. 8. and God came unto <hi>Balaam</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 9. and in <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Balaam</hi> saith, <hi>The Lord refuseth to give me leave;</hi> and when <hi>Balak</hi> sent a second time, his answer was, If <hi>Balak would give me his house full of silver and Gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the Lord my God, to do less or more.</hi> In <hi>v.</hi> 20. God cometh to <hi>Balaam</hi> and said, If <hi>the men come to call thee, go; but yet the words which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</hi> And when <hi>Balaam</hi> came before <hi>Balak</hi> he said, <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>Lo I am come unto thee, have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word which God putteth into my mouth, that shall I speak:</hi> and in the 23. Chap. v. 18. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> saith, <hi>How shall I curse whom God hath not cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?</hi> and in v. 12. he saith, <hi>Must I not take heed to speak that which the Lord hath put into my mouth?</hi> These places laid together, prove <hi>Balaam</hi> to have been a true Prophet of the Lord; and he prophesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing contrary to the Lords command, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls him a Prophet.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="344" facs="tcp:104419:191"/>Nevertheless it is true, that <hi>Balaam</hi> sinned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously, though not by being a Witch or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer, or a false Prophet; his faults were, that when God had told him he should not go to <hi>Balak,</hi> yet in his covetous heart he desired to go, being tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the rewards of Divination, and promise of promotion; so that upon a second Message from <hi>Balak</hi> he stayed the Messengers to see if God would suffer him to go; wherefore the Lord in his anger sent <hi>Balaam.</hi> Also when God had told <hi>Balaam</hi> that he would bless <hi>Israel,</hi> yet <hi>Balaam</hi> did strive to tempt God, and by several Altars and Sacrifices to change the mind of God. Again, when <hi>Balaam</hi> saw God immutable in blessing <hi>Israel,</hi> he taught <hi>Balak to lay a stumbling-block before the Sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to commit Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Rev.</hi> 2. 14. Whereas it is said that <hi>Balaam went not up as other times to seek for Enchantments, Num.</hi> 24. 2. the Original is, <hi>to meet Divinations,</hi> that is, he did not go seek the Lord by Sacrifices, as he did, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 3. 15.</p>
                     <p>An exact difference between all those Arts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in <hi>Deut.</hi> no man I think can give; that in some they did agree, and in others differed, seems probable. That they were all lying and false Prophets, though in several ways, I think none can deny. That they differed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of punishments is possible: there are but three sorts that can be proved were to be put to death, <hi>viz.</hi> the Witch, the Familiar Spirit, the Wisard. As for the Witch, there hath been some doubt made of it. The <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors that were skild
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:104419:191"/>
in the Laws of <hi>Moses,</hi> observe, that wheresoever one was to die by their Law, the Law always did run in an <hi>affirmative precept;</hi> as, the Man shall be stoned, shall die, shall be put to death, or the like; but in this text, and no where else in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the sentence is onely a <hi>Prohibition negative, Thou shalt not suffer a Witch to live,</hi> and not, Thou shalt put her to death, or stone her, or the like. Hence some have been of Opinion, that not to suffer a Witch to live, was meant not to relieve or maintain her by running after her, and reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. The <hi>Hebrews</hi> seem to have two sorts of Witches, some that did hurt, others that did hold the Eyes, that is, by jugling and slights de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Mens senses. The first they say was to be stoned, the other, which according to the proper notation of the word was the true Witch, was onely to be beaten.</p>
                     <p>The Septuagint have translated a Witch, an Apothecary, a Druggister, one that compounds poysons; and so the Latin word for a Witch is <hi>venefica,</hi> a maker of poysons: if any such there ever were, or be, that by the help of the Devil do poyson, such a one is to be put to death, though there be no Covenant with the Devil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is an Actor and principal her self, not by any wonder wrought by the Devil, but by the natural or occult property of the Poyson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the time of Christ,</hi> saith Mr. <hi>Perkins, though there be no particular mention made of any such Witch, yet thence it followeth not that there were none, for all things that then hapned are not Recorded; and I would</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:104419:192"/>
                        <hi>fain know of the chief Patrons of them, whether those persons possessed with the Devil, and troubled with strange Diseases, whom Christ healed, were not bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with some such people as our Witches are? if they say no, let them if they can prove the contrary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here it may be thought that Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> puts his Adversaries to a great pinch; but it doth not prove so: for the Question being onely whether those that were possessed in our Saviours Time were bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; The Opposers of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> say they were not bewitched: but if he or any other, say they, were, the Proof will rest wholly on him or them to make good their <hi>Affirmative;</hi> it cannot in reason be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that his Adversaries should prove the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> it is against the Rules of Disputation to require it.</p>
