            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>Taken and Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the Latin Original. Printed at <hi>ROME,</hi> by Order from the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the approach of the Jubilee, the Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> cauſe the Bull of the Jubilee to be publiſhed with a great deal of Pomp and Magnificence. This Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony is always performed on <hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> in the Great Portal of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church, in the <hi>Vatican;</hi> where for this purpoſe are placed two Rich Chairs, from whence the Miniſters choſen by his Holineſs, read with a very loud and diſtinct Voice, the Brief or Bull of the Jubilee in <hi>Italian:</hi> After this Publication four ſeveral Copies of the ſaid Bull are affixed to the <hi>Eaſt, South, Weſt</hi> and <hi>North</hi> Corners of the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> as it was practiſed in Pope <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. time, who in the year 1624, upon <hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> which then fell upon the 16 <hi>May,</hi> appear'd in Perſon in the Church of St. <hi>Peter's,</hi> and commanded Signior <hi>Don Auſtin Durando</hi> to read the beforementioned Brief in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſome of the Clerks of the Apoſtolick Chamber, and ſome other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, but neither any of the Cardinals nor of the Canons of St. <hi>Peter</hi> aſſiſted at the Ceremony. The Sunday next following the ſaid Bull was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe publiſhed in the ſame manner in the other Churches, where, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Antient Cuſtom, they are uſed to open the <hi>Holy Gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being done, Briefs or Letters are diſpatched to all the Patriarchs, Primates, Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, and other Superiours, of all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kingdoms, to notifie the Celebration of the Jubilee, and to exhort the Prelates to be more than ordinary Zealous in their Duty to inſtruct, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves or by their Miniſters, the Flocks committed to their Care, by which, means they may qualify themſelves to obtain the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the appoaching Jubilee; Juſt as the Jubilee inſtituted by <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to Gods order, was publiſhed before the ſeventh Month under the ſound of Trumpets.</p>
            <p>The Solemnity of the Jubilee it ſelf begins upon <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Eve,</hi> juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Veſpers,</hi> by a Ceremony, which deſerves particularly to be taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, which is <hi>the opening of the Holy Gate.</hi> For the better underſtanding of which, it is to be known, that this <hi>Holy Gate</hi> is one of the Gates of St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> which is always ſhut, nay even brick'd up during the interval betwixt the Jubilees, which always begins by the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Gate.</p>
            <p>On the 24 day therefore of <hi>December,</hi> which is the Eve of the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt, all the Gates of theſe four Churches, where there are any <hi>Holy Gates,</hi> are ſhut up by his Holineſs's order, ſo that no body can paſs thro', till ſuch time they are opened with the accuſtomed Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>After dinner, about the time of the <hi>Veſpers</hi> of this great Eve, a moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion is made; at which aſſiſt the Ambaſſadours of Foreign Princes, then reſiding in <hi>Rome,</hi> the Magiſtrates of the City, all the Penitentiaries and Prelates abiding at <hi>Rome</hi> all the Chapters, Fraternities, the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, the College of Cardinals, and the Sovereign <hi>Pontife</hi> in perſon; each according to his Ranck and Quality. Thus they go in proceſſion with a great Croſs before them, to the Chappel of the Apoſtolick Palace, where the whole Company being entred, the Holy Father, with all there preſent, fall upon their Knees before the Sacrament; In the mean time that many Officers are employed in lighting flambeaus for the Cardinals to hold, as a ſign of Joy. Then the Pope throws ſome Incenſe upon a Chaving-diſh, with a moſt profound Reverence before the Altar; after which, he begins the Hymn; <hi>Veni Creator Spiritus,</hi> which is continued to the end by a Conſort of Muſick, and Sung diſtinctly, to repreſent the Holy Fathers <hi>in Limbo.</hi> From thence, this Proceſſion goes on in the ſame Order as before, to St <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church, being followed by the Holy <hi>Father</hi> in perſon, who is carried in a Chair to the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> which, as well as all the reſt, is kept cloſe ſhut up. Every body having taken his place, the Holy Father gets out of his Chair, and with a lighted Wax-taper in his hand, walks up three ſteps to another Chair, placed for that purpoſe, juſt by the Holy Gate. After he has repoſed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he ariſes, and turning himſelf towards the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> he knocks with a Silver Hammer on the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> which is to be opened, and Sings like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe three ſeveral times, the following Verſes, unto which the Muſicians, who Compoſe the <hi>Chorus,</hi> anſwer at each time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>O</hi> Lord, who by thy Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> didſt inſtitute among the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the Jubilee and year of Remiſſion: grant thro' thy Goodneſs, to us who have the honour to be called thy Servants, to commence, happily this preſent Jubilee, ordained by thy Authority; and in which it has been thy will to ſet open to thy People in a moſt ſolemn manner this Gate, thro' which to enter into thy Temple, to Offer their Prayers in the preſence of thy Divine Majeſty; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by having obtained plenary and abſolute Remiſſion of all our Sins, we may, at the day of our departure out of this World, be conducted through thy Mercy, to the enjoyment of the Heavenly Glory. Through Jeſus Chriſt. Amen.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This Prayer being ended, a Croſs is given into the Popes hand, who kneeling down in the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> Sings the <hi>Te Deum Laudamus, &amp;c.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, as he is entring thro' the Gate, the <hi>Chorus</hi> go on ſinging, <hi>Te Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum.</hi> He is no ſooner entred thro' the Gate into the Body of the Church, but the Chair-men Cloathed in Red, attending for that purpoſe, take him up in a Chair, and carry him ſtreight-ways to the Great Altar of the Church of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> where being ſet down, he ariſes out of the Chair, and after ſome time ſpent in Prayers before the Holy Sacrament, he mounts a Throne, erected on purpoſe for this uſe, and begins the Veſpers, which according to cuſtom are Sung for the Feaſt of the Nativity of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>On the ſame day, and at the ſame hour, His Holineſs deputes three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Legats, to go and open the other <hi>Holy Gates</hi> of the Churches, to wit: That of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that of St <hi>John de Lateran,</hi> and of St. <hi>Maria Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jori,</hi> which is performed with the ſame Ceremonies and Prayers as has been mentioned juſt now. This Choice falls commonly upon two Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and the Dean, who go from thence with a moſt Magnificent Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade, to perform this Function, which is like a Proclamation to all the Chriſtian World, That the Treaſure of the Church is ſet open, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes the true Catholicks from the <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Jews.</hi> It muſt be confeſs'd that the firſt Origin, as well as the true Creation which gave birth to this ſolemn Ceremony, is ſome what obſcure; but out of the Bull of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. which begins <hi>Inter Curas,</hi> &amp;c. it is evident, that the ſame has been practiſed for many Ages paſs'd in the Church, and which has been mentioned by St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in his Chronicle, as a very Antient Ceremony. Some derive this opening of the <hi>Holy Gate</hi> from a Cuſtom practiſed in the primitive Church, where thoſe who had incurred the Cenſure of the Church, by reaſon of ſome Enormous Crimes and Scandals, were enjoyned to perform certain publick Penances, and were excluded from the entrance of the Church on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> by ſhutting the doors upon them; but on the <hi>Holy-Thurſday,</hi> after a General Abſolution given to all the penitent Sinners there, by opening of the Gates, readmitted and received into the Boſom of the Church; if they had accompliſhed the enjoyned penance; if not, the door was ſhut againſt them again till the next following year, and ſometimes for their whole life-time, The Church Oyle therefore, having from Antient Times been the place aſſigned to thoſe who underwent the Church Penance during the time of the Chuch Office, this has introduced the Cuſtom of opening the <hi>Holy Gate</hi> at the beginning of the Jubilee.</p>
            <p>But there being four ſeveral Churches, which each have a <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> this has occaſioned ſome diſpute, which of them ought to have the precedency in the performance of this Ceremony. The Church of St. <hi>John de Leteran,</hi> is both the firſt in Rank, and enjoys ſome prerogatives before all the other Churches in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the Conſtitutions of Pope <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> XI. and Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. However when any of theſe Pontifical Functions, which have a more ſtrict Relation to the Popes Authority, Dignity and Majeſty, are to be performed with the utmoſt Splendor; ſuch as the Canonization of Saints, the Coronations and Benedictions of Kings, the Church of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> has always had the preference given her before all the reſt. And it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame ſcore, that this Church claims the preference in this moſt juſt, Ceremony, both as to the time and other Circumſtances; The <hi>Holy Gate</hi> of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church being the firſt that is opened by the Popes own hands. It has alſo been call'd in queſtion by ſome, whether any other Perſon beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the Pope himſelf has any Authority to open the <hi>Holy Gate;</hi> where it is to be obſerved, that in Caſe the Jubilee has already been publiſhed before by the deceaſed Pope, and the Cardinals are not entred into the Conclave in order to proceed to the Election of a new Pope, it belongs to the Cardinal <hi>d' Oſtia,</hi> Dean of the Church, to open the firſt <hi>Holy Gate</hi> in the Popes ſtead, as then their Cardinals repreſent the Popes Perſon when they open the <hi>Holy Gates</hi> of the other three Churches; The reaſon is, that, becauſe this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is not Eſſential, but only an accidental Part of the Jubilee, which might be Celebrated without it, the ſame is not thought fit to be omitted, for fear of giving ſcandal to ſome, who might perhaps look upon the Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee as imperfect without it. But many are of opinion, that if thee Jubilee be not promulgated before the Death of the Sovereign <hi>Pontife,</hi> the ſame cannot be publiſhed, and conſequently the <hi>Holy Gate</hi> is not to be opened; The Authority of giving plenary Indulgence to the whole Church, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the Pope and the General Councils. However, it is to be obſerved, that this Jubilee being eſtabliſhed every XXV Years, by many preceding Popes, eſpecially by <hi>Paul</hi> II. <hi>Sixtus</hi> IV. <hi>Alexander</hi> VI. <hi>Julius</hi> III. <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. and <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. this plenary Indulgence, I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo often publiſhed, confirmed, approved and renewed by their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, there is no queſtion, but that the Cardinals, in Caſe of a vacancy of the Chair may ſupply the Popes place, and conſequently alſo open the <hi>Holy Gate;</hi> and the Dean of the Church may ſend his circular Matters throughout Chriſtendom, to notify that the Jubilee, Eſtabliſhed and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Authority of ſo many preceding Popes, being near at hand, they ought to pepare themſelves to receive the Benefit of it, and to invite them to undertake this Holy Pilgrimage, this being not to be accounted a new grant of Indulgences, but only a publication of what was granted before by a Legal Authority. Thus Pope <hi>Julius</hi> III. in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; <hi>ſi Paſtores. &amp;c.</hi> declares, that without any further publication, the Jubilee begins with the Feaſt of the Nativity of Chriſt in the <hi>Holy Year:</hi> And, whereas his Exaltation to the Papal Dignity, did not happen till after <hi>Advent,</hi> in the Year 1549, when the <hi>Holy Year</hi> was actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, he publiſhed a Bull, dated the 23 day of <hi>February</hi> 1650, in the firſt year of his Pontificate, in which he declares, that the Jubilee had actually commenced with the next preceding Feaſt of the Nativity of our Saviour.</p>
            <p>But having entertained you ſufficiently with the <hi>Holy Gates,</hi> and the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies belonging to them, we muſt alſo take a ſhort view of thoſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which are performed in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> to obtain the happy end of the Jubilee. As thoſe who hope to reap the fruits of a plenary Indulgence, muſt qualify themſelves for it by many acts of Charity, a true penitence and other Good Works, ſo, I muſt needs tire the Readers Patience, if I ſhould pretend to give an exact account of thoſe who flock from all Parts to <hi>Rome,</hi> to make their Confeſſions, and appear before the higheſt Tribunal of Penitence; It will ſuffice to ſay, that both day and night all the Churches of that great City, are filled up with Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Multitude of People, who offer up their Prayers in the preſence of God Almighty. I may ſay it without Vanity, that there is no Street, no not as much as a By-Lane in this vaſt City, which being formerly the Capital Empire of the World, is now the Capital of Gods Kingdom up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, where you may not ſee moſt evident Marks of an unfeigned Piety; Here you meet thoſe, who make it their whole buſineſs to give Alms to the Poor, with ſo much Profeſſion, that you cannot imagine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, but that they are giving away all they have, the better to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſt; Others you may obſerve to beſtow moſt of their time and ſubſtance in giving a good reception to thoſe Pilgrims, who come from all the Corners of Chriſtendom, to partake of the happy Effects of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee. You will meet as well in the Streets as in the Churches vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Sexes, who touched with remorſe for their paſt Crimes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in miſerable Dreſs, and a moſt abjected Poſture; Some are clad in long courſe Gowns, others covered only with Sack-Cloth, ſome cover their Hands and Faces with Aſhes, others knock their Breaſts with their Fiſts; Many there are who tear the Fleſh all over their Bodies by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the Diſcipline; and to be ſhort, there is ſcarce any kind of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification invented to give Satisfaction to, and appeaſe Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which you ſee not put in Practice at that time. Neither muſt you Imagine, that thoſe Exerciſes are performed by private Perſons only; No, you will ſee whole Fraternities and Congregations, compoſed of a conſiderable Number, who all animated by the ſame Spirit, ſtrive to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite one another to the Performance of them, by their mutual Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Thus you may behold entire Chapters and Colleges of Canons, and other Societies, enter in proceſſion the City of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay whoſe Pariſhes, with their Curates at the Head of them, who leave their Habitations to pay their Adoration to the Lord and His Son Jeſus Chriſt in that Church, where, as it may be ſaid, God has erected his Tabernacle, and honoured it with his particular protection, and which claims a prerogative before others by the death of the Chief of the Apoſtles and his Fellow Sufferer. With this kind of People you ſee all the Streets and other publick Places of this vaſt City crowded, going in Proceſſion from one Church to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome ſinging, others fighting and ſhedding Tears. For whilſt ſome are buſie in ſinging the Litanies and Pſalms appointed for that purpoſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers offer their Prayers with their Eyes faſtned to the Ground, and when they Approach the Churches, eſpecially that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> you may ſee many of them crawling upon the Ground to the foot of the Altar, where they continue for a conſiderable time in ſaying their Prayers.</p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Devotions are practiſed at <hi>Rome</hi> throughout the courſe of the whole Jubilee; when a few days before <hi>Chriſtmas-Eve,</hi> (the laſt day of the <hi>Holy Year</hi>) Proclamation is made, that upon the next Eve of the Nativity of Chriſt, His Holineſs intends to ſhut up the <hi>Holy Gate</hi> of the Church of the <hi>Vatican;</hi> which day being come, a Proceſſion is made from the Apoſtolick Pallace, to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in the ſame manner, as has been mentioned before; and, after ſome time ſpent in Prayers before the Holy Sacrament, the Veſpers are Sung, and three Cardinals deputed to ſhut up the <hi>Holy Gates</hi> of the three other Churches. No ſooner have theſe three Prelates and their Company received the Benediction from His Holineſs, and are Marching in a moſt ſplendid Cavalcade to perform this Function, but the Pope and Cardinals, who aſſiſt at the Ceremony, being Preſented with lighted Wax Candles, they March in good Order, with the Croſs before them, towards the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> which is to be ſhut up; the Pope being carried after them in a Chair under a Canopy, and as they paſs by their Chappel where the Holy Sacrament of the Altar is depoſited, he offers up his Thanks to God for the happy Concluſion of the <hi>Holy Year;</hi> Which done, the Holy Pontife begins the <hi>Anthem, cum Jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate;</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Chorus</hi> is ſinging this <hi>Anthem</hi> or <hi>Pſalm, niſi Dominus ediſicaverit domum,</hi> the Proceſſion moves from and towards the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> where, after ſome Prayers, the Pope ſtanding under his Canopy, turns his face to the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> without his Mitre, and a Wax Candle in his Hand, and thus imparts his Benediction to the Materials, which are ready at hand to cloſe up the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> in the following Words:</p>

            <p>After which, the High Pontife, the Clergy, and all the reſt that aſſiſt at the Ceremony, come out through the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> juſt before it is going to be cloſed up; and the Holy Father beſprinckles the Materials with Holy Water and ſome Incenſe, and putting again his Mitre upon his Head, with Linnen Cloth round his middle, he gives thereby to underſtand, that he profeſſes himſelf to be the Servant of the true Servants of God, and, that after the Example of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is not exalted to the Papal Dignity, and put in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair to be ſerved, but to ſerve o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In this Poſture the Grand Penitentiary preſents to him a Silver Trowel guilt, wherewith he takes up three ſeveral times ſome Mortar out of a Basket carried by the Maſter of the Ceremonies, which Mortar he ſpreads and Plaiſters all along the lower part, upon the Threſhold of the <hi>Holy Gate;</hi> according to the Viſion of the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> which ſaw the Lord with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Trowel in his hands. The Threſhold being thus covered all over with the Mortar, the Pope throws upon it both to the right and the left, as well as in the middle, ſeveral Medals of Gold and Silver, repreſenting the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Jeruſalem,</hi> The Walls of which are deſcribed, Apocal, c. 21. to be built of Precious Stones. The Pope after this covers the Mortar and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals with three Square Stones, and whilſt he is buſie in performing this Function, ſays, with a low but intilligible Voice, theſe following words.</p>
            <q>

            </q>
            <p>In the Faith and by the Authority of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the only Son of the living God, who did ſay to the Chief of the Apoſtles, thou beeſt <hi>Peter,</hi> and up in this Rock I will found my Church, we lay this laſt Stone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cloſing of the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> which is not to be opened again till the next Jubilee. In the Name of God the Father, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After the Pope has faſtned theſe three Square Stones with Mortar, and the Maſter Maſon has drawn his Line, the Grand Penetentiary with a Trow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el in his hand, lays likewiſe a Stone upon thoſe laid before by the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſiſted by the other Penitentiaries there preſent, to convince the World that they are the Popes Co-adjutors, in the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Penitence. For each of them in his due order, lays hand to the Work, under the direction of his Holineſs, and raiſe the Wall, which is to cloſe up the <hi>Holy Gate,</hi> to a conſiderable height, whilſt the <hi>Chorus</hi> Sings the Hymn: <hi>Coeleſtis urbs Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> Which being ended, the Sovereign Pontife waſhes his hands, and ſays theſe following words.</p>
