            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Regard I have ever born in my Mind towards Men of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, in Times past born and bred among us, (especially when with their Qualities and Places they have been adorned with Learning, Wisdom or Integrity,) led me at my leisure-Hours to make cursory Collections out of my Books and Papers, of their Lives and Actions. And many such men there were in the Last Age, when Learning and
<pb facs="tcp:100352:4"/>
Religion after a long Eclipse, began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to enlighten our Horizon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some, however useful they were in their Times, and made a fair Figure to the World, are now in effect quite forgotten; and tho' the Names of others of that sort are better known, yet but slight and imperfect Characters remain of them. Whenas they were perhaps the great Pillars of the State or Church, and whose Counsils and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances the Prince made much use of in the weighty Transactions of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Of these I confess I cannot read or hear, but I am drawn with an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Humour to know more of them, as whence they sprang, their Country, their Parentage, their Education, their Tempers and Inclinations, and remarkable Actions, and what Events fell out to them, over and above what is commonly known or vulgarly told of them. And when by searching a little out of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Way as it were, (I mean in the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corners of old rejected Papers or Letters, and other Journals, Records, Registers, &amp;c.) I gain further Notice of these ancient Patriots, there is wont to arise thence a great Complacency to my mind. And the Thoughts that it may be as
<pb facs="tcp:100352:4"/>
delightful to others as to my self, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive the Memory of such, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as much of them as can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved, hath moved me to make publick some of my Collections of this nature. And moreover, I reckon it a Matter of Equity and Gratitude due from Posterity to preserved the Names and Remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all worthy men that have served God, their Prince, or Country by their Learning or other Abilities. And God himself seems to take care of this, when he saith, <hi>that the Memory of the Iust shall be Blessed,</hi> as their due Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>These, Sir, are some of the Reasons, why I have now brought that to pass, which I formerly made you privy to; namely, the Publishing what I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve of the Life of your most Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Accomplished Ancestor Sir <hi>THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS SMITH.</hi> He was a Person that lived in very Critical Times, occasioned by Court-Factions, and the frequent Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of Religion, and the various Dispositions and Interests of the Princes whom he served. So that he could hardly keep himself always up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his Legs: but by his great Wisdom and Moderation, tho' he sometimes fell, he
<pb facs="tcp:100352:5"/>
fell softly, and fell to rise again with more Glory. This may make his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story the more pleasant and useful: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially being mixed with many Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in his Time, wherein he bore a great Part, both in the University, in the Church, and in the Commonwealth. Where such things may be read, which perhaps are not to be met with elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Your said Ancestor, Sir, was the best Scholar in his Time, a most admirable Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher, Orator, Linguist, and Moralist. And from thence it came to pass, that he was also a very wise Statesman, and a Person withal of most unalterable. Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Justice, (which he made his <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks</hi> to comport with) and lastly, a con stant Embracer of the Reformed Religion, and therein made a Holy and good End. And therefore the <hi>English</hi> Soil which he so adorned, would be ingrateful, if she should let the Memory of such a man born in her, pass away, and lie for ever in obscurity. But as he was all this to the Publick, so, Sir, let me add, he is, and ever will be, an Ornament to your ancient House and Family, to your <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Mount.</hi> where the Noble Seat erected by him, will be his lasting Monument, and finally to the County of <hi>ESSEX,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100352:5"/>
where he was Born and Educated, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gladly retired, as often as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Business permitted him, and where he quietly resigned his last Breath to God.</p>
            <p>This Great man is the Subject of this Book: which therefore deserves to have been writ by an abler Pen. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to my self that I have omitted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remarkable Passages of his Life, which, could they have been retrieved, would have shewn him still more resplendent to the World. But it is impossible to recover all. What I have collected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in these Papers from various and sundry Books, and Original Writings, are sufficient to give a fair, tho' not a full Account of him. And that which I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue my present Undertaking for is, that I have done it impartially: For it is not of the nature of a Rhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orical Panegyric, wherein more Care is taken to Praise, than to speak Truth. To which last I have had a very tender Regard; being born out in every thing I have writ by the Authority of indubitable Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; that is, either of <hi>Smith</hi>'s own Letters, Books and Papers, or of others his Friends and Contemporaries.</p>
            <p>One thing more, Sir, seems requisite to have been done, to render this Work
<pb facs="tcp:100352:6"/>
more perfect, namely, together with this, to have published his Manuscript Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Discourses, which being the Fruits and Products of his Learned Brain, no question would have been very accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to all such as have a Value for him. Two of these, that is, His Dialogues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riage, and his Tables of the Valuation of Coins, I have now brought to Light. But alas! what Pity is it, that all the rest of his brave Philosophical, Astronomical, Moral, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Divine Thoughts, digested by him into divers Tracts, are now tis to be feared, (except his <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and his Books of <hi>Pronuntiation</hi>) utterly lost: together with all his other Papers, except some Letters of State, that lie in the Kings Paper-h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>use, and those rough Writings, Sir, in your Hands, and a few others else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But where are now his University Exercises, his Learned Readings, his Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Orations, exhortatory of Vertue, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and found Knowledge, his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondences with the best Wits of his Age, and many Elucubrations upon ingenious Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s, which his busie Head was always employed in? I am affraid I must say, they are perisht irrecoverably.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100352:6"/>So that this poor Book of mine must serve for the chiefest Remains of our States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And, Sir, my Pains therein I hope, will be taken in good Part by you and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, excusing candidly my Imperfections: As particularly my Style; which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e to some may appear more loose and neglected; and not so smooth, nor set off with Words, as might be expected in Books appearing abroad now a days. But my chief Aim is to speak Truth, and to make my self understood of him that reads me. Nor do I care, this being secured, to be too curious in my Expressions. And perhaps my Converse with a Language and the Writings of an Age or two past may render my Periods more rough and unpolished. But this I suppose will hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely be forgiven me.</p>
            <p>Nor would I have it disgust you, Sir, that in the Current of the History you are sparingly entertained with some Latin Poetry, or other Allegations out of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; so long as they are Historical and directly tend to illustrate the Story, and the Man I am writing of: and not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly used for Flourish and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:100352:7"/>
concerning the Life of Archbishop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>; blaming the Author for crouding so much his other Learning into the Body of the History, (he means Citations out of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets and other <hi>Classics</hi>) <hi>which,</hi> as he saith, <hi>instead of entertaining his Readers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his good Design, was apt to amuse and distract them.</hi> The Rule he drives at for an Historiographer to observe is good.

               </gap>it of the History, and not surely (to speak so much in that Writers behalf) intended as a mere Embellishment. And if this be a Fault, I may in this Piece be guilty of
<pb facs="tcp:100352:7"/>
some such Blemish: which I reckon in Truth none at all.</p>
            <p>You may possibly, Sir, here and there in the Book meet with some Passages con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> seeming too minute and jejune to be taken notice of, and of little Moment. But herein I entreat you, Sir, to bear with me, as you would do with an Admirer of some Piece of Antiquity, who is want diligently to pick up and preserve even the contemptible Stones and Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he finds in the Ruines of it. But besides, upon a little Circumstance we know many times depend great Matters; and a Hint may open a Door into some material Points of History. And in a word, what one Reader may run over, as not worth regarding, another may perceive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or Profit therein. Which were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations that swayed me not to reject or cast aside even the slighter Matters that may be found in this History.</p>
            <p>You are, Sir, the properest Person to whom this Book should be Dedicated: Not only in that you have so freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to me divers of Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Papers remaining in your Custody; and that you are his next Relation in a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Line, and to you is descended his beloved Manor of <hi>Mounthaw,</hi> or <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hault,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:100352:8"/>
and that eligant Fabrick of his rearing there; but chiefly, because you do so truly resemble his Vertues, in being so useful a Magistrate, a Gentleman of so sober and regular a Conversation in this loose and debauched Age, and so constant an Adherer to the Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which your Predecessor had a great hand in the Reformation of, and in which he so sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly persevered.</p>
            <p>Pardon therefore, Sir, this that I have done, to prefix Sir <hi>EDWARD SMITH</hi>'s Name to Sir <hi>Thomas SMITH</hi>'s Life, and this long Address I have made to you on the same Account: Wishing withal my Heart the Continuance of your Worthy Name and Family, for many suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Generations in the hopeful Issue God hath given you, to be a Blessing to <hi>Essex,</hi> and to the whole <hi>English</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

By which Computation he must have come into the World in the Year 1512. (a Year famous to <hi>England</hi> for building of a Ship, the biggest that ever the Sea bore.) And by the Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on his Monument it appears, he departed this Life in the 65th Year of his Age. So that <hi>Cambden</hi> made him Two Years younger than he was, and <hi>Fox</hi> Five; unless we should say the Figure 33 is mis-printed for 39, a Fault too common in his Books.</p>

For <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> they had not yet seen, who had in a Book found fault with the common reading of the Greek. But tho' both saw these palpable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, they could not agree among themselves;

                  </note>When this new Utterance of Greek was sufficiently conquered and inured to them by private use, and did daily more and more please them, by reason of that Fulness and Sweetness that they apprehended in it, they thought good then to make Trial of it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. It was agreed that <hi>Smith</hi> should begin. He read at that time <hi>Aristotle de Republica,</hi> in Greek, as he had done some Years before. And that the Roughness of a new Pronunciation might give the less Offence, he used some Craft, which was this, That in his Reading he would let fall a Word only now and then uttered in the new correct Sound. Which he did for this end, That if his Auditors utterly refused his Words thus pronounced, then he reckoned he ought to defer his purpose for some longer time; and accordingly so he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do: But if they received them with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100352:21"/>
a good Will, then he would the more spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily go on with his Innovation. But behold the Issue! At first no Notice was taken of it; but when he did it oftner, they began to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, and listen more attentively.

                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> as E and OI, they who three Years before had heard him sound them frequently uncorrectly after the old way, could not think it was a Lapse of his Tongue, but suspected something else, and laughed at the unusual Sounds. He again, as though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his Tongue had slipp'd, would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times correct himself, and say the Word o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again after the old manner. But when he did this daily, and, as appeared, every day, the corrected Sounds flowed from him more and more, some of his Friends came to him, and told him what they noted in his Lectures. <hi>Smith</hi> now cared not to dissemble, but owned that he had been thinking of something pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, but that it was not yet enough dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted and prepared for the Publick. They, on the other hand, prayed him not to conceal it from them, but to tell them without any grudging. Whereupon he promised he would. Upon this Rumor many came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and repaired to him; whom he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only to hear his Reasons, and to have Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience with him three or four Days at most, until the Sounds, by Use, were made more trite to their Ears, and the Prejudice of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty more worn off. And so by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he explained to them the whole Reason of the Sounds. Many went to <hi>Cheke,</hi> and related
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100352:22"/>
to him <hi>Smith</hi>'s Discourses; and others resort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to others, according as they esteemed them to be Men of Judgment in this matter. These thought some one thing, some another; <hi>Cheke</hi> assented.</p>

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Greek: For that, he being a Stranger, and not well skilled either in the French Tongue, or the Customs, might expose himself to Envy; which is wont to accompany all them that profess something different from the rest. The Professor asked what that was. <hi>Smith</hi> answered, His Pronounciation; which, he said,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100352:25"/>
was almost quite different from theirs, which he heard there, especially in some Letters and Diphthongs; to which, as he added, he had so accustomed himself, that he could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily leave it, if he would; nor indeed would he, if he could; so far near did it come to Truth, and the Use of the Ancients, and the Nature of Sounds; and now that he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to it, it seemed more pleasant and easie. I understand, answered <hi>Strazelius,</hi> what you say to be that Pronunciation that <hi>Erasmus</hi> pursued in a little Comment of his. That very Pronunciation, replied <hi>Smith.</hi> For it is most evident that this Pronunciation of yours is corrupt; and it is very easily proved, that the Ancients spoke otherwise, and made a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference where now none at all appears. Then for Proof he produced that concerning <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> resembling the bellowing of an Ox; and <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, out of <hi>Suidas,</hi> representing the bleating of a Sheep: Which would not inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate either, if the former Word were read <hi>Aminia,</hi> and the latter <hi>Bibi,</hi> according to that present vulgar Pronouncing. And several other Authorities did <hi>Smith</hi> give, from whence he gathered, that the Sounds of the common Readers of Greek were not the same which the Ancients in <hi>Greece</hi> used. It is certain, said <hi>Strazelius,</hi> there be many Reasons and Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in favour of what you urge, and that place out of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> is clear. Yet they that hold the contrary Opinion are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether destitute of Conjectures too. For my part, added the Professor, I am contented
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100352:25"/>
with the present Sound such as it is. I have had no mind to strive about any new Matter. And if you should attempt any such thing, I know not how they that shall hear you, would take it, having been always brought up in another way of Pronunciation. And to speak freely (as he went on) these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests about the Sounds of Words are Pedantic, and more sitting for School-masters: We promise our selves, some greater things from you, whom we have heard to be well Versed in all kind of Philosophy. Nor would I have you in so slight a matter provoke them here, that of themselves are too apt to envy the Praises of others. <hi>Smith</hi> acknowledged he counselled him well, and like a Friend, and added, that he would wait till his Money came; and if it chanced, that he stayed any considerable time, seeing he was not bound to Read there, he would sometimes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had leisure, consider upon these things.</p>

                  </note> That <hi>Smith</hi> wrote a Tract concerning correct Writing of English, and the true sounding of the Letters and Words. That which he found fault with in our Language was that ill and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100352:28"/>
writing of it. As for instance in these Words, <hi>Please, Sonne, Moone, Hemme, Cleane, To, Toe, Meane.</hi> In which Words, he said, those Sounds are not comprehended which we express: And in some of them the Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables are stuffed with needless Letters. Which Letters by themselves have their certain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as he observed, and that being joyned after that manner, have not that Force which they ought to have. And again, in other Words, he took notice we had no Letter which express that which we spake, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it necessary to have more Letters. So he framed Twenty nine Letters: Whereof Nineteen were Roman, Four Greek, and Six English or Saxon. The Five Vowels he augmented into Ten, distinguishing them into Long and Short, making certain Accents over, or on the side of them, that were to be pronounced Long. It is worth seeing <hi>Smith</hi>'s new Alphabet, wherein might be observed that he allowed no Diphthongs, nor double Consonants, nor any <hi>E</hi>'s at the end of Words, being not sounded. He had a good mind to throw out utterly, and banish from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabeth the Letter Q. as useless, Ku expressing the full power of Qu, for without the Vowel U, the Letter Q is never written. And the same uselesness he found to be in the Letter C. for it is ever expressed either by K or by S. But he retained it in his Alphabeth to serve instead of Ch. This Alphabeth may be found in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>

                  </note> For tho' for four Years, <hi>Smith</hi>'s new way of reading <hi>Greek</hi> was quietly and gladly received, yet afterwards by the means of some turbulent Men, it received great Opposition.

                  </note> and against <hi>Cheke,</hi> who was now by the King his Master appointed his Reader of Greek. For to fetch the Matter a little backward, about the Year 1539. near the Time of <hi>Smith</hi>'s departure to travel, the King's Greek Lecture was committed to <hi>Cheke,</hi> He, in the beginning of his Lecture, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prepare the Minds of his Auditors to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive true benefit by his Readings, declaimed for six Days together concerning the more correct sound of Letters. But on a sudden,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100352:29"/>
one <hi>Ratecliff,</hi> a Scholar in the University, stood up and declared that he would oppose him; being instigated by such, as had no more Wit than himself. <hi>Cheke</hi> had no need to fear him, whom all knew understood little Greek, and whom none thought a Man sit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, or dealt with as a considerable Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. Yet some were for hearing him, to make Sport. The Magistrate, to whom the Scurrility of the Man well known, thought he ought in time to be restrained. Nethertheless he went up to read somewhat, and having spoke a little, he was so laugh'd at by the Boys, so exploded and hissed, and so tossed in the Crowd which came together in a great Assembly to laugh rather than to hear, that his own Friends were ashamed of him; and he himself repented him of his Folly;<note place="margin">

But, saith <hi>Smith,</hi> his Lordship had never done this, had they, who named him to the Bishop, declared what kind of Man he was, of what Wit, of what Nature, of what Prudence, Gravity, Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty and Learning; that is to say, none at all. After this Fellow was gone, there was Peace, Quiet and Silence concerning these Matters, and in great fervor and industry the Youth

of <hi>Cambridge</hi> Learned Greek, until the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Decree, which we shall hear of by and by.</p>
               <p>But all the blame of this new Pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lay upon <hi>Cheke.</hi>

                  </note> He was the Man now cried out against as arrogant, proud and daring, and guilty of high Crimes: And the Chancellor rebuked him. And all the Storm that light upon <hi>Smith</hi> all this while was, that he was accused to have been an Abetter, and one that approved of <hi>Cheke</hi>'s Doings. But <hi>Smith</hi> was not afraid of all this Noise, and generously took the thing upon himself, that he might take off some of the <hi>Odium</hi> from his Friend <hi>Cheke.</hi>
And so he freely told the Chancellor, <q>I was his Fellow and Partaker in this Matter;<note place="margin">

<q>That he knew, <hi>Balbutire, modo idem siquando usus sit expeditè loquatur, etiam laudi dandum est,</hi> that is, That even Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering deserved Praise, if so be he that did so, when need was, would speak smoothly: According to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,

                  </note> For when he came home, (which was about the Month of <hi>Iuly</hi>) he recollected his Discourse with the Bishop, and the Bishops with him; and in a large eloquent Epistle, privately sent to him, argued with much freedom the Points in Controversy between them. Which Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, (full of Excellent Learning) consisted of three parts. In the first, he shewed what was to be called true and right in the whole Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Sounds and Pronunciation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved this from the common and present Use, and out of the hands both of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and Learned that lived at that time, and placed it with the Ancients; restoring to them their Right and Authority, propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as the best and only Pattern in the whole Case of the Greek Tongue to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by all Posterity. In the second, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the old and the new Pronunciation with that Pattern, that the Chancellor might see whether of the two came nearer thereunto, or strayed farthest from it. That so by this, Judgment might appear, what was to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and what followed. In the third Part, he explained by the Story of the past time the whole Account of his Doing in this Affair, that his Lordship might understand, that if there were nothing therein worthy to be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100352:31"/>
commended, nothing at least deserved to be reproved.

His other House was in <hi>Philpot-lane London,</hi> where his younger Brother a Merchant lived. It was a large and fair House.

Which was the Cause of a large Letter, which he address'd unto her: Wherein he vindicated himself, against many Slanders which were told the Dutchess; whereof she had twitted him in the Teeth, as Things the World took notice of in him: Namely, <hi>I.</hi> Haughtiness, and a disregardful, proud Temper. <hi>II.</hi> That he was Oppressive; and had, by Extortion and Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, got a great deal of Money. <hi>III.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness. <hi>IV.</hi> That he bought and sold Benefices, or Spiritual Promotions. Add to these, That he was a Chopper and Changer of Lands: That his Wife went not in so Courtly a Garb as was sitting: That he kept no House: And; That he was a Neuter in Religion. But these were mere Aspersions, and malicious Insinuations; his generous Mind ever abhorring any thing that was base and unjust, or unworthy of a Man, and a Christian Philosopher. And these Calumnies he wiped off, assoiling one Particular after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in his said Letter to the Dutchess. Indeed, she was an Imperious and Ill-natur'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100352:36"/>
Woman, and had taken some Occasion to fall out with him; and in her Passion, it seems, had cast out these Reports before him.</p>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100352:36"/>
for <hi>Scotland.</hi> Then <hi>Smith</hi> obtained so much from the Emperors Counsellors of the said <hi>Low-Countries</hi>: Tho' the Promise was not so well made good; for, in the latter end of this same Year, both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> came from <hi>Scotland,</hi> and were landed and discharged at <hi>Dunkirke.</hi> Which caused another Embassy in <hi>Ianuary,</hi> by Sir <hi>Philip Hoby,</hi> from the <hi>English</hi> Court, to the Emperor, complaining of this; and shewing how the Emperor's Counsellors in the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> had declared to Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Smith,</hi> at the Court there, That the <hi>French</hi>'s going into <hi>Scotland,</hi> or returning thence, should have no manner of Favour or Reception at any of the Emperor's Ports. This was one of the Business of this Embassy; but the chief Matter indeed, and End thereof, was, for the Raising of Soldiers in those Parts; which they did, to the Number of 2000; and obtained the Emperor's Leave for Passing of them. There is a Letter of <hi>Smith</hi>'s, remaining in the <hi>Cotton</hi>-Library, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, while he was now Ambassador at <hi>Brussels</hi>; wherein may be perceived the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his Embassy,<note place="margin">Galba, <hi>B.</hi> 12.</note> with other News of the Affairs of the World; and was an ensueth: (And I the rather set it down, to preserve what Monuments we can of this excellent Man.)</p>

Examination of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> that began now to spring up apace and shew themselves more openly.

                  <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:100352:39"/>
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> for certain Incompliances, and Disobediences to the King's proceedings in Religion. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was Able and Bold, and one that sincerely wished well to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of corrupt Religion. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner of all the rest,<note place="margin">Boner <hi>would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Boner</hi> seemed most to regret, and set himself in opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. His first Quarrel against him was, that because he sat not at the beginning, when the Commission was first opened and read, therefore he ought not to be a Commissioner at all. For by the Law, said <hi>Boner,</hi> they that first began, must comtinue the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But <hi>Smith</hi> told him, that as cunning as he made himself in the Law, for his part he had studied the Law too; anf that these were but Quiddities, and Quirks invented to delay Matters. But the Commission was to procede summarily, <hi>Et de plano,</hi> and to cut off all frivolous Allegations. And when at this same Session, the Bishop demanded some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the Commissioners upon pretence of Law, that was not convenient to be granted; Secretary <hi>Smith,</hi> seeing that his Device was meerly to deferr and elude the main Business told him plainly, he asked he knew not what; and that the Bishop would have had them to humour him, and to be lead according to his mind in these Quiddities; whereas all was for no other intent but to delay Justice. And that herein he did all one with Thieves, Murtherers and Traitors, that the Truth might not be known, to prevent their Shame and Condemnation. Which plain dealing did
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100352:39"/>
more and more provoke that proud Bishop. And those Expressions of the Secretary he could never forgive, but was continually pelting at him, and declining him as none of his Judge.</p>
               <p>The great intent of this Commission was to examine him concerning a Sermon,<note place="margin">Smith <hi>deals roundly with him.</hi>
                  </note> which was appointed him by the Council to Preach touching the King's Authority in his tender Age to Administer the Government, and make Laws. In which the Bishop prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, not speaking home to that necessary Point to the satisfaction of the People; but running out upon the Subject of the <hi>Real Prefence.</hi> Concerning which, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners could not bring him to confess whether in that Sermon he omitted that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or no, shifting it off by his uncertain Speeches, other Articles were drawn up for him to answer to by Oath: Which <hi>Smith</hi> told him he must not dally with as he had done hitherto. And that tho' he had made his Answers by writing after his wary and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure way, yet now he should be examined by them, and make answer by Mouth to the same Article, or do that which was worse, namely, go to the Tower. I do not indeed, added he, discommend your Protestations and Terms of Law, if it were in a young Proctor, in the managing of his Clients Cause; but in you it may not be suffered so to use the King's Commissioners.</p>
               <p>When the Bishop was next to appear before the Commissioners,<note place="margin">Smith's <hi>Words to</hi> Boner's <hi>Servant.</hi>
                  </note> he sent two of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100352:40"/>
to excuse his not coming before them by reason of Sickness. But the Secretary knowing well of his former ways of Delay and Baffling the Commissioners, doubted of the Truth hereof: And therefore told the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers roundly, that because he should not deceive them as he had done, they would send the Knight-Marshal unto him, who should have Order, if he were Sick indeed to let him alone, for that he said, was a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Excuse; but if he were not Sick, to bring him forthwith; for that he should not do as he had done; nor would they take it at his Hands. Mr. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> added the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, (he was one of the Bishop's Servants that brought his Message) you do the part of a trusty Servant as becomes you; but it is your part also to shew my Lord of his Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Heart and Disobedience, which doth him more harm than he is aware of. What? Doth he think to stand with the King in his own Realms? Is this the part of a Subject? Nay, I ween, we shall have a new <hi>Thomas Becket.</hi> Let him take heed, for if he play these parts, he may fortune to he made shorter by the Head. And, whereas the Bishop was all for disowning these Commissioners, and appealing from him, the Secretary subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he may Appeal if he think good. But whither? To the Bishop of <hi>Rome?</hi> So he may help himself forwards. I say, he can appeal but to the same King, who hath made us his Judges, and to the Bench of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. And how they will take this Matter,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100352:40"/>
when they hear of it, I doubt not. He would make Men believe that he were called before us for Preaching his Opinion of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherein I assure you he did but false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and naughtily, yea, and leudly, and more than became him, and more than he had in Commandment to do. For he was not willed to speak of that Matter, and perhaps he may hear more of that hereafter: But at present that was not laid to his Charge.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thus using to deal with him,<note place="margin">Boner <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> Smith.</note> in many Sessions held for his Examination, and not suffering him to dally out the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and sometime taking the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him, the Bishop at last made a solemn, large and formal Recusation of this Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners Judgment; Exhibiting it in Writing at his next appearance; which may be read at length in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>'s Acts and Monuments. In which Recusation, <hi>Boner</hi> shewed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag. 1205.</hi>
                  </note> how the Secretary had charged him with dealing with the Commissioners as Thieves, Murtherers and Traitors would have done. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this Recusation, the Secretary told him that he would proceed in his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and would be his Judge still, until he were otherwise inhibited.
<q>And where you say, proceeded <hi>Smith,</hi> in your Recusation, that I said you did like Thieves, Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Traitors; indeed I said it, and may well say so again, since we perceive it by your Doings. Whereto the Bishop in a great Rage replied, Well, Sir, because you sit here by Vertue of the King's Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100352:41"/>
and for that you be Secretary to his Majesty, and also one of his Highness Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, I must, and do Honour and Reverence you, but as you be Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> and say as you have said, I do like Thieves, Murtherers and Traitors, I say you lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; and in that Case I defy you in what you can do to me; I fear you not. And therefore, <hi>Quod facis, fae citius.</hi>
                  </q> The Secretary told him, <hi>He should know there was a King. Yea,</hi> said the Bishop, <hi>and that is not you. No, Sir,</hi> said the Secretary again, <hi>but we will make you know who is.</hi> And so in fine, for carrying himself so irreverently towards the King's Commissioners, and especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> the King's Secretary, the Knight-Marshal was called in, and the Bishop committed to him. And the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary commanded him to take and keep him that none might come at him. For if he did, he should set by him himself.</p>

                  </note> Secretary <hi>Smith</hi> did burthen him, how disobediently and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously he had always carried himself towards the King's Majesty and his Authority. To which the Bishop replied, <hi>That he was the King's lawful and true Subject, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his Highness to be his Gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Lord.</hi>
                  <hi rend="margQuotes">Yea, <hi>answered the Secretary,</hi> you say well, my Lord; but I pray you, what else have all these Rebels in <hi>Norfolk, Devon</hi> and <hi>Cornwal</hi> done?

Laws,</hi> and the like. And yet, when either Commandment, Letter or Pardon was brought to them from his Majesty, they believed it not, but said it was forged under an Hedge, and was Gentlemens Doings. <hi>I perceive your meaning,</hi> said the Bishop again, <hi>as who should say, the Bishop of</hi> London <hi>is a Rebel like them.

                  </note> the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector received a terrible Shock; almost all the Privy Counsellors making a Defection from the Court, and meeting in <hi>London,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together against him. So that he at last was Imprisoned, and lost all his Places, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Lands. There were only Three then stuck to him in this Time of Adversing, <hi>viz.

For the Lords wrote to them, that it seemed strange to them, that they should either assist, or suffer his Majesty's Royal Person to remain in the Guard of the Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi>'s Men, and that Strangers should be armed with the King's own Armour, and be nearest about his Person; and those to whom the ordinary Charge was committed to be sequestred away. And the Lords sent them word moreover,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100352:42"/>
that if any Evil came thereof, they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it must be imputed to them. And whereas the Archbishop, <hi>Paget,</hi> and <hi>Smith</hi> in their Letter to the Lords told them, <hi>They knew more than they</hi> [the Lords] <hi>knew,</hi> at those Words thay took this advantage, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them Answer,
<hi rend="margQuotes">That if the Matters that came to their knowledge, and were hidden from them [<hi>the Lords</hi>] were of such weight as they pretended, or if they touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or might touch his Majesty, or his State, they [<hi>the Lords</hi>] thought that they did not as they ought to do, in not disclosing the same to them, [<hi>the whole Council.</hi>]</hi> In fine, being over-powered, <hi>Smith,</hi> together with the Archbishop, and the Comptroller <hi>Paget</hi> sent another Letter from <hi>Windsor,</hi> (where the King and they were) that they would not fail to endeavour themselves according to the Contents of the Lord's Letters; and that they would convene together when and where the Lords pleased. this was a notable instance of <hi>Smith</hi>'s Fidelity to the Duke his old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; who stuck to him as long as he durst, and was then glad to comply as fairly as he could. And, if I mistake not, now did some storm fall upon Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>: And I believe he was deprived of his Place of secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.

That <hi>Smith</hi> and the said <hi>Cecil,</hi> by Command of the said Council drew up certain Articles, to which the Bishop should shew his Consent, and to Preach and set forth the same. And that after several At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendances upon the Bishop to bring him to this, and upon some hope of Conformity thereto, the Lords of the Council sent for him to the Palace at <hi>Westminster.</hi> After that, was the Lord <hi>Wiltshire</hi> sent to him, to whom he shewed some Conformity herein. Soon after that Lord went again accompanied with <hi>Smith,</hi> to know his final Resolution.

               <p>SIR <hi>Thomas</hi> past the Reign of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>He loses all his Places.</hi>
                  </note> in great Reputation and Prosperity. But upon the Access of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to the Crown, as many of the deceased King's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of State, especially such as favoured Religion, were cast off, so were the two Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Smith.</hi> And besides the loss of that honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Station, he was deprived also of what he held in the Church. For he was a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Person also; and so was invested by the late King with the Provostship of <hi>Eton,</hi> and the Deanry of <hi>Carlisle.</hi> And to spoil him of these and other places with the more Formality, he was summoned to appear before certain Persons, whom the Queen had Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated for these purposes, together with <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Dr. <hi>May,</hi> Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s. He fell easy, for his Life was saved, tho' he were a Protestant, and had an 100 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> allowe him, for his Subsistence; but was charged not to depart out of the Realm. Which favourable hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling no doubt was obtained for him by some great Friends ai this Court: A sign of the great esteem they had of his worth. Such
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100352:44"/>
was his good Fortune in those hard times, when so many of his Friends, and the fast Professors of Religion suffered most sharply. Dr. <hi>Henry Cole,</hi> (afterwards Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s) succeeded him in the Provostship of <hi>Eton:</hi> And Dr. <hi>Iohn Boxal</hi> in the place of Secretary of State: As Sir <hi>Iohn Bourn</hi> succeeded <hi>Cecil</hi> the other Secretary. And so he made a shift to pass through this dangerous Reign in safety, following hls Studies and Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his native Country of <hi>Essex,</hi> at his House of <hi>Hill-hall</hi> there. And when many on all hands of him were most cruelly burnt alive for the Profession of that Religion which he held, he escaped, and was saved even in the midst of the Fire. Which probably he might have an eye to in changing the Crest of his Coat of Arms, which now was a sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander living in the midst of a Flame; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before it was an Eagle, holding a Writing Pen, flaming in his Dexter Claw, as may still be seen upon a Monument of his Ancestors in <hi>Walden</hi> Church, and likewise in another Monument in the Church of <hi>Greensted</hi> in <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi> set up to the Memory of his Sister, who Married <hi>Wood</hi> of <hi>Brodlane</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi>

                  </note> he acted his part so dextrously in these difficult Times, that even his Enemy the Pope sheltered him under his Bull for many Transgressions of his own Laws. For in the Year 1555. one <hi>William Smythwick,</hi> of the Diocess of <hi>Bath,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Esq</abbr> had obtained a very large Indulgence from <hi>Rome.</hi> For which, no question, the said Gentleman
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100352:44"/>
was very liberal, which caused that Court to shew her self so liberal again. It was, that he and any five of his Friends whom he should nominate, (excepting Regulars) such as were Married, and their Children of both Sexes, should enjoy many extraordinary Indulgences upon his Petition to the Pope, who then was <hi>Paul</hi> IV. Which Petition was graciously accorded to by that Pope, and the Bull ran for Indulgence to <hi>Smythwick,</hi> and his five Friends and their Children (as was petitioned) <hi>à Quibusvis Excommunicationis, Supensionis &amp; Interdicti, aliis<expan>

<hi>Cambridge,</hi> he waited upon him at <hi>Hampton</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Court about the Difference, as it seemed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the right pronouncing of the Greek. When <hi>Tho.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100352:46"/>
new correct way; Yet <hi>Smith</hi> carried himself with so much facility and obsequiousness to him in that regard, that it took much with him. And upon his Return back to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> tho' he took the freedom to write a large Letter to the said Chancellor, arguing against the Decree he had lately made, to forbid the new way, and to continue the old, yet it was with extraordinary Complement to him of his high Worth, Learning, Prudence and Acuteness: Beginning his Letter after this obliging manner:</p>

               <p> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his Letter with a Protestation of intire Obedience to his Lordship's Order, however he should determine for or against his Desire; and that he would submit to his Authority,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100352:46"/>
being the Authority of a Reverend Prelate, and a very Learned Chancellor. From hence I date the Respect and Love <hi>Smith</hi> gained with this Bishop.</p>
               <p>This must be Remembered to this Bishops Commendation, among the many evil Things that asperse and blacken his Name to this Day.<note place="margin">Ascham <hi>favoured by</hi> Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</note> Nor must the like favour or a greater be forgotten by him shewn to such another Learned and grave Protestant, Friend and Contemporary with <hi>Smith,</hi> I mean <hi>Roger As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cham</hi>; which I must have leave to mention here. Whom the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> did not only spare, but called to Court, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be Secretary of the Latin Tongue to Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> Whom for his Learning in the Languages, and incomparable faculty of a clean Stile, and beautififul Writing, he greatly loved, and obliged with many Benefits. And when Sir <hi>Francis Englefield,</hi> Master of the Wards and Liveries, a fierce Papist, had often cried out upon <hi>Ascham,</hi> to the Bishop as an Heretick, and sit to be rejected and punished as such, he never would hearken to him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to punish him or remove him from his Place.

Namely, <hi>Robert Smith,</hi> who was burnt at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> in the Year 1555. This <hi>Robert</hi> belonged to the Church of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi> and had a Clerkship there of 10 <hi>l.</hi> a Year. Of Stature he was tall and slender, active and very ingenious for many Things, chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in the Art of Painting, which for his Minds-sake rather than for a Living or Gain he practised and exercised. He was smart and quick in Conversation, and fervent in Religion, wherein he was confirmed by the Preachings and Readings of Mr. <hi>Turner,</hi> Canon of <hi>Windsor</hi> and others. In his Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations before Bishop <hi>Boner</hi> he spake readily and to the purpose, and with no less Boldness, and gave that Prelate his own. He was also a good Poet according to the Poetry of those Times: Some Pieces whereof remain in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Monuments.
And his Parts, and Elegancy of Stile as well as his Piety Godward, may be judged of by his Sententious Letter to his Wife from Prison a little before his Death: Which may be seen in <hi>Fox,</hi>

                  </q> It was remarkable at his Death, that his Body well night half burnt, and all in a lump like a black Cole, he suddenly rose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and lifted up the stumps of his Arms, and clapped the same together, and so sunk down again and Died. And this was the more to be remarked, because he had at the Stake said to those that stood about him, that they should not think amiss of him or his Cause, tho' he came to that End; and that they would not doubt, but his Body, tho' so to be consumed presently to Ashes, yet Dying in that Quarrel, should rise again to Life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, and added, that he doubted not God would shew some Token thereof.</p>

For all those wily Titles, our Hearts, our Joy, our Comfort was gone. As much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate as you note me to be to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Countrymen, I assure you I was then ashamed of both.—What decay came that Time to the substance of the Realm, and Riches both publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, it should be no less Pity than needless to tell.</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:100352:48"/>I am sorry I can retrieve so little of this worthy Man, during these five Years of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which he spent in Leisure and Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.<note place="margin">Smith's <hi>wife Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Counlsse.</hi>
                  </note> However, I have retrieved a Paper wrote by him in the Year 1557. that deserves here to be set down, Intitled,</p>
               <div type="paper">
                  <head>Advertisements and Counsels very necessary for all Noblemen and Counsellors, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of divers Authors both <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Spanish.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p n="1">1. TEll not all that you think, nor shew all that you have, nor take all that you desire, nor say all that you know, nor do all that you can. For lightly shall he lose the Favour of his Prince that followeth the Commandment of his Lusts, and restraineth not them with the Bit of Reason.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beware you put not Fortune in trust with those Things that appertain to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Honour, Substance or Conscience. For the Nobleman which is wise will not hazard himself, in hope to have relief at her hands as often as he shall need.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Altho' all Men promise to help you if you had need, yet nevertheless trust not too much thereto. Many of them which now do offer to take Armour for your sake, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion be offered will be the first to strike you, to give you the Overthrow.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In other Mens Cases meddle not too much; nor in your own enforce not Time,
For governing you so, you may remain in the good Estate you be, or else may easily happen to utter what you were.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100352:49"/>5. The Danger of Noblemen is like to them that be in the top of high and sharp Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, whence they cannot descend but fall, Wherefore procure unto your selves such faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends, as will rather stay you from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, than such as will reach unto you their hands to help you up, when you be down.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Do good while you have power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and never do hurt tho' you may. For the Tears of the Offended, and the Complaints of the Grieved may one Day have place in the sight of God, to move him to Chastise you, and also be occasion to make the Prince to hate you.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Bestow your Benefits and Offices rather upon the Good, than upon your Friends. For among your Friends it is lawful to depart your Goods but not your Conscience.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In that you Counsel be not affectionate, in that you Discounsel be not passionate. Whatsoever you do, do advisedly. For altho' in the Courts of Princes, every Man behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Worthiness and Nobility of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; Yet the more noble a Man is, the more is he noted, marked amd hated of others.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If you will not err in your Counsels, nor stumble in your Actions, embrace them that tell you Truth, and hate them that flatter you. For much more ought you to love them that advise you, than those that will seem to pity you, when you are in Danger.</p>
                  <p n="10">
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:100352:49"/>10. Have always in memory the Benefits you have received of others, and enforce your selves to forget such Injuries as others have done unto you.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Esteem much that Little of your own, and regard not the Abundance of others.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Endeavour your self to do good to all Men, and never speak evil of them that be absent.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Jeopard not the Loss of many things for the Gain of one thing; neither adventure the Loss of one thing certain for many things doubtful.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Make much of your dearest Friends; and do not procure any Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Exalt not the rich Tyrant, neither ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the Poor which is rightous. <hi>This hath a Line drawn through it by the Pen of Sir</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Smith <hi>Thimself as it seems, fearing perhaps some misconstruction of his Words, which might draw him into danger under this jealous Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Queen</hi> Mary.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Deny not Justice unto the Poor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is poor, neither pardon the Rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is rich.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Do not good only for Love, neither chastise only for Hatred.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. In evident Cases abide not the Counsel of others; and indoubtful Cases determine not of your self.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Suffer not Sin unpunished, nor well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing without Reward.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Deny not Justice to him that asketh, nor Mercy to him that deserveth it.</p>

                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:100352:50"/>21. Chastise not when thou art Angry, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promise any thing in thy Mirth.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Do evil to no Man for malice, neither commit any Vice for Covetousness.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Open not thy Gate to Flatterers, nor thy Ears to Backbiters.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. Become not proud in thy Prosperity, nor desperate in thine Adversity.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Study always to be loved of good Men, and seek not to be hated of the Evil.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Be favourable unto the Poor, which may be little, if thou wilt be aided of God against them that be Mighty.</p>

                  </note> And assisted in settling the publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs both in Church and State. The first thing he seemed to be employed in, was in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Reformed Office of Religion. For when a Deliberation was soon had of changing the Religion set up under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice offered to Sir <hi>William Cecil,</hi> (who was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100352:50"/>
now admitted Secretary of State) for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, it was advised, that before an whole Alteration could be made, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire some longer time and study, a Platform or Book of Divine Service should be framed, to be shewn to the Queen; and being by her approved, to be put up in the Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House. For which purpose, seven Men were Nominated, Dr. <hi>Bill,</hi> the Queen's Almoner, and Master of <hi>Trinity</hi>-College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and after Dean of <hi>Westminister,</hi> Dr, <hi>Parker,</hi> late Dean of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> soon after Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>May,</hi> late Dean of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and soon after Elect of <hi>York,</hi> Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> late Dean of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>'s-Church <hi>Oxon,</hi> after Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pilkington,</hi> late Master of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s-College, <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and after Bishop of <hi>Durham, Grindal,</hi> late Chaplain to Bishop <hi>Ridley,</hi> and soon after Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Whitehead,</hi> a grave and elderly Divine, highly esteemed by Archbishop <hi>Cranmer:</hi> These four last having been Exiles in the last Reign.

And after Consulation with these, other Men o Learning were to be drawn in, being grave and apt Men, to give their Assents. And accordingly these Men met, it being now Winter, at Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s House, which then was in <hi>Chanon-Row.</hi> Where was laid in a sufficient quality of Wood, Coals and drink for their use. And here was Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> Assistant with the rest in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing of King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Book of Common|

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100352:51"/>
Iune</hi> 16. 1559. by the Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the Lord-Lieutenant, and the rest of the Justices there met. It was for the taking care to the Orders newly made by the Parliament for the Reformation of Religion, and for the muster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and putting the County in a Posture of Defence. In which, I make no doubt, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had a great hand, and was a special Director. The sum of these Orders was, That every Justice of Peace was to take an Oath, which was provided for that purpose; and that every one appointed to be a Justice should not forbear to Serve, or take the Oath. That the Justices should call three or four of the Honest Inhabitants of every Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and charge them to get the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Prayer Book and Administration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments lately Authorized by Parliament to be said and used. And that the said Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants should see the Curates in each Parish use such Service as was appointed in the said Book, and no other. And if any Curate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused so to do, or Ministered some other way than was set down, or Preach or Teach any thing in Derogation to the same, to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and take him and bring him before the Lord-Lieutenant to receive Punishment ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Statute. The said Inhabitants also to present the Names of all Persons as did absent themselves from Divine Service. That the Justices and all other Gentlemen give their Attendance upon such Preachers as should be sent by the Queen or the Bishops, so long as the Preachers should tarry in those
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100352:52"/>
Parts. Also, to order Watches and Beacons to be kept within their several Division. To cause the Act for Rebellion, and the Statute for Archery to be Published to the People. To see to the Punishment of Vagabonds and seditious Tellers of Tales. To send their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to all Constables, to give admonition to all Persons to provide themselves with Horse and Armour, according as the Law late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made in that behalf ordained. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables to direct a Brief of the Statute of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with the Pains contained, that it might be Notified to all Men, how they were to provide for the Musters. And within three Weeks after the former Precept, to send forth Precepts to the Constables, requiring all Men from Sixteen to Sixty, chargeable by the last Statute for finding of Armour, to repair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Justices at such a Day and Place as they should appoint; and thither to bring all their Household Servants and Arms and Horses, as they were bounden to find. Also, to Certifie to the Lord-Liuetenant of the Default and Lack of Furniture in any. To chuse out the most likely and able Men for the Wars, and put their Names in a Book: And particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly note their Names that should be most meet for Demi-launces, Light-horsemen, Gunners, Archers, Pikemen and Billmen.

               <p>Great Discourse was now had every where about the Queen's Marriage.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ann.</hi> 1560.</note> For it was the Nations great Desire to see the Queen have a Prince to succeed in the Government after her.<note place="margin">Smith's <hi>Dialogue concerning the Queen's Marriage.</hi>
                  </note> The Queen seemed not inclinable to Marry; and there were some that flattered
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100352:53"/>
her, and declared it were better for her and the Realm, that she should remain single as she was. But the most part, and especially the Protestant, was earnest for her Marriage: Yet these varied; some were for her Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad, others at home. Of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> drew up an ingenious Book, consisting of divers Orations for and against the Queen's Marriage, fained to be spoken by certain Dialogists according as their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were in this Point. Their Names were <hi>Agamus,</hi> whose Judgment was for the Queen's not Marrying, <hi>Philoxenes,</hi> who was for her Marrying, but for her Marrying a Stranger, and <hi>Axenius,</hi> who was for her Marrying at home with some one of her Noble Subjects. For the sight of this choice MS. I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to my worthy Friends, Sir <hi>Richard Gibbs</hi> of <hi>Weltham</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Knight, and the Reverend Mr. <hi>Iohn Laughton,</hi> publick Library Keeper of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Entrance into this Dialogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins thus. </p>
               <q>
                  <p>As I was walking in my Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den all alone, <hi>Francis Walsingham</hi> came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me: And whether I espied him at the first coming or no, my Head Being occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied with Matters, I know not. But after the first common Words of <hi>Welcome,</hi> and <hi>How do ye,</hi> and <hi>Ye have been long a Stranger, What News?</hi> &amp;c. I pray you, saith he, tell me, if I may be so bold to ask you, What is that you are musing upon so sadly alone, when I came in. Methoughts you had some great Matter in your Head: For ye scarcely
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100352:53"/>
did see me, and loth ye were to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. Ye guess well, quoth I; For I was recording with my self a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which was had here, even in this Place, partly in Walking, and partly in sitting upon the Green Bench, of certain Friends of yours and mine, which came now from the Court to solace themselves in the Country, and took my House in their way. I pray you, said he, if I may hear it, let me hear some piece of it. For it must be some great Matter that maketh you Muse of it all alone? S. It is great Matter indeed, quoth I, Marry it is a Man doth take it. For it was a Disputation much after the old fort of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Dialogues and <hi>Tullies,</hi> and <hi>a Thing</hi> which I would wish some Learned Man had in hand that could handle it well, as it will bear. For the Matter seemeth worthy the Writing. And they surely each Man defended his Part stoutly and lively with so <hi>many Reasons</hi> as came to his Mind, I dare say for that time. <hi>W.</hi> And whose Part took you? But I am a Fool to ask you that Question before you tell me the Matter and Argument of the Disputation. <hi>S.</hi> The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was of the Marriage of the Queen's Majesty, whom I had thought, that all the World as well as I, had wisht to have been Married, that it might have pleased God to have blessed and made glad our Country with a Young Prince of her Body. <hi>W.</hi> And is there any Man so wicked and so foolish that doth not wish so? <hi>S.</hi> I cannot tell you what
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100352:54"/>
he doth indeed, but I assure you one, whom I dare say ye neither account wicked nor a fool in reasoning, would shew himself not only of the contrary mind, but to have great Reasons for his Opinion. <hi>W.</hi> That is but as you Philosophers and Rhetoricians do. For you care not what part you take. For if you list, you will never lack Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and would make some simple Men as I am that hear you, believe, that the Cow is Wood, and that the Moon is made of a green Cheese. <hi>S.</hi> When you speak of Learned Men, put me out of the number. But he held that her Majesty did best in thus keeping her self sole as she doth; and would seem to be in mind, that it were best for her not to Marry. <hi>W.</hi> Mary, that is a Mind indeed; if it were known abroad, he were of such a mind, whosoever he were, I dare say every Man would spit at him in the Streets as he goeth; and for my part I should never love him. <hi>S.</hi> Why? If her Majesty were of that mind, as it seemeth by divers of her Doings and Sayings she is, would you not love her? <hi>W.</hi> Love her? Her Majesty I cannot chuse but love: Her Vertues be such, that whosoever know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her Majesty (tho' he were not her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject) must needs love her. As for us that are her Subjects, Duty compelleth us to love, honour and obey her, to take her part what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it shall please her Highness to do in that Case. But I cannot chuse but with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. <hi>S.</hi> Well, another held the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100352:54"/>
Mary, he would in any Case her Majesty should Marry within the Realm. <hi>W.</hi> God's Blessing on his Heart: Him I like well. <hi>S.</hi> The third thought it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that her Majesty should have some Prince a Stranger; and brought great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons therefore. <hi>W.</hi> That was, I dare lay a Wager, some <hi>Italianated English</hi> Man, or some Mongrel that hath good store of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landish Blood in him. <hi>S.</hi> Ye judge very fast, before ye either know the Man, or have perused his Reasons. Well; the fourth seemeth most indifferent. For he was but directly against the first. For in any wife he liked not that sole Life of a Queen. For the rest, whether it pleased her Highness to take a Nobleman of <hi>England,</hi> or a Stranger, he was indifferent. <hi>W.</hi> Sir, if I may be so bold as to hear the whole Discourse, you shall do me the greatest pleasure in the World. And seeing you were repeating the same with your self, you were as well tell it out. With one labour you shall repeat that thing that else you would do, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure me your Friend. <hi>S.</hi> Neither the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is all one to meditate in a Man's Mind, and to speak out with his Tongue: Nor his Peril is like. For if I fail in the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my self, either in my Memory of the Reasons, or plain uttering of them, I am the Offender and Punisher, no Man else can controul me. When I shall take upon me to tell them unto you, you shall I know sometimes have cause to find fault with my

Then, quoth I, would that Wooing were once done, and that her Majesty had one whom she could like of, that we might see the hope and fruit of Succession more near at hand. What, said one of them, is there not in <hi>England</hi> as goodly Men, Noble, Witty and Couragious, as be in other strange Places? What need it be fought so far that we have so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Well, saith the third, and I am in that mind, (altho' I know it is not the most plausible Opinion) that her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty doth best to keep her thus sole, unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as she is. The fourth at that was as much displeased as you were. Neither, saith he, am I altogether Proselyte of the first Opinion; nor yet of the second: But so, that her Majesty Marry, whether our Countryman, or a Stranger, I like indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently: Mary, to hold that she should not Marry, I hold it an unnatural, and in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a wicked Opinion against our Country. My Masters, quoth I, we have all leisure, thanks be to God; and ye may make me now glad. For methinks I am in <hi>Plato</hi>'s Academy, or <hi>Cicero's Tuseulane.</hi> I pray you, seeing you all four be of divers Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, let us hear your Reasons. We can have no better Place nor Time. And if this Green Bank be not soft enough, we will have Cushions brought to fit on. To that they all agreed, and said they needed no Cushions, the Bank was so fair, and the Garden so pleasant. A little they strived who should begin. But he that spake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Marriage, said, he would gladly first declare unto them, that his Opinion was not so strange nor so unreasonable as they took it: And so he began.</p>

Concerning which, thus the Secretary wrote to him:<q> This alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your Speech into Latin, I thought very strange; but surely Her Majesty had occasion ministred by such Reports as now were brought, to think the same were best.

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100352:60"/>
a man of Intrigue. He and Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> a person of more Gravity and Discretion, could not well comport together; <hi>Throgmorton</hi> rather hindring than furthering the Queen's Business by his over-practising. The Dissension be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them came to the Court. <hi>Throgmorton</hi> had a great Friend there, namely, the Lord <hi>Robert Duddeley</hi>; so Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s course was to sue to the Secretary for his good Word.

very desirous to know what his Friends here thought of him.

some Accident may turn them to disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and he advised him to have that of old <hi>Ennius</hi> in his memory,

Yet as you may, said he, interpose your self, and be not si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent when you perceive any thing that may turn to the help and benefit of us your Countrymen at home. He went on in his Counsels to his Friend: He bad him aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all Converse with loose Women, for they blunted the Edge of the Mind, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded nothing but sudden Mischiefs of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul: That he should not be too much disturbed at the Offences, the Passions, and the Mistakes of others, as becoming neither his Prudence, nor Learning, nor manner of Life. For the various Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and thoughts of Men have ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced such Waves and high Tydes in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Life, and will do so to the end: In which, if we proceed with Reason, as much as we can, we shall be upheld with the Conscience of our good Deeds.

                  <hi>Smith</hi> also spake to <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Printer, that he would take it in hand. He desiring the Copy, to see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were any thing in it, which touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the State of that Kingdom, as also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Bulk of the Book, and on Condition, he had leave of the Queen, undertook to do it. But it received some stop by this means, (which probably enough might have been a thing plotted by <hi>Osorius's</hi> Friends, or Queen <hi>Elizabeth's,</hi> and the Nations Enemies.) One <hi>de Valla</hi> came to the <hi>English</hi> Ambassador, and desired he might have the sight of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle of <hi>Haddon's</hi>; and whether he had the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador's leave or no, went to <hi>Stephens</hi> as from the Ambassador, and took the Book from him to peruse it for a time. But while it was in <hi>de Valla's</hi> Possession, the Provost Marshal arrested the said <hi>de Valla,</hi> upon pretence of some Crime, and withal, took this Book out of his hand, and so it was brought to the Court, and remained in the possession of the said Provost. This created work for the Ambassador.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:100352:65"/>So he wrote to the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> acquainting him with the whole matter; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to him, how <hi>Osorius</hi> had in the Book traduced the Manners, Lives and Religion of <hi>England,</hi> not according to the truth of the thing, as indeed it was, but according to his Apprehension; and as ignorant Men had out of Envy represented matters to him.<note place="margin">

Thus the Ambassador discoursed in his Letter. Two things therefore in Conclusion he requested of the Chancellor; one was, that after he had read this Epistle of Dr. <hi>Haddon,</hi> he would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that the Copy might be restored to <hi>Stephens</hi> to Print it <hi>Cum Privilegio</hi>; or if that were not allowed, yet that he might not be hindred from printing it in Latin and French. Or if yet that would not be granted, at least to restore the Copy, that it might be printed elsewhere. This was written by <hi>Smith, March</hi>

                  </note> That the <hi>French</hi> Queen was much of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with those Folks that presumed to print <hi>Osorius</hi> his Book in <hi>France</hi> without the King's Licence, and commanded him, the Chancellor, to enquire after those that dared to Publish it, and to see them punished. He prayed <hi>Smith,</hi> or his Messenger to procure him one of <hi>Osorius</hi>'s Books, that he might peruse it in order to the taking of Punishment on the Printers. That the Queen, as he said, might know, that good Kings, even in War, have a care of the Honour of crown'd Heads. But disapproving the doing it as they did, they could not, he said, permit of <hi>Haddon</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to be printed; and so the <hi>French</hi> Queen ordered the Copy of the said Book to be sent back.</p>

                  <hi>Smith</hi> therefore further pressed the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor in this manner; That this only remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> that both Parties should be heard, as well he that made the Answer,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as he that put in the Caution. And whereas the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor thought it inconvenient to allow <hi>Haddon</hi>'s Book to be printed, because it would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a contending in Reproaches and ill Words; <hi>Smith</hi> said, that there would be no such rude Contention between them, but that whereas <hi>Osorius,</hi> in an Oratorical way, shook our Forms of Religion, and taxed the Manners of certain Men; <hi>Haddon</hi> shewed, that <hi>Osorius</hi> indeed knew neither the one nor the other, and that such was the state of the thing, that in his Judgment, it were better, that both their Orations should be Read, than either be supprest: For that, both of them were wrote Eloquently, and in Latin; and that which they wrote, did not at all touch the State of <hi>France.</hi> Boldly adding, That when <hi>Osorius</hi> had a Liberty <hi>Cum Privilegio,</hi> of accusing our Forms, we seemed to demand that which was but equal of him, the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> namely to be heard with the like Privilege; and that it must seem hard, that a liberty of Haranguing should be granted to one Party only. The effect of this was, that our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador got the Book Printed not long after, as shall be related in due place.</p>
               <p>But though <hi>Smith</hi> was not concerned any further in this Affair,<note place="margin">

                  </note> after he had brought the Book to the Press with his own Corrections and Additions; yet it may not be amiss to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100352:67"/>
relate the Progress of this Controversy, which I shall do briefly. There past over a year or two, and Dr. <hi>Haddon</hi> was appointed the Queen's Agent in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and was Leiger at <hi>Bruges.</hi> At what time one <hi>Emanuel Dalmada,</hi> a <hi>Portuguese</hi> Born, Bishop of <hi>Angrence,</hi> sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sprung up in <hi>Brussels,</hi> and undertook the Defence of his Friend <hi>Osorius</hi>: Stuffing a great Volume full of Slanders and Brabbles. And in the end of the Book he had caused certain ugly Pictures to be pourtrayed; thereby to deface <hi>Haddon</hi>'s Personage as much as he might. This Apology (for so it was called) when <hi>Haddon</hi> perused, he professed he never saw so foolish and unsavory a Writing, full of Scoffs and Absurdities. The Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he despised as one altogether unlettered, and so dull by Nature, that he was oftentimes a jesting Stock among the wiser sort of his own Fraternity. But after some more time, Dr. <hi>Tho. Wylson,</hi> the Queen's Ambassador in <hi>Portugal</hi> coming home, at <hi>Osorius</hi>'s Request, brought certain Volumes of the said <hi>Osorius</hi>'s composing against <hi>Haddon</hi>'s Answer, digested into three Books. Whereof he delivered one to <hi>Haddon.</hi> Who received it gladly, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rused it once or twice: Having hoped that he being then installed a Bishop, would have been much more modest than before. But the Matter fell out quite contrary. For instead of a civil and sober Person, he found him a most frivolous Sophister, (I use <hi>Haddon</hi>'s own Words) for a grave Divine, a childish Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit: And in the Book, of Vanity and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100352:67"/>
Haughtiness good store. To this Book, <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> soon after began the writing of an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer Apologetical</hi> against the said <hi>Osorius</hi>'s slanderous Invectives, as he stiled them, for the necessary Defence of the Evangelical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Verity: And dedicated it to <hi>Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> as <hi>Osorius</hi> had done his Letter before to the Queen. Which as she had gently entertained and perused, so he perswaded himself to obtain the like Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of that King's Magnificence and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Clemency. In this Apology, <hi>Haddon</hi> made some Progress, but died before he finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it. And the rest of it, which was the greater part, was done very Learnedly by <hi>Iohn Fox</hi>; and printed about the Year 1573. And after by <hi>Iames Bell,</hi> put into English and printed 1581.</p>
               <p>But turn we now again to our Ambassador Resident in <hi>France.</hi>

This gave the Secretary a great Concern, for fear of some miscarriage in publick Business by means thereof. And in <hi>December,</hi> in one of his Letters to <hi>Smith,</hi> taking notice of it he told him, that he hoped nevertheless, <hi>That Both, for their Wisdoms, would have regard of the Queen's Affairs, and one of them bear with the other.

And in that Condition he remained some time, namely, so long till the Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; tho' he still acted as the Queen's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador. He was somewhat impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main so long under Restraint, and thought that <hi>Cecil</hi> was not sufficiently diligent to get him his Liberty.
But <hi>Cecil</hi> understanding it wrote to his Fellow-Ambassador to this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi rend="margQuotes">That as he had promised <hi>Smith</hi> his Friendship, so he had done the like to <hi>Throg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi> tho' some Clouds, he said, let the Influence of his good Will to be felt of him.

                  <hi>French</hi> Gentleman. <hi>Cecil</hi> took notice of it, and wrote to <hi>Smith,</hi> that he thought it strange to see what great Amity now was between the <hi>French</hi>-Ambassador and Mr. <hi>Throgmorton,</hi> considering the Hate he had before born him. It was strange to <hi>Cecil,</hi> a plain-dealing Man, and of no Turnings and Windings, tho' a great and wise Politician.

<hi>Smith</hi> on the next oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion in his to <hi>Haddon,</hi> thus communicated his Judgment; <q>That if any doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cicero</hi> was a Lawyer, it was not to be wondered at, because Men for the most part are ignorant of Age and Times. That <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> was not of those in that Time that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Civil Law, but yet he was <hi>Iure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consultissimus, Admirably skilled in it:</hi> Which not only many of his Pleadings and Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons demonstrate, but his <hi>Topics</hi> to <hi>Treba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> And he esteemed himself so to have prosited herein, that he openly declared one Day, <hi>If they vexed him he would the third Day after profess the Civil Law.</hi> But he never saw indeed <hi>Accursius,</hi> nor <hi>Bartholus,</hi> nor <hi>Baldus,</hi> nor <hi>Iason,</hi> nor the <hi>Digests,</hi> nor Code of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> A good Reason why, because they were not in being in his Time. But so thorowly had he learned the Laws of that Time, that unless he had been an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he had been esteemed the Learnedest Civilian. If he that is a Lawyer deny him to be a Philosopher, that Answer will easily be given to him, that <hi>Apelles</hi> gave the Shooe-maker, <hi>Let him not give his Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond his Slipper.</hi> But for his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, he betook them that denied it to his Book <hi>De Deo, De Divinatione,</hi> or what he

               <p>In <hi>April,</hi> 1564. Secretary <hi>Cecil</hi> writ our Ambassador the News of the Disturbance at Court,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the Troubles oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by</hi> Hales<hi>'s Book.</hi>
                  </note> occasioned by <hi>Iohn Hales</hi>'s Book, wrote in the last Parliament. Which was the cause of his being cast into Prison, and several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Court committed, or banished the Court. Of this <hi>Haddon</hi> (who was now at home) had also acquainted him, and called it <hi>Tempestas Halisiana,</hi> i. e. The Storm raised by <hi>Hales.</hi> This <hi>Hales</hi> was a passing good Scholar, an hearty Protestant, thorowly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the State of this Kingdom, and a great Antipapist; he had been a Courtier to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and an Exile under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and now under this Queen Clerk of the Hanaper: And fearing the Succession of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen, a Papist, to the Crown, if Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> should die unmarried, and childless, he by private Consultation with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, resolved to take upon him to write a Discourse to discuss the Title to this Crown after the Queen. And having in a Book confuted and rejected the Line of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen, made the Line of the Lady <hi>Frances</hi> that had been Married to <hi>Grey</hi> Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> (who was Daughter to the Younger Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.) to be only next and lawful Heir. She was Mother to the Lady <hi>Katharine Grey,</hi> who had been privately Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Edward Seimour,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hertford:</hi> And were now both in the Tower for that Marriage, and under the Queen's Displeasure. In
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100352:75"/>
                  <hi>April, Hales</hi> was committed to the Fleet for this bold and presumptuous Act, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Tower, where he continued a great while; Especially because he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated these his Conceits to sundry Persons. The Lord <hi>Iohn Grey,</hi> Uncle to the Lady <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> was in trouble about it, and so was the Lord-Keeper <hi>Bacon.</hi> And besides all this, <hi>Hales</hi> had procured Sentences and Counsels of Lawyers from beyond Seas, to be written in maintenance of the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which seemed to have been by their Consents only: For which the Marriage had been declared invalid and null by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> But hereat the Queen was much offended. In <hi>May, Hales's</hi> Business came to be examined by the Secretary. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Examination, he was found to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured Books in Defence of the Earl of <hi>Hert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's</hi> Marriage, and likewise in Approbation of the Title of Succession for the Lady <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi>
Upon this Occasion thus did <hi>Smith</hi> the Ambassador write;

than Malice. And whereas he saw so much Danger and Vexation, Banishment from Court, and Imprisonment of great Men, happening upon the Occasion of the said Book, some for Writing it, and some for Reading it, he made this Moral and wise Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,<note place="margin">

Prayers, as she taught him. And thereby she said, he should be delivered of his Bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or his Witch should consume as the Fire did. Which when this Evidence rebuked her for doing, as using Witchcraft, she conceived an ill Will towards him. And he having a Sheep-shearing about that Time, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting her thereto, being his Neighbour, she, as he supposed, bewitched two of his Sheep. For immediately after they were taken with Sickness, their hinder Legs so indisposed, that they only could crawl, and died. The same Man had a Sow, being well when the Sun went down, which the next Morning was found dead, with her Nose lying upon the Groundsel of this Woman's House, where she never was f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another Witness deposed, That she being Servant to a Farmer's Wife in the said Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of <hi>Theydon Mount,</hi> this Goodwife <hi>Malter</hi> came to her Mistress, who was going to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Market, and desired her to bring her home some Sprats; but she saying she came always loaden from <hi>London,</hi> denied her. Upon this, the Deponent, then her hired Maid, came from Milking; and as she set her Milk in the Pan upon a Loft, there was a Speckled Bird, as she thought, which fluttered among the Milk-Pans, and with her Feet and Wings slubbered therein: Her Mistress in the mean time called her away. But she endeavoured by a Broom to sweep or drive away this Bird. But it would not away, but went fluttering
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100352:80"/>
from Pan to Pan; and could not fly, but skip and hop. At the last, it went from the Loft where the Milk and Wheat was, into the Cheese Loft. And then being often called by her Mistress she came down, and being blamed for her long tarrying, she related how she was troubled with such a Bird. And then her Mistress came her self into the Milk Loft, and found it come down Stairs a very Toad. Which after it was once come into the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, she could never see it more. And for the space of six Weeks after by no Means, nor Diligence, nor change of Churn, nor Cloths, could they have any Butter; until that her Mistress did bid her carry her Milk, and churn at a Neighbours House; and there the Milk made Butter as it was wont to do before, and in the same Milk Pans. Other Evidences there were against this Woman.</p>

               <p>Another Woman of <hi>Stapleford Abbots</hi> said, That about three Years past, she was coming from <hi>Rumford</hi> Market with this <hi>Anne Vicars:</hi> And suddenly the said <hi>Anne</hi> cast up her Nose into the Air and smelt: Which the other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at, and asked her if she saw any thing, or if there were any Carrion there. And she said, she smelt either a Whore or a Thief. At last she espied the Wife of one <hi>Ingarsole,</hi> going a great way before them. Whereat the said <hi>Vicars</hi> cried out with an Oath, I told you, I smelt either a Whore or a Thief; and making great haste to overtake her, when she came at her, she cast her Apron upon the side of her Face next unto her: And then went backwards a great way with her Face towards the said <hi>Ingarsole's</hi> Wife, casting her Apron over it; and making many Crosses, saying as it were certain Prayers, but what, this Examinant could not tell; but marvelled much at her Behaviour; and said she was to blame to slander her that was an honest Woman, and so known among her Neighbours for twenty Years. But upon this, <hi>Ingarsole's</hi> Wife fell extreamly Sick, and lost one of her Eyes with a stroke as she thought that came unto her, she could not tell how, in the plain Field, where neither was Bush nor Tree, or other Creature.</p>

               <p>Also one <hi>Agnes,</hi> Wife of <hi>Thomas Combres,</hi> being examined, said, That since <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Iast, the said supposed Witch fell out with her, and upon that she fell a Cursing and Banning at her, and wisht her Eyes out.

their next Work was to forward the Business with all speed, that they might lie no longer at great Expence. <hi>Smith</hi> excited the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> that they might proceed to a perfect Beginning of the Work in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Society. The Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> was very forward, offering Iron, and Lead, and Money also, and making more Vessels. <hi>Smith</hi> also put on the Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> to make Orders when and how it should begin; and that one Man or two should be fixed upon, as chief Overseers to take Care and Charge of the Works; who should be answerable to the whole Society: Making clear Books for one Day prefixed, what the Daily, Ordinary and Extraordinary Expences be, and what the Comings in again Weekly of Copper, Allom, Coperas, and other Things be and were like to be. Then what common Seal for the whole Society. And that <hi>Burghley</hi> also would out of other Statutes for other Societies, cull out some good and wholsome Statutes and Orders for this: Which without a Society, he said, could not well stand: And the fewer Statutes, and well kept, the better. And lastly, he desired that all might be ready, so as by the 10th or 15th of <hi>February,</hi> the Work might be fully begun: That so by the last of <hi>March,</hi> a sure Guess might be made, what were like to ensue thereof. One Sir <hi>Iohn Hibbord,</hi> was the Man agreed upon to have the chief Charge of the Provisions for all things necessary for the Work, and for Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursing Money by Accounts. And to him
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100352:84"/>
the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> had given order for Iron, Cask and Lead. And one <hi>Cole</hi> was appointed by Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> to be over the Works, to be the chief Doer and Worker of the Melting, and not to go from the Work. There was also a Clerk to keep the Reckoning, to see what the Labourers did daily, and Weekly what was melted and made in Coperas and Allom.</p>

                  </note>But notwithstanding all <hi>Smith</hi>'s hastening, the Matter suffered Delay, and was retarded by <hi>Medley</hi> the chief Undertaker, who loiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>London</hi> till the 7th of <hi>March,</hi> making Excuses, of wanting Money to defray his Charges here, that he did not perceive that the rest were all agreed, that he thought himself hardly dealt withal, if he should not be allowed for the Charges in making Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments now this two Years and more, and for his Buildings and Vessels, the sum of 400 <hi>l.</hi> But in reply to him, <hi>Smith</hi> urged, that for two Years past, <hi>Medley</hi> and <hi>Topcliff</hi> (who was his Partner) had made <hi>Crocus</hi>; of which they might have made Benefit for the Re-embur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of themselves. They said, they sent it away for Essays, and part of it was purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Smith</hi> said again, that he might, as well as they, claim to have his Allowance, he and Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilbert</hi> being out of Purse 400 <hi>l.</hi> in making Tryals, paid into the Hands of <hi>Medley,</hi> and to the Lord <hi>Mountjoy.</hi> And he resented these Prolongations to my Lord <hi>Burgbley</hi> in this manner, That <hi>Medley</hi>'s Skill began by this Time to be known, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100352:84"/>
made him jealous that his Delays would wholly spoil their Business: That Sir <hi>Iohn Perot</hi> had a whole Discourse of the compleat manner of the Work in Writing: That the Lord <hi>Mountjoy</hi> had gotten one of <hi>Medley</hi>'s chief Workmen to him: That divers in the Countries knew the Earths and the Working of them. And yet, said he discontentedly, we do nothing, and wished that he might go down himself. For which he was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, undertaking within fourteen Days to bring Things to a full certainty, as to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding what Truth or Likelihood there was in the Matter: Assuring his Lordship, that he was not satisfied, until they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified from thence by Order and by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: That they might compare the Time, the Charge, and the Labour with the Gains that came of it, and in what kind it was and should arise. And that the ill Success, which it seems they met with at <hi>Poole,</hi> and at the Lady <hi>Mountjoy</hi>'s Works, taught to trust little to Words and Promises, nor to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made afar off, nor to the Accounts of Men of that Faculty [<hi>i. e.</hi> Alchymists.] <hi>Fain they would be fingering of Money,</hi> said he; <hi>But when it is once in their Hands, we must seek it in the Ashes.</hi>

                     <hi>An Article debated by</hi> Smith.</note>In this Treaty, it is worth taking notice of one Article in Debate: Which was that the two Princes should mutually assist each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if the Queen were invaded for the Cause of Religion, that the <hi>French</hi> King should yield her his Assistance. This Article, when almost all the rest were well accorded, that King declined to have put into the Treaty, tho' he promised to perform it most faithfully. And tho' it were not expresly mentioned in the League, yet such general Words should be used, that the Matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100352:86"/>
should be contained therein.
To which <hi>Smith</hi> replied, <q>That that could not be; and that no general Words could contain it, if the Party that was bound would say, that it was against his Conscience, or he meant it not.</q>
To which the King said, <q>That he would write to the Queen his Sister with his own Hand what he meant as to that; and that he would as well defend her even in that Cause, as if it were exprest in Words: and that which he said he would keep, tho' he dyed for it.</q>But this King was a great Dissembler, which our Ambassador pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably knew well enough, but gave him this discreet Answer; 
<q>That for him, he thought no less, and he was sure the Queen his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress took him to be a faithful Prince, and constant to his Words as any was Living. But when they spake of Treaties, they were not made in Words, nor in such Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters missive, but after another Authentical sort Sworn and Sealed. Without which, he could not, he said, for his part take it substantially and orderly done. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the Treaty was not Personal but Perpetual, for him and his Successors.</q>

the Queen should desire: <hi>Smith</hi> answered, That he knew the Fashion of Leagues. And that it must be agreed upon between the Commissioners, that no Words be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, then Subscribed with the Hands of both the Parties; the <hi>French</hi> Commissioners delivering the Part Signed with their Hands to those of <hi>England,</hi> and the Commissioners of <hi>England</hi> next to them. Then the Prince causeth it to be made under the Great Seal of the Realm, and so to be delivered to each others Ambassador. And that he that came to see it Sworn to, might make a new League, if the Princes would; but to alter that that was made, he could not. For the Princes were bound to Ratify and Swear to that, on which the Commissioners were agreed. And that it were not Wisdom, as he added, to send such Personages as they spake of to an uncertain League: And he might consider that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress would not do it.</q> This Conference happened <hi>March</hi> the 1st, 1571.</p>

                  </note>After much Pains, this Article and another about the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen was agreed; and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was only to give her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to finish this happy and advantageous League.
And to excite the Queen hereunto, Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> with <hi>Halsingham,</hi> did freely give her advice to this Tenor, <q>That it was for the Assurance of her Person and Crown, as she was a Prince lawful and natural, and had a Crown Imperial. And that she did it so by her Laws, as God's Laws and Hers
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100352:87"/>
willed it to be done. That foreign Princes that were her Friends, would and must take it well; and that such as were not, would rather laugh at her, and be glad of it, if she did it not; and, when they should see Time, take occasion to endanger her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty thereby.</q> The Queen soon after sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified her Consent. And so in the Month of <hi>April</hi> ensuing, at <hi>Blois</hi> the League was concluded, and signed the 18th or 19th Day. Which, according as <hi>Smith</hi> and his Collegue did conceive, should be with as great Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Defence of the Queen as ever was or could be; the two Realms being so near and ready to defend her, if it were required. And in case <hi>Spain</hi> should threaten, or shew ill Offices, as it had of late done against the Queen's Safety; it would be afraid hereafter so to do, seeing such a Wall adjoyned, as <hi>Smith</hi> wrote. Which he therefore hoped would be the best League that ever was made with <hi>France,</hi> or any other Nation for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Surety.
His good Conceit he had of this League, did further appear by what he wrote in another Letter soon after to the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> 
                  <q>That now it could not be said, That her Majesty was altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, having so good a Defence of so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Couragious, and so faithful a Prince of <hi>his Word,</hi> (but herein our Ambassador was mistaken in his Man, none being so <hi>false of</hi> his Word, and treacherous as he, all covered over with most artificial Dissimulation) and so near a Neighbour, provided for, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoken
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100352:88"/>
beforehand against any need. Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, and partly the Trouble in <hi>Flanders</hi> (which he trusted God had provided to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver his poor Servants there from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Tyranny) should make her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness enjoy more quietly both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and a better Neighbour of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                     <hi>He loved not many Words.</hi>
                  </note>When <hi>Monsieur De Foix</hi> came to him and his Collegue, with the Draught of the whole League in <hi>French,</hi> which before was in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the Matters that past <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> (which he said was, that the King might understand it) and had made a new Preface, <hi>Smith</hi> did not much stick at it. And acquainting the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> (now Lord <hi>Burghley</hi>) with it, he opened to him the Reason of it.
<q>I am old, said he, I love not much Talk, and would fain be dispatched honestly home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So the Effect be there indeed, and our Queen not deceived, I care for no more, that done.</q> 
                  <hi>Smith</hi> loved to do his Business well and soundly, and yet to knit it up with Brevity and Expedition. Thus again, when the <hi>French</hi> Deputy urged much in this Treaty the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen, that she might be sent safe home to her Country; a thing which the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors had order not to deal in, by no means; he began to amplify upon that in a long Oration.
But at the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Smith</hi> told him in short, <q>For all your Reason you must pardon me. I know you are a good Rhetorician, and you have Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical Ornaments at will to make; and so
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100352:88"/>
have I on the contrary side, if I would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow my Time in that sort. We are the Queen's Majesty's Servants, and we have shewed our Reasons so good, that no Man could deny that we should not agree unto it.</q>

               <p>While <hi>Smith</hi> was in this Country,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in</hi> France.</note> he was forced to follow the Court from Place to Place; but it being Winter pinched him sore. At <hi>Tholouse</hi> it almost cost him his Life, and had made an End of him had it not been for Strong Waters, which he used for his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach Morning and Evening. At <hi>Blois,</hi> where he remained after <hi>Candlemas,</hi> he endured the greatest Cold that ever he felt, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual. And notwithstanding the Cordial Waters he used, he was scarce able to resist the extream Cold of the Weather, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thirty Days together continual Frost and Snow. Neither was there Wood plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor good Chimneys for Fire. And in his Bed-chamber he could make no Fire at all.</p>

                  </note> the League being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, the Queen-Mother, one Day in <hi>March</hi> (<hi>Anno exeunte</hi>) in the King's Garden at <hi>Blois,</hi> brake her Desire of a Marriage between Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her second Son the Duke <hi>D'Alenson</hi>; asking <hi>Smith</hi> the Ambassador, whether he knew how the Queen would fancy the Marriage with her said Son.
<q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, said he, you know of old, except I have a sure ground, I dare affirm nothing to your Majesty. When she said again,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100352:89"/>
That if the Queen were disposed to Marry, she saw not where she might Marry so well: That as for those she had heard named, as the Emperor's Son, or <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> they were both less than her Son, and of less Stature by a good deal: And if she would Marry, it were pity any more Time were lost. <hi>Smith</hi> liking well enough the Motion, replied to this, That if it pleased God, that the Queen were Married, and had a Child, all these Brags, and all these Treasons, (he meant of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and her Party) would soon be appalled. And on condition she had a Child by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur D'Alenson,</hi> for his part he cared not, if they had the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> [which was an Article propounded by the <hi>French</hi> King in the fore-mentioned Treaty, but by no means allowed by the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors.] For then he said, they would be as careful and as jealous over her for the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s Surety as the Queen's Subjects, or she her self was. The Queen-Mother then subjoined, That it was true; and without this Marriage, if she should Marry in another Place, she could not see how this League and Amity could be so strong as it was. Our Ambassador answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, It was true; the Knot of Blood and Marriage was a stronger Seal than that which was printed in Wax, and lasted longer, if God gave good Success. But yet all Leagues had not Marriage joined with them, as this might, if it pleased God. To which she
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100352:89"/>
joined her Wish, and added, That if it should so happen, she would her self make a Start over and see the Queen; the which of all things she most desired. To which again the Ambassador said, That if he had at that present as ample Commission, as he had at the first for <hi>Monsieur</hi> [<hi>D'Anjou,</hi>] the Matter should soon by God's Grace be at an End. The Queen wisht he had: And asked him, If he should have such an one when he went into <hi>England,</hi> whether he would not come again to execute it. Yes, Madam, said he, most gladly, on so good an Intent I would pass again the Seas, tho' I were never so Sick for it.</q>

               <p>Another Day,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Further Discourse on the same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </note> in the same Month of <hi>March,</hi> the Queen-Mother met <hi>Smith</hi> the Ambassador in the same Garden, and having Discourse concerning other Matters, as of the Queen of <hi>England</hi>'s danger from the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> who now applied her self to <hi>Spain,</hi> she thus brought in the Talk again of Marriage: Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him whether his Mistress did not see, that she should be always in danger until she Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. And that once done, and that in some good House, who dared attempt any thing against her?
<q>Then, said he, he thought if she were once Married, all in <hi>England,</hi> that had any Traiterous Hearts would be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. For one Tree alone (as he ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously explained the Matter) may soon be cut down, but when there be two or three together, it is longer a doing. And one shall watch for the other. But if she had a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100352:90"/>
Child, then all these bold and troublesome Titles of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen or others, that make such Gaping for her Death, would be clean choaked up. The Queen cryed merrily, she saw she might have Five or Six very well. Would to God, said the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, she had one. No, said she, still merrily, two Boys, lest the one should die, and three or four Daughters to make Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with us again, and other Princes, to strengthen the Realm. Why then, said
<hi>Smith,</hi> as jocularly, you think that <hi>Monsieur Le Due</hi> shall speed. With that she laughed, and said, she desired it infinitely. And then she would trust to see thre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or four at the least of her Race, which would make her indeed not to spare Sea and Land to see her Majesty and them. And if she could have fansied my Son <hi>D'Anjou,</hi> said she, as you told me, why not this of the same House, Father and Mother, and as vigorous and lusty as he, or rather more; and now he beginneth to have a Beard come forth. And as to his Stature, she told the Ambassador, that the said Duke her Son was as tall as himself, or very near. For that Matter, said he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that for his part he made little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, if the Queen's Majesty could fansy him. Adding this Story, That <hi>Pipin the Short,</hi> Married <hi>Bertha,</hi> the King of <hi>Almain</hi>'s Daughter, who was so little to her, that he was standing in <hi>Aix,</hi> in a Church there, she taking him by the Hand, and his Head not reaching to her Girdle. And yet he
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100352:90"/>
had by her <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the great Emperor and King of <hi>France,</hi> who was reported to be almost a Gyant in Stature. To which the Ambassador added, the mention of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Glesquin,</hi> the <hi>Britain</hi> Constable, which the <hi>French</hi> made so much of, and lay bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried among the Kings at St. <hi>Denys,</hi> if he were no bigger than he was there pourtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Tomb, was very short, scarce four Foot long. But yet he was valiant, hardy and courageous above all in his Time, and did the <hi>English</hi> Men most hurt. </q>Thus ingeniously did <hi>Smith</hi> hold the Conference with the Queen-Mother.</p>
               <p>But as to his Opinion of the Queen's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>His Thoughts of the Queen's Marrying.</hi>
                  </note> wherein he perceived she was but back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, (and a Marriage he and the best States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in those Times reckon'd the only Means for the Peace and Safety of the Queen and Kingdom, against the Disturbances and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Scotch Queen, and her Friends) the Ambassador was full of sad and uneasy Thoughts: For so at this time he opened his Mind to the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi>
                  <q> That all the World did see, that they wished her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Surety, and long Continuance, and that Marriage, and the Issue of her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Body, should be the most Assurance of her Highness, and of the Wealth of the Realm. The Place, and the Person for his part he remitted to her Majesty. But what she meant to maintain still her Danger, and not to provide for her Surety, he assured his Lordship he could see no reason. And
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100352:91"/>
so prayed God to preserve Her long to Reign by some unlookt for Miracle: For he could not see by natural Reason, that she went about to provide for it. And soon after, when <hi>Smith</hi> had sent Messages two or three for the Resolution of the <hi>English</hi> Court about the Marriage, which the <hi>French</hi> were so earnest for, and in great hopes of, and no Answer came, He lamented to the aforesaid Lord, that he, and his Collegue <hi>Walsingham,</hi> could say nothing of it, when they were asked. And that they were sorry in their Hearts to see such uncertain, so negligent, and irresolute Provision for the safety of the Queen's Person, and of her Reign; Praying God Almighty, of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and Miraculous Power to preserve her long to Reign over her People; and that his Grace and Mercy would turn all to the best.</q>

                     <hi>His Concern for the Queen's Sickness.</hi>
                  </note>In the midst of these Cares of our Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador, the Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> wrote to him of a Matter that put him and his Collegue into a great Consternation. It was concerning the Queen's falling Sick of the Small-Pox, and withal of her speedy Recovery again.
His careful Mind for this Matter he thus exprest in his next Letter to the said Lord: <q>That he and his Fellow read the News of the Queen's Illness together in a marvellous Agony, but having his Medicine ready (which was, that her Majesty was within an Hour recovered) it did in part heal them again. But that, as his Lordship wrote of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100352:91"/>
himself, that the Care did not cease in him, so he might be assured it did as little cease in them: Calling to their remembrance, and laying before their Eyes the Trouble, the Uncertainty, the Disorder, the Peril and Danger, that had been like to follow, if at that Time God had taken her from them; whom he styled <hi>The Stay of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the Hope of their Repose, and that Lanthorn of their Light next God</hi>: Not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom to follow, nor certainly where to light another Candle.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another great Solicitude of his at this Time was,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>And the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolutions of the Court.</hi>
                  </note> as the Queen's Sickness, so her Slowness to resolve, and the tedious Irresolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Court.
Of which he spake in some Passion after this sort: <q>That if the Queen did still continue in Extremities to promise, in Recoveries to forget, what shall we say but as the <hi>Italians</hi> do, <hi>Passato il pericolo, gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bato il fango.</hi> He told that Lord moreover, That he should perceive by their Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their Embassy, what justly might be required was easie to be done. But if her Majesty deceived her self, and with Irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution made all Princes understand, that there was no Certainty of her or her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, but dalliance and farding off of Time, she should then first Discredit her Ministers, which was not much, but next and by them discredit her self; that is, to be counted uncertain, irresolute, unconstant, and for no Prince to trust unto, but as to a Courtier, who had Words at will, and true Deeds
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100352:92"/>
none.</q> These were Expressions proceeding somewhat, as may be perceived, from his Spleen, and partly from his present Indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Body. Which he seemed to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of.
For he begged his Lordship's Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for what he had said, rendring his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <q>That he had been kept there so long, that he was then in an Ague both in Body and in Spirit. And that as the Humours in his Body made an Ague there (of which he wisht it would make an end) so that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolution at the Court he hoped would help to conclude; that he might feel no more Miseries: Which he feared those that came after should feel: <hi>Because we will not see,</hi> said he, <hi>The Time of our Visitation.</hi>
                  </q> Thus did <hi>Smith</hi> express his Discontents into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of his trusty Friend, for the Mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of publick Affairs, as he conceived, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering as his Zeal and Affection to the Queen and the State; so the Temper of his Mind, somewhat enclined to Heat and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.

                  </note> as well as his long Experience and other Deserts, that preferred him. For his Learning had rendred him very famous in the Court.

                  </q> Wherein of all the Queen's Wise and Noble Counsellors, <hi>Smith</hi> her Secretary is made to be the deeply Learned Man about her, as being an ingenious Poet, an excellent Speaker, of exquisite Skill in the Civil Law, in Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, in natural Philosophy and Physick, in Divinity, and in a word, so richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished in all the Arts and Sciences, that the Muses themselves might be supposed to have taken up their Seat in him.<note place="margin">Smith's <hi>Device for a View be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>and the Queen.</hi>

               <p>And thus we see <hi>Smith</hi> re-enstated again in that Place which four and twenty Years ago he enjoyed under King <hi>Edward. Smith</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:100352:94"/>
now being Secretary, and <hi>Walsingham</hi> Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the <hi>French</hi> Court, and the matter of the Match for Duke <hi>D'Alenson</hi> and the Queen, transacted earnestly this Year, the main of this Matter went through <hi>Smith</hi>'s Hands. And thus it stood. The <hi>French</hi> King and Queen-Mother, and the Duke and that Court were extreamly eager for it, and so was the <hi>English</hi> Nation too; supposing it the best way for the Security of her Majesty and her Crown. But the Queen her self was but cold in the Matter. And when an Interview was moved between her and the Duke, she refused to yield to it upon some Scruples. Whereat Secretary <hi>Smith</hi> to set it forward, that it might not be suspended on such a Point, devised that the Duke should come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hither without the Ceremony of an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For as he wrote to <hi>Walsingham</hi> in <hi>August,</hi> he was sorry so good a Matter should upon so nice a Point be deferred.
Adding, <q>That one might say, that the Lover would do little, if he would not take pains once to see his Love, but she must first say Yea, before he saw her, or she him. Twenty Ways, said he, might be devised why he might come over and be welcome, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly do more in an Hour than he might in two Years [otherwise.] <hi>Cupido ille qui vincit omnia in oculos insidet, &amp; ex oculis ejaculatur, &amp; in oculos utrius<expan>

               <p>The <hi>Parisian</hi> Massacre happening in <hi>August,</hi> so treacherous and so inhumane, that all the World stood amazed at it, Secretary <hi>Smith</hi> abhorred, and wrote his Thoughts of it in this following Letter to <hi>Walsingham</hi> then Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador there;

                           </note> this Accident in <hi>France</hi> seemeth to us so strange, and beyond all Expectation, that we cannot tell what to say to it: And

the Excuse [<hi>tam Exilis,</hi>] <hi>so slender</hi> or fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, (namely, That the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have made some dangerous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbances in the Kingdom, and therefore the King was forced to do this for his own safety,) that we wot not what to think of it. The Matter appears all manner of ways so lamentable, the King so suddenly, and in one Day to have dispoiled himself and his Realm of so many notable Captains, so many brave Soldiers, so wise and so valiant Men, as, if they were unguilty of that which is laid unto them, it is most pitiful.

                  <p>I <hi>Most heartily thank you for the Book of the past Troubles in</hi> France. <hi>But alas! who shall now write worthily of the Treasons and Cruelties more barbarous than over the</hi> Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>used</hi>?</p>

                        </note>And in the same Month, when upon some Treachery feared to be acted upon <hi>Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> he was sent for home for some Time; and Tidings being brought of the Massacres upon the Protestants at <hi>Roan,</hi> and other Places, as well as at <hi>Paris</hi>; thus did this good Man express his Detestation of these Practices: The cruel Murthers of <hi>Roan</hi> are now long ago written unto us, when we thought all had been done. And by the same Letters was written unto us, that <hi>Diep</hi> was kept close, and the same Executions of the true Christians lookt for there, but as then not executed. Howbeit <hi>Sigoigne</hi> did warrant all our <hi>English</hi> Men to be out of danger, and not to be afraid. But what Warrant can the <hi>French</hi> make now? Seals and Words of Princes being Traps to catch Innocents and bring them to the Butchery. If the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and all those Martyred on that bloody <hi>Bartholomew</hi> Day, were guilty, why were they not apprehended, imprisoned, interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and judged; but so much made of as might be, within two Hours of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassination? Is that the manner to handle
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100352:96"/>
Men either culpable or suspected? So is the Journier slain by the Robber; so is the Hen of the Fox, so the Hind of the Lion, so <hi>Abel</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> so the Innocent of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so <hi>Abner</hi> of <hi>Ioab.</hi> But grant they were guilty, they dreamt Treason that night in their Sleep, what did the Innocents, Men, Women and Children at <hi>Lions?</hi> What did the Sucking Children, and their Mothers at <hi>Roan</hi> deserve, at <hi>Caen,</hi> at <hi>Rochel?</hi> What is done yet we have not heard; but I think shortly we shall hear. Will God, think you, still sleep? Shall not their Blood ask Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? Shall not the Earth be accursed that hath sucked up the innocent Blood poured out like Water upon it? I am most sorry for the King, whom I love, whom I esteem the most worthy, the most faithful Prince of the World; the most sincere Monarch now Living </q>[Ironically spoken no question by <hi>Smith,</hi> because to him that King used to profess so much Integrity.]</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>I am glad you shall come home; and would wish you were at home, out of that Country so contaminate with innocent Blood, that the Sun cannot look upon it, but to prognosticate the Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God. The Ruin and Desolation of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> could not come, till all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were either killed there, or expelled from thence.

And therefore to temperate, as you may perceive.

He mentioned two Letters withal to be sent by the same Dispatch into <hi>Ireland,</hi> for three Bishopricks void there, to which the Lord Deputy had recommended certain Persons as able and fit Men for those Places.

                     <hi>His Advice about the Earl of</hi> Desmond.</note> When in this Year, 1572. the Earl of <hi>Desmond</hi> was in <hi>England</hi> a Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but reconciled unto the Queen, and had promised to do her good Service in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and soon to drive out the Rebels out of the Country, the Queen and Court thought he would prove an honest and faithful Subject, and so resolved to dismiss him into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And she told Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> that she would give him at his Departure (the more to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige him,) a piece of Silk for his Apparel, and a reward in Money.
Upon which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Judgment was, <q>That seeing the Queen would tye the Earl to her Service with a Benefit, it would be done, <hi>Amplè, liberaliter ac prolixè, non malignè &amp; parcè,</hi> i. e. Nobly, liberally and largely, not grudgingly and meanly.

               <p>A Quarrel happened this Year between the Earl of <hi>Clanrichard</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Fitton,</hi> Governor of <hi>Connaught,</hi> who was somewhat

rigorous in his Office, which had caused the Rebellion of the Earl's Son. The Case came before the Deputy and Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at last to the Queen and her Council in <hi>England.</hi> Our Secretary drew up the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then each Party might say and prove the most and worst they could. But Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> thought it the best way for the Deputy to perswade them both to wrap up (as he exprest it) all things by-past, and to be Friends, as they had promised, it seems, to be at a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation formerly made before the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, and to joyn faithfully for the Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Queen's Majesty's Service, and the Quietness and good Order of the Country hereafter.

one to keep the People in the Blindness of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and the other to hood-wink them to believe, as it were by Prophesy, the speedy approaching Death of the Queen. The Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was now Lord President of the Council in the North. He employed two sharp Persons, to discover these Persons and their Doings. Which they did so effectually, that in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> many of these Conjurers and Massmongers were seized, and by the said Lord Presidents Order were brought up by them that seized them to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Smith,</hi> good store of their Books; which Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> seeing, called, <hi>Pretty Books and Pamphlets of Conjuring.</hi> They brought also to him an Account in Writing of their Travail and pains in this behalf. There was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended danger in these Practices. For the Papists earnestly longing for the Queen's Death had cast Figures, and consulted with unlawful Arts (which they mixt with their Masses) to learn when she should die, and who should succeed; and probably to cause her Death, if they could. This piece of Service there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Queen and Counsel took very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully at the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi>'s Hands.

                  <q>My very good Lord; the Pain, that the two, to whom you gave Commission, <hi>viz. Pain</hi> and <hi>Peg,</hi> have taken to seek out the Conjurers and Mass-mongers, is very well

accepted of by my Lords of the Council; and they willed me to give your Lordship, therefore their most hearty thanks. The Queen also not without great Contentation of her Highness, hath heard of your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ordering of those matters. The matters be referred touching the Massing, and such Disorders, to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the rest of the great Commission Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical. That which shall appear by Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to touch the State, and the Prince, to be referred again to my Lords of the Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                  </q>This was dated from <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> 
                  <date>Feb. 17. 1572.</date> But it was thought highly needful, that this dangerous Nest in the <hi>North</hi> should be searched more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for, and the Birds taken, that they might no more Exercise these evil Practices, or worse hereafter: The care of which was therefore committed by the Council to the Justices of those parts, out of some secret Favour, as it seems, in some of the Privy Counsellors to Papists. For those Justices were known well enough to be generally Popishly affected. Therefore it was the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Secretary, that these Justices would rather Cloak than Open, Excuse than Accuse them, who were worthy of Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; and very doubtful he was, whether they would hinder the Discovery of the Nest that would be broken. As he broke his Mind to the Lord Treasurer, who was of the same Judgment, and so also the Lord Chamberlain shewed himself to be, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100352:101"/>
with the Secretary. But the said Treasurer, who was for doing all things with <hi>Doulceur,</hi> and with as little opposition to others as could be, judged, that for this time the doings of these Justices should be tried; to which Opinion the Secretary did shew himself to condescend and agree. There came soon after to his hands more <hi>Indicia</hi> of these Conjurers, which were taken, and withall, a foul knot of Papistical Justices of Peace discovered, and of Massing Priests, which made him signify his judgment to the Lord Treasurer, that it would be well done, some of them should be sent for out of hand, and laid hold on, if they could be found: And accordingly Letters were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched into the <hi>North</hi> for that purpose.</p>
               <p>About this time it was that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was earnest with the Queen,<note place="margin">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100352:102"/>
his designs and Council to the Queen to succeed.</p>
               <p>For it is to be understood, that the Queen for the securing of her Affairs with respect to <hi>Scotland,</hi>

                  </note> had by her Interest there, procured the Earl of <hi>Morton</hi> a Protestant to be Regent of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But the Papists and Frenchified Party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted and took <hi>Edenburgh</hi> Castle; the reducing of which so expeditely before the <hi>French</hi> could come in to their assistance, was owing to the Managery of the Lord Treasurer and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary. His part was to urge the Queen to send speedy supply thither, and the Lord Treasurer would have Men, Ammunition and other Necessaries, and a Ship immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ready at <hi>Newcastle</hi> to go for <hi>Scotland,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Queen's Order: So about the 11<hi>th.</hi> or 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> the Secretary moved the Queen for aiding the said Regent to reduce that place into the young King's Hands. But she considered the Expence, and told <hi>Smith</hi> of a device she had to do it without any such charge, that is, by a Letter to be written, it seems, to them that held the Castle, thinking to bring them to yielding by some good words and promises. But this the Secretary shewed her the inconvenience of, namely, that it would be a protracting of time, being the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which they desired, that the <hi>French</hi> might have time to come to them with their Succours. He shewed her moreover, that now, the <hi>French</hi> King being thorowly occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was the best time to perform that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that was to be done; and in fine, she
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100352:102"/>
consented to his opinion; and shewed her self very well pleased with the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures making Provision in this mean while, to have Powder and a ship of <hi>Newcastle</hi> and other things necessary provided beforehand for the doing it, as the Secretary had signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to Her. And she told him, that upon that Lords coming to Court, (which then was at <hi>Greenwich</hi>) she would fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with him all those Matters to be set forward with speed.</p>
               <p>About this time were two <hi>Scotch</hi> men,<note place="margin">

But this the Secretary saw was but such Talk as might appear to be common in <hi>France.</hi> For that Nation, he said, was full of Babble and Words, and all for magnifying of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Threatning what they would do, rather than what they could do. These men who called themselves Merchants were search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Rye,</hi> and no Letters nor other things suspicious found about them. Yet the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary advised that Mr. <hi>Randal</hi> the Queens Ambassadour in <hi>Scotland,</hi> or some other who knew <hi>Scotch</hi> Manners and Matters better, should somewhat consider of them: and if there were no matters against them, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss them in his Mind were best.</p>

He was in a good forwardness of reducing <hi>Sarleboy</hi> to Obedience. For they had much Converse together, and came at length to Articles of Agreement. The main of which was, that he should be made a Denizon of <hi>England</hi> by the Queen, and hold his Land of her and him: and the same Privilege should the rest of his <hi>Scots</hi> enjoy. Paying to the Queen a yearly Rent in acknowledgement, and he to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Homager to Her by Oath, and so to be a faithful Subject, or else lose his Right.

Likewise he drew up a draught for explaining certain Words doubtful in the Indentures between the Queen and him and his Son. As, about his Sons soldiers, if they should Marry in that Country, as it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would. The Secretary entreated the Lord Treasurer to steal a little leisure to look these Writings over and correct them: so that he might make them ready for the Queens signing.

               <p>At Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s first coming hither he found some few that claimed themselves descended of <hi>English</hi> blood,<note place="margin">

For in <hi>March Anno exeunte,</hi> (his Son being but newly, if yet, dead) there were <hi>Harrington, Clark</hi> and some others, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers on this Design, that gave certain Summs of Money for Lands there to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them. In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> 1572, the Ships, Captains and Soldiers were
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100352:106"/>
ready to be wasted over: When unhappily some Persons concerned had started some new Matter in regard of the Bargain. Which put a stop to their Departure. And one <hi>Edward Higgins</hi> the Chief of the Gentlemen and Captains that were going over, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this generous Expedition, was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for want of the money agreed upon. Hence it came to pass that the Captains lay at great Charges, when their Ships, Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Soldiers were ready, and they did nothing but dispend their Money. This troubled Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> not a little; as appears by a Letter he wrote to one Mrs. <hi>Penne,</hi> a Gentlewoman that had an Influence upon some of these Persons that made the stop. To whom therefore Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, praying her to call upon them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider at what Charge the Captains did lie, and to do what she could in any wise to help them away. Whereby she should do the Queens Majesty good service, and him and them great Pleasure. It being a matter, said he, which indeed for the goodness of it, I take much to heart.

                  </note>For, as I have been informed by some of that Worshipful Family, Sir <hi>William Smith</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and Heir to our Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> was meerly tricked out of it, by the Knavery of a <hi>Scot,</hi> one <hi>Hamilton,</hi> (who was once a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, tho' afterwards made a Person of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) with whom the said Sir <hi>William</hi> was acquainted.

And this <hi>Hamilton</hi> did craftily, thinking, that if he should have begged it all for himself, he might perhaps have failed of success, being so great a Thing, but that he might well enjoy a Part, especially with the Concurrence and

Interest of some of the Powerful men about the King, when they begged for themselves. And never after could Sir <hi>William Smith,</hi> nor any of his Posterity recover it.

To trace him a little in his Pains and Diligence. To them he devoted himself even to quite Tyring, after he had been a year or two exercised therein. For when once in the year 1574. he had a few Play-days, and was ready to go home to his House in <hi>Essex,</hi> he told his Friends, that <hi>he was thorowly weary, tam Animo quam Corpore, and could scarce endure any longer.</hi> And tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> which increas'd his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness was the Queens Wariness, for she did not use to be hasty in Dispatch of Matters, which was <hi>Smith</hi>'s great Desire should not hang in hand.
This he would call among
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100352:108"/>
his intimate Friends the Queens <hi>Irresolution</hi>; and in some Heat (as he was somewhat hasty and quick in his Temper) complained at this time to the Lord Treasurer, <q>That it was sometimes So, and sometimes No; and in all times uncertain, and ready to Stays and Revocation.</q> And sometimes she would not be spoken with upon Business, and Access to the Queen was clean shut up.
Which made him between jest and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest say, <q>That he thought her Majesty sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that he would chide, as he dared: But indeed, he said, that he could not but Lament, and complain of this her Irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; which did weary and kill her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, destroy her Actions, and overthrew all good Designs and Counsels.</q> And again in this Discontent he cryed out, <q>I wait while I have neither Eyes to see, nor Legs to stand upon.

                  </note> that the Queen had commanded the Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> and Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton,</hi> her chief Favourites, to forbear moving suits to her. And when the Secretary went to her with private Suits, he could get neither Yea nor Nay.
And if these Two aforesaid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were forbidden to move Suits, <q>Then said he, had we need within a while to have a Horse or an Ass to carry Bills after us, encreasing daily and never dispatched, as he angerly and wittily spake to one of his

The Queen resolved and revoked her Resolutions again. This created the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary a great deal of Vexation.

                  </note>Thus the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Plat stuck with the Queen. But about 10 or 12 days passing in <hi>March,</hi> the Secretary comforted himself by the Perswasion that she was come to a full Resolution to go forward with it, without any going back, and that she would send for him and signifie the same to him. And had it indeed been so, to use the Secretaries Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Realm and she had past a great and troublesome Ague, and especially the Lord Treasurer and himself, and such others as they, who had Doings in that Matter. But the Queen took respite again, until she heard
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100352:109"/>
again from the Lord Treasurer. Whereat the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary was so bold as to tell her, that she knew his Lordships Mind full many times told her before.
And this he signified unto that Lord, and in Conclusion told him, <q>That Coming unsent for to have Resolution, he was sent back again without Resolution. He prayed God to send it that Night, or to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And added, that it was high time to resolve one Way or other.

                     <hi>Conference between the Queon and her Secretary about</hi> Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</note> (<hi>Anno incipiente</hi>) Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and the Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> got the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>'s Business to come to a Resolution. Which was, to send a good supply, with a Plat how he was to manage himself. The Queen had first entred into a discourse one night with her Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary about <hi>Ireland,</hi> and declared her dislike of the Enterprise of <hi>Ulster,</hi> for default of them who should execute it, asking him what Men of Counsel or Wisdom there were, into whose Hands might be committed so great a Mass of Money, and so great a Charge as should be sent. The Secretary answered her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, That the Counsel, what and how to do herein, was already taken. And that a Plat was laid down by my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> and allowed of by the Lord Deputy and Council there, and liked of by the Lords of her Council here; as she her self had heard of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:100352:110"/>
the Lords, and all their Reasons; so that, said he, whereas it is said <hi>Priusquam incipias, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulto,</hi> that had been Maturely and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately done. And to which, as he subjoyned, her Highness by Letters to the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> had given her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And now there rested nothing but, <hi>Ubi consulueris mature opus est facto,</hi> To which her Majesty had set a good Beginning, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Warrant for the half Years Charges. Now, said Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> Counsels be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Old men, Grave men and full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and at home; the Execution is to be done by young men, Captains and Soldiers abroad.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>And tho Earl of</hi> Essex.</note> And, said he, my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> hath shewed great Wisdom, Courage and Boldness hitherto, and brought it to a very good Pass for a beginning; And now having more Experience, and <hi>Malby</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captains with him of Courage, it was to be hoped that he should bring it to a good End. Yea, said the Queen, but who hath he with him but <hi>Malby?</hi> Shall I trust so great a Matter to him, and such a Mass of Money? Who shall have the Charge of it, and the laying out of it? Madam answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Secretary, the Money is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Treasurer there; and upon his Accounts to be employed upon the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Soldiers for their Wages and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and upon Fortifications. If he do keep his Plat, then he followeth that which the Wisest Heads of the Counsellours in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> think fit and best to be done. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:100352:110"/>
he deceiveth them, and your Highness, and most of all himself. Which it is not likely that he should, and I trust he will not do. But the Queen still harped upon that string, that there was lacking able Ministers, and shewed her self notwithstanding at this Discourse desirous to consult with the Treasurer.</p>
               <p>But tho' the Commission and Order for the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi>

Whereupon the Secretary entreated the Treasurer, whose Opinion she greatly valued in Matters of State, that he would perswade her to think no more of it till <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> that is till half a year were past. And by that Time he trusted she should see such good success, that she should be glad; and sorry only that it was not set upon before. Thus earnestly did Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> solicite his Royal Mistress for the Good of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and labour'd to release and satisfie her Mind anxious about her successes, and loth to part with her Money, without fair Probability of succeeding. And perhaps he was the more earnest herein, the safety and good Estate of his Lands in the <hi>Ardes</hi> depending upon this Expedition of that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord.</p>

                  </note> procured an Act to pass for the Universities, and the two Colleges of <hi>Eaton</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi>; (for which his Memory will be always dear to Scholars) which was, that a third part of the Rent upon Leases made by Colleges, should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Corn, paying after the Rate of Six Shillings and Eight pence the Quarter, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for good Wheat, and Five Shillings a Quarter or under for good Malt. This Corn the Tenants were yearly to deliver to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges either in Kind or in Money, as the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges pleased, after the Rate of the best Wheat and Malt in the Markets of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> at the day prefixed for the Payment thereof.<note place="margin">

Where many could not conceive, how this would be at all profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Colleges; but still the same on the Point, whether they had it in Money or Wares. But the Knight took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the present cheapness; knowing hereafter Grain would grow dearer, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind daily multiplying, and Licence being lately given for Transportation. So that at this day much Emolument redouudeth to the Colleges in each University, by the passing of this Act; and tho' their Rents stand still, their Revenues do encrease.</q>

As it is a Thing that is wont to create a true Friendship, I mean the Proportion and Likeness of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, so it is not without Remark, that Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> and the Lord Treasurer <hi>Burghley,</hi> their Distempers were the same. And which was more remakable still, they used to seize upon these two Persons at the same Time. Their Distemper was a Rheum.
<q>The Rheum, as he wrote to the same Lord, which is my natural Enemy, is commonly wont to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100352:113"/>
me most, when your Lordship is also grievously troubled with yours.</q> For <hi>April</hi> 22d. 1576. at which time the Lord <hi>Burghley</hi> was very ill of his Distemper, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> wrote him a Letter, that he was then seized with his. And, which was an ill Sign, whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it used to take him either in his Jaw, or Teeth, or in the Lower Body with Loosness, and all over with Sweat, now it fastned it self in his Throat and Tongue; and would not by any Art be removed. So that he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most out of Hope of any Amendment; but clearly without Hope of any speedy Help; tho' he never took so much Advice, as he wrote, nor used so many Physicians, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served so much their Rules; which he styled their <hi>Preciseness.</hi>
                  <q>But when all is done, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he piously, that man may, or ought to do, the Sequel and Event of Health, and the End of Life is in Gods Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. That which he shall appoint is best to me. Surely all is one, being as willing now to Die, as to Live: and I trust (with Gods Mercy and Hope therein) as ready. For it grieveth me to Live unserviceable to my Prince, and unprofitable to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Heavy and unpleasant to my self. For what Pleasure can a man have of my years, when he cannot speak as he would: [For his chief Grief was in Eating, and Drinking, and Speaking; and in the last especially] While his Legs, he said, his Hands, his Memory and his Wit, served as much as need be desired.</q>

Which was to this Tenor; That he had put himself into the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians hands; and they according to their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, first fell to Purging him, to free his Body from peccant Humours as a Preparato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to other Physic. A Practice which he did not like of, because it would make a great
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100352:115"/>
Disturbance of the whole Body, and affect the Parts that were well, and in a good State. And so indeed it happened to him. For this Physic put his whole Body, and all the Parts of it, into a Commotion and Indisposition: When it was perfectly well before, as appeared by his Urine, and by his own Feeling and Apprehension of himself. But after he had taken this Preparatory Physic, there was no part of his Body, which was not brought out of Frame. His Urine so troubled, so high coloured, and so confused: Which did bespeak a Seditious Rout of Humours raised in his Body, as he spake. This being a little setled, they gave him a Pill, which was as insuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful as the other. For it gave him scarcely a Stool; and that with abundance of Wrack and Torment, and left such an unpleasant and bitter Relish in the Stomach, that he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to vomit it up again. The next Course that was taken with him, was Shaving his Head, and wearing a Cap: Which one Dr. <hi>Langton</hi> was the chief Prescriber of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of Excellent Use for those that were troubled with great Rheums: And was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self present, when it was laid on. The Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect whereof was to be seen after Eight or Ten Days. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> was very unsatisfied with his Physicians, who for two or three Months had been thus tampering with his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and with no manner of success; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he was for a speedier Work; and declared himself of the <hi>Smiths</hi> mind, his Namesake in <hi>Plato,</hi> who willed the Physician to give him

these he gave also upon Condition, that they chained them up in their Library, or did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute them among the Fellows, such as would best Occupy them.

It might be <hi>Astraea,</hi> said he, now peaking out afar in the North, to see what Revenge shall be done upon so much innocent Bloud shed in <hi>France,</hi> at a marriage Banquet, and reer Suppers after it. Yet that it would be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him, to understand what their Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers, and Heaven-gazers there did judge of it. He added, that if he were not so much occupied as he was, he would turn over all his old Books, but he would say something of it himself, and guess by chance, even as wisely as they; tho' he would not publish it but to his Friends.</q> 
                  <hi>Walsingham</hi> in Answer to this of the Secretary, sent him certain Notes, and a new Book from <hi>France,</hi> of this new Comet.

He observed more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the printed Book went upon it <hi>Suspens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pede:</hi> and prayed the Ambassador, that if any had writ upon it more boldly, he might see it. He added further, that our Men did not deny that it arose in that Degree of <hi>Pisces,</hi> or the first of <hi>aurus,</hi> but that it was
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100352:124"/>
one thing to rise with the Degree of the <hi>Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack,</hi> and to stand in a place after Section of the <hi>Zodiack</hi>; and that our Men did find him far above the Moon, and above the height of the Sphere of <hi>Venus.</hi> And then it could not be a Temporary Comet.
Concluding, <q>Now things above the Moon do rise and die, which was never believed afore, but either a new Star mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

III. Of the right and correct Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. Both these last mentioned were published by himself in <hi>Latin,</hi> when he was Ambassador in <hi>Paris.</hi> There is a Fourth Book lately Printed, <hi>viz.</hi> 1685. which some make him the Author of, namely, Of the Authority, Form and Manner of holding Parliaments. Other Tracts there be of his, that have lain hitherto unpublished, As his Orations about the Queens Marriage; His discourse of Money, and his Tables for the reducing the <hi>Roman</hi> Coins to the just <hi>English</hi> Standard. I have also seen another large Writing, which by the hand seems to be his, shewing certain ways and means for the taking care of, and for the maintaining the Poor of the Nation. And many more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as yet, neither the sight, nor the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Subjects have come unto me. To which I add several excellent Letters of his when Ambassador in <hi>France</hi> to the Lord <hi>Burghley,</hi> and being Secretary of State to Sr. <hi>Francis Walsing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Ambassador in the same Court, which are Printed in the <hi>Compleat Ambassador.</hi> And
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100352:126"/>
a Bundle of other Letters writ to the Court, when he was Ambassador with the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Ann.</hi> 1562. the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> going then in the famous Expedition to <hi>New-haven,</hi> which are yet reserved in the Kings Paper House.</p>

                  </note> and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were often made to him for his Judgment in Matters of that Nature. So Dr. <hi>Haddon</hi> appealed once to him in a sharp Controversie, between the <hi>French</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and himself, Whether <hi>Tully</hi> were a good Lawyer: Which that Ambassador had denied.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100352:127"/>
by a Letter, that he had sent it to <hi>Walden</hi> to be Transcribed; least the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and the whole Invention should perish to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And <hi>Haddon</hi> being lately dead, <hi>Smith</hi> in the same Letter told <hi>Ascham,</hi> that his Epistles were found, but not all, and that his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles to <hi>Haddon,</hi> were more uncertain. For they reckoned it pity any thing of that most Humane and Learned Friend of theirs should be lost. And so there was a purpose to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect together his Epistles, and to publish them. And so they were afterwards by <hi>Hatcher</hi> of <hi>Cambridge.</hi> This <hi>Ascham</hi> about the Year 1568. sent an Astronomical Figure to <hi>Smith,</hi> drawn by some ingenious Astronomer of the said <hi>Ascham</hi>'s Acquaintance. Upon which he sent a <hi>Latin</hi> Letter from <hi>Mounthaut,</hi> thanking <hi>Ascham</hi> for it, and declaring how much he was pleased with it, and that he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be acquainted with the Person that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed it. He acknowledged he professed himself this Study. And this Person seemed to him, to write Ingeniously and Learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and not according to the vulgar manner of unlearned men, who abused themselves, and the opinion of their Learning, for Gain. Whose Friendship he declared he desired not, and whose Familiarity he was averse to. And the Diagram and Figure that <hi>Ascham</hi> sent, he dispatched back to him, with his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same, as it was put or placed. Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> Erected a Figure concerning the same Hour and Day, according to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meris</hi> of <hi>Ioh. Stadius.</hi> Of which he said the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100352:127"/>
Diagram seemed a little a differ, but the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not so much. Thus we see his Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence; and withal his Disposition to that kind of Study, of Judicial Astrology.</p>

                  </note> of the great Opinion that went of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>'s Learning, I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Passage. When Dr. <hi>Wilson,</hi> one of his Learned Friends, Master of S. <hi>Katharine</hi>'s, and afterwards Secretary of State, had for News wrote to <hi>Haddon,</hi> then Ambassador at <hi>Bruges,</hi> of the Queens going to Visit the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity of <hi>Oxford, Anno</hi> 1565. and of the Report of the great Learning in that Place, and what learned Exercises were then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be performed there, before her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; <hi>Haddon</hi> answered, not to disparage that Noble University, or the complete Scholars that were there, but to take the Opportunity of commending one or two other Egregious men, <hi>viz.</hi> That however magnificently it was talked of the learned men there, <hi>Nec Smith: ibi simile quicquam, aut Checi occurret,</hi> i.e. <hi>there would be nothing like to</hi> Smith <hi>or</hi> Cheke.</p>

                  </note> so it happened to him. For his Excellences created him Envy, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viers. And some there were in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s time, that laid several gross Vices to his charge, but most unjustly: As tho' he were proud, a Lover of Money, and that for the sake of it, he extorted and opprest; that he was a Buyer and Seller of Spiritual Preferments; and chopt and changed Lands. Finally, that in the Changes of Religion, he was a Complier. But these were all most false Calumniations: but such as he was fain to write some Sheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to vindicate himself of: whereby he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to set forth his own Vertues unwillingly.</p>
               <p>His Spirit was brave and great,<note place="margin">

by designing men for private Profit, or secret Grudge.
And so I find him somewhere describing himself, when Haughtiness was once laid to his Charge, <q>I cannot deny, but I am of Nature hault of Courage and stomach, to contemn all Perils, and worldly things, or Dangers to do my Master Service, and likely more would be, but that I am by such things [he means Accusations and Slanders] some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time plucked back; and so again contented to rule my self: being able I thank God to serve in the Body and Thilles (as Carters call it) as well as in the Room of a Forehorse.</q>

                  </note>His Apparel was usually good, and like a Courtier. For which he thought some might accuse him of too much Prodigality. But it was more to suit the Office wherein he served, than any Pleasure he took in gaudy Garments. He never sued any man,<note place="margin">

                  </note> nor ever was sued. He never raised any Rents, but contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the old ones; neither of any of his Lands or Promotions, viz. <hi>Eaton</hi> and <hi>Carlisle</hi>: nor heightned any Fines, nor ever put out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tenant, nor ever sued any of them. He was in a Place, namely that of Master of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, wherein he might have received many Bribes, if he would, for dispatching Sutes, and selling the Lord Protectors Letters; but he challenged all the World to charge him with one Peny, that he had taken dishonestly. Two indeed of his Servants did use sometimes to do so: but when it came to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he put them away: Acquainting the Protector with it, and sueing to him to have
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100352:135"/>
one of their Ears nayled to the Pillory. And none Living remained under more Dispeasure with him, than they did, only for that Crime, and no other.</p>
               <p>In fine, he was of an Universal Charity and good Will,<note place="margin">

I pray you, that do note my Opinion so strange, a while suspend your Judgments of me, until you have heard al my Reasons which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me to take this part.</p>
                  <p>First I say, that in this Matter either we must have respect to God, to the Prince her Self, or to the Commonwealth; or rather to al these. For as for vain Talk of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100352:144"/>
People, and the common Opinion of every Man in this our Disputation, I think little regard to be had to them. For neither I speak in Pulpit before all Rascalls that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor I do reason with such, as I must needs say as they say, or else hold my Peace: but with them who wil look to have no further Credit to be given to their Authority and Mind, than just Reason doth require. And therefore to Godwards yee must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes, that Virginity is above Matrimony which Christ himself being our Head, King and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster did follow. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> allowing both thone and thother, Marriage I mean, and the Sole Life, yet preferreth the sole Life far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Matrimony. And I cannot see, that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any Distinction or Difference, whether they be Men or Women, Young or Old, Princes or Subjects, Rulers or private Persons: but as in Bondage or Freedom, whether it be of Men or Women, Young or Old, he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Liberty, not excluding Bondage from the Gospel: So doth he rather allow and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort unto, and wish tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Men would chuse and take hold of Virginity and sole Life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Marriage, with such <hi>Elogium</hi> as would seem slanderous, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it were not of his speaking. <hi>The Virgin,</hi> saith he, <hi>and single Man have care how they should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lease God.</hi> The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Woman hath chosen infinite ways the worse Person to be pleased, and the sole Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the better. Wherefore as I did say at the beginning, to define what is good and most for the Queen, if we shall try it by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100352:144"/>
best, truest and more sure Ballance, that is to Godwards, St. <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to be with me: and the example of Christ himself, and his most happy Mother, St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Heads of our Christian Religion, who ensued that kind of Life as best and most acceptable to Godwards.</p>
                  <p>You see I do not bring you Histories of certain Emperors and Empresses, Kings and Queens married, who notwithstanding their Marriage, yet lived continently; lest perhaps you should doubt of the Truth of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Or if the History were true, yet of the Perfection and Sincerities of the Persons: Or whether therin they pleased God, altho it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them best. Nor yet I bring in that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Names of Virgins and Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, which at the very Beginning of Christs Religion professed and kept Chastity, as a thing, whereby they thought most to please God, and made their choice of that as of the most godly Life: Lest peradventure with the evil Example again of the Nonns, Monks and Friars of our Days, who likewise have as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily vowed, and yet so lewdly have and do keep the same, you should have occasion to derogate Faith from all the rest, but sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly and of Principles most certain I have proved, that to God the best, most commendable and most allowable Life of these two, is to be sole and chast.</p>
                  <p>It is hard, ve will say, in that Liberty, Ease and Plenty of all things, which Monarchy and Princely State doth bring, to keep modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100352:145"/>
and much more to keep Chastity. Mary, the harder the better, and as the Greek Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>that which is laudable is hard to attain,</hi> Ye be al learned and know <hi>Hesiods</hi> Verse; What is that that men may take up by Heaps, and case me by? And how streit and hard a Path is left to creep to Vertue? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we speak of the Goodness of a thing, or compare which of the Two is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Hardness is no Objection but rather a Proof of the Goodness thereof. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am yet in that Part, which is to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Why shall I go any further than Christs saying, who willed us to enter in at the streight Gate, where few go in, and to leave the easy way, where there be many gon, and going before, which bringeth eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction? But I think this Part enough pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, till I hear the contrary of you.</p>
                  <p>The next that I promised you to take in hand was, that to the Prince her self this is the best. First, either all the Women in the World do wonderfully dissemble, or, els bringing forth of Children (besides the often Irksomeness, Loathsomeness of Meats, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of strange Meats, Morfew, and other such Troubles that they have al the Time from the Conception to the Childbirth) they be in such Danger of Death as at no time Men be more. For we se by common Order, they are wont to take the Communion, to take their leave of the Church, and prepare themselves even to it as Persons that were neither Alive nor Dead, but betwixt both.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100352:145"/>
And al I am sure do not dissemble. For I pray you what number of Women every houre even in their Travail, or shortly after, be dispatched, and sent from their Childbed to their Burial? Not only poor Folks Wives, in whom Negligence or Poverty might have some excuse, but Countesses, Dutchesses, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses and Queens. Farther Examples we need not seek than the Mother of our late K. <hi>Edward, Q. Iane,</hi> and of the Q. Dowager <hi>Katharin Parr.</hi> I can compare the danger of Childbed to nothing more aptly, than to a foughten Battail, save that there is this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that in foughten Battails, the Prince by thold Examples, as one saith of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> provide for themselves out of the Foreward and most Danger: But in this, whatsoever Estate they be, Queen or Empress, she must fight with Death Hand to Hand. There is no Champion to stand betwixt, or to bestride them, when they are down, or to take the Stroke into their Bodies to defend them, as hath been done before this by faithful E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>squires, to the safety of their Prince. And if the faithful Friends of <hi>David,</hi> after he was at one time by chance in great Hazzard in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foughten Battail, would not suffer him in Person to come no more into Battail, lest peradventure (as they said) the Light of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> should be quenched; How should I think, that I should have so much regard to the Queens Persons as they had to <hi>Davids,</hi> if I should not also with and desire, yea, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil too, that her Grace should never enter into
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100352:146"/>
that Danger and Battail, wherein she her self hand to hand, and without Aid, must Fight with Death himself a more perillous Fight than is any set Battail. And if her Majesly be fruitful (as there is no Cause to think the contrary) then if she escape one, she must within one year, or a little more, prepare for the next, and so still be within the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of that Extremity, which I do tremble to think upon. Wel may I think, as a great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man (altho merrily) writeth, that unless God had given a certain notable Quantity of Foolishness and Forgetfulness to al Women, after once they had assayed the Pains and Travails and Danger of Childbirth, they would never company with Men again. For altho Souldiers, who put their Life to sale for mony, do not fear to continue war and skirmishes, and will adventure at the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Commandment hardily upon the Spear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to win or loose; And altho some War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Princes, as <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> thought themselves never so wel, as when they had sowen one War upon another, and were courageously in the Field themselves; yet can it not be denyed, but it had been more safty to their Persons to have lived quietly and justly at home with their own, and made Peace with their Neighbours. Nor tho they dyed at home amongst their Friends, thone by Surfeit, thother by Conspiracy; yet can it not be understanded by the common Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that they were in more Danger in the Battail: and so the Success we must leave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100352:146"/>
to Destyny and Gods Judgments. What is by the common Course of Causes, thereof we may conclude, as far as natural Reason and Mans wisdom will go.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in my Mind, the Queens High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Person, by course of Nature, being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject (as al Mortal Mens and Womens <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e) to Feavers, Plurisies, to Pestilence, to the Sweat, and infinite other sorts of Sicknesses and Diseases, which the Physicians can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ibe, from the which whensoever it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth God to send them (as I pray God long to keep her from them) no mans Power can rescue her; methinks willingly and witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bring in one other, which shall be as dangerous as any one, or al those, it is not the part of him that professeth a Care of her Highness Person.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have spoken of her Person, but as touching the Body (nevertheles by her <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> I mean all such Things as touch her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly: and altho it is now hard to make a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of this, but that which toucheth her Person should also touch al the whole Realm; yet because I speak amongst you, whom I know to be both Learned and Wise, ye will I dare say take what I mean by the Order of my Talk) Let us grant that her Majesty doth Marry, if he be a Subject, then she should seem to disparage her self. For what shall she do other than that which is found fault with in certain Dutchesses and Countesses, which have married with those which were their Servants. If she marry a Stranger, then must
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100352:147"/>
he needs by Gods Laws be her Head, and where she was highest before, now she hath made one higher than her self. If she study to please him, then is she in Subjection of him: If she mind not to please him, why should she then marry him? And this is the best. But if there should arise any Dissension betwixt her Majesty and her Husband, and Part-takings who should rule, as there hath been ere this in other Countreys; what a Misery shall her Majesty bring her self unto from so great a Felicity? To what a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes from so great a Quietness? Now al dependeth upon her only Wil and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. She only commandeth, and it is done. She saith the Word, and every one obeyeth. Then is no Grace to be looked for, but at her Husbands hands only. Then there shall be two to sue unto, tho not equal, yet such as each of other would not like well to have a Nay. So that their Requests one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall be as it were Commandments of thone to thother. So that if the good and loving Wife loth to displease her Husband, and the loving Husband his Wife, when one of them shall ask and require of the other that which thother would not gladly do, if it be not done, who is displeased, ye perceive; And if it be done, who is aggrieved ye se. And so much the more as thone desireth in his or her mind to have it don, thother in his or her mind, that it should not be done; so much the more Grief the Granting doth bring to thone, and so much more Hatred and Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100352:147"/>
the Denying doth bring unto thother.</p>
                  <p>As for Example sake, it K. <hi>Philip</hi> desired most earnestly we should make War with the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and Q. <hi>Mary</hi> desired no less to live in Quiet, and to have Peace with them, (the Husband and the Wife in most contrary Appetites) the Granting extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved thone, the Denyal should as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely have offended thother. Of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what followed we know. But ye wil say, this was when a Foreign Prince did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Queen, who having War of his own with the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> must needs desire his Wifes Country for Loves-sake to joyn with him. And this Realm having Wounds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at home, had good Cause to mislike War abroad. But if her Grace marry one of her own here at home, there shall be no such Occasion, you wil say, but their Minds shall be al one; whom thone loveth thother lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth also, and whom the one misliketh, so wil thother also. This is wholly assured, if it were always so; but seeing never Man was always in one Mind himself continually, nor yet Woman, but that which at one time we love, another time we hate; what we like being Children, we mislike being Men and Women, and much more when we be old; How can we think, that any Man or Woman may be always of one Opinion, Mind, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Desire with another, where he is not so with himself?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Conveniet nulli, qui secum dissidet ipse,</hi> saith the old Verse. And what Mischiefs

                  </p>
                  <p>And first, I will begin with the <hi>Goths,</hi> when they were Lords over <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Italy, Amula Suinta,</hi> or as some do write her <hi>Amala Suen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> the Daughter of K. <hi>Theodoricus,</hi> King of <hi>Rome</hi> and al <hi>Italy,</hi> and so rightfally Heir of that Kingdom, to govern the Realm the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, took to her Husband <hi>Theodotus,</hi> a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the <hi>

                        </gap>oths</hi>; who belike afterwards dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting with her in Opinion of Matters of the State, first found the means to exile her into a little Island in a Lake besides <hi>Vossinana</hi> in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and afterwards there caused her to be most cruelly slain. <hi>Philippe</hi> Vicecount of <hi>Milain</hi> being at a very low Ebb, by Marriage of <hi>Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice</hi> wife to <hi>Fantino Cane,</hi> had the Lordships and Seignories of <hi>Vercelli, Alexandria, Navar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Cortana,</hi> four goodly Cities, &amp; a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Riches. Thereby he recover'd again the State of <hi>Milain</hi> and <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lost. This man to recompence her Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and al these Benefits, within a short while after caused her to be convicted of Adultery and cruelly to be put to death. <hi>Iane</hi> the 2d. Queen of <hi>Naples</hi> did otherwise. She took to Husband <hi>Iaques</hi> Countie <hi>de la Nardy,</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Kings Blood: with whom she indent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he should be contented to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prince <hi>Tarento,</hi> and to leave to her not only the Name, but also the Government of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi> This liked not he, or els his Counsillors, and so remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100352:148"/>
her from Administration, and kept her almost as a Prisoner. She, like a wise Woman, feigned to rejoyce thereat, and to bear it well until such time, as she had compassed all her Device, and shut him clean out of <hi>Naples.</hi> For which Cause, altho' he made War, yet was he sain, at the last, (willed he, nilled he) to live as a Man banished out of that Realm.</p>
                  <p>I have read of many, being Sole Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Princesses of many Countrys, which after took unto them Husbands, who had no better success, tho' not all so evil. Even in our days, Q. <hi>Mary</hi> took K. <hi>Philip</hi> to her Husband, a Noble Prince, Wise, Discreet and Fortunate. Yet many Men think, that thereby she lost the Hearts of the most num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her Subjects. And it is too manifest, that immediately upon it, in a very short space, an incredible number of her Subjects were, by order of such Law and Justice as was used in those Days, most cruelly put to Death. And God for his part, whether offended that she so living Sole, and as may be thought a Virgin, did so suddenly choose to marry, or rather that she finding the Light of the Gospel abroad in her Realm, did what she could to Extinguish it and put it out, did so punish the Realm with Quartan Agues, and other such long and new Sicknesses, that in the two last years of her Reign, so many of her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were made away, what with the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

Then was Burning and Hanging at Home, Wars and Losing of Strong Holds Abroad: Most Men discontent, except a few of her Sect: with Subsidies and Loans, Sicknesses and Promooters, as well th'one as th'other throughly vexed. War we saw and felt, and other Mischief was feared: which, whether it was to come, or no, few know. Now, for War we have Peace; for Fear, Security. So, tho' even the Papists, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' otherwise they lost for their Stiffness, yet they be more sure of their Lives now, by the Clemency of the Time, than they were then by the importune Favour of the Prince. For Scarcity we have reasonable Plenty:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100352:149"/>
for Brass-Mony, good Silver: For Servitude, Liberty. What can a Common-wealth desire more, than Peace, Liberty, Quietness, little taking of base Mony, few Parliaments, their Coin amended, Friendship with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, War with no Man; either to follow the Gospel, or Security of Life, if they will be Papists? Except, peradventure, we should seem to do as <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Frogs did, which, not content with the King which <hi>Iupiter</hi> gave them, knowing them to need none, were weary of their Liberty, and would not rest till they had also the <hi>Stork</hi> and <hi>Hearn</hi> for their Kings. From whom now, with all their Cryes these many Thousand years, they cannot be delivered.</p>
                  <p>Well, yet for the Wars, and such Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Feats, it is most convenient to have a Man, who should Govern abroad, take upon him the Spear and Shield, be there in Presence himself; which is marvellous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Souldier, to Fight in the Sight of the Prince, where he thinks his Reward shall be according to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts. And, as a great Warrior said, I had rather have an Army of <hi>Harts,</hi> their General being a <hi>Lyon,</hi> than an Army of <hi>Lyons,</hi> their General being an <hi>Hart.</hi> First, I do not see that every Prince maketh his War himself there in Presence, nor that every one of them is that <hi>Lyon</hi> which they speak of. And if it be in a Country where Peace may be had, and the Realm so well

the poor Subjects, they make a Greater and more Commendable Conquest than ever <hi>Sylla,</hi> or <hi>Marius, Pompeius</hi> or <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> did, yea, or <hi>Carolus</hi> the last Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> in taking the <hi>French</hi> King, or winning <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Goleta.</hi> And if VVars should happen to come, why may not the Queen make and maintain her Wars as well by a General of her appointing, sought out by her Wisdom, as all other Princes commonly do? And <hi>Plutarchus</hi> doth well note, that <hi>Augustus</hi> himself had small ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in all Wars, wherein he had the Conduct himself, as himself also was in great danger: but those which he did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage by Legats and Generals, all did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper well and fortunately with him.</p>
                  <p>But of Wars we have spoken enough: wherein it is no more need that the Prince should be in Presence, than it is that all the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> now, or the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> in times past should always have been in Presence and Person in their Wars. For it is their Wit and Policy, their Fore-seeing and VVisdom, as well in maintaining of the War, as in chusing of their Captain, that obtaineth the Victory. And I pray you, did not th'one Conquer as much, and doth not th'other keep as well their Conquest, as ever <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Successors did? Then it may appear it is not the Presence, but the Wisdom of the Prince, the Manly Look, but the Sober Discretion; the Beard, but
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100352:151"/>
the Chearful Heart that bringeth the Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and keepeth the Land conquested. And this, I say, may as well be in a Queen as in a King, in a Wise and Discreet Lady unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as in any Husband she shall take unto her.</p>
                  <p>One thing must I needs say; if it be chargeable for a Realm to maintain one Prince or King, it must needs be more chargeable for a Realm to maintain two. If they cry out of the Takers for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for one House or Train, for two they shall have more cause. And do you think that whensoever the Queens Majesty shall take an Husband, the Court can be unaug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented? I am sure Reason, Order and Experience sheweth the contrary. Well, if the greater Train bring the more Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the more Officers do require the more Charge; the greater Family doth consume the larger Provision of Victuals. And if the Realm, as Reason it is, must bear all these, and yet all things done as well now as it shall be then, I cannot but conclude, even of Husbanding, but as good Husbands do, that the Affairs of the Realm being as well done th'one way as th'other, the best cheap must appear the best way. Which is as ye see, that the Queens Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty should remain as she doth now still Sole, and unmarried, neither intangle her self with a Husband, either strange, or born in the Realm.</p>

                  <p>And with this he held his Peace, and none of the other were hasty to answer.

It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was moved with this Oration; For with much ado he brought out his Words. The effect whereof was this. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, quoth he, this is a Tale indeed, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments well picked out. You may well be called Mr. <hi>Agamus,</hi> or <hi>Misogamos,</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named in right English, <hi>Wedspite,</hi> or <hi>Spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed.</hi> For I never heard Man speak so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitefully against Wedding and Marriage of the Queens Majesty in my Life. I think you be one of St. <hi>Frauncis,</hi> or St. <hi>Benets</hi> Scholars. I would to God my Tongue would serve me but half so well as yours, I would ask no help to answer you. But now, seeing my Tongue will not follow, I shall desire these Two to take my part: Who, altho' with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themselves, they be not of one Opinion, yet with me, against you, they agree.

Two things being, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be had in Election, if the one be honest, th'other dishonest, the Election is easy to him that preferreth Vertue and Honesty to all other things, altho' the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honest be more profitable, or more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant ten thousand fold. For always that which is honest and godly is to be taken. And yet possibly this Election would not be so taken of every Man; as hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them that have made War to their Country, Proscription of their Citizens, and have exercised a thousand Tyrannies, for Ambition, Profit, or Pleasures-sake, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the Dishonest things, because they were profitable or pleasant, before Hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly. But where the Things propounded be both equal, for that Part there the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on standeth in their Degrees; as if Things of themselves may be Honest and Godly, and the Contraries thereof may also so be;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100352:153"/>
and the one and the other may be used; there the Circumstances do alter the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: As Peace and War, Punishment and Forgiveness, Eating and Abstinence, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and Sole Life, both not only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but allowed of God. And according to the Circumstance of Time, and Place, Person and Occasion, sometime th'one bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sometime th'other. And herein I think we do not vary. Altho' you seem in your Tale to make them both Vertues, I mean Virginity and Marriage. Which, I think, you did, after the common manner of Speaking, rather than the true manner of Understanding. For a right Vertue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be abused: Either of these may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, and encrease Damnation. But as things indifferent, Eating and Drinking, Reasoning and Disputing, Ruling and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, Sleeping and Waking, Earnest and Play; so these take of their Circumstances, as I said before, of Place, Time and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Cause, Occasion or Necessity, to make them good or bad.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore this is not so simply to be granted unto you, that Sole Life is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; No, tho' it be the harder; but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Circumstances be. Who, that should begin, being a private Person, to bring in a new Sect or Religion to reform all the State and Order of that which hath been taught before, not with Power but Perswasion; not with Sword, but with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100352:154"/>
Miracle; not with Violence, but with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; not with War, but with Fleeing, when he is persecuted from one place to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; To him it is necessary, and to all them that shall follow that kind of Policy, to be disburthened of Care for his Wife, of Charge for his Children, of the Negligence of Servants, of harkening to Accounts, of Saving of his Stock, and of all such Things as Marriage necessarily doth bring to the private or publick Person, whosoever he be that is not altogether without that Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is most natural; the which they that lack are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Then to Christ, then to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> then to all them, who at the first Time, as it were the Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time of Christian Religion, were the Till-men of the Gospel; ye see it was most necessary, yea, in a manner, it could not well otherwise be done, but that they should be Sole and unmarried. That which was in their Persons, and at that time best, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be now, and in the Queens Person best, may justly be a great Doubt. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see but that <hi>Abraham,</hi> having the Seed promised him, wherein all Nations should be blessed, was as Holy in knowing <hi>Sarah,</hi> as <hi>Elias,</hi> who was ravished into Heaven in his Virginity, if no other Difference were but that; Nor why <hi>Manue,</hi> [<hi>Manoah</hi>] to whom <hi>Sampson</hi> was promised, who should be the Deliverer of <hi>Israel,</hi> did not as well therein, as <hi>Elizaeus</hi> in keeping himself Sole,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100352:154"/>
who the Prophet said should slay all them that <hi>Iehu</hi> left.</p>
                  <p>Now let th'one be simply better than th'other, Virginity than Mariage: which it seemeth can hardly be gathered of St. <hi>Paul</hi>: for he praiseth Virginity as better, not for it self, nor in its self, but for having less Lett and Trouble than hath Marriage: So that if a Marriage have less Let and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Virginity more, then he preferreth Mariage. Wherein it may appear, that it is not (as I said) so better, as Vertue is better than Vice, nor as Gold than Silver, nor scarcely as the Fine than the Base; But let it be as both in one kind of Nature, but the one as fine Gold, the more to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, th'other as base, the less: Yet where the Baser weigheth Ten pound, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but one Ounce, there must needs the Base in kind be better indeed; the Courser in Nature of such things be more excellent in Use and Necessity. Peradventure to a Student, a Priest, a Man of War, and a Merchant-Adventurer, the first were best; because Care of Houshold and Family should happily much disturb them of their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; the other, because they are always in danger and absent from home, it were best for them to live a Sole Life. But, for a Prince, upon whose quiet Succession a great part of the Common-wealth doth hang: whose Family is the Root and Foundation of inward Peace within the Realm; to live
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100352:155"/>
Sole, is to be an Author of such Mischief, as no Man can wish to a Realm a greater. And who would say then, That to a Prince it is simply better to live Sole, than to marry. To kill the Prince, who is the King's El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Son, is worthily made High-Treason; What is it then, not to kill one but all; yea, and not that, but the Hope of all?</p>
                  <p>And you, Mr. <hi>Aganius,</hi> open your Lips to praise Virginity, or Sole Life in our Queen; whose Daughter, much more Son, or a Prince, if God should send one, as I trust God, (if it shall please her Highness to marry) shortly would send a Prince, if you should once wish dead, all Men might just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhor you to the Death. VVhat could you wish more, if <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Nero,</hi> if <hi>Maximine,</hi> or <hi>C. Caligula</hi> did Reign over us, than that which the Soldiers did say, when they slew their Children, <hi>Ex mah genere ne catulum quidem relinquendum.</hi> And because you come with what is good to God-ward, and you take your sure Rule, <hi>that which pleaseth God is best,</hi> I pray you, what is the Promise that he maketh to <hi>David? If thy Sons walk before me,</hi> saith he, <hi>in truth with all their hearts, thou shalt not want one, who shall come out of thy Loins, to sit upon the Throne of Israel.</hi> And to <hi>Iebu,</hi> for the zelous Revenge of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Iniquity, that his Sons should sit upon the Throne of <hi>Israel,</hi> to the fourth Generation. Again, What threatneth he to <hi>Saul</hi> for his Rebellion,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100352:155"/>
other, than that the Kingdom should be translated from him, and his Sons should not Reign after him: To <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> to <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi> and <hi>Achab,</hi> for their Idolatry and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, but that he would not leave of their Posterity one to piss against the Wall? So that it may appear a Blessing of God, a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Faith in God, and good Favour of God towards Princes, when he sendeth them of their own Seed to Reign after them. As the Contrary, of Disfavour, and Discontentment of God toward them, when he cutteth off their Generation, and leaveth them without Posterity and Issue of their Bodies to Reign after them. Then, if it be a Blessing to Princes to have Children to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit after them, which sheweth the Favour of God, it is a Curse to have no Posterity, or the Posterity cut off, which sheweth the Disfavour of God, as appeareth most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly by these Examples of Scripture: And Sole Life bringeth the Curse, and want of Posterity, and no other thing can bring the Blessing of lawful Children but Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Why then may not I conclude by this judgment of Scripture, that Matrimony in a Prince is that Good to be allowed, and that Sole Life is that Evil to be eschewed?</p>
                  <p>And what hath the Queens Majesty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served at your hands, I pray you, that you had rather she had the Curse which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Saul, Hieroboam, Baaza</hi> and <hi>Aehab,</hi> than the Blessing which <hi>David</hi> had and <hi>Abraham</hi>?</p>

been at the Battel of <hi>Muskleborough</hi> or <hi>Agin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>; But when I looked again and saw so many fair Ladies, so goodly Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, so fine and so trim Maids pas these Pykes so wel, not once only but twice, thrice, yea sometimes twenty times, so easily, so merrily, so quietly, in their sine Beds of Down, their Chambers hanged with Arras, their Curtains and Coverings of Silk, their Pillows and Cushions Embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with Gold and Silver-work, their Warming-Pans, their Perfuming-Pans, and al such things so trick and trim about them: And they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>r it look so fair and ruddy, and so beautiful, that it would make any man in the World enamoured of them. And when I marked further what hast they made to go to the Battel again, I began to laugh at my self, and thought that the Fear in which you put me was with a Vizor only which you had taken upon you, and so made me afraid, as Children be afraid of Bearbuggs and Bulbeggers. Why? Is not the Bearing of Children painful? Is not that dangerous, say you? Ask not that of me, but of them who be never wel til their Paniers be ful, which they are sure they cannot em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty til they come to this terrible Battel that ye speak of.</p>
                  <p>Lets see, Many of them wil leave and take Truce any longer than their Month or time of Churching cometh out. Which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100352:157"/>
Month some of them think it so long of four Weeks, that they end it most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at three weeks, because they might the sooner come to such another of these Conflicts: So much they be afraid of it. It was my Chance to be at Dinner with the Countes of <hi>Ormond,</hi> with whom Sir <hi>Francis Brian</hi> maried. At which time she being merrily disposed, among other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications that Ladies and Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had of this matter, she said, she had now born (as I remember) Ten Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and she was brought to bed not so nicely as the Ladies and Gentlewomen be here, but either in a Tent or a wide Barn after the maner of her Country <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: And I'tell you, said she, I felt in a maner no pain at al these Births. Nor I se no Cause why I should make so nice of the Matter as you do here in <hi>England.</hi> We do not so in our Country. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at an old Lady was wonderfully offended, and said they were Beasts, and she was but a Beast to say so. Then she as a witty Lady turned the Matter, and said, It was a Gift which St. <hi>Patrick</hi> begged for her Country-folk, the <hi>Irish</hi> Women, of our Lady. But the Truth is al Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that stir about to travail and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as they do there, and do not use themselves to Rest and Ease, as they can better away with Travail because of use, so they bear that Travail of Childbirth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100352:158"/>
with much more Ease, and in maner with no pain. Which we do se also in these idle Runnagates <hi>Egyptians</hi>; whose Women be always trudging from place to place as they be, and be brought to bed in the Straw, in some Barn or Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house without any great Curiosity: And within three or four days after, yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the second day they ride away with the rest of that beggarly Train.</p>
                  <p>I remember I read, when I was a Boy, in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and I trow it be in his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi>; he would that those that should make Laws for a Common-wealth, should have regard also to Women that were great with Child; that they should not use themselves to over-fine' Diet, nor to over-much Rest. Which, saith he, may be don, if they do appoint them certain Pilgrimages to be don to such Gods as have the Honor of such Matters: Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such Gods as the Gentils did Sacrifice unto for such things, as <hi>Gemini, Lucina, Parcae, Iuno,</hi> &amp;c. His purpose is, that when the Time of Birth draweth nigh, they should by gentle means be brought to a kind of Exercise and Travail, either on Horseback, or on Foot, or both: to the intent that they might the easilier bear the Travail of Childbirth: And thought that they could by no means so wel be perswaded unto them, which then he somewhat heavy, because of their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100352:158"/>
as by Colour of Holiness and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. So that our Pilgrimage, also, which we had of late years, was not much out of the Way for such an Effect, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
                  <p>But I tary long about these Matters. To bear Children is painful I do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is the Threat of God to <hi>Eve,</hi> and to al her Posterity, as wel as to <hi>Adam</hi> and al Men, to get his Living with the Sweat of his Brows: And yet some Men sweat but easily. And why should not I think also that her Highness should bring forth her Children more easily than a great sort of other Women. I se nothing leadeth me to the contrary. Many things do encourage me to think so: Her Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Discretion, Judgment, her store of Physicians, and of al things necessary for them to use. That where other by their Folly do make that Travail to them more painful and dangerous than naturally it should be, her Highness by her Noble Vertues and Wisdom should make it more easie, yea, than of natural Course it should be. For as there be ways to augment, so there be ways to diminish Pain or Grief: Wherein standeth the Difference of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Folly. But why do I stand upon this? Would not her Majesty be glad, think you, to take some pain to make a Prince? To make one, who should be a part of her? who should m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

after her Death, Reign in her stead, when by Course of Nature she can tarry no longer? Who shall continue and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant her Name and Posterity for many an hundred years here Kings in <hi>England,</hi> and leave such a Row of that Race, as is the Root of <hi>Iesse.</hi> Was it nor you of whom I heard even now, that all fair and laudable things be painful to come by? Will you not grant unto me, that this which I speak of now, to have a Prince born of her own Body, who should Reign after her Highness here in <hi>England,</hi> in whom she might se her own Image, not painted in a Table, but lively expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, every Joint, yea, both Body and Soul; who should cal her Highness Queen Mother, and whom al <hi>England</hi> should cal King and Father? Whom it you do not think more to be esteemed than al the Treasure, that the wise and rich Prince her Grandfather K. <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. left at his Death, or that the Noble and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Prince her Father K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. spent in his Life, ye are in a contrary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion to all <hi>English</hi> men. Whom when she shall behold, kiss and embrace, she shall take more Comfort and more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in, than of all the Riches and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els which her Highness had, or ever was Lady of.</p>
                  <p>Do you not think I say, such a Jewel worthy to have the pains taken, for the

getting of it, and bringing it to life? Are you he that was even now so stout, that if the Thing were good, laudable and necessary to be had, the harder it were to obtain, the more you thought it were to be laboured for? And so you Counsilled and proved by many Reasons and Authorities. Are you, I say, now again so weak and so womanly hearted, that for a little pains in the Birth, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure of one Hour or two, or at the most of one Day (for the Extremity of the Pain cannot lightly be longer) wil counsil us to cast down our Courage, and run away like Cowards, and leave al this so rich and so precious a Treasure ungot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and unlaboured for, for the Travail of one hour? I wis <hi>Foloign</hi> cost more the getting, and <hi>Calais</hi> the loosing. And yet this Treasure were more worth than both those Holds to her Majesty, I dare say, and unto the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> if it should be esteemed by true value.</p>
                  <p>Mary, yet ye go neerer me, and bring in certain Queens, who have dyed in Childbirth. And herein you had good Advantage to have two Examples so neer, and in so fresh Memory, that they must needs make much indeed to the Terror of Mischance. And yet this is but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Startbugg, that you have gotten to make us afraid. It is sine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100352:160"/>
In which time our Chronicles have indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently wel been kept, and many Kings and Queens have dyed, and al not after one sort. I pray you how many more have you read of that have dyed in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed? And yet one of those was not the Queen, but Dowager, as you know well enough. And some men would say it was thought that that did distress her then, and bring her to her End, as much as Travail of the Birth. But of that I will not Dispute. But if in five hundred years, in which space so many Queens have had so many Children, and only one or two have dyed in Childbed, would you make this so great a Fear?

K. <hi>William Rufus</hi> was slain with an Arrow in hunting. Shall Kings therefore give over all pastime, or let no Man bear Bows while they be in Hunting? How many do you see yearly drowned in the <hi>Thames</hi>? And who forsaketh not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding to row in a Barge or Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? How many thousand of Children be born every day in one Place or other? How many Hundreds think you in the City of <hi>London,</hi> and in the Shire of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex</hi> in a Month? And if two dy in a year in Childbed, it is a great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. And yet even they commonly dy of some Fear or some Fright, or some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, or some other Cause, than the very Birth going before. So that it is not Ten, but a Hundred or a Thousand to one, that the Woman shall escape, who travail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with Child. And yet they do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss to commit themselves to God, and to require his Aid at all such good and natural Works. And they have the more Comfort, as I think, when they be in pain. But to make this so perillous a Case, and so fearful a Matter, and so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a Battel, I do assure you I se no Cause.</p>
                  <p>And because you reckoned up so many Diseases, whereunto natural Men and

For even as when in a heap of Sand or Mould there is espied a bright thing like Mettal, by sifting of it and washing it, will come to a neerer Guess, and by farther Travail be tryed whether it be Gold or no: So when a thing glistereth and appeareth gay, the same being sifted in Consultation among divers Judgments, at the last doth so come to the strong Water or Ramentation, or to the Test, til it appeareth in his Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, how it is to be reputed. Or els Copper may sometimes be taken for Gold, and a vain thing, that wil consume like Brimstone, may be praised for good Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. And I pray you, who shall more carefully look to, or more faithfully coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil, or be more circumspectly fearful, for the managing of her Highness Affaires than an Husband should do? Or who can more amiably, more frankly, more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, or more secretly confer with her Majesty for th'execution of them, than he can do? whose Heart and Body by the Law of God, and by the Law of natural Love, is knit to her Highness in a most sure Knot.</p>

To the First if we should answer, ye would bring us in a Displeasure with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, as tho we disliked their Doings.

What lack we, say you: Mary even that which you know your self; For you were present, and a Goer with them your self; the whole Parlament lacked you know what wel enough. What was their suite to her Majesty I pray you? What required they by the Mouth of our Speaker? Were they then of your Opinion, or of mine touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Matter? Why did not you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare so much in the Parlament, before they went to make their Petition to her Highnes, as ye have done here? ye might have stayed them peradventure, that they should not with such humble and earnest Requests have moved her Majesty, to have

Compassion upon her poor Realm, and to think upon Marriage, wherein we might se some speedy Hope of Succession from her Highnes. But you durst not; you saw so many, even al men bent to the contrary; And you know wel enough you should not escape unanswered at the ful. And possibly you were not of that Opinion at that time.

wherefore, I peradventure could shew some Causes. Indeed for good Warriors I never heard Man yet give them the Prize.

So much think I it doth excel to the Encouragement of the Soldier, to the Hope of the Capitain, to the Terror of the Enemy, to understand that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Queen, he whom her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes Loveth above al men, and whom She trusteth most, and who can commend their Doings at al Times to her Highnes, to be in the Field; over it is, of any other Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant or General, whosoever he be.</p>

From the Time that K. <hi>Richard</hi> II. was deposed, in whom al the Issne of the Black Prince was extinct, unto the Death of K. <hi>Richard</hi> III, the unkind and cruel Brother of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. whose Daughter was Maried as ye know to K. <hi>Henry</hi> VII. by reason of Titles this poor Realm had never long Rest. Noble men were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, poor men were spoiled, both one and th'other stain in battel, or murthered at home. Now this King prevailed, now th'other.

It is no marvail tho' they lost <hi>France,</hi> when they could not keep <hi>England.</hi> And <hi>England</hi> in the latter end of K. <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was almost a very <hi>Chaos:</hi> Parishes

decayed, Churches fel down, Townes were desolate, plowed Fields waxed Groves, Pastures were made Woods; Almost half <hi>England</hi> by Civil War slain: and they which remained not sure, but in Moates and Castles, or lying in Routs and Heaps together.</p>
                  <p>When those two Roses, by the Reliques and last store of the Whole, were joyned in the amiable Knot of Mariage, then the Strife ended, and <hi>England</hi> began as it were to be inhabited again.

And thus it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from K. <hi>Henry</hi> VII. hitherto; Save that in this Time a few Broyls of the Stirred Sea, which could not so soon be calmed, by <hi>Martin Swarte, Perkin Warbeck,</hi> and <hi>Simond</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what renewed; but they were Trifles to the rest.

And it standeth but on a tickle and frail Ground, if God wil so plague our Country, whether the Red and White Rose shal strive again together, or whether the branches of the mixed Rose shal cleave asunder and strive within themselves, which is neerer the Root.

for me to describe what maner of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band I thought most meet for the Queens Highnes, if it were not first proved by reason, that it were convenient that her Majesty should have one. For if her Grace be fully determined and perswaded by Mr. <hi>Agamus, Spiteweds</hi> Reasons, then to reason whether a Stranger or an <hi>English-man</hi> were more to be wished, is clean super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous. For it is cut off by this one stroke, Her Majesty wil have none.</p>
                  <p>Wel, here among this Company for Disputation sake, I wil stand so wel in my own Conceit, that I take Mr <hi>Agamus</hi> his Opinion thorowly confuted. And let us put the Case that is aggreed upon; That best it were for her Majesty to Mary; then standeth it in Consultation farther of the maner and Condition of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Wherin may be made many Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions; as whether a Young Man, or a more elderly; whether a Batchelor or a Widower, an <hi>English-man</hi> or a Stranger, a great Prince or a King, or a mean Personage: as in al such where divers be offered of sundry Qualities, wherof the Choise and Election is to be taken: and because both I am weary, and there hath yet but one of these Questions been moved amongst us, I shal speak but of that Branch only, Whether an <hi>English-man</hi> or a Stranger is to be perferred. Wherin because I have already declared my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100352:175"/>
which Part I mind to take, it rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that I should also declare the Reasons which moved me to think as I have said; and here I intend to begin.</p>
                  <p>The very true, godly and essential Causes of Matrimony, (if I may use that Term) be three; The getting of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren without the Offence of God, The natural Remedy to resist the Temptation of the Devil, moving us to Fornication or Adultery; And the Comfort, Pleasure and Help which th'one hath of th'other in al private Affairs, and in Governing the House and Family. This last the Philosophers, which knew not the right Law of God, make the first, the chief and the whole Cause. For as for the Second, I mean Fornication, they esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not. And the first they thought they might amend, when they would, by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, either of their own Bastards, or other Folks lawful Children, with the Consent of their Parents. For al these Three, this our Question doth not vary. For either the Stranger or the <hi>English-man</hi> seemeth indifferent therunto; and I make no Difference in them. Then there be other Causes, which be incident and as I might cal them, Accidental, as Honor, Power and Riches: Having first God, and those three Causes, which I called Essential of Matrimony, principally in our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100352:176"/>
Eyes, these Things ought in this Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to have the highest Place.</p>
                  <p>And because I take al you here to be no Children, and in this which I have said to be in the same Opinion that I am, I wil make no further Proeme, but go to, and confer these together in the two Persons which you have brought in to be weighed here as in a Pair of Ballances; that is, the <hi>Stranger</hi> and the <hi>English-man.</hi> And I say, if the Queens Majesty have respect to Advancement and Honor, can that be in Mariage of any within the Realm, who being but her Subjects be they never so high, shal be under her highnes a great Distance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So for that purpose it shal not be Advancement but Disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Wherin I must commend the late Q. <hi>Mary</hi>; who having more regard to her Honor than to her Age, to th'advaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therof than to any other Plesure which she could long have, took to her Husband K. <hi>Philip, Charles</hi> th'Emperours Son, the greatest Prince of Birth and Possessions in al Christendom. Wherby she gat the Sovereignty over so many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Dukedoms, Marchionates, Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Baronies, Countries and so forth; that it would be more than an Hours Work to reherse them, and to be the greatest Estate of a Woman in al Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:100352:176"/>And if it be honorable to a Prince to Conquer one Kingdom with Dint of the Sword, with making of War, with Spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Burning, Wasting, Death, Destruction, Fire and Sword, Man slaughter and Effusion of Christian Blood; how much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ought it to be accounted to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and get not one but a great fort of Kingdoms and Dominions, not with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppression, but with Amity and Love, and that most godly, sweet and pleasant Knot of Mariage? So <hi>Mary</hi> the Daughter and Heir of <hi>Charles</hi> the hardy Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> by Marying her self to
<hi>Maximilian</hi> Son to <hi>Fredericus</hi> of <hi>Austriche</hi> then Emperor, hath made her Progeny the House of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> to enjoy so many Realms and Seignories in <hi>Boheme,</hi> in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in the High and Low Country of <hi>Germany,</hi> and neer it went to have enjoyed also <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> So <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen that liveth now, if the Enterprize had had Success, and she had had by her Husband any Son, She should have left a double King; I mean in <hi>France</hi> a King, as wel as of <hi>Scotland</hi>; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> them both the greater King by her Purchase than else he should have been by his Mothers Inherit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. So <hi>Claudia</hi> the Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> by Mariage with the <hi>French</hi> King hath made her Sons and Off-Spring not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Dukes of <hi>Britain,</hi> but Kings and Possessors
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100352:177"/>
of al <hi>France</hi>; when her Auncesters here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore had much ado always to keep their own, being but only Dukes of <hi>Britain,</hi> much less could conquer or adjoyne to their Dutchy any thing of the rest of the Realm of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if Honor is to be desired, and if it be a Glory to be made from a Baroness a Countess, and from a Countess a Marchioness or Dutchess, and from a Dutchess a Queen; why is it not also as wel to be from a Queen an Empress, or from a Queen of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, a Queen of two or three; and so the more Honorable, and the more to be sought and desired? To the Encrease of which Honor, if Men do apply and study them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sometimes by Sword and sometimes by Mariage to attain, why should not a Queen desire to do as wel as they, especially by the better, more sure and more amiable way? Which thing ye see can be don either by no ways, or by no ways better than by Mariage. And this I have to say of <hi>Honor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I come to <hi>Power</hi> or Strength. Which standeth in two Things. Either for a Prince to keep his own Realm quiet from Rebellion, or to make that the foreign Prince being Ambitious or desirous of War, neither may dare invade him, or els, if the Prince be so minded, to conquer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover such Things, which of old by Titles and just Reasons remain to be claimed. The which the Prince heretofore either for
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100352:177"/>
lack of Power or Mony, for shortnes of Time. Civil Dissension, their own Sloth, or any Cause whatsoever it be, hath omitted or foreslowed. For these remain stil as Causes unto Princes, when they be weary of Ease, or desirous of Honor, or when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther just Occasion is offered to exercise themselves and their Subjects. For any of those, if her Majesty mary within the Realm, what hath She gained? All her own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were her own before; all their Powers are Hers already. Not one Man hath She for the Mariage more than She had before. Wheras if She mary a foreign Prince, if he be an Emperor, al the Empire is hers to aid her, and her Husband at al Events. If she mary a King, likewise al his Kingdom; if she marry a Duke, Earl or Prince, al his Vassals, Kinsfolks, Allies, and Friends are united to her Realm, and be taken al for Brethren, to allow Strength and Aid, both Offensive and Defensive, as Occasion and Necessity shal serve. For who can offend the Wife, but he must offend the Husband also? So that her Majesties Power must needs be encreased by so much as the Power of her Husband doth extend, either by Authority, Title, Blood, Alliance, Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Affinity.</p>
                  <p>Then if Princes be glad, whensoever they invade, or be invaded, to ally themselves with the Princes their Neighbours many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by costly Leagues and much Suite
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100352:178"/>
and Entreaty of Ambassadors, if that may be don by one final Act, as chusing such a puissant Prince to her Husband, as we would most desire to be our Friend or Aid in Necessity either of Defence or Invasion, why should not I think that it were better for the Queens Majesty to take such an one, wherby she may be backed and strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and her Power as it were double and treble, than to take one by whom she shal have no more Power, Help, Aid nor Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour brought unto her, than she had before? And it is to be feared that she shal rather have less. For when Envy naturally kindleth amongst Equals, if the Queen take one of her higher and stronger Nobility, all the rest it wil be doubted wil envy his Felicity, and tho in Words they speak him fair, yet in Heart hardly wil they love him. For they shal be as Rivals and <hi>Candidati</hi> for one Office: where commonly he that hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, if of the inferior sort, al the rest shal disdain at him. Which Disdain wil bring Grudge: and Grudge never bringeth good Wil. So that by this Mariage her Highnes shal seem, not to encrease her Strength, but to weaken it, not to unite it, but to dislolve it.</p>
                  <p>Examples be too neer to be found. K. <hi>Edward</hi> IV. maried the Lady <hi>Katherine Gray,</hi> a goodly Lady, and his Enemies Wife. Did not that Mariage as all Histories make mention, fil in maner al the rest of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100352:178"/>
the Nobility, that thought themselves somewhat, with Malice, Envy, Grudg and Displesure against al her Blood? And her Blood by most Liklihood did not greatly come behind them. This Mischief was the Destruction both of th'one and th'other; and not that only, but of the Two goodly Young Gentlemen K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Sons, the Prince and his Brother. Had it not been better he had married there where the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was his Spokes-man; Wherby he should have gotten Strength abroad, and his Nobility at home not so to have been dissevered. Thus far of <hi>Power</hi> and Strength.</p>
                  <p>The same I do think also of <hi>Riches.</hi> For the which altho it doth most become poor men to travail, yet I do not se, but that Princes both do and have as much need to look and study for to get it. Especially now in our Times, when War is made as much by Mony as by Sword; and he that may longest pay his Soldiers, goeth Victor away. And if they be both disposed to cock it throughly, yet when they both be made Bankrupts, then they must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace. But if her Highnes do look to enrich her self and her Realms, as both Reason would, and I am sure it is no little Part of her Graces Study so to do, (Which thing may appear by many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Tokens) seing that which in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> is to be accounted her own
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100352:179"/>
(as no man doubteth) there can of the gathering together of that no Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be accounted: But if to that which her own Kingdom hath, her Highnes doth adjoyn the Riches of another Region which is none of hers, then must we needs judge the true Encrease to be made. Which Thing you know the Mariage of the Lord of the Country doth without further Cost or Danger bring to pass.</p>
                  <p>And this ye may be sure, that her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes can take to Husband no foreign Prince, nor Nobleman of another Country, but some Riches he will bring with him, more than shal bear his Costs. And contrariwise, if her Majesty take one at home, both her own Crown must be spoiled of Lands and her Coffers of Mony, to furnish him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Estate. For what private man, of what Condition, Riches or Power soever he be, is able of his own Lands or Coffers to bear or maintain the State of her Highnes Husband?</p>
                  <p>And of this matter I think I have said e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For where there be but six Causes or Occasions of Mariage, as I have declared, whereof the Three first be indifferent, that neither the Stranger is excluded, nor the <hi>English-man</hi> reckoned to have any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in them; (Which Three do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain chiefly to the Conscience, and the godly Motives towards Matrimony,) and the Three other, which rule and lead al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100352:179"/>
al the World after them, be al up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Strangers side, as you se, whether way I should lean, if my Judgment were asked, it is apparent enough. If th'ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vauncemont to Honor; wherto al Princes, as ye know, have a special regard and Ey; If the Encrease of Power and Strength, which is the thing, that a wife Prince and Governor doth chiefly covet; if th'aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of Riches and Wealth, which is not the least Care that a King or a Queen ought to have; if not one I say, but al these stand on his Side. So that the Mariage of a stranger doth appear not only more Honorable, but also more Safe and I more Profitable to the Queens Majesty, I must needs be in this Opinion, that it is better for her Highnes to take to Husband a Stranger than any Subject of Hers within the Realm of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had ended al, the rest held their Peace, til my Friend, the Stammerer began, whom they al the night after (as I say) called Mr. Godfather, because he was so ready to Nickname the rest. So that as he misnamed others (and yet not misnamed, for according to their Opinions and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he gave them Names: but as he did) so likewise was he upon his Doings called of them Mr. Godfather; because that he, as tho he had been at a Christening, named
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100352:180"/>
them al of new. Which Names they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me not much to refuse, nor to be angry with them, nor he with his. And therfore I wil hereafter so name them al. Wel, faith he, for your Part, Mr. <hi>Lovealien</hi> or <hi>Lewelyn,</hi> (for my Tongue loveth to speak short) you have played it wel; and now I am content to be on your Side. Mary, I cannot tel what I shal be, when my Friend here hath spoken, what shal I cal him? what other than <hi>Homefriend,</hi> or, if ye would be Christned in Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. For in good Faith he is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>English.</hi> I think he be the Patron and very Idea of an old <hi>English-man,</hi> which thought no Country so good, so plentiful, so rich, so happy as <hi>England</hi> is, nor no men so fair, so wel made, so bold, so hardy, so good Warriors, so wise and so discrete, as we <hi>English-men</hi> be. And even now he is so enamoured of his Country, that he taketh I dare say, as the Proverb is, the Smoak in <hi>England</hi> to be warmer and better than the Fire in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> And as for the Stoves in <hi>Germany,</hi> he cannot abide them. Wel, said Mr. <hi>Homefriend,</hi> and laughed, I am glad I have my Name yet before I shal begin; And I do not fear, but when you have heard me, you wil be of my side, and so we shal be at the least two to one; altho Mr. <hi>Spitewed</hi> tary stil in his Opinion of Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery and sole Life. And after a little space thus he began:</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="oration">
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100352:180"/>
                  <head>IV. <hi>Axenius</hi> or <hi>Home-friend</hi> This Oration, for the Queens Majesty's Marrying with an <hi>English</hi> Nobleman, rather than any Foreign Prince.</head>
                  <p>OF one Part of my Oration, Master <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alien,</hi> saith he, I take my self to be well eased. For you have so much proved the Necessity, and Commodity of her, highness Marriage, and so well refuted <hi>Agamus</hi> his Oration, that it were superfluous for me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to make any Words. And if you had been disposed to have stretched the Vein of your excellent Wit, as well in the behalf of our Countrymen, as ye were of the Strangers, who neither are so near unto you, and shall never do you, nor your Country so much good, I know you would have done it much better, and I had been eased of my Labour, who had rather a great deal be a Hearer than a Talker. But now, seeing that through your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalness, this Burthen lighteth on my Back, altho' I know that I am very weak, yet had I rather overburthen my self, than leave my Country undefended, or to see my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men so much disgraced.</p>
                  <p>Our Question is, Whether, if it please the Queens Majesty to Marry, it were better that her Majesty took an <hi>English</hi> man, or a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Here you come with your fine and logical Distinction, and bring in the Causes
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100352:181"/>
Essential and Accidental of Marriage; as tho' we were in a School of <hi>Dunsery,</hi> and not in a Discourse of Pleasure, where we would seek out the Truth, without any Fraud or Circumvention, I pray you either mince not the matter so finely, or else go not so lightly away with every piece, before it be either granted to you, or else fully proved.</p>
                  <p>And first, to the three Essentials which you make, I will never grant that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> man and the Stranger be equal. For even for the first, I mean getting of Children, if you ask mine Opinion, altho' after Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, by the Law of God, whosoever the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, the Prince or Child which is gotten, shall be most rightful Heir of <hi>England,</hi> and an <hi>English</hi> man, yet it must needs be better an hundredfold, that our Prince be a mere <hi>English</hi> man, as well by the Father, as by the Queen his Mother, than half <hi>English,</hi> which shall have any part of Strangers Bloud in him.</p>
                  <p>We laugh at this, and you think that I speak now of the Honour, and of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which I have to our Country above other. No, I speak not of Affection, but as great Causes move me. For I would the Prince of this Realm, should be wholly <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> and that no other Realm had any Duty to claim of him, but that he should think this his whole and only Country, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soil. So shall he never set by others Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, but by this. So shall he not prefer sickle
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100352:181"/>
Strangers to his trusty Subjects. So shall he ever covet to adorn, magnifie, and exalt this Realm, and drive away no Part of his Love from it to another. Whereas if he should have to his Father a Stranger, it cannot be, but he must have a natural Mind and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this his Father's Country, and his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Country, and either as much, or more than to <hi>England.</hi> Of which thing this Realm already hath had Proof enough.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> enjoyed once this Realm too long: Of which altho' some of them were born here, yet so long as the <hi>Danes</hi> Blood was in them, they could never but favour the poor and barren Realm of <hi>Denmark,</hi> more than the rich Country of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Normans</hi> after wan and possessed the Realm. So long as ever the Memory of their Blood remained, the first most, and so less and less, as by little and little they grew to be
<hi>English</hi>; What did they? Keep down the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation, Magnifie the <hi>Normans</hi>; the rich Abbies and Priories, they gave to their <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>; the Chief Holds, the Noble Seignories, the best Bishopricks and all. Yea, they went so low as to the Parsonages and Vicarages; if one were better to the Pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se than another, that a <hi>Norman</hi> had. Poor <hi>English</hi> men were glad to take their Leavings. And so much was our Nation kept under, that we were glad to dissemble our Tongue, and learn theirs: Whereupon came the Proverb, <hi>Iack would be a Gentleman if he could speak</hi> French.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100352:182"/>But as the <hi>Norman</hi> Bloud and Tongue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished away, so by little and little, Thanks be to God, this Mischief began to cease; and the Princes by Process of Time, made mere <hi>English,</hi> merely favoured this our Nation. And is not this a good Cause, think you, why I should wish the Queens Highness Husband to be of our Country, and the Prince her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Son to be a mere <hi>English</hi> man? For as we have seen by these, and other Proofs in Time past, if the Prince should be a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> he would favour the <hi>French</hi>; if an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> the <hi>Italians</hi>; if a <hi>Dane</hi> or a <hi>Swedener,</hi> he would also favour his Country and Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And is not the whole, at least the greatest part of the Love which we <hi>English</hi> men should require of him, to be derived thither? And you may be assured, as the People see the Prince part his Love, so will they part theirs. Which Love I would have, and wish always to be whole, intire, and perfect in both. That there should not arise a Seditious Person to say, <hi>Non est nobis Pars in</hi> David, <hi>nec Hare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas in filio</hi> Jesse. <hi>Unusquisque ad Tentorium,</hi> O Israel.</p>
                  <p>As for the second, which is the Avoiding of Adultery and Fornication, it lyeth more in the Gift of God, and the Godliness of the Mind of the Married Person, than in the Quality of his or her Make. But will not evil Examples think you do much? And I pray you, what Nation is there, where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony is so indifferently of each, and so godly of both kept, as in <hi>England</hi>? The <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:100352:182"/>
be so jealous, that almost every private man there, doth not think himself sure of his Wife, except he keep her close in a Mew, as here in <hi>England,</hi> men keep their Hawks. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he for his part taketh so much Liberty, that to resort to Courtezans, to describe his Loves and Pastimes, with others besides his Wife, so it be in fine Rhythme, and wittily contrived Verse, he taketh rather an Honour, than a Dishonour.</p>
                  <p>Do you think her Majesty brought up in <hi>English</hi> Manner, can like this suspicion against the Wife? Or this Licentious Liberty of the Husband? And yet if her Grace should take an <hi>Italian,</hi> this is the Manner of his Country.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> man in jealousie is not so much, nor doth so streightly, as in prison, keep hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>What shall I gather of this, but that if the Queens Majesty should marry a Stranger, she shall take one, who shall, not only love his own Natural Country better than <hi>England,</hi> but also the Apparel, Conditions, Manners,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100352:184"/>
Pastime, and Behaviour of his own Country, better than those of <hi>England.</hi> For as it is natural for an <hi>English</hi> man to love <hi>England,</hi> and to like the Manners and Conditions of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so it is natural to <hi>Italians, French</hi> men, <hi>Germans, Danes,</hi> Men of <hi>Sweden,</hi> each one to like theirs. And if it be natural so to do, than he is an unnatural man that doth not, and as <hi>Herodotus</hi> thinketh, a man to be counted rather mad and beside himself than otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Now whether think you better, Master <hi>Lovealien,</hi> for the Queen to take a Stranger, which should be counted a wise, natural and godly man to his Country, or no? If he be so, then shall he set more by his own Country, than <hi>England.</hi> And if he be not, then whom will you have the Queen to marry? One who neither shall be counted wise, nor natural to his Country? And if he be to that his own Country unnatural and unkind, do you think that her Highness shall find any natural Love in him, in whom his Country, as Mother who first brought him up, his Subjects of whom he is Lord and Patron, the Land that bred him, the Tombs of all his Ancestors, that Country, where all his Friends and Kinsfolks dwell, that Place, which next unto God, he oweth most Duty unto, cannot find?

to his own Country, as it is most likely he will be, then shall he covet to enrich that, and to impoverish ours; to honour and exalt that, tho' it be with the oppressing of this, to bring in the Manners and Conditions of that Country, which he liketh best, and to see if he can bring the Queens Highness to them; And so to frame her Majesty, as they call it, to his Bow, which he thinketh best; not to apply to our Institutes, Conditions and Manners, which be best indeed. Or be it in case they be not (as for my Part, I think they be) yet our Queen and her People brought up in them, must of Force and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture think them best. Now, Sir, as you say of Apparel, Manners, Customs, Behaviour, Pastimes, Exercises, Eating and Drinking, so say I also of Laws, (for this Education con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth all) what Contention hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways betwixt us and Strangers, because they like their Laws and Customs best, and we ours? They say we do wrong, where we do not as they do. And we again think their Laws unjust and unequal for us, not only in Succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Now this Contention is easily born; for the one part of sine force must give place. But if you bring this contention once into <hi>England,</hi> the Queens Majesty shall like her own Realm, Customs and Laws; and her People will so desire. Her Husband possibly, as he shall think

himself as great a Prince or greater, shall like his Laws, Customs and Ordinances better, and shall by all means study to bring them hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or else he shall not think himself sure, or not fully a Prince. What Turmoil shall that be, trow you, to the Realm, what Disqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what better Argument will you have of this, than our Laws and Customs of <hi>England,</hi> which may evidently appear, (except the Acts of Parliament) to be a thing made and gathered of the Laws of the <hi>Romans, Danes</hi> and <hi>Normans.</hi> Which three Nations have been in past times Governors and Heads of the Realm. Each one for their Time bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in as they could a piece of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Ordinances. And do you not think, that if King <hi>Philip</hi> had been long here, he would not have brought some piece from <hi>Spain</hi>?

                  <p>Now if it please her Majesty to take one of her own Country, all these Doubts be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100352:186"/>
Mother of his Country, obey her as the Head of the Realm, to the which next unto God, he oweth Duty and Love. His Manners, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, Pastimes, Diets, Laws, Titles, Rights be all <hi>English</hi>; nothing differing from those wherein the Queens Majesty hath been brought up. But so much as should make him have the more Honour, Admiration and Obedience to her Majesty: and so much the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he cannot, tho' he would, dissemble or forget from what Place her Highness ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, to what Place she hath brought him. Whereas on the contrary side, the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince standing upon the Reputation of his Country, may perhaps little Weigh that as a Benefit, but stand upon the Terms of as Great and as Good.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but whosoever her Highness would Marry, he shall be such as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will frame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to all these. First, there is a Question, If he can. For they say, <hi>Mercury is not made of every Wood.</hi> So every Person is not apt to all kind of Manners. Then the next is, If he will. For it is hard bending an Old Oak; and an old Tree long grown crooked, will not with ease grow the other ways. But if he will, and can learn to apply himself to our Manners, is it not better to take one which is already for the Purpose, if he may be had, than to take one which is to break anew; and to be doubted of, when you have done. And if any Breach or Dissension should chance to arise between her Highness and her Husband; as we see no Year is so fair, but there be some
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100352:186"/>
foul and rainy Days in it; and no Peace so surely made, but that it is Wisdom for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to provide against War, let us examine this Part. The stranger strait standeth upon his Reputation, which should he yield, he is a great man born, a Prince as she is, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as good, or as he peradventure will think, better, why should he yield to his Wife? He will peradventure say, he hath born too much, he will bear no more. And if he cannot make his Party good here, he will send to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, his Friends, his Kinsfolks, his Allies. So shall we have her Highness in a strange Agony, the Realm in an intricate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Trouble. Or if he despair to make his Party good, he hath a ready Passage home to his Country again. There will he Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph at his Pleasure, and have leasure there to study upon mischief to her Highness, and Realm; or at the least so long to hold out, till the Queen's Majesty be glad to sue to him for a Peace, and to make Ambassadors for a Concord.</p>
                  <p>Can this happen, if her Majesty Marry one here in <hi>England</hi>? What Refuge, what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or Succor can he have, but in her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? If her Highness be displeased with him, where is his Stay, his Aid, his Defence, his Garrison, and Help to fly unto? What hath he to make any brag again to her Majesty? No, no; It will not be. And as a man bound to the Peace in the Star-chamber in the Pain of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> he will be loth, yea by Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, to seek to break it, for fear of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100352:187"/>
of his Bond, which he is not able to pay: So that Person, if natural Love and Duty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make him, yet this Danger and Fear shall make him always to apply to Love, Serve and Honour her Majesty, because the contrary bringeth to him the next Pain to Hell. And if he should be faulty, no Sanctuary, no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge hath he to avoid the Forfeit.</p>
                  <p>This Part indeed is that which nippeth the most; and which you would fain steal away from us. With which and the other three ye joyned God as the Author of those Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, which was before all these three Causes, or any of them were made: Wherein I do assure you in my mind, you did not only like a wise and learned man (as we all know you are) but like one that cannot dissemble the Truth. Altho' to make for your Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, you can play the Orators part, and pass after such a sort, that if we had not given good eye unto you, we should have taken no Advantage thereat: Which must have been counted rather our Folly in this part, then any thing else: Then those Marriages which be made for these three Grounds, and for these three Causes only; that is, the Continuance of Succession, the avoiding of Fornica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100352:187"/>
whom smallest Repentance doth follow. And that Man or Woman, which for these three Causes especially do take their Mate, seem to have God before their eyes, and to have a godly Mind and Will, and to take the just and right way: And he or she that taketh any of the other three, which is Honour, Power, and Riches, to be their Guide, and chief Cause, and hath not the chief regard to the other three beforenamed, (which you call Essential) leaveth God out of the way, and taketh some other tickle or frail things, the Devil or the World by most Likelihood, to be his Broker and Marriage-maker. So that her Highness by your School and Teaching, having first in her Mind the Continuation of her Posterity with the fear of God, is to consider and make Election of one, whom her Majesty can Fancy, by the stable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found judgment of her most excellent Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be such an one, as whom she shall have always a Joy to behold; a Comfort to have at home, a most sure Trust abroad, an Helper in Adversity, a Pleasure in Prosperity, whom for his Wisdom and Dexterity, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness, Faithfulness and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherein as it appeareth little regard, or nothing is to be had of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Riches, Honour or Powe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:100352:188"/>
For whosoever hath God on his side, and God his Guide in Marriage, must need be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have all these.</p>
                  <p>And hitherto you see we have proved the <hi>English</hi> man, for all these Purposes to be far above the Stranger. And if this Election be to be had of the man, because for such a prey no Craft of Wit, or Engine of man shall be left unassayed; the next Care is to see that her Highness take not a Glass for a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, or Gilt for true Gold. And for that, let us see where her Highness may soonest be deceived. The Stranger either her Majesty seeth not, or seeth but for the time of his Wooing. How then? he doth it by Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors, and moveth it by Letters: he maketh his Friends to commend him. He spareth for no Gifts. What Judgment is all this of the man? Will his Ambassadors tell any of his Faults? And will they disclose any of his Vices? Will they open any of his Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections? Nay all that must be hidden within a Ninefold Stone Wall. But they increase with words his Vertues (if he have any) above the Skies; They praise his Stature, Beauty, Strength, Body, as much as their Wits can extend unto. If he have any Strength at all, they make him <hi>Achilles</hi> or <hi>Hector</hi>; if he have ever been at Wars, he is as good a Captain as <hi>Alexander</hi> or <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>; if he be not altogether a simple or ignorant man, he is as wise as <hi>Ulysses,</hi> and as eloquent as <hi>Nestor</hi>; if he be not altogether deformed, he is as fair as <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Nereus</hi>; if he be a Prince not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100352:188"/>
a Beggar he hath the Riches of <hi>Craesus,</hi> and Magnificence of <hi>Solomon</hi>; if any doubt of his Inconstancy, Hastiness, or any other Vice, he is as continent as <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> as meek and patient as any Lamb, and more gentle than ever was <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> This shall the Queen hear to whom the Suit is made; this the Ambassadors shall say. This the Commender shall write; yea, and if need be, some shall be hired at home to help to bear a part of this Song. And is this a sure Proof trow you, for her Majesty to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her Person for a continual either Joy or Torment, as it shall happen?</p>
                  <p>Well, but for a more sure Trial of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage, ye shall have a Picture brought, as they will swear, <hi>Ad Vivum.</hi> Of which if ye see Two, not one shall be like the other. And if they be, what is the Picture to the man? And yet I heard not many years ago of a certain Lady, who having the Picture sent unto her of one whom she never saw, who should be her Husband, was so enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereon, and so ravished that she languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Love, and was in a manner out of her Wits for his long tarrying and absence. But I ween hot Love was soon cold, and not long after repented. But what other Proofs can you have of him, that dwelleth not within four or five hundred, or a thousand Miles, or more of the Realm? And if he do come hither, he cometh but his Wooing Time. All which Time he must be Liberal, Magnificent, Plentiful, Princely, and make a Shew of all

Whose Judgments if you would have to be esteemed so much, as appears in your Argument you would, and as I think you will even now Subscribe unto, this Matter is concluded, and your Disparagement is gone.</p>
                  <p>And where you said, that the Marriage within the Realm should bring in Envy, Strife, Contention and Debate; and for to prove the same you shew forth the Marriage that King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. made with the Lady <hi>Katharine Grey,</hi> wherein followed such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sension, Cruelty, Murther and Destruction of the Young Prince and his Brother; the sequel I grant: Mary, if you do consider the Matter well, ye do alledge <hi>Non Causam, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Causam.</hi> As for the Stomach and Grief of the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> against the King, I think indeed that Marriage was the Cause: Not because the Queen was an <hi>English</hi> Woman, but because the King having sent the Earl as his Ambassadour to conclude a Marriage for him: Which the King did afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to accomplish. And this the Earl thought not only to touch the Kings Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but also his: and fought therefore the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100352:193"/>
Revenging. Which he would as well have done, and he had the same Cause, if he had concluded it in <hi>England,</hi> and after the King refused it. So that it was not the Place, or Person, but the breaking of the Promise, and disavouching of his Ambassage, and the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Earls Honour herein, that made the strife between the Earl and the King. For the rest, for the Beheading of the Earl <hi>Rivers</hi> and others, the Marriage was not the Cause, but the Devilish Ambition of the Duke of <hi>Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cester,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> Which may appear by the sequel. For the one rested not till he had the Crown, nor the other till he lost his Head. And I pray you what Kin was the Lord <hi>Hastings</hi> to the Queen? And yet he lost his Head, even then. King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. Married in <hi>France.</hi> And did not that Marriage make Dissension enough in <hi>England</hi>? And for all that the Queen was a <hi>French</hi> Woman, was not her Husband, and her Son, by the Desire of the Crown, which the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had, both bereaved of their Crown and Lives?</p>
                  <p>So that you see that neither Marriage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Realm, maketh these Mischiefs, nor yet the Marriages without can let them; but Wisdom, Foresight, and good Governance, and chiefly the Aid and Grace of God. But it is a great thing to be considered, the Riches, Power and Strength, which shall be by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a Foreign Prince, as well for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment and well keeping of her High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, against Insurrections and Conspiracies
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100352:194"/>
which might chance here within the Realm; and for Invasions, War, Battle to be made by, or against Princes abroad, and without the Realm. And here you seem to triumph, as tho' all were yours, and as tho' it were a thing clear, and without all Controversie.</p>
                  <p>But I pray you, let us weigh this Matter. Do you think so much Riches, and so much strength gotten unto the Realm, when she shall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a Foreign Prince? Do you praise so much Queen <hi>Mary</hi> for Marrying King <hi>Philip</hi>? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he is a Prince, as you say, as great in Birth and Possession, as any Christian Prince is at this day. But what was <hi>England</hi> the better for his Marriage? We kept <hi>Calais</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Two Hundred and odd Years in the <hi>French</hi> Ground, in despight of all the <hi>French</hi> Kings, which have been since that Time, in all the Civil Wars, and the most pernicious Dissension, that ever was, either in King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> IV. <hi>Henry</hi> VI. <hi>Richard</hi> III. or King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. their times.

I do assure you for my Part, I never saw, nor I think if I should have lived this Five Hundred Years heretofore past, I should not have seen at any time <hi>England,</hi> weaker in Strength, Men, Money and Riches, than it was in the Time when we wrote King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> King and Queen of so many Kingdoms, Dukedoms, Marchionats and Countries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For all those jolly Titles, our Hearts, our Joy,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100352:194"/>
our Comfort was gone. As much Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as you note me to be to my Country, and Countrymen, I assure you I was then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of both. They went to the Musters with Kerchiefs on their Heads. They went to the Wars, hanging down their Looks. They came from thence as men dismayed and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn. They went about their Matters as men amazed, that wist not where to begin or end, And what marvel was it, as my Friend Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus</hi> saith? Here was nothing but Fining, Heading, Hanging, Quartering and Burning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Taxing, Levying, and Pulling down of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks at home, and beggering and loosing our Strong Holds abroad. A few Priests, men in White Rochets ruled all. Who with setting up of Six foot Roods, and rebuilding of Rood-lofts, thought to make all Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                  <p>And is this the surety we shall look for, the Defence we shall find, the Aid we shall hope of, if the Queen's Majesty take a Foreign Prince to her Husband? And what Decay came at that Time to the Substance of the Realm, and Riches both publick and private, it would be no less Pity to think, than it is needless to tell unto you especially. For first, what Debt the Realm was left in, to be paid beyond the Seas, you heard it declared by Mr. <hi>Secretary</hi> in the first Parliament of the Queens Majesty; and how much it did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Debt of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. What was owing also to the Subjects within the Realm. It was marvellous to hear, how the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100352:195"/>
private Substance was diminished: Part might be seen by the Subsidy Books. And in the first Parliaments of King <hi>Philip</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> You heard a Burgess of <hi>London</hi> make plain Declaration, and proof, that the City of <hi>London</hi> alone was worse in Substance, in those Five Years by 300000 <hi>l.</hi> than it was at the Death of the late King <hi>Edward.</hi> And if you will say that King <hi>Philip,</hi> being so occupied with continual Wars, in which the Emperor his Father left him, could not be rich: but her Majesty may take one that shall bring in great Wealth and Treasure, and whom his Friends have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>st very rich: This may be done I do not deny, altho' it be unlikely that any Prince would be so unnatural to Rob, Spoil, make bare, poor and naked his own Country or Realm, to enrich this. But if he should do, doth he not, think you, look to be a Gainer by it? I think he doth not mean to cast his Money away; but possibly he may look for the greater Usury, the longer he tarrieth for it, and do as some men do, adventure a little to get a great Treasure.</p>
                  <p>But grant that he looketh for nothing. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for mere Love and Royalty, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the Money here in the Realm, he will enrich the Queen's Majesty, he will frankly spend all. What shall he do when all is spent? We see the Treasure of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. All the Treasure which <hi>Maximilian</hi> l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If we will say that Yearly there shall come in the Revenues of that Realm, which shall supply again the empty Coffers: First, I will ask you, if that Realm you do speak of is kept with nothing? And where that Realm shall stand that hath no Enemies near it, no Garrison on the Frontiers, no Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to be paid, no Officers to be kept, no Charge to go out. I know few Regions, but all that ever can come of them ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily can do no more, but keep their own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Charges. For I see when they have any extraordinary thing, as War, or Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to be made, the Princes are constrained to seek extraordinary means, by Subjects Love, and other Devices, to bear them. I see this, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> The rich <hi>Indies,</hi> be so rich to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> for all that He is only the Merchant of Spices to all <hi>Europe.</hi> Yet now almost every man doth see, that he is scarcely with the Revenues of them, able to bear their Charges.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100352:196"/>
Gains King <hi>Philip</hi> hath of them. And if the Prince being away from thence remaining the Enemies should invade the Realm you speak of, should it not be necessary, trow you, to employ that Revenue, and more, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? Or if the People seeing their Treasure so wasted, and their Realm impoverished, should repine at it, as some Countries would do, and refuse to pay any more; or if any other in his Absence should take upon him to usurp the State, and pretend some Titles, (as we see to Ambitious Heads there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lack Titles, either of Kindred or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to Claim to themselves the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty,) what Gain shall be looked for from thence? Nay, what Charges shall we be put to by it? Either we must abandon that Realm, which were the greatest Dishonour that could be; or else employ all our Force and Treasure, to the Recovery thereof. Either of which, if they should chance (as few Realms be long without them) then cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Cards aright, we shall find very small Advantage.</p>
                  <p>And for Proof of this which I say, we will but examine your own Examples. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Queen was highly advanced, you say, to the Dolphin; who afterwards was the <hi>French</hi> King, called <hi>Francis</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.

But I will deny that her Country of <hi>Burgundy</hi> is in so good an Estate, as it was in her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers time. For then it was Head and Chief, but now it is Subject to the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strich.</hi> Then the <hi>Burgundians</hi> were reckoned the hardiest, and most valiant Warriors, now be the <hi>Spaniards, Almains,</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> before them. Their Riches were then a Terror to <hi>France,</hi> a Marvel to all the World; now it is but a little Patch to King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Power. And if they were not as well taxed and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed in the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> and this Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Puissant King <hi>Philip</hi>'s Time as ever they were, the <hi>Burguudians</hi> were much to Blame to groan so fast. Take <hi>Antwerp</hi> apart, and a few small things by the Sea side, which have had another Cause of Increase, let us

see if all the rest of the Cities be not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Decay, and in far worser State than they were, when they had but a Duke to their Head. As when one River falleth into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do increase indeed, and make larger Water, but yet the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So a Kingdom swalloweth up a Dukedom adjoyning, and the bigger King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the less. And if they fall both into the Lap of a Mighty great Monarch, as the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the <hi>Turks,</hi> or of the <hi>Persians,</hi> security they may have, but their Honour and Liberty is clean lost; whether Conquest giveth it them, or Marriage. Howbeit of these the Empire of the <hi>Romans</hi> doth least op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, and leaveth most Liberty: Which is not for fault of Will, but of Strength.

                  <p>These may be Mirors and Examples to us to consider, and see what Advancement it would be to us, to fall into the Hands and Power of a Prince that is a Stranger, and Stronger than We be.</p>
                  <p>Now if you will say, there may be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants made, Bonds taken; and for the more surely, by the Parliaments of both Realms, the Conditions of Matrimony may

be enacted, and such Assurances devised, as there may be no doubt of any Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences to follow: Indeed this is a Device, but I pray you, let me tell you of a Question that not long ago a Baron of <hi>England</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Parliament to this Purpose. And if you can assoil it, you shall move me much. If the Bands be broken between the Husband and the Wife, either of them being Princes and Soveraigns in their own Country, who shall sue the Bands?

If you will not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, I will tell you: Discord, Dissension, War, Bloodshed, and either extream Enmity, or else the one Part must at length break and yield. If you will say, Tush! He will not do against his Promise; he will not break his Accord and Agreement; he will so much consider his Honour and Love, that what he hath once said, he will always stand to. Well, granting that, I pray you, what needs any Bonds? Whereupon cometh this Mistrusting, but upon Fear?

But if his Mind fortune to alter or change; and so he misliketh the Conditions whereto he hath agreed, and will not keep the Covenants, what shall these Bonds avail? To which you have neither Place of Iudgment, Persons of Plaintiff or Defendant,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100352:198"/>
and least of all a competent Judge to compel the wrong Doer to abide right. And if it were done, what pleasure shall the Compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Party have of the Compeller? Or what Trust can the Compeller have of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled? Nay, Bonds, Covenants, Indentures and Conditions, be far from the free Love, Sincerity and hearty Doings of Love; when the Hearts, Minds and Bodies be united: Can there be a surer Bond than that which maketh them all one? And if they be not so, then they be two; and what two? Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Princes, which know to Rule, and not to be Ruled, and who may not abide to be compelled or enforced? Nor is it so meet that otherwise they should, but only by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; nor indeed cannot without Battle or Bloodshed. I think an Article comprized in the Conditions by Act of Parliament with King <hi>Philip</hi> was, that we should not for his Cause enter into War with <hi>France.</hi> But yet I trow we did, to our no small Loss.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100352:198"/>
must needs be the Consuming of Money, of disquieting her Subjects, of emptying the Realm of able men.

And so would I say too, if I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider as well the sequel thereof, as the first fair shew. For in taking the Power from hence, they took so many of the good War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, expert Captains, tall and likely men; that they left the <hi>Britains</hi> so weak, that the <hi>Scots,</hi> and Princes over them, overcame them in every Place.

Which things if you will weigh in a just Pair of Ballances, without being affected so much, as you are, to Strangers, I do not doubt but ye will condescend now at the last to my Opinion and Judgment, and think as ever I have thought, that for all Purposes, it were better for the Queens Majesty, if it could stand with her Pleasure to Marry an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> man, than any other Stranger whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be.</p>

But yonder hath one stood a good while to call us to Supper. I have caused him to stay whilst all were ended.
