            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and the vndoing of many
men. In these verses he proceedeth against
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18993:3"/>
idlenes, and negligent slouthfulnes, or slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
negligence, another extreame, contrarie
to the former, and no whit inferiour in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
vnto the former. And betweene both he
requireth in all the children of God, an adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
diligence in all the waies of their calling,
to shew that the way of a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to make
an euen course betweene so many rocks and
dangers, as he is on both sides beset withall,
and alwaies to saile by the carde and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of Gods word, the spirit of God sitting
as Pilote at the helme to direct the course by
the same; lest otherwise, either vpon the rocks
of rashnes &amp; vaine glorie, or vpon the sands
of slouthfulnes and negligence, he suffer ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of bodie and soule before he neede,
or before he would.</p>
               <p>The matter of these verses is in generall a
disswasion from idlenes and negligence: Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for want of a calling, and negligence in a
mans calling are the principall things which
the spirite of God here dealeth against, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
also to faithfull diligence, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of a sillie creature the Pismire. But
more particularly these poynts are in these
verses to be considered of: first, the Sluggards
Schoolemaster, and his lesson that he must
learne, in the 6. 7. 8 verses: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Sluggards
examination in the 9. verse: then his answere
in the 10. verse: and lastly his iudgement in
the 11. verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18993:3"/>And this text may be called the rowsing of
the Sluggard, because it hath to deale with
one that is fast asleepe, and therefore commeth
to awaken him by all the meanes he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise,
as it were by calling, pulling, and hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and pinching, &amp; terrifying, as if he would
not leaue him till he had awakened him, if he
will be awakened: for first, he perswadeth him
by the example of a Pismire, to shame him
withall: then he debateth the matter with him
to know how long he will sleepe, to see if that
will awake him: and then he sheweth him his
nature and propertie, to see if that will awaken
him: and then seeing he will not awake, hee
sheweth him the danger of it, and so he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
him: And the same course will I take.</p>
               <p>But for as much as euery man consisteth of
two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> bodie and soule, both which are
in time to be prouided for, and <hi>Salomons</hi> care
was aswell for the one, as for the other: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we will set downe two sorts of Sluggards
to deale withall. The Sluggard temporall, and
the Sluggard spiritual: for some are Sluggards
for the bodie, and some are Sluggards for the
soule. Of Sluggards temporall which neglect
the things of this life, wee may also set downe
two sorts, either such as liue without any cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
or such as liue neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly in their calling.
Of Sluggards spirituall likewise, I summon
two sorts to appeare before the Pismire: first,
those that haue no care at al to vse the meanes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18993:4"/>
of their soules health, but liue as though they
had no soules to saue: then those that vse the
meanes of their saluation but coldly, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently,
driuing off all to the last cast, thinke
that it is not yet time to make their prouision.
And first of the Sluggard temporall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Goe to the Pismire, &amp;c.</hi> The Sluggard is here
set to schoole with a very simple schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
and yet able to teach the Sluggard wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
if he will take the paines to behold her
waies, that is, to consider well of the order and
manner of her liuing, and to applie the same
vnto himselfe. Whereby wee may learne first
that idle bodies and slow bellies which liue
without a calling, or negligently in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
are not so wise, and therefore neither so
profitable, as the sillie Pismire is. For she is
wise to helpe her selfe, by making readie her
prouision in time: the Sluggard hath no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
nor care to helpe himselfe, nor to saue
any thing that he hath. Now he that hath no
care to helpe himselfe, for whom will he care?
He that is vnprofitable to himselfe, to whom
will he be profitable? He that will not till his
owne ground, whose ground will he till? He
that will not labour for himselfe, for whom wil
he labour? for euery man naturally is giuen to
helpe himselfe, and to prouide for himselfe:
therefore it seemeth that Sluggards and idle
packes are vnnaturall, and monsters in nature.
And therefore ought to haue no place in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:4"/>
that is amongst men or beasts, because
they are not so profitable as either man, or
beast, be the one neuer so simple, and the other
neuer so filthie. For the beast is still in his kind
euen to the very Pismire or Emmot, but the
Sluggard is out of kind. And therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
warneth the Thessalonians,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 10.</note> that if any
amongst them were able to worke and would
not worke, they should not eate; to shew that
idle persons are not worthie to liue: his reason
is, because they be inordinate liuers, and work
not at all, but are busie bodies, that is, they liue
out of all order, intermedling with other mens
busines, but altogether neglecting their owne
dueties. Such are those wanton widowes and
pratling gossips, of whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostle speaketh
in another place, which <hi>liue in pleasure,</hi> that is,
they loue not to take any paine for their liuing,
now heare the Apostles iudgement of them,
<hi>They that liue in pleasure</hi> (sayth he) <hi>are dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 6.</note>
                  <hi>while they liue:</hi> that is, they are vnprofitable to
men, and as good dead as aliue, and better too:
for while they liued many were the worse, no
man the better for them: but when they bee
dead, they hurt no bodie: besides that, the
wormes, or something els, doe then feed their
fill vpon their carkasse, which in their life time
fed vpon all other, but fed none themselues.</p>
               <p>The naturall man hath abho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed idlenes for
want of a calling, although he had no light but
the light of nature: therfore when <hi>Iosephs</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18993:5"/>
came before <hi>Pharao,</hi> he asked them of
what trade they were:<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 3.</note> for it was a very vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
thing to be without a trade, that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some ordinarie and lawfull kind of calling,
either in the Church, or Common-wealth,
whereby a man may be both profitable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and helpfull to himselfe.</p>
               <p>As the naturall man condemned it, so doth
the Pismire here in our text rise vp in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against the Sluggard whatsoeuer he bee,
but especially against him that for want of a
trade, or some calling, is become a sluggard, &amp;
leadeth an idle life: <hi>For she hauing no guide, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour,
nor ruler, doth gather her meate in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
&amp;c.</hi> What would she do if she had a guide
and gouernour? &amp;c. And what a shame is this
to the slouthful person (if he be not past shame)
that hath both guides, and gouernours, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
both to teach him, and keep him in order,
besides the benefite of reason and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
and yet for all these meanes and helpes,
which the Pismire wanteth, is carelesse of his
owne good? But hath the Pismire or Ant no
guide, nor gouernour, will some say? how is it
then that she doth alwaies keepe that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
order, and take that meruailous trauaile
for her liuing, without breaking or altering
thereof? To this we may answere, that her or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is the order of nature giuen and imprinted
in nature by God at the beginning, her guide
is God himself, and her gouernour is the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watching,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:5"/>
and euerlasting prouidence of the
Almighty, which extendeth it selfe to man and
beast, to all things in heauen, in earth, in the
sea, in hell, and in all places, and at all times, yea
to the Pismire, the flye, the haires of a mans
head, the haires of euery mans head in the
worlde, and finally taketh accompt of euery
haire vpon euery mans head.<note place="margin">Mat. 10. 30.</note> But as for other
helpes, and other guides, and other gouernors,
the Pismire hath none: man hath so much as
she hath, and more too by many degrees: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if man shall be found more careles; nay, if
not ten thousand times more carefull &amp; pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
then the vnreasonable creatures, hee must
iustly be condemned: for God doth condemne
him, the naturall man doth condemne him, the
bruite beast doth condemne him, the poore
Pismire doth condemne him, and the whole
course of nature doth condemne him. Then
grieuous, and iust must that mans condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
bee, that is denounced and ratified by all.
Therefore in time <hi>goe to the Pismire, O slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
behold her waies, and be wise: for she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no guide, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be some, companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to Atheists, which
partly through ignorance, and partly through
pride of heart, (for commonly they goe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
that haue not stuck to finde fault with the
creating of the Pismire, the flye, the worme, &amp;
an infinite number of creatures moe, and as it
were to quarrell with God for making of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:6"/>
because (as they say) they cannot see to what

good, nor were no more profitable in their

but finde fault with God, and his workes
in nature, like dogs which bark at the Moone;
it were no great matter if the world were rid

or in his mercie, if it please him to worke their

               <p>But yet the Sluggard is not answered, hee
must needes knowe wherefore the Pismire
serueth, and what she should do in the world:
And the Pismire on the other side meruaileth
what the idle Sluggard doth in the world. It
is no meruaile though the Sluggard cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

with the Pismire of all other things: for
many idle schollers cannot away with the

the Sluggard well digest the sight of the Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
because he is put to schoole with her to
learne wisedome. For he counteth it as a kinde
of disgrace to his person, to be set to schoole at
an Ant-heape, or at any body els: but so it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Lord wee see to pull downe the pride

What say many now adaies? They skorne
to learne their duetie at the preachers hand, or
to bee catechised, they will not so much bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based
and disgraced, when the Lord knoweth
they be as blind as beetles in their duetie both
to God and man. But if men be so proude, that
they will not be taught by the preacher of the
word, nor bee subiect to the ministerie of their
pastors, the Lord knoweth a way to humble
them well enough: He can turne them out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fielde amongst the Ants, and flyes, and
grashoppers, that they may see what manner
of schollers they are, when such tutors are set to
teach them their lesson:<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 30.</note> As he turned <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> out of his pallace into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

thus we may see that the poore Pismire can in

                  <hi>Behold her waies, and be wise.</hi> Here wee are
further taught, that wee ought to beholde the
creatures, with due consideration of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the wonderfull workes of God in
them, and that we ought so to behold them, as
to bee the better for beholding them, and not
to bee (as most are) idle gazers vpon them, or
vaine and curious disputers of them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but for ostentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of learning or wit, &amp;c.
It is good to be a naturall Philosopher, but it is
better to bee a christian Philosopher withall:
that is, when by beholding and learning the
natures of the creatures, we are drawne neerer
to the Creator, and taught to know our selues,
and our duetie to God better then we did. For
this is true wisedome, and true wisedome is
true Philosophie. Therefore the Sluggard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sent to the Pismire to behold her waies, &amp;
so to get wisedome, what els is he taught, but
to become a right Philosopher? So that a man
may learne Philosophie in the fieldes, by an
Ant-heape, if he hath the spirit of God; yea as
good as any <hi>Aristotle</hi> can teach him in the
schooles, and better too: for he goeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the causes of things, and teacheth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to rest there, saying: <hi>Foelix qui potuit rerum
cognoscere causas:</hi> that is, Happines standeth in
the knowledge of naturall things, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
causes of naturall things. But Christians
haue learned out of the booke of God, to goe
one step beyond <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and all that are but
<pb facs="tcp:18993:8"/>
meere naturals, and that is not onely to search
out the causes and qualities of the creatures,
(wherein indeede <hi>Salomon</hi> did excell, for he
disputed of all things from the Hyssoppe that
springs out of the wall to the Cedar in Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus)
but then further to make vse of the same,<note place="margin">1. King. 4. 33</note>
and out of euery thing to learne something,
whereby they may either correct their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or bee more confirmed in the prouidence
of God, or bee stirred vp to the doing of their
dutie to God and man, or to be more humbled
in themselues, or to magnifie the name of God
for his wisedome, for his power, and for his
goodnes, &amp;c. Such a Philosopher was <hi>Dauid:
When I behold thy heauens</hi> (sayth he) <hi>euen the

               <p>There is no creature of God in the world, but
that man may learne somewhat out of the
same, and profite by it, to the amendment of
his life. The reason is, because all the creatures
of God doe serue their Creator in that course

men are the sinners in this world, and haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
their first estate, and are become vnkind

to build vpon his comming: to shame those
that promise much, but performe nothing, and
to shewe that vnconstant men of their word
may be taught by the sea. As they goe beyond

And therefore to conclude this poynt, what
cause is there that we should bee so proude of

giue the Lord leaue thus to waite and attende

how hard a thing it will be for thee (if not

when all these meanes are gone, and this sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

some remedie against thy disease, and to

And both of these, if they were sure that
the winter time of persecution, and trouble: or
that the stormes and tempests of sicknesses &amp;
common calamities were at hand, they would

time. But alas poore soules, what charter hath

doe we not see young dye aswell as olde? and
many both young and old die suddenly, when
they thought to haue liued long? Some drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
downe in the streetes: some at boarde:
some in bed: some at sea: some at worke:
some at play: and some cut off by murther in
frayes: some by theeues murthered in trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
by the way: &amp; some sitting at table, are
murthered with the meate in their mouthes.
Woe worth the time, and the trees that euer
brought forth such fruites of sauage crueltie,
and brutish barbarisme in the peaceable go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
of England, vnder the Gospell of
Christ. And yet for al this, and many moe such
like, thou are not warned, but thinkest thou
shalt liue still: as though thou heldest thy life
by Letters Patents from the Lord: and still
thou forgettest: <hi>[Thou foole this night shal thy

hath the Lord left vs certain of our death,
and vncertaine of the time of our death, but
that we should be alwaies readie for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of death?</p>
               <p>And as for this summer time of peace and
plentie, which vnder the gouernment of our
soueraigne Queene, the Lords handmaide, we
enioy now, it cannot bee denied but it hath
been, and is great, and wonderfull. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:18993:28"/>
great and fearefull will be the Sluggards
iudgement, when the winter of trouble and
penurie shall come, with the famine of the
Worde into the land, because he hath not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
any riches for his soule, but is bare, and
barren in all the heauenly graces of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
yea in all this time, wherein any man might
haue stored himselfe for many winters, and all
weathers. And when that time commeth,
thou shalt lye and thinke vpon the time past,
yea and burst thy heart with griefe, when thou
shalt thinke how many golden occasions thou
hast omitted: how many sweete sermons thou
hast lost for a little sleepe, or one vanitie or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And the burden of thy dolefull and woful

               <p>But if we speake of Poperie and persecution,
or alteration of religion, or comming of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
&amp;c. some make a iest of that, as they doe
of all the iudgements of God: No, no, say the
secure sluggards, we shal neuer see those daies:
and if they should come, thousands and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans
would dye before they would turne: and
as for the Spanyard, let him come when hee
will, or when he durst, he shall be met withall
I warrant him: oh one Englishman will be too
hard for ten Spanyards: and if we all be ture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mognst
our selues and hold together, we need
not care how many, or how mightie they bee.
Thus we see how foolishly foolish men talke,
and how vaine their confidence and hope is,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:29"/>
which is builded onely vpon ifs, and ands. As if
one should say, If it doth not raine, it will hold
vp: But is he sure it shall not raine? so, are they
sure the enemies shall not come? or if they
come, are they sure that al wil be true amongst
our selues? or is it likely? And what reason
haue any man to stande so much vpon the

Gospell, &amp;c. As if the Lord were more bound

Lord had made his hill so strong, that it should
neuer bee moued: but that was <hi>Dauids</hi> error.
So we thinke that the Lord hath made our hill
so strong, that it shall neuer bee moued: but
that is our error. And pride was the mother of
<pb facs="tcp:18993:29"/>
it both in <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in vs. But <hi>Dauid</hi> was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and his kingdome sorely shaken as strong
as he was: so we may bee moued, and shaken
too, as strong as we are. But seeing as the slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
hath sealed himselfe a quittance, and
thereupon hath promised vnto himselfe a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
peace: we will consider a little of these
two poynts.<note place="margin">Two points very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</note> First, whether it be a thing likely
or no, that after this long and blessed possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the glorious Gospell of Christ, a winter time
of trouble may come, or not come. Secondly,
if it proue a thing likely, how wee may knowe
whether it be farre off, or nigh at hand. And by
that time, it may be the sluggard will awake. I
dispute not of Gods power, and what he is able
to doe, for he is almightie: nor of his mercie,
and how he may renew it with vs still: for he
is infinite in mercie, and his mercie is ouer all
his workes: but what his iustice requireth to
bee done, which is no way disanulled by his
mercie. And now the question is, what is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ensue, by all circumstances, and probable
coniectures, in respect of the manifolde and
wonderfull blessings which the Lord hath so
long heaped vpon our nation with his Gospel;
and the manifolde vnkindnesses, and daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
which his maiestie hath receiued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
at our hands for the same: And if his
spirite should still striue with man, to put our
sinnes out of his remembrance: or for <hi>Noahs</hi>
sake a while longer to spare the world: or for
<pb facs="tcp:18993:30"/>
some <hi>Lots</hi> sake to saue the citie from burning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and to draw out the thred of our peace &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
yet longer: it is no more then his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
may doe, and can doe if it please him, and
(that it may so please him) we doe all most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
beseech his diuine maiestie, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
sake: which if he graunt, shall bee no lesse
wonder, then to command the Sunne to stand
still, and the Moone to goe backe againe, as in
the daies of <hi>Amaleke:</hi> or to diuide the sea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
as in the daies of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> or to forbid
the fire to burne againe, as in the daies of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar.</hi> But this is not likely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it shall be no part of wisedome for vs to
presume vpon it.</p>
               <p>Now then let vs come to the poynt, and see
why it is not likelie. We vse to saie, that after a
great time of heate, there will come a cooler,
and it is so for the most part. And as it is in the
state of times and seasons, so is it also in the
state of the Church: and therefore it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that after this long time of peace and
ease, there may come a cooler: for so it hath
been commonly seene from the beginning,
and not without cause: for if nature should not
sometimes be corrected, it would in time bee
wholly corrupted: the standing water that is
neuer troubled, we knowe by experience doth
breede the most filth. And if the ayre shoulde
still bee calme, and neuer bee clensed by the
windes, by thunder, and lightning, it would
<pb facs="tcp:18993:30"/>
proue infectious: the bodie that is not exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
aboundeth most in ill humours, and the
yron that is not scoured still gathereth rust,
and the childe that is continually fed, and hath
whatsoeuer he craueth, and cryeth for, at last
playeth with his meate, and casteth it to the
dogges: and therefore it is necessarie that
sometime he should be abridged and pinched.
And so doth the Lord also (by interrupting the
peace and ease of his Church) purge the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of pride and contempt growing in the
bodie of his Church: so doth he vse to scoure
off the rust of impatience, and distrustfulnes
which growe vpon our yron hearts with the
graces of Gods spirite. So doth he by stormes
and tempests, by thunderings, &amp; lightnings of
troubles and persecutions, clense the corrupt
ayre of his Church, least the good graces of
faith and of repentance, and of loue, and of
zeale, and of patience, and of charitie, should
through continuall calmenes be infected with
infidelitie, or impenitenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or profanenes, or pride, or vaineglorie, or selfe-loue,
or coldenes, or Apostasie, or with one spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
disease or another: and so dooth the
Lord vse to pinch, and abridge his Church of
the foode of his heauenly worde, now and
then, and sometime for a long time, when it is
loathed, and plaied withall, and trode vnder
foote, and all this the Lord dooth in singular
wisdome, because the worth of benefites is not
<pb facs="tcp:18993:31"/>
so well knowne, as by the want of them. That
our hearts and soules are cankred and rustie it is
most euident, and therefore a scouring is to be
thought vpon at the least: that there are many
ill humours of vnthankfulnes, of pride, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
of crueltie, and oppression, of swearing
and forswearing, of whordomes, and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
of al kind of profanenes and abominations
abounding in the bodie of the Church, it is not
to be denied. And therefore a time of purging
and exercise is to be thought vpon. That Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
is loathed, and the pure preaching of Gods
most holy word despised, and the faithfull Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of the Lord hated, and molested, for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the Lord hath done as much for his vineyard
<pb facs="tcp:18993:31"/>
in England, as euer he did for his vineyard in

But what then? And is not now a breaking

And are we not rather worse then bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for all that? Now if these things come to
passe, wee our selues shall bee iudges whether
the Lord hath done vs any wrong or no. Now
consider further with thy selfe (O sluggard)
what priueledge hath England more then Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el

vs, more then to them? surely neither to them
nor to vs, nor to any was euer the Lord behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
for if a man be righteous, he is righteous
for himself, saith <hi>Iob.</hi> But what promise or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

Surely not long, for scarce eight generations

them, who refuse to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to God? I speake not onely of the open
enemies, which haue wilfully striuen against
the wholesome doctrine of godlines, but also
of them that haue professed themselues Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
For how coldly, and disdainfully haue
many of them, how falsely, and dissemblingly
(like <hi>Iudas</hi>) haue othersome kissed Christ? It
is not vnknowne that Ierusalem<note place="margin">Ierusalem.</note> was once the
fountaine from whence saluation flowed into
the vttermost bounds of the earth: but at the
comming of Christ, it retained scarce a thinne
shadowe of the ancient worthines: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a while after, it not onely lost that that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
but was vtterly cast downe also, and
made a waste wildernesse: which made the
Lord Iesus shed teares when he looked vpon
the citie. What is the reason that no man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth
in seeking out the cause of so monste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
a ruine: but that the desperate wickednes
of that nation doth openly crye out that the
same was the cause thereof?</p>
               <p>Rome<note place="margin">Rome.</note> was neuer plagued with so manie
cruell slaughters in so short a time, as it hath
beene since the Gospell came thither. But
what was the cause thereof? Open thy eyes
(sluggard) and thou shalt see the cause plaine
enough, that when God brought the medicine
of his Gospel thither, as the vttermost remedie
against so many deadly diseases of lawles lust,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:35"/>
wicked partakings, and intollerable tyrannie
which raigned in that citie, they (like persons
that had sworne their own destruction) proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reiected it, and ceased not to fall from worse
to worse.</p>
               <p>The very selfe same thing wee may obserue
in this our age, both in the kingdom of France,
and elsewhere: For when the Church was as
it were newe borne againe, and had a glorious
beginning, like the rising of the Sunne, it hath
been seene soone after to slide downe and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
backe againe. And yet before the Lorde
layde those fearefull punishments vpon them,
of ciuill dissentions, and of bloudie massacres,
accompanied with many horrible mischiefes
moe, the Gospell was seene diuers and sundry
waies euery where filthilie abused: in so much
that the sudden turning vp of things that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
is not so greatly to bee wondered at, as
Gods long sufferance, in bearing with the
prodigious wickednes of our time.</p>
               <p>And in England, amongst so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
as to outward appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce had very glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
denied the Pope, and professed themselues
Gospellers: how fewe (I pray you) doe fall to
amendment of their vices? Nay rather, what
do the greater part pretend, but that when the
yoke of superstition was shake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off, they might
more licentiously giue themselues to all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
libertie? And albeit they confesse the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospell to bee true, yet where is
<pb facs="tcp:18993:35"/>
there one among many that submitteth his
necke vnto the yoke and discipline thereof?
That Christ shall be abased for their aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are content: That he shall be pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with pouertie and penurie to make them
rich, they are content: That Christ shall bee
betrayed for them, if not by them too, they are
also content: That Christ shall be whipped for
them, and imprisoned for them, and buffered
for them, and mocked at for them, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for them, they are very well content, and
like it well: but that Christ shall be the King
of their soules, and rule them, and ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sure them,
and order them, by his owne lawes and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
they will none of that; because that is
against our pleasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and against our profite,
and against our honours, and dignities: Like
the young man in the Gospell, that would doe
any thing that Christ bad him,<note place="margin">Mat. 19. 22.</note> sauing selling
away his goods for the vse of the poore: but
that he could not abide, because he was rich;
and it was not for his profite.</p>
               <p>Now then what is to be looked for, or likely
to ensue, but a most sharpe punishment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
to such wicked, &amp; wilfull contempts?
And if any thing be to be wondered at, here is
the wonder, that (considering our great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulnes)
any part of the worke remaineth
which God hath begun. And (to conclude this
poynt) wee see how the Lord hath tossed and
turned his Church from time to time: how he
<pb facs="tcp:18993:36"/>
hath from the beginning of the worlde both

will not come yet: Like the euill seruant in
the Gospel that said, My master will not come

off the day of his turning to God. And it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
that this is no news deuise of the slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard:
for he hath learned it of the scornefull
men of Ierusalem, and it is a common answere
of all sluggards that meane to dwell still in
their sinnes: It will not come yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 28. 15.</note> When the
Lord by his Prophet sent worde to Ierusalem
that a scourge was comming vpon them for
<pb facs="tcp:18993:37"/>
their sinnes, they cared not for it: for they had
made a couenant with death, and were at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with hell, that is, they had a shift for
euery thing. And admit, say they, that a scourge
do come, and runne ouer vs, and passe through
vs, yet it shall not come at vs: for We haue
made falsehood our refuge, and vnder vanitie
are wee hid. A goodly refuge, and a couering
sutable, and best beseeming the scornfull slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.
And what other refuge, or couering haue
all the sluggards of our time, but a refuge of
falsehood, and a couering of vanitie? that is a
falfe refuge, and a vaine couering, which is as
good as none at all. But because the sluggard
is at that poynt, to thinke that it is yet a great
way off: like the foole in the Gospell, who told
his soule of pulling downe his old barnes,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 20.</note> and
building bigger, and of liuing many yeares, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
that night whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his soule was to be fetched
away from him: wee will now goe a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and as wee haue proued it a thing very
likely to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a winter come after this fune-shine
summer of the Gospell: so wee will also
proue, by the grace of God, that it is not farre
off, but very likely to come shortly vpon vs. I
set neither houre, nor day, nor moneth, nor
yeare: but would haue the sluggard to knowe
that it is at hand, and nor so farre off as he doth
imagine. And let not this caueat be to dismay,
or terrifie any man, except it bee the drowsie
sluggard, whom nothing will awake: but as a
<pb facs="tcp:18993:38"/>
voyce going before the Bridegromes shoute,<note place="margin">Matth. 25. 6</note>
that they which now want oile for their lamps,
may in time prouide against his comming.
But how shall wee knowe that the winter
stormes of trouble and persecution are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
that we may make our prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Surely,
as Christ taught his Disciples to knowe when
summer is at hand: so by the same rule wee
may learne to knowe when winter is at hand
And by the figge tree both may bee learned:<note place="margin">Mat. 24. 32.</note>
                  <hi>Learne the parable of the fig tree</hi> (sayth Christ)
<hi>when her bough is yet tender, and it bringeth
foorth leaues, ye knowe that summer is neere:</hi>
Therefore by the rule of contraries, when the
figge trees bough hath lost her tendernes, and
cast her leaues, we may knowe that winter is
neere. The figge tree shall be the Church of
England, the boughes the members of the
Church, or professors of the Gospell; the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes
of the boughes, the loue of the Gosped;
the leaues, the profession of the Gospell; the
fruites of the tree, the fruites of the Gospell; as
loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlenes, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
meeknes, temperance, godlines, patience,
charitie, sobrietie, faith, repentance, mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of fleshly lusts,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 22.</note> and such like, which are
called in Scripture the fruites of the spirite:
which should bee in all the true professors of
the Gospell, because they are led by that spirit
which is a spirite of loue, and of ioy, and of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,<note place="margin">Esay. 1. 12.</note>
and of counsell, and of courage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18993:38"/>
and of the feare of the Lord, as <hi>Esay</hi> sheweth:
The hardnes of the boughes may shewe the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the Gospell, which argueth (where
it is) a departing of the grace of God: the fall
of the leafe may resemble the falling away
from the sincericie of the Gospell: which Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> calleth a departing from the faith: which
he prophecied of to come in the latter ende of
the world: which also argueth, that the end of
the world is at hand. Now, to know whether
the fig tree hath any fruite, or be casting off of
her fruite, leaues and all, great search need not
to bee made with a candle, as if it were a thing
hidden in darknesse: for it is so euident that a
man may see it a farre off. When <hi>Ieremie</hi> was
set to make search in Ierusalem for one righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
man, that it might be spared: he was not
willed to stand stil in euery place that he came
at, and narrowly to looke into euery corner, as
though he should els haue wanted matter: but
to runne to and fro in the streetes,<note place="margin">Iere. 5. 1.</note> and it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
for their wickednes was so openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that a man might see it as he ranne. So
a man neede not stand prying into euery cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of England, and leisurely to take a narrow
view of euery mans life, that were too much:
but let him runne to and fro in the streetes, and
open places of the land, and it is enough: so
openly is wickednesse professed, and so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
is our filthie nakednes laid open. <hi>Ieremi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ranne through the streetes of Ierusalem, but he
<pb facs="tcp:18993:39"/>
could not finde one that executed iudgement,
and that sought the trueth: So they that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
iudgement iustly, and seeke the trueth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sainedly
in the Church of England, are least in
sight, and must not doe it openly, least they be
noted for Puritanes. Many say, the Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
yet sweare falsely: there was swearing,
and false swearing, and common swearing in
the streets, and in the houses, and in the shops,
and in the markets, and in the courts of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:
and the same is to bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eene in England,
and all vnder the cloake of religion too. And
for these things the Lord hath striken vs, but
we haue not sorrowed: and some hath he euen
consumed to the terror of others: but neither
they, nor others haue returned to the Lord. If
we goe along with <hi>Ieremie</hi> from the common
people to the great men, what shall we finde?
Surely they should know the way of the Lord,
and the iudgement of their God should not be
hidden from them. But alas, none more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
then many of them, they haue altogether
broken the yoke of discipline, and burst the
bandes of godlines. If a man looke into the
Court, is not there also the fall of the leafe?
for how els is the time spent? but (as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

that the Lord might be iustified when wee are
iudged,<note place="margin">Psal. 51. 4.</note> and cleered when we are condemned:
because our destruction is of our selues, which
sleepe on still when wee are called, and yet
count all but a little. And this may serue as a
notable patterne of loue for Christians to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe,
in reclaiming their brethren that goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray:
whereby we are taught not to giue them
ouer at the first: but when wee haue taught, to
teach againe, and though we haue called once
and often, yet to call againe, and not to leaue
teaching, and instructing, and calling, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulating
with them till they heare, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
if there bee any sparke of hope left vnto
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18993:45"/>
vs: like those that blowe at a coale till it hath
set al the wood a burning. And in dealing thus
with our brethren, let vs but imagine that wee
are labouring to fetch one againe that is fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
into a swoune, who with often rubbing and
chafing, with much pinching, boxing; and
wringing, may bee recouered againe, or els
not.</p>
               <p>The former patterne of diligence in the Pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
was sufficient to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>troll vs all, and to
humble vs, for our slouthfulnes in our calling,
(if we were wise indeede, for a word to a wise
man is sufficient) and very effectuall is that
doctrine which the Lord hath taught vs by it:
yet it pleaseth God to goe on still in expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
and debating the matter with vs (as we
see) whereby we may learne, what a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is to awaken our sluggish nature, &amp; when
we are awake, as hard it is to keepe vs awake:
for our eyes are no sooner open, but wee fall to
nodding againe: Like the Disciples of Christ,
who slept on still, though their master called
them, though he called them lowd, and often,
though the tempter were neere, and they in
daunger of falling into the pit of temptations;
yet coulde they not watch so much as one
houre, so heauie were they: And so is it with vs,
if we bee as good as Christs disciples. Now if
the best bee so heauie and sleepie, what are the
worst? The experience hereof we haue daily:
Let vs goe but to the Temple where the word
<pb facs="tcp:18993:45"/>
is preached, and there we shall see men no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
set downe, but fast asleepe. And the like we
finde at home in perfourming our spiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
whether it bee of prayer, or reading, or
singing Psalmes, or instructing our families,
though Gods spirite doth sometime touch vs,
and awake vs, yet are we soone forgetfull, and
sleepe creepeth on againe. Therefore the Lord
giueth vs to vnderstand, that we haue neede of
many words to rowse vs, and all little enough.
For sinne is stubborne, like a monster whose
face is of brasse, whose necke is of yron, and his
heart as hard as an Adamant. And therefore
when the Prophets had to deale with the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
Iewes, the Lord told them they should
deale with a stiffenecked people, whose necks
had finewes of yron,<note place="margin">Eze. 3. 7. 8. 9</note> and therefore would not
easily bowe to the yoke, and their faces were
of brasse, and therefore would not blush at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing, and their hearts were harder then the
flint stone, and therefore would not easilie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.
They were euen such as the preachers

stil in their sinne, as if it had neuer been

them: to teach vs, that it is not enough to

other speciall vertues that he is described by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
this is one, that he swore vnto the Lorde, and

head to take any rest vntil he found out a place
for the Lord, and an habitation for the mightie
God of Iacob. Thus that holie man (percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his zeale to faint) would binde himselfe
in many obligations. And thus also in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of prayer, the feruants of God doe vse
<pb facs="tcp:18993:46"/>
many words, not because they delight in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words, and vaine babling, (as Pharisles and
Papists, which labour it with their lips, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be heard the sooner for their lip-labour)
but thereby labouring to amplifie their griefe:
and because they doe not yet sufficientlie see
the wants that be in themselues, therefore they
vse many words, as bellowes to blow vp their
mindes, and to kindle their fainting spirits in
zeale, and feruencie. And for this cause like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the seruants of God haue set themselues
to their taske of reading, and praying, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying,
that so much they will reade (if God
will) euery day, and so often they will pray e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
day,<note place="margin">Dan. 6. 10.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> set themselues
to pray three times a day at the least. And thus
Isay in these and all other things belonging
both to their calling, and to their profession,
they haue still tasked themselues, and applied
their taske through the grace of God, which
(as S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayth) worketh and laboureth in
them, fearing least otherwise they should doe
but little or nothing. And in the doing of their
taskes, it is a wonder to see how sluggish they
are, and what a number of lets, and lions lye in
their way (as the Prouerbe sayth) that they bee
constrained to pricke themselues forward, and
then they dragge their legges after them too.</p>
               <p>In this demand we are (as we see) accused,
and indited of making great delaies of those
dueties which we owe to God. A matter sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18993:47"/>
very worthie to be expostulated:<note place="margin">Note that.</note> for it is a
true token of a soule that feareth not God, to
driue off so long the doing of that which the
Lord by his word requireth to be done: for if
they feared God, they would be more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
knowing that God is able euery minute to cast
them downe to hell, and to presse them with
his iudgements. Some goe on (for all this) and
say, the time of their calling is not yet, they are
not called yet: although they heare the word,
and knowe in their owne conscience that they
doe euill, yet they goe on like desperate wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
making a mock at the iudgements of the
Lord, and say they are not called yet, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are most euidently conuicted in themselues, &amp;
by themselues. And being tolde of it, they tell
vs, that they must pray to God to be mercifull
to them in that, and so they continue still in
their rebellion, bathing and rotting in their
sinnes, like <hi>Naaman</hi> the Assyrian, who said, <hi>God
be mercifull to me in this:</hi> for though he knewe
it to bee a sinne to goe into his Rimmon, yet he
must goe in and do as his master did, and God
must dispense with him in that. Many such
<hi>Naamans</hi> there are still, which haue one Rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
or other that they knowe of, and yet they
sleepe on still in their beloued sinnes: some in
vsurie, some in whoring, some in stealing, some
in swearing, some in oppressing the poore,
some in deceiuing both poore and rich, some
in scoffing at Religion, some in prophaning
<pb facs="tcp:18993:47"/>
the Lordes sabbath, some in persecuting their
brethen, some in their ambitious and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
attempts, and some in one sinne, and
some in another, euery one hath his Rimmon.
And thinketh in his base conceite, that the
Lord is as negligent in punishing of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous
rebellions, as they are in obeying
his holy commaundements: but let them take
heed of dallying too long with his Maiestie,
for hee will not bee mocked, though they bee
deceiued.</p>
               <p>The Children of God are commended (in
the word) for their diligence in obeying the
will of God, when once they know what was
his pleasure:<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 23.</note> When <hi>Abraham</hi> was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to circumcise himselfe, and all the male

to cast out his sonne <hi>Ismael</hi> ouer night, hee
gate vp early in the morning, and did it, as hee
was commaunded, which might bee a hooke
to pull out his very bowels: to cast out his
sonne was grieuous vnto him (as the storie
sheweth) yet hee did neither deny, nor delaye
the dooing of it. So in the 22. of Genesis we
reade, that when he was commaunded to offer
vp in sacrifice his onely sonne <hi>Isack,</hi> (which
might haue cut his heart strings in peeces) yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18993:48"/>
hee delayed not the time, but rose vp early in

corruptions, both in the Church &amp; common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,

denie his master:<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 61</note> yet at the last, when Christ
looked vpon him he remembred himselfe, and
went out and wept bitterly. Wee haue oftner
then three times denied our master, Christ
hath both looked vpon vs, and spoken vnto vs,
but yet we remember not our selues: nay, we
are so farre from weeping and grieuing at the
matter, that we rather reioyce &amp; laugh it out.
Therefore if we stil so continue, what weeping
and wailing will there bee at the last? For it is
sayd in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Luk. 6. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe be to them that laugh
and reioyce now: for they shall weepe and lament.</hi>
When God had both warned <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let
Israel goe, and plagued him for detayning of
them still: at length he asked him this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Exod. 10. 3.</note>
                  <hi>How long wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
me?</hi> So the Lord hath warned vs often to
let our sinnes goe, and hath also in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb facs="tcp:18993:51"/>
plagued vs for keeping them still. Now he
asketh vs also the same question, How long
will you refuse to humble your selues before
the Lord? which argueth that we are growne
as hard &amp; as desperate as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, which
is also a signe of greater plagues yet to ensue.
Now this is fearefull and grieuous, when the
Lord commeth vpon vs with such questions:
for that sheweth that he doth not onel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

our sinnes, but the long time that wee haue
prouoked him by them, and that he is euen
wearie in bearing them any longer, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to vnburthen himselfe of them, and to
beare no longer. And commonly we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
in the scriptures, that when the Lord co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
with (<hi>How long? and how often?</hi>) there
is some great iudgement following: as in the
14. of Numbers the 11. verse, <hi>The Lord sayd t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
Moses, How long will this people prouoke me, and
how long will it be, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> they beleeue me, for all the
signes which I haue shewed amongst them?</hi> Then
marke what followeth in the next verse, <hi>I will
smite them with the pestilence, and destroy them,
&amp;c.</hi> to shewe, that though the Lord beareth
long, yet hee will not beare alwaies. When
Christ sayd, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, how often
would I haue gathered thee, as a henne g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thereth
her young ones, and thou wouldest not?</hi> So great
was his griefe conceiued with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of those mischiefes that were to come
vpon Ierusalem, that hee could not vtter his
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18993:52"/>
speech without shedding of teares. Therefore
when the Lord commeth, expostulating the
matter with vs in this sort, with <hi>How long,</hi> and
<hi>how often, &amp;c.</hi> then let vs beware, if euer wee
beware, whether it be spoken in generall to al,
or in particular to any one man, that hath been
often warned by the hand of God vpon him.</p>
               <p>Had not <hi>Moses</hi> prayed for the Israelites,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 10 11.</note>
they had perished oftentimes in their sinnes:
so if some did not pray for vs, (whom yet wee
can as hardly abide, as they could abide <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
when they would haue stoned him) surelie
wee had perished yet this time. When the
Lord sware in his wrath that the Iewes should
not enter into his rest, he set them downe the
causes which moued him thereunto, and those
were in number fiue: They tempted him, to
trie what he could doe: then they prouoked
him by their often murmurings, &amp;c. then they
grieued him with their continuall vnkindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and rebellions: then their hearts were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with error. And how could it be otherwise?
for they cared not for the knowledge of his
waies. And to aggrauate the matter, &amp; make
their sinne appeare in his full ripenes, he sets
downe the time how long they had continued
at that stay, saying, <hi>Fortie yeares long haue I
been grieued with this generation, &amp;c.</hi> Fortie
houres had been much to grieue the Lord, but
fortie yeares was intolerable. Now the same
sinnes are we also to be endited for: and if no
<pb facs="tcp:18993:52"/>
Iurie will finde the inditement, our owne
consciences will crie guiltie. And how long
haue wee grieued, and tempted, and prouoked
the Lord? Hath it not been euer since the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
came among vs? waxing euery day worse
and worse? And what doth that now lacke of
fortie yeares long, haue I been grieued with
this generation? surely but a little. Thus the
Lord we see marketh wel enough euery thing,
not onely what we doe, and how we liue, and
how we sinne: but how long we haue sinned,
and how often we haue been warned, &amp; how
long we haue refused to returne, &amp; to humble
our selues: yea the Lord marketh how many
yeres, how many moneths, how many weeks,
how many houres, how many sermons, &amp; how
many sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces in euery sermon we haue passed
ouer in careles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt, without trembling at
the word of the Lord, or profiting by his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.
And according to the time of his lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
suffering &amp; patience, &amp; of our stubbornnes &amp;
disobedience, shall his iudgements be powred
vpon vs, if wee doe not preuent them by true
and speedie repentance. Long did the olde
worlde sleepe in their sinnes: long did <hi>Noah</hi>
preach against their sins, and at last the floud
came and awakened them to their cost. Long
did Sodom and Gomorrha sleepe, and long
did they vexe the soule of righteous <hi>Lot</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, &amp; at last the fire of Gods wrath
awakened them. Long slept Ierusalem in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18993:53"/>
but at the last their enemies awaked
them. So <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> heard his dreame
as a dreame, and <hi>Daniel</hi> told him what would
come of it long before it came, but he fell a
sleepe againe: and at last the Lord turned him
out amongst the beast, and then he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
himselfe: but he was seuen yeares first in
learning his lesson.</p>
               <p>And this is most certaine, The longer the
blow be in fetching, the heauier will the wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
be when it commeth: And the deeper the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
bee drawne in the bowe, the deeper it
pearceth when it is let flie. Now in trueth, all
this time the Lord hath forborne vs, he is but
bending of his bowe, and whetting of his
sword, and aiming at the marke: and because
he doth not yet let goe at vs, wee thinke there
is no such matter. But we deale with the Lord
(oh miserable wretches that wee are) as birds
play with a skare-crowe standing in a corne
field with a bowe and arrowe in his hands, as
though he would shoote, but doth not: and
therefore they euen waxe bolde by little and
little, and at last euen flie to him, and sit downe
vpon him, and picke vpon him. In all holie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
of Gods vnspeakeable maiestie be this
comparison made, which serueth onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the base, and brutish conceipt that the
wicked haue of God, and his long suffering of
them. But who knoweth the force of the Lords
wrath?<note place="margin">Psal. 90. 11.</note> (sayth the Psalmist) for after as a man
<pb facs="tcp:18993:53"/>
feareth, so shal his wrath be: and when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
it shall burne like mountaines of fire,
which no sea of water shall be able to quench,
if once his wrath be kindled, yea but a little.</p>
               <p>And on the other side, (for the comfort of
the godly and faithful, which haue a sanctified
desire to awake out of their sleep, and to serue
the Lord at the last in all holie obedience, and
careful diligence) though we haue long temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Lord, and tried him: yet if now at the
last we awake in trueth, we shall finde, that as
he hath been long in suffering, so he will bee as
rich in mercie. The prodigall childe was long
absent, and at last (returning truely humbled)
was welcome to his father, and ioyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and so shall we be to our heauenly father,
if wee make such a returne, and that betimes.
Therefore let none be so desperatly minded as
to continue still his old course, as though there
were no hope of grace at his returne. And let
none be so discouraged with the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of his long sleepe, as to runne quite away from
the Lord: for God will finde vs out wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
we become, as he did <hi>Adam</hi> when he had
hidden himselfe (as hee thought) among the
trees of the garden. The diuell indeed will be
readie to shewe thee what a great way thou
hast to goe backe againe, what a number of
dueties neglected thou hast to repent of while
thou didst lie asleepe, and how hard a thing, &amp;
impossible it is for thee to performe all this;
<pb facs="tcp:18993:54"/>
and all to discourage thee, and to keepe thee
still fast asleep, but beleeue him not: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth the Lord els put thee in mind of the
same things, but to haue thee awake and bee
diligent in doing thy duetie hereafter? And
wherfore els doth he thus reach forth the hand
of his grace vnto thee, but to helpe thee vp,
which canst not help vp thy selfe? Therefore
giue ouer now at the last, &amp; be resolute in the
worke of the Lord, and the Lord hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that all that is past shall be forgotten. Let
vs therefore in the feare of God, leaue our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying,
and descanting, and lay this doctrine
to our hearts, that it may appeare in our liues,
that wee be truely awakened, and all will bee
well: if not, but our purpose bee to sleepe still,
then the Lord by his Apostle doth giue vs to
vnderstand, that custome of sinne will bree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

hardnes of heart, and hardnes of heart will
bring forth impenitencie in the end, that thou
shalt not bee able to repent if thou wouldest.
And thus haue wee heard the Lord calling to
the Sluggard, and expostulating with him for
his long sleeping. Now wee will heare what
answer the Sluggard maketh vnto the Lord.</p>

as a beast that is past all feare of God,
and shame of the world, resolueth still to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in his olde course, counting all but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
When <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> sawe their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
they blushed, and feared, and ran away for
feare, thus wrought their pride and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
when <hi>Caine</hi> sawe his wickednes, hee
knew not what to doe, except despayre, but
wished it vndone againe, and thus did murther
bestirre himselfe, when hee was awakened:
when <hi>Dauid</hi> was roused for his adulterie and
murther, he said that he had offended: when
<hi>Paul</hi> was called to his answer for persecuting
Christ, hee fell to the grounde astonied, and
tooke a new course: when <hi>Peter</hi> was awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for denying his Master, hee went out and
wept. And thus wee see that when pride and
disobedience haue been called, they haue fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the iudge, and when murther and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
were called, they feared the iudge, when
persecution and treason were called, they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the iudge: And all other sinnes being rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
out of their holes, haue startled at the call,
seeking either how to yeelde, or how to flie.
And being conuicted, haue all cryed like the
<pb facs="tcp:18993:55"/>
prisoner at the barre, O my Lord be good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me now, and I will neuer do the like againe.
But when slouth and negligence were called,
and endited by the name of careles his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
they (in stead of submitting themselues
to the mercie of the iudge,) stand to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
of their faulte, and like beastes both care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
shameles, and graceles, in stead of saying,
pardon O Lorde that which is past, and wee
will take a new course, they crye out to the
wonder of all the world, and the vtter shame
of themselues, <hi>Yet a little more sleepe, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
slumber, &amp;c.</hi> We haue not enough yet, and
all is but a little, so that shamefull was pride,
and rebellion, and murther, and whoredome,
and persecution, and treason, and all other
sinnes, but shameles is the Sluggard, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
them all in wickednes.</p>
               <p>Here then wee are taught to make a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our sluggishnes: and it argueth that
we count all too little, to giue vnto sinne and
Sathan: as though they were two such deare
friendes of ours, that wee coulde not doe too
much for them. And the diuell on the other
side who hath taken vp his lodging in the
wicked, and gotten like a fawne ghest into the
mindes of the godly, hee crieth still, a little
more, a little longer, and though we haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
him with his impes to lye sleeping in our
Churches, in our common wealths, and in our
shoppes, and markets, in our houses, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:56"/>
and in our soules almost fortie yeares,
and in some twise fortie yeares: yet hee hath
taught vs to say, yet a little, and a little, and still
he must haue a little more, like <hi>Achsah</hi> in 15.
of <hi>Ioshua:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 15.</note> who when she had begged of her
Father an inheritance of the South countries,
then she must haue certaine grounds with wels
and springs. Such a shameles begger is sinne,
and Sathan, that they neuer leaue begging,
like hungrie courtiers, and couetous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
which will not sticke to beg their owne
brethren for fooles, to haue their lands: and
not rest there neither, but would beg the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the Kings backe, and the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
too, with a good will, if they thought they
might haue them for the begging; &amp; yet count
all but a little. So plaieth the diuell too, he will
still haue a little, and a little, and neuer leaue till
by little and a little he getteth both body and
soule into hell. And so sweete hath he made s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the tast of the wicked, that they crie still
a little more of it, and finde no fault with it: but
that there is too little, and they cannot haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of it; like little children which knowe
not what is good for them: if they beginne to
tast hony once, they will not leaue eating by
their good wils, till they bee sicke with eating.
And so greedie of sleepe is the Sluggard, that as
<hi>Esau</hi> would sell his birthright for a messe of
pottage; so hee will sell his soules right for a
messe of sleepe, and a little more of sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18993:56"/>
But as for religion, and things pertaining to
the worship and seruice of God: as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the waies of God, and the graces of the
spirite of God: they thinke that of such things
they haue enough, when they haue nothing,
like the luke-warme Laodiceans,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 17.</note> who thought
they were rich, and increased with goods, and
had neede of nothing: when they were wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
&amp; miserable, &amp; poore, &amp; blind, &amp; naked.
And here now appeareth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the wicked and the godly: for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God hauing a little mortified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
through the grace of God, they are come
to this point: that all they can doe is too little
for the seruice of God, but are desirous still to
serue him more, &amp; better, &amp; still to bring more
and more knowledge, more faith, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and more loue, and more zeale, and
more holines, and more courage, and more

of the Church, without any tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

same to be made by the scriptures: and at last
the worde of God (which should haue sit as
Iudge) was brought down, and set at the barre
to be iudged by men, yea by his enemies too.
And by little and little it came to this paste,
that the Church could not erre in any thing:
and that the Church of Rome must be that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
priuiledged Church which could not erre.
And then they thrust vpon vs what they listed,
as the Philistims made <hi>Sampson</hi> doe what they
would, when they had put out his eyes. But
this was done by degrees: for first, the Bishops
and teachers waxed rich and wealthie: then
they grew to be proud and lordly: then coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:18993:62"/>
and greedie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then idle and lazie: and then
cruell and bloudie, as also subtill and craftie, to
couer all withall. And when the starres thus
began to fall from heauen,(that is, from the
heauenly doctrine, and from heauenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation,
to become so carnall and earthlie
minded) the sunne of righteousnes also the
Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, that true light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be darkened, and his Gospell to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praued,
&amp; then the Moone (that is) his Church
must needes lose her light: for shee hath no
light but from the sunne: and then (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ioel</hi> speaketh)<note place="margin">Ioel. 2. 31.</note> was the Church also tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into bloud: for vpon these things grewe
most horrible persecutions in the Church,
through the malice &amp; crueltie of the Prelates,
so that she failed both in light and life toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
And so it is to bee feared, that (for our
sinnes) it may fall out againe: for as by little &amp;
little the candle goeth out: so by little &amp; little
darknes commeth in. And after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
came in such monsterous abuses in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
both in men and women, such excesse and

till by little and little many of them come to
shame and confusion. And thus haue all ill

customes growne vp from time to time, both
in the Church, and in the Common-wealth, &amp;
all by the custome of the diuell, that is, by little
and by little: yea, and that so softly and slilie
he creepethinto men, that they can hardly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see him, or feele him when he commeth:
As wee see the weedes growe vp amongst the
corne while men sleepe, but so softly that no
man can perceiue how they growe, or how
much they growe at once: but that they doe
growe, and in time (if they be not plucked vp)
ouergrow the corne, euery man may see that:
Or as the Iuie by little and little creepeth vpon
the oke, till at last he doth ouergrowe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the oke: So doth sinne by little and little
get vp, and get the strongest and the mightiest
men sometimes vnder him: as it did <hi>Salomon,</hi>
and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and diuers others, for all
their wisedome, and learning, and iudgement,
and experience, which they had both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
&amp; of the world. Now, to saue our selues
from this vsurping and encroching enemie, it
shall bee our best course still to pray vnto our
God, for the helpe of his grace, and holie spirit,
and stil to perswade our soules and our friends
by the word of God, to make resistance at the
verie first entrie, and continually to withstand
the beginnings and first motions of Sathan vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any sinne, lest by little and little now a stone

himselfe against vs, vntill he hath battered and
spoyled all the good things that were in our

littles may the better appeare vnto vs, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that sinne is like leauen, a little wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will sower the whole lumpe of dowe: It is
like fire, whereof but one sparke is sufficient to
kindle a great fire, and to burne down a whole
citie: It is like a tree, whose stubbes remaining
in the ground are enough to giue one a fall: It
is like <hi>Iezabel</hi> that painted harlot, whose verie
remnants, as the skul of her head, &amp; the palmes
of her hands, must be buried, least they infect
the ayre. A mote in the Sunne is but a little

yet none of the least plagues. The lice were
lesse then the flies, yet one of the greatest
plagues that came vnto Egypt. And such be
our sinnes, which wee call little sinnes, and the
Papists call them veniall sinnes, that may bee
washed away with a little holie water, &amp;c. we
count them little and nothing, and not to bee
stood vpon, nor once to bee touched: but in
time wee may proue them to bee the greatest
plagues that will trouble vs, if securely &amp; rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we venture vpon them. For though the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
and motions perhaps bee but small in
respect of grosse sinnes, and hainous crimes,
<pb facs="tcp:18993:63"/>
yet there is a hidden corruption in our nature,
(whose very froth doth continually annoy the
children of God) and that may threaten some
hainous downfal in time to come: which hath
made euen men of very good report and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation
to hang downe their heads, still fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their secret hypocrisie, as that which may
breake forth to the shame of all the former in
time to come. In regard whereof, Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
haue such a ielousie, that they tremble at
the very first motions, and the least occasion to
sinne that can be. And the rather too, because
they see many excellent men in gifts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

way, are most foule, and ougly diuels by the
worde of God: yet no man must say so, but
at his perill. For the diuell when hee hath
brought vp a fashion, will followe the fashion
himselfe: and the fashion is amongst hunters,
that if any body doe call a hound or a spaniell
by the name of a dogge, he must be punished,
because the hauke hath no taile, but a traine,
as if she were some state: and two bee not a
couple, but a cast, and a brase, and I knowe
not what: So, if a man come when the diuell
is at hunting, and call the wicked his dogges,
by the name of hell hounds; as they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
he must be punished: for they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dogs nor hel hounds, but good fellowes:
and their hunting of vertue and godlines, is
good fellowship: And hereupon a common
harlot is commonly called a good fellowe.
And still the diuell followeth the fashion:

toole and instrument in their shops: and if
a man come into their shoppes, and doe but
touch any of them, or call them by other
names then the occupation doth call them by,
(as to cal a spade a spade a spade) is a forfeit called for
by and by. So if a man come into the diuels
warehouse, and doe but touch a piece, except
it be to buy it; and doe but call his tooles and
implements by other names then hee and the
occupation doth call them: as to cal a knaue a
knaue, you shal straightway haue one or other
at you for a forfet, which doe serue for nothing
els, but to watch for such booties: and are as
glad of them too as sumners are of citations:
or as quiristers in Cathedrall Churches, when
they see a man come into the quire with his
spurres on his heeles: because then they hope
to get something to encrease their commons,

his conscience against the trueth in any

will grow to such things fast enough without

them to shame, and their parents to smart and

And of this bodily pouertie there bee also two
kinds: some belonging to the godly; and
some to the wicked, for both good and bad
haue oftentimes their part in these wantes.
So that good men, and honest men may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

by pouertie and want, though these thinges

to make them better, as pouertie to bridle

to succour others: by which we may see that

because there shall be euer some poore

<hi>Thou shalt open thy hand vnto thy brother,</hi>

needie, &amp;c. As if they were of our familie and
charge, to be prouided for by vs. And to this
doth the Son of God, the Lord Iesus also giue
witnes:<note place="margin">Mat. 26. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>The poore</hi> (saith he) <hi>you shall alwaies

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18993:73"/>
in bodily presence) <hi>and looke what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
would doe for me, doe it for them:</hi> to shew that
if the poore were wanting, the rich should not
haue whereupon to exercise the works of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie,
and christian compassion.</p>
               <p>Another reason why there are poore in the
world aswell as rich, is, that by such a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
Gods bountifull liberalitie might appeare to
the rich, as he would haue the liberalitie of the
rich appeare to the poore. God could haue
made all alike, and enriched all alike, if it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him: but hee sawe this inequalitie to bee
more for his glorie; wherein appeareth so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
singular arguments of his vnspeakable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and power, and mercie, and goodnes
towards all men, and all his creatures. For if al
were head, where were the comelines of the
bodie? And what doth shew the height of the
mountaine but the valley that lieth vnder it?
And if the rich consider well of the worke of
God in this poynt, they shall finde great cause
to loue the poore, and not to disdaine them.
We see how proude and insolent many are if
they get vp a gorgious house ouer their heads,
or a veluet coate vpon their backes, or a golde
chaine about their necks: and as for their poore
neighbours, they count them but as peasants
and slaues in respect of themselues. But alas
poore soules, what is it that setteth out the
brauerie of their building, but the poore cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that standeth by it? And in what estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:18993:73"/>
would their veluets and silkes bee had, if
some did not weare frize, and goe plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled?
And againe, if none were vnlearned,
then who would reuerence the learned? or
what account would there be of Artes and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coces,
if the knowledge of them were equallie
giuen to euery one? And where doth wisdome
shine most in her glorious beautie, but in the
middest of fooles? Therefore men should leaue
admiring of themselues, and despising of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
which come short of them, whether it be
in the riches of the bodie, or in the riches of the
minde, and learne to praise the wisedome and
goodnes of the giuer and disposer of them, and
in all humblenes of minde vse them to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of the giuer, and the benefite of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
And further, how could the rich liue
without the poore and baser sort of people,
whom God hath made their seruants to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
their wants? For as it is not meete the
ploughman should weare the Crowne: so is it
as vnfit for the King to holde the plough. And
therefore as in the bodie naturall God placed
diuers members, and all differing one from an
other, that one might be seruiceable to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
so in the bodie politicall he hath in no
lesse wisedome made diuers degrees &amp; estates
of men, that one might be seruiceable &amp; help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
vnto another. And thus wee see that for
diuers causes the Lord will haue the poore still
amongst the rich, and that good men haue bin
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18993:74"/>
in pouertie aswell as bad: and yet the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               <p>As there be good poore men, so be there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
wicked poore men, which are become
poore and miserable through their owne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and slothfulnes: such are they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> speaketh vnto in my text. And to
such persons, pouertie is both a reproch of
men, and a iudgement of God: for as it is no
shame to suffer, but to suffer for euill doing: so
it is no shame to bee poore, but to become
poore through our owne negligence and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes.
Of those that beare the burthen of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie
in that sort there be some in the Church,
and some in the common wealth: of Church
men that bee in pouertie, some are of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
and antichristian Church, and some of
the christian Churches. In the popish church
there are a companie of idle Monkes and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

ers, and hedge priests, and cloisterers, which
professe wilfull pouertie, making the worlds

what need the Sluggard care for such a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Nay then it is no iudgement at all, but
a blessing and a happines: and so by that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
the Sluggard were a blessed and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
man, and the Sluggards life were the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happy life that could bee deuised in this
world, but that cannot bee; for here wee see
pouertie and necessitie set vpon the Sluggard
to punish him for his slothfulnes. In our chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church also we haue seene some both in
the ministerie and otherwise, who liued in
good estate: and yet afterward through their
couetousnes and ambition haue fallen into
great decay: for when they were not content
with that which was conuenient for them, but
still would haue more: it hath happened of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
to them as it did to the dogge, that
hauing a piece of meate in his mouth, would
snatch at the shadowe of the meate in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so when he thought to haue both, hee
lost both.</p>
               <p>In the scriptures there are diuers causes of
pouertie set downe, and pouertie is made a
punishment for diuers kindes of offenders,
and is a whip for the backe of many fooles:
it is a whippe for the Sluggards backe, that in

punisheth the cruell oppressour, so will it also
punish those which are rash and prophane in

(as many are) attended vpon and haunted by
