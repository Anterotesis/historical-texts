            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:14877:5"/>
forwards they went in theire euill, &amp; by coloured craftines drew many simple harted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after them, in a blind kind of schisme. And this not only within the Citty, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad they practised, to the abusing of many. Had they had the power of our Bishops, doubtlesse they would haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned me, and had they had the power of our Prince, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all question, they would, haue slaine mee. They can speake against the power they haue not, but had they that they would, it would be greater then that which others with vs haue, euen a power for trampeling Kinges, crownes and scepters vnder theire feet, little or nothing differing

from Papall supremacy. Hee that knowes not that, is very sillily acquainted with the too true stories of our times, and the positiue doctrines of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall leaders in that kind. But to proceed.</p>
            <p>VVhile thus they labored to make men hate mee and my labors, I toiled in my ministry, wheresoeuer the dore of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance was opened vnto me, and God mercifully gaue vnto me the holy likengs of many. Yea, some of these, that had beene charged not to heare me, did (God beeing mercifull vnto them) repaire to my Sermons, concluding vvith themselues to vvalke by the Apostles rule, namely, to <hi>try all things, and then keepe that is good.</hi> In fine, they perceaued how they had beene <hi>hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winked,</hi>

Gentle Reader, consider of it soberly, and the Lorde giue thee vnderstanding in al things. Looke how I taxed them at first, they haue made it good at the last. But how many of them haue the grace to laie downe their enmitie towards me, to confesse their euill, and accordingly to make satisfaction? well, if I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken euill, beare witnesse of the euill, but if it bee but trueth, why still doe they smite mee? The trueth is greate and will conquer, and better for them to be subdued <hi>vnto</hi> it, then subdued <hi>of</hi> it. As for their followers, let them beware they followe them not in euill, howsoeuer it be their duety to reuerence their good. Be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of all, as they be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Christ, but not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

haue fully got the thing we faithed or beleeued: for ceremonies bee but as a waggon for conuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith to his iournies end.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:14877:139"/>
in this respect it is, that Charitie in the 1.

And for such continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce eternall, it is also, that God (neuer cal led by name of faith, or Hope) is called of saint Iohn by the name of Loue or Charitie.</p>
