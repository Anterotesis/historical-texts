         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Vindication of the Round-heads.</head>
            <p>FIrſt whereas that Libell begins with our head,
wee therefore pronounce it a Capitall Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell.</p>
            <p>It then butts at our hornes which in deſpite of
that Libell ſhall ſhoot out to a greater length, and
be more viſible then they were, there being no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting
ſince Doctors Commons ſuffred an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe.</p>
            <p>As for the Cavalliers, our black and blew Armes
and Sides doe confeſſe that deere truth, and we one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay they are a Company of Abſoloms, and wee
hope to ſee them hang'd in their long Locks for that
affront.</p>
            <p>To the ſhutting upon Shopps, we anſwer, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as when the Sky falls you may catch Larkes,
juſt ſo when Biſhops goe downe we may ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>As for the Whitebrothes, &amp;c. they are diſhes
the Libeller would lick his lips at, and we ſay, that
at one of thoſe Feaſts we edifie ſo much, and grow
ſo ſtrong, that the Devill himſelfe cannot tame
us.</p>
            <p>To that point where he ſaith that wee hold to
maintaine Biſhop, Order, learning and Unity, in
the Church, Univerſityes and Common-Wealth,
<pb facs="tcp:64743:3"/>
is Prophaneneſſe, ſuperſtition, and plaine Popery,
Though it be put upon us as a jeere, yet thus wee
confirme it; Firſt, to maintain Order is proph<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
for if there were no Order (as it is amongſt
as) there could be no tranſgreſſion of the Order,
and conſequently no prophaneſſe. Secondly, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is ſuperſtition, for thereby Schollers are ſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
with ſuffient arguments againſt us, that they dare
ſtand ſtiffe upon their owne knowledge and as it
were overtopps us. Laſtly peace and Vnion is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi>
for what doe the Papiſts more boaſt of then
their Uniformity, That we may not therefore be
like them, we entend as long as we may have any
Countenance, to ſet all the Kingdome together by
the ears, whereby we in time ſhall become as famous
for our ſeperations as they, for their Uniformity.</p>
            <p>As for the Tearmes of <hi>Roundheads and prickears,</hi> we
ſay it is a ſeemly ſight, and if our example could but
beget that faſhion, amongſt the Courtiers, they
would look juſt like ſo many <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and
<hi>Abednegoes,</hi> in the Kings Houſe, to the amazement
nay afrightment of all forraign nations that ſhould
behold them, which ſome of them may eaſily doe,
without the helpe of a Barber, 'tis but even pulling
off a Cap of haire, and the thing is done if not over
done.</p>
            <p>Then for our Lecturers of both Sexes, I pray you
who is it but they that beget Children Dayly and
Hourly in our Churches? The men haild out of the
world, and the women pull them in by the ſhirts of
the fleſh, and in ſhort, time draw them emptie of
Carnall things, abating much of their fleſhly luſt,
<pb facs="tcp:64743:3"/>
leaving them onely to the comfort of a creſtfalne
Spirit which wee call Repentance, and after that
brunts over they quickly learne the Miſtery of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle,
break-faſts which ſurely proveth Cordiall
and Reſtorative, enabling them to goe through with
the worke they take in hand Cheerefully and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Community betwixt the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
and the Siſters, ſurely ſurely no fleſh is able
to reſiſt the ſweet alurement of a zealous fleire when
ſhe heares a not able piece of ſtuffe from the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Lecturer, or of a goodly Sky-coloured gleg up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
upon the pricking of her conſcience, and the
Deepe-ſigh of two minuits long preſently after it,
for theſe cauſes we wonder that the yong Gentlemen
of the Inns of Court do not convert, verily the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catives
thereunto are plump, and ſmoath, and yet
rough enough in ſome places, (but thoſe are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
places, and therefore not worth mentioning)
They are no <hi>Ieſebels</hi> paynted or brayded, but rather
faithfull <hi>Rahabs,</hi> penitent Harlots. Another induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Gentlemen might be good Husbandry:
for queſtionleſſe, the Commons are larger, and the
payment leſſer. Beſides, they teach the Tone of the
Noſe an Artificiall way, as wel as the Siſters of
Saint <hi>Giles</hi> in ruefull earneſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we hope this will
be conſidered.</p>
            <p>Touching the Woods and Sawpits, they were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
frequented onely in thoſe times, when Learning
played the Tyrant, by Commiſſion, ſince which extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation;
every of our own houſes are Synagogues for
that purpoſe. And for the putting out lights, ſome
reaſons may be ſhewed, and ſome not; one cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:64743:4"/>
thereof may be, for that in our Prayers we ſhould
ſee each others yawning, gaping and ſtaring upward,
the divine rapture would be converted to a lowd
laughter at one anothers ill-favoured faces, and we ſo
prevented of that fruit, which from the exerciſe will
otherwiſe ariſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for other reaſons they are not to
be diſcovered to any reprobate, whoſe haire is longer
then his eares.</p>
            <p>Then the Lybel wrings us by the Noſe, the Noſe
is to be conſidered as part of the Face, and is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of one Sence (then 'tis well you'l ſay we
have ſome ſence) but you ſhall finde we make other
uſe of it then you expect, for even as the Apoſtles
did ſpeak with Tongues, ſo verily do we ſpeake with
Noſes, yea, with fiery Noſes, which do guide a Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
and Tintinable relliſh to our Language; like
the hum of a Bel, or the drove of a Bagpipe; but (as
the Song hath it) let <hi>Symons</hi> Beard alone, ſo let <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
Noſe alone.</p>
            <p>For the Ruffe, the Dublet, and the Breeches, they
have their ſignifications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Ruffe ſheweth how ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
we are in our Choller, the Doublet is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of the Stomacke which is ſpacious, and the
ſhortneſſe of the Breeches, conduceth to the length
of the Leg, and therefore demonſtrates our adverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to the Charactor of the Duck, O Ducks,
plaguie Creatures.</p>
            <p>As for our Faith, Charity and good Works, we
linke them thus together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Religion is built on
Faith only, and great need there is it ſhould be ſtrong,
in reſpect the other Graces and Symptomes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
mindedneſſe are ſeldome apparant in us, not
need they be ſo, For Faith applyeth it ſelfe to things
<pb facs="tcp:64743:4"/>
not ſeen, our Charity and good Works were never ſeen
nor ever ſhall be, for that is the common way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and diſſonant from the rules of ſingularity; but
ours preſcribeth a new way to be ſaved by ſtratagem.</p>
            <p>The length of the Prayer is a qualification in the
Lungs, the toutologie thereof a Vertigo in the Braine,
and the earneſtneſſe of the ſame, a habit got by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
which ſeemeth to ſtraine the interiours of the
whole man, with a kind of Divine Witchcraft, even
raviſheth the Soules of the tender Siſters, and filleth
them with a ſervent deſire to experience the ſtrength
of thoſe able bodies that retain ſuch powerfull graces.</p>
            <p>As for the Robes, Geſtures, and Utenſils Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick,
what is a Canonical cote, but a woollen Smock;
or a Surpleſſe, but an over-wide Linnen Smock, and is
a habite quite contrary to a plaine Text, that men
ſhould not put on Womens Apparell, what are the
ornaments of the Altar, but Images of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the forme of Candleſticks and Emboſſed
Books, and the Cringes and Bowings, but Sacrifices of
dexterous hamſtrings thereunto.</p>
            <p>As for the Synod of <hi>Morefields</hi> and <hi>Pimlico,</hi> wee
doubt not but the Canons there deviſed, will hould
good with as much ſucceſſe as thoſe laſt enacted a
<hi>Paules,</hi> eſpecially for that the Agent of them are
now, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now truely and verily for the Reſolution and the
Reformation, it could not have been <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>ed, though

               </gap> it;
but onely the raſcally Libeller put it in jearing
Termes; but that may be requited when we meet him
in Cheapſide.</p>
            <p>Now for an Addition of better Arguments for the
maintenance of this Religion, take theſe few; It is
<pb facs="tcp:64743:5"/>
confirmed by the lamentable death of a godly Knight,
the Proto-Martyr of the Spiritual cauſe, who becauſe
he is dead, our Secretary (being principall Councell in
this Vindication) thinks it good manners or, let him
reſt in peace; but in his life time <hi>Ram-Ally</hi> knew him
well.</p>
            <p>Rome is the Beaſt with ten Hornes, we having but
two Hornes, are therefore no Roman Beaſts; thoſe
Horns were empailed with Crownes, which our horns
rather puſh againſt. A glorious Whore did ride on
that Beaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we are Beaſts our ſelves, and ride the
Whore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are the onely Roman Puritans, that our
ſingularities ought to take the right hand of theirs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they are the Brothers of Jeſus the Sirname<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but we
are the Brothers of Chriſt the proper name, which
alwaies preſerves the eminence of the Pedigree in
every great Family.</p>
            <p>That this Religion is meerly of the Spirit, what
do you ſay to many of us, that can reade as perfectly
at the wrong end of the Book, as at the right end; or
to a Brown-Baker that will take a Sermon <hi>Verbatim</hi>
in Charactors (which you would take for Conjuring
formes, they look ſo ghaſtly) and yet could never reade
a Letter of the Book, or to another, that never read his
Accidence, and hateth Latine, yet derives Hebrew
roots with facility; if theſe be not peculiar and ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

us, and the Reſolution is an honeſt Libel.</p>
