            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter of Advice from a PROTESTANT OUT OF IRELAND TO THE Masters of Apprentices In the CITIES of London and Weſtminſter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>e have had the Advice to the <hi>Apprentices,</hi> we hope you will Concur with them in this Honourable Undertaking, ſeeing it is You, your Families and Eſtates, that is ſtruck at, by your and their Enemies. Methinks we ſhould hear you <hi>Maſters</hi> ſaying, We would be glad our <hi>Apprentices</hi> would appear in this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Work, which will be ſo Honourable for them, in being ſo Couragious for the Proteſtant Cauſe, which ſo much of the World approve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It will be much for our Honour in this, that we have not only allowed this Liberty, but we have Encouraged them, and ſent them out like Men. Gentlemen, this will be for your Honour, and will raiſe a Monument of Praiſe to your never to be forgotten Name, in after Ages, of Loyalty and Stedfaſtneſs to ſo good a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> as God hath by his good Hand of Providence brought to the Royal Thorne: Beſides, how kindly the <hi>King</hi> will take it, if you be found in this Honourable Undertaking, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this juncture of time, when on all Hands there is ſo much occaſion. Do as you would be done by, conſider how many poor Diſtreſſed Proteſtants here are <hi>Ireland,</hi> that is drove from Poſt to Pillar, have no Houſe to go to, no Bed to lie on; in ſhort, no Relief: Now ſuppoſe it was your Caſe (as you know not how ſoon it may be) what would you deſire from your Brethren but Relief; and would you not think it unkind if they ſhould not ſend it to you? And if <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo, as well as we, ſhould ſtand in need of your Aſſiſtance, would not this be a ſad thing? and what may you expect, but if a Blow do fall, it will come on you at laſt, either upon Body, or deep in the Purſe: And we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve for the Trade you now have, there may be ſeveral Thouſands of <hi>Apprentices</hi> ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and no lack of them. Conſider alſo, how much of a Diſloyal Spirit it will ſhow to be in you, if you do not Incourage theſe your Servants, who are willing to venter theit Lives, for the ſafety of your ſelves and Families; and alſo if you do not Incourage this, and the Enemy do come upon you on one hand or the other, may you not have juſt cauſe to Retort upon your ſelves with theſe Reflections, you might have had opportunity of uſing the means that hath been effectual in former Ages, but you would not Incourage it; perhaps ſome of you may ſay, That it will be time enough to ſend out my Servant when the <hi>King</hi> calls for the <hi>Auxiliaries</hi>; Good Sir, that will be no Point of Honour to go when forc'd to it; for that's as much as to ſay, We will let our Lives and Liberties, and all go till they be at the laſt gaſp, before we deſign to do any thing to ſave them, and give Relief to them; and in the mean time, where is your Love to your <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country, Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi>? Conſider on theſe things and every one that would be counted a Loyal Man, let him Incourage the Work, and help to Cure the Wound before it be too late; we believe you had rather have their go then your ſelves; ſo leave you to conſider on it.</p>
