            <title>A brief description of the future history of Europe, from Anno 1650 to An. 1710. Treating principally of those grand and famous mutations yet expected in the world, as, the ruine of the Popish hierarchy, the final annihilation of the Turkish Empire, the conversion of the eastern and western Jews, and their restauration to their ancient inheritance in the Holy Land, and the Fifth Monarchie of the universall reign of the Gospel of Christ upon Earth. With principal passages upon every of these, out of that famous manuscript of Paul Grebner, extant in Trinity-Colledge Library in Cambridge. Composed upon the occasion of the young Kings arrival into Scotland, to shew what will in probability be the event of the present affairs in England and Scotland.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </hi> Here preſent you with a miſhapen Embryo, having neither had time for Perfection, nor life to actuate Acception. A meer Chaos and diſordered Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is it, yet for matter treating of wonderfull and famous Events, which in this European world are quickly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. It is true, that <hi>Primi foetus ſunt horridiores,</hi> as commonly defective in mature Conceptions and ripeneſſe of judgement. Yet they that reade this Pamphlet ſeriouſly, will finde thoſe Paſſages opened (I will not ſay fully explained) in Scripture, which Commentator never yet diſcloſed, nor Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine unfolded. In ſuch an intricate Labyrinth it is eaſie to ſtray: therefore I am confident, Charity will uſher your Iudgements, and your love cover mine Infirmities. I know I have ſlipt in many places, but for the preſent can neither tell where, nor how: Some Ariadne might do well to lead the way, and I ſhall be as ready to follow: <hi>Secundae cogitatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſunt meliores:</hi> If I finde thoſe Non-entities to be accepted with, but as much reſpect as worſe ware every day is, it ſhall not irk me to beſtow a week or two in licking it over into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter form and putting a handſomer Coat upon it's back. There are ſeveral paſſages in it, which (I know) will not reſent with our Great Ones: but <hi>Amicus Plato, amicus Socrates,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:165767:3"/>
yet <hi>Magis amica veritas,</hi> which ſhall prevail, though all the world gather in battalia againſt it. I muſt confeſſe it is too too abortive: for it came into the world in fewer hours, then <hi>Toſtatus</hi> beſtowed in tranſlating the five first Chapters of <hi>Geneſis</hi> out of Greek into Latine. I wiſh it may obtain the end for which I made it: that is, to move us all with repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to meet God in theſe great Mutations and Changes he is bringing upon us in this Land; that every one would ſtrive to reform one from Hereſies, Sects and Schiſms; to ſuffer the Scriptures to be our Rule, and the holy Ghoſt our Guide both in Faith, Religion and Diſcipline, that ſo God may put out his hand in amending the Body-Politick in the whole, that judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may depart from us, destruction flee far from us; that <hi>Peace may dwell within our wals and plenteouſneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Palaces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſtudy <hi>multum in parvo,</hi> and hope to give ſatisfaction to all, but ſuch as are wedded more to their wils then reaſons. For theſe I have no more but this, A good winde at their backs to the <hi>Anticyra's,</hi> that they may drink <hi>Hellebor</hi> luſtily to purge their <hi>Brains,</hi> that they may be more quick, and their Eye-ſight clearer. I quote ſtrange Authors in this Work; and good Reaſon, for the Work it ſelf is ſtrange. Yet they in whoſe hands theſe Authors are (and they are not in every Library) ſhall finde I have both dealt with them truly, and cited them faithfully. And for the Tractate it ſelf, it will with the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned be either <hi>Laudatus aut ſaltem excuſatus;</hi> either of which ſhall content me at this time. Farewel.</p>

It hath made me often wonder, to behold how virulently and barbarouſly Proteſtants could oppoſe and maſſacre one another, when the Romiſh Froggs can live in an eſtabliſhed amity among themſelves, and laugh at our follies. I will not ſay, it is Jeſuiticall projects which ſets us by the ears together, ſo much as our own Seditious and Schiſmaticall ſpirits, and want of Charity. If we would but ponder, how much Popery hath won upon us by theſe Warres and Diviſions, what fearfull occaſions we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the profeſſed enemies of Chriſt to blaſpheme his Name, and deride our Religion, it would much provoke us to end our Controverſies, and band againſt the common Enemy. The Empire hath got but a wofull Booty, by her 30 years Warres, having weakned her ſelf with the loſſe of Six Millions of valiant Souldiers, and enticed that Imp of Mahomet to prepare an Army of 200000, now in the Field, and ready to march within the bowels of <hi>Germany.</hi> We in <hi>England</hi> have gained no better by our civil Warre, but in ſtead of one Tyrant to advance a douzen over us, and from the height of Liberty to runne the broad way up the next hill, to the height of Slavery.

Behold then what profits our Warre hath brought us! and what a bleſſing our ſins have depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us of! How fearfull are the Judgements of God and his anger againſt ſin, when the Church is dilacerated, the Commonwealth disjoynted and diſmembred in every part thereof, the luſt of Tyrants, the pleaſure of Peſants, the barbarouſnes of Souldiers, diſſentions of Churchmen, ſad and tragicall ends of Nobles, confuſions in Families, countenancing of Hereſies, and applauding of Blaſphemies are ſo rife and ripe amongſt men! On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, how happy are Kingdomes, how bleſſed be Commonwealths, when Princes, Magiſtrates, and other ſubordinate Officers, each in their ſeverall place and calling, ſtrive to promote the glory of God, with the Liberty, Honour and Tranquillity of Subjects; where the Miniſtry is incouraged, Univerſities countenanced, Courts of Judicature upholden, Subjects be unanimous and accuſtomed to the Exerciſe of Piety and Godlineſſe: laſtly when both Prince and people aim joyntly at the advancement of the Goſpel and mutuall commodity of one another, ſo that there be no decay, no leading into Captivity, nor complaining in their ſtreets!</p>

            <p>The diſparity of theſe two contradictory conditions, and the fearfull effects, which they in all ages have wrought in the Conſciences of men, have made me at length after a long time of ſilence put Pen to Paper, and through the intricate Labyrinth of thoſe portions of Scripture which never Commentator yet ever medled with (I mean, the twelve laſt Chapters of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the three laſt of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> the laſt of <hi>Daniel,</hi> with ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in <hi>Hoſea</hi> and <hi>Zechary)</hi> to deſcry when We People of <hi>England</hi> with all Proteſtants in <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall ſee an end of theſe our Warres and Tumults, what ſhall be the Eſtate of our Churches, Stares and Kingdomes, from this preſent year 1650, to the beginning of the Fifth and laſt univerſall MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARCHY of the Goſpel of Chriſt upon Earth, which ſhall begin in the year of our Lord 1710; and in what year we may expect the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals of the Beaſt of Rome, the Red Dragon of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the totall Converſion and reſtauration both of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Jews within their holy Land of <hi>Jury:</hi> all which muſt moſt certainly be falfilled before the end of the World.

relate, are contained in M. <hi>Archers</hi> Perſonall Reign of Chriſt upon Earth, <hi>Rich. Stirreys</hi> Kingdome of King Jeſus, and in <hi>A.R.</hi> his <hi>Caeleſtis Hieruſalem,</hi> Printed <hi>A.</hi> 1642, 1644, and 1645. Now having unmasked the vanity of this Error <hi>(ut contraria juxtà ſe poſita magis eluceſcant)</hi> I will epitomize in this Section the truth of the future eſtate of the World, from this time to the end, which afterward I intend (God willing) further to dilate and proſecute in this Treatiſe. This year 1650 all <hi>Europe</hi> are in civil Warres. Theſe civill warres ſhall not ceaſe till they have muſtered out a great Army of the true worſhippers of God to ruine Rome, which ſhall be about <hi>Anno</hi> 1666. Rome thus deſtroyed, the Weſtern Jews ſhall begin to learn the waies of God, and believe his Goſpel (which they cannot do ſo long as Rome ſtandeth) and ſhall <hi>Anno</hi> 1683. enter upon the converſion of their Eaſtern brethren (the 10. Tribes now inviſibly hid in Tartaria and India) and they two (none elſe) ſhall ruine the Mahumetan Empire about <hi>An.</hi> 1698. and ſo ſhall be reſtored to the holy Land to reinhabit Jeruſalem. Then muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a comparative felicity of the Church of God upon earth, becauſe after theſe times both Turk and Pope ſhall be deſtroyed. Nevertheleſſe this felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt be mingled with internall troubles and perſecutions, within the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Church, becauſe the Church ſhall never be wholly at reſt, while the world ſtandeth. Lo, here the difference betwixt Truth and Hereſie, betwixt the opinions of the Millenaries and right ſenſe of Scriptures. The Millenaries ſay, Chriſt muſt deſcend perſonally feom heaven: The Scriptures on the contrary ſay, he ſhall not come from Heaven perſonally till the laſt day, when he ſhall deſcend with his holy Angels in flaming fire to judge the quick and the dead. He ſhall ſend power and ſtrength from heaven to his true Worſhipppers (as he hath done hitherto) to deſtroy Turk and Pope, from Heaven he ſhall give power to his ancient people the Jews, to regain their ancient Land of Judea, and not by his corporeall preſence upon Earth: from Heaven about <hi>An.</hi> 1700. he ſhall transferre his Goſpel from Europe, as he hath done from Aſia, and raiſe up and inſpire godly Miniſters after his own will, who ſhall implant his holy word in all and every of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Provinces of America, and in all countries of the Southern and Eaſtern India, China, Tartaria, and in all the regions of the North unto the worlds end, and make it ſhine in as great purity and glory as ever it hath done in England or Germany. This is the felicity of the Church, the fifth Monarchy in Nebuchadnezzars Image, the miniſteriall (not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall) Reign and Kingdom of Chriſt upon Earth, which muſt not endure for ever (as Archer would have it) nor for a 1000 years (as Alſted dreams) but for a very ſhort time, that all Nations (none excepted) may profeſſe Gods worſhip, and none plead ignorance before his Tribunall, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after which the diſſolution of the world ſhall come, after which time ſhall be no more.</p>

            <p>This Digreſſion made, I return to my purpoſed method.</p>
            <p>That fearfull and ominous Night-torch, which prognoſticated all that  miſery to Germany and great Brittain, which they have now ſuffered, was the forerunner of all our evils. This Comet Longomontanus and D. <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> ſay appeared but 28. dayes, indeed it was neither obſerved in Denmark nor at London before Novemb. 18. or 21. but <hi>Erycius Puteanus</hi> obſerved it Novemb. 11. the firſt time, as he teſtifies in the firſt book of his learned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxologie, pag. 33. 38. ſo it appeared for the ſpace of 37. or 38. dayes, foreſhewing that firſt Germany, Livonia, Swethland, with other North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of Europe, then Scotland, England and Ireland, ſhould feel the terrible effects thereof in warre and famine, for the ſpace of 37. or 38. years, even from <hi>An.</hi> 1618. till <hi>An.</hi> 1656. This Comet was ſtrengthned by a fearfull conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter, <hi>An.</hi> 1616. July 18. The effects of both which were not to be confined in thoſe terrible concomitants of war perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Germany (which L.B. and D. <hi>Vincent</hi> ſo pathetically delineate) but were to end in the judgements of God upon Europe for neglecting the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of Antichriſt, ruine of Rome, annihilation of the Sodomiticall Order of the Society of Jeſuites, and in the extirpation of all Kingdoms and free States of Papiſts, to make way for the Lion of the North to erect his FIFTH MONARCHIE in the aſhes of Germany, wherein ſhall be eſtabliſhed the eternall felicity of the Church, by the converſion of the Jews and fulneſſe of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Shirley</hi> Fellow of Trinity-Colledge in Cambridge, once ſhewed me a Letter from his learned friend <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> dared <hi>An.</hi> 1624.

            <p>Whereas you are angry that I keep ſilence concerning the eſtate of our moſt diſtreſſed Countrey. Truly I have nothing now to write, but that all things (that I may uſe the words of the Poet) grow worſe and woeſe. As well the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> as the Emperour earneſtly endeavour to ſee miſerable <hi>Germany</hi> deſtroyed as ſoon as may be; neither do the ſouldiers of either of them, think of any other thing then ſlaughter and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I received the other day, from my dear Friend <hi>John Baudenſis,</hi> the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Aſtrologers concerning that terrible Comet which appeared <hi>Anno</hi> 1618, and about the later Conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Behold thou then a Prophecie (if not Apoſtolical) yet (if I miſtake not) far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Aſtrological. GOD hath ariſen and drawn his ſword: There ſhall happen in theſe our European Regions, the deſtruction of great Emperours, the ſlaughter of people, Funerals of Kings, ſubverſions of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, mutations of Monarchies, maſſacres of Princes and illuſtrious Commanders, violent and proud Counſels, Treaſons and Rebellions amongſt Subjects: Clergie-men ſhall finde a change of Laws and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Conſtitutions, by thoſe of greater power, and an inſatiable deſire of new things amongſt common people. The Northern parts of Europe ſhall be greatly oppreſſed with Warre, Sickneſſe and Peſtilence. Rich men ſhall be impoveriſhed, Princes caſt out of their Dominions; The fathers ſhall be baniſhed, and after a long ſpace of trouble their children ſhall be reſtored to their former condition. This Comet alſo threatneth the terrible ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> and burnings in all the Cities of Europe. The Papiſtical Clergy, eſpecially the Cardinals, ſhall be caſt down from their Dignities, the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites every where ſhall be drawn to death, neither ſhall the French-men or Spaniards have courage to ſave their necks from the halters. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, We diſcern a Kingdom to ariſe of the moſt ancient Inhabitants in the holy Land, which to Chriſtians ſhall be a Miracle, and to the World a terrour; and theſe ſhall obtain the Revolution of a new Empire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which ſhall be adminiſtred univerſal Gladneſſe, Joy and Delight to mankinde (the wicked being every where taken away.) All theſe things ſhall be effected by a certain Northern King who ſhall miraculouſly
<pb facs="tcp:165767:6"/>
eſtabliſh Peace, Religion and Security throughout the whole world.</p>
            <p>Thus far the words of this Letter. And how punctually all theſe things are come to paſſe, let the world judge. We in England have felt the miſery of the one, and are ready ſtript to ſuffer the calamities of the other, having for the preſent loſt what is impoſſible to be regained, and ſeeing a new ſtorm of Devaſtations hanging over our heads by the young Kings late arrival in <hi>Scotland</hi> (where he is received as abſolute Soveraign) which fils mens hearts with penſive thoughts and doubtings what will be the end of theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beginnings. For my part, I am a zealous adoret of a Parliament, nor deſerve I to cenſure the Actions of our Repreſentatives, yet will I not promiſe the Term of an Age to our novel Government, but think verily, a change to the old Model is nigh at hand. It is caſual to the beſt Kingdoms to have Interregnums, but as we ſtand now, we ſhall neither be for ſix years together a Body Politique, nor a true Church of God. That excellent Aſtrologer of Miſnia, <hi>Paul Grebner,</hi> was more then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitour into the Effects of Starres, being queſtionleſſe indued from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove with a Prophetick ſpirit, not to be deſired, much leſſe expected of all. He plainly affirms, That as <hi>England</hi> ever was a Monarchy within it ſelf, ſince it was diſcovered by the Romans, ſo ſhall it ſo continue and remain, even then when all other Kingdoms and States in Europe are ſwallowed up of the FIFTH MONARCHIE of the Lion of the North. His Prophecie of our Civil Wars, of the Fate of our late King, and the Reſtauration of his Son to his Fathers Dominions, runneth thus in <hi>Ban.</hi> 72.</p>

            <head>VI. A true Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that Number in <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 8.</head>
            <p>BEfore I come to comment upon this Chronologicall Index, it will not be amiſſe to deliver that ſaying, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>(And the Saints ſhall reign with Chriſt a thouſand years)</hi> from all thoſe falſe Interpretations which have been faſtned upon it, by <hi>Papias, Bucholcherus, Scaliger, Brightman, Alſted</hi> and others, and declare the true ſenſe of it, as remoteſt from Innovation, and coming neareſt the intention of the H. Ghoſt. There is in this 20 Chap. two ſeverall Epoches of a 1000 years, which are two ſeverall waies to be interpreted. The firſt is in <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. of Satan being bound for a 1000 years; which muſt begin either at the Inſtant of our Saviours Incarnation, and end at <hi>An.</hi> 1000, in the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> year of the Popedome of <hi>Sylvester</hi> II, that infamous Sodomite, Necromancer, and Conjurer, under whom the filthineſſe and Idolatry of the Romiſh Church was brought to the height: or rather they muſt begin at the Deſtruction of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Temple by <hi>Titus,</hi> which was <hi>An.</hi> 71, and end in <hi>An.</hi> 1071, in the Popedome of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII, aliàs <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who firſt broke bonds of Allegiance with <hi>Henry</hi> the Emperour, excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him, ſet the Goſpel in a totall Eclipſe, and Europe in the mournfull Flames of a civil Warre: but of this in the Chronology. But this in the 8 <hi>verſ.</hi> of the Saints reigning with Chriſt a 1000 years, <hi>Alſted, Bucholcherus</hi> and others expound of a Comparative Felicity of the Church on this Earth, for a 1000 years, beginning. <hi>An.</hi> 1694, when they ſay all viſible Enemies <q rend="margQuotes">of the Church ſhall be overthrown, and muſt end <hi>An. Ch.</hi> 2694. after which ſhall be the Warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> againſt the Church, which ſhall be prevented by the coming of Chriſt to judgement.</q> But in this <hi>Alſted</hi> is wide from the right mark: for this number muſt begin <hi>An.</hi> 1072, at the expiration of the former, and muſt be interpreted for all that time that the World ſhall laſt after the aforeſaid <hi>An.</hi> 1072. And the holy Ghoſt doth term this indefinite and unlimited time by the Number of a 1000 years, for three ſpeciall Reaſons: 1 Becauſe a 1000 years are the Number of Perfection and of Eternity, and doth moſt aptly ſerve to expreſſe the End of theſe Earthly Troubles, and the beginning of that Time which never ſhall have end. 2 Becauſe thoſe things which the holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures affirmeth are yet to come, muſt not be plenarily accompliſhed till after <hi>An.</hi> 1830, it may pleaſe God that the glorious and flouriſhing eſtate of the Church and Goſpel here upon Earth, may continue much of 200 years longer, to increaſe the number of them who ſhall be ſaved, and to amplifie more the heavenly At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of Gods Mercy, Righteouſneſſe, Truth, Holineſſe and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the Salvation of the Juſt: and his Equity, Judgement and Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the firebrands of deſtruction. 3 Becauſe a viciſſitudinary time of Affliction and Eaſe, Perſecution and reſt, pure Doctrine and Hereſies, is ſignified to be the whole continuance or moſt part of a 1000 years, wherein thoſe who are to ſuffer for the Teſtimony of the Word of God, and the truth of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall have their reward after the expiration of that time, which cannot be till after the laſt generall Judgement. The fearfull and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible

Warre of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog (viz.</hi> the bloudy Warre of Turks and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians with the Jews newly converted in the Land of <hi>Jury,</hi> in which the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry name of Turks ſhall be rooted from off the Earth) muſt be before the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this glorious Eſtate and Felicity of the Church of God here upon Earth, and therefore the 7, 8, 9, and 10 <hi>verſes,</hi> are in order of time before the 5 and the 6. The Devil and Antichriſtianity muſt be chained up in the dungeon of Hell for the ſpace of a 1000 years after the Incarnation of Chriſt. <hi>An.</hi> 1000 muſt the Devil and Romiſh Idolatry by the Popedome of <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the ſecond, be let looſe to range upon Earth, and tyrannize over the Church for the moſt part of another 1000, ever till <hi>An.</hi> 1698 <hi>(numorus completus</hi> being put here <hi>pro incompleto)</hi> before an happy and comfortable Eſtate of the Goſpel can be brought forth to the World. <note place="margin">The eſtate of England with other Provinces of Europe from <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. to <hi>An.</hi> 1698.</note> Therefore all  Chriſtendome from this year 1650, muſt expect very ſad and wofull daies, much perſecution, bloodſhed and ſavadge tyranny in every Kingdom of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope (eſpecially in <hi>France, Spain, Italy, Swethland, Germany and England)</hi> untill <hi>An.</hi> 1698. Some of thoſeKingdoms which have abandoned the ſuperſtition of the beaſt, ſhall by ſubtle allurements be perſwaded to readmit and reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſame. Wofull and unſupportable Afflictions ſhall beſall both the European Jews (which are the two Tribes of <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident in Chriſtendom and <hi>Turkie)</hi> as likewiſe the ten Tribes, the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (who ſhall inſenſibly and miraculouſly ariſe out of the bowels of <hi>Tartaria</hi> and <hi>India,</hi> about <hi>An.</hi> 1669.) who nevertheleſſe ſhall be ſo extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſupported by God, that they ſhall ſtand in little or no need at all of the Chriſtians. Becauſe from this time of the Converſion of the Iſraelites for the ſpace of 30 years, theſe 12 Tribes ſhall ſuffer much trouble, Heathens, Papiſts and Mahometans, ſhall ſtrive to eradicate their name from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet all in vain; for an illuſtrious and heroick Prince <hi>(è Tribu Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali oriundus)</hi> ſhall be their valiant and fortunate Commander, called <hi>Michael,</hi> not <hi>proprio nomine,</hi> but becauſe he <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1. ſhall ſtand up and ſhew himſelf the Aſſertor and Protector of their Religion and Liberty. In which time ſhall be ſuch troubles as never were, no, nor ever ſhall be to the end of the world. For like as the Chriſtians had reſt 30. years from the Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and now have endured the fiery triall almoſt theſe 1600. years, ſince that time from the Heathen Emperors, and the Beaſt; ſo the Iſraelites, which ſhall 1600. years till <hi>Anno</hi> 1668. live without Prince, Law, Temple, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and true Religion (as <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſied <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5.) beginning now to be converted to Chriſt, ſhall have ſavage times of affliction and Butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries  for other 30. years (to welcome their converſion withall) till <hi>Anno</hi> 1698. when God ſhall grant reſt from their enemies, and begin a peaceable eſtate of the Church.</p>

effectible, when-we think him the furtheſt off; and his Providence neareſt execution, then, when the world is moſt irregular, and incapable of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. When the Abominations and Paganiſmes of the old World had deſtroyed all true worſhip of God, and an 120 years of repentance did no good, then was God's time to ſeparate the Wheat from the Chaffe, and by ſaying of <hi>Noahs</hi> family to preſerve a ſeed for the implantation of a new. So in the new World, when Idolatry had overſpread all, the Judgement and Mercy of God moſt appeared-in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Vocation, by ſelecting his Church from the reſt of mankinde, and continuing it above 2000 years in the Houſe of <hi>Heber,</hi> the true Heir to Grace and Salvation. Thus was it in the deſtruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> in the Babyloniſh Captivity, in the Reformation by <hi>Luther,</hi> when all the world were become Apoſtates, God's Providence ſhone out brighteſt, and was moſt conſpicuous in propagating Religion, maugre all the oppoſition the devil and the world could invent or deviſe: So ſhall it be in this prefixed time: though the world muſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate more and more in civility and humanity; Chriſtianity be eclipſed in a higher meaſure, and the true Worſhippers of God decreaſe above what ever yet hath been done: though Proteſtantiſme in many Coaſts and Kingdoms ſhall be totally ſwallowed up of Popery and Mahumetaniſme; more lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Warres and fearfull Maſſacres rage through <hi>England, Germany, France, Spain, Italy,</hi> and all European Monarchies, then we have yet beheld; and though ſome of theſe Kingdoms wholly revolt to Popery, others be luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and at a ſtand, untill <hi>An.</hi> 1686; yet all theſe ſhall but make way for the finall Eradication of the enemies of the Church, and the glorious and wonderfull Birth, and erection of the FIFTH MONARCHIE UNIVERSALL, which by theſe pangs and ſorrows of Chriſtendome ſhall be brought forth about the time of the totall converſion of the Jews. For the ſeaſon is now come, when Judgement muſt begin (not at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Antichriſt) but at the Houſe of God; and what bloud ſoever is ſhed upon the ſoyl of the Church, ſhall be no other then fruitfull ſhowers and warm ſeaſons, to make the Field of Chriſtmore pregnant in production of that glorious Harveſt of Saints, which ſhall cover the Earth. For as it ſhall be in the end of the World, this old, decrepit, and corrupt world muſt be purged and refined with the fire of the Lord, before there can be placed in ſtead thereof a new Heaven and a new Earth: So in the finall Concluſion of the troubles of the Church, warres, Apoſtaſies, alternations and changes in Kingdoms and States, the <gap reason="foreign">

Far wide therefore is the Surmiſe of thoſe Chriſtians, how this doctrine of the univerſall Regiment of the Church upon earth is a vain glorious and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick dream, conſidering the hopes of it now are ſmall, and like to be leſſer, becauſe charity and devotion daily decreaſeth: Nay rather this is the moſt evident ſign that it ſpeedily approacheth, becauſe the malice of the devil with the corruption of mankinde, hourly augmenteth and ſtrives to ſtifle and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

            <p>Of how large an extent the Turkiſh Empire ſhould be, how far it ſhould  prevail againſt Chriſtendome, when it ſhould be at the height, and when Chriſtians ſhould begin to cry quits with them by victories and conqueſts, is long ſince extant in ancient Propheſies.

            <p>
               <hi>Imperator noſter veniet, Ethnici Principes Regnum capiet, rubrum quoque po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum capiet, inque ſuam poteſtatem rediget.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Quod ſi inſeptimum uſque annum Chriſtianorum gladius non inſurrexerit, uſque ad duodecimum annum eis dominabitur. Domos aedificabit, vineas plantabit, hortos ſepibus muniet, liberos procrebit, &amp; poſt duodecimum annum Chriſtianorum gladius apparebit, &amp; Turcam quaque verſum in fugam aget.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Emperour ſhall come, he ſhall take the Kingdom of a heathen Prince, he ſhall alſo take the red apple, and ſubdue it to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But if the Chriſtians ſword ſhall not ariſe by the ſeventh year, he ſhall reign over them to the twelfth year, he ſhall build houſes, plant vineyards, hedge in Orchards, and beget children, and after the twelfth year ſhall the Chriſtians ſword appear, and put the Turk to flight on every ſide.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Fox</hi> expounds theſe 12 years to be 12 Turkiſh Emperours prevailing againſt Chriſtians, beginning at the firſt Emperour <hi>Ottoman</hi> An. 1300. and ſo <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent to be the twelfth Emperour, and the laſt that ſhould prevail againſt Chriſtians; who began his reign <hi>An.</hi> 1519. and died <hi>An.</hi> 1567. But I think rather it muſt begin at <hi>Mahomet</hi> the II. winning of Conſtantinople (called here <hi>rubrum pomum)</hi> An. 1452. and muſt end at the late Emperour <hi>Mahomet</hi> the IV. his death the laſt Auguſt, 1649. My reaſon is this: Other Emperours have prevailed againſt Chriſtians, ſince <hi>Solyman</hi> the magnificent. For <hi>Selimus</hi> the II. his ſon wan <hi>Cyprus</hi> from the <hi>Venetians. Armurath</hi> III. took the Fort <hi>Guiermo</hi> from the Hungarians, and his ſon <hi>Mahomet</hi> III. took <hi>Agria</hi> in Hungary, and had he purſued his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, had won that whole Kingdom in leſſe them a year: So the late <hi>Mahomet</hi> is the 12 Emperour from <hi>Mahomet</hi> the II. and now after his death ſhall the Turks prevail no more againſt Chriſtians. For fourty years agoe that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was at a ſtand, and is declining to an eternall deſtruction. The ſword of the Chriſtians ſhall now ariſe and prevail againſt the Turks till <hi>An.</hi> 1696. when the converted Jews ſhall gather head to overcome them in a bloudy pitcht field, and root out their name from off the Earth. By this young Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours deceaſe without iſſue, the Ottoman Line is extinct, and none left. One <hi>Sultan Hali</hi> (a Perſian by birth) is now Steward of the Ottoman houſe, and the Crim-Tartar by old compoſition and agreement layeth claim to the Turkiſh Empire, which at preſent is in combuſtion becauſe of this.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165767:17"/>
And though above 200000 Turks are in the Field, with an intent (as is thought) to invade Germany, yet if Chriſtians could but leave off their unneceſſary diviſions, they might ſoon ruinate the Turkiſh, Empire. For ſince <hi>Armurath</hi> IV. his death, <hi>An.</hi> 1642. (who began to reign, <hi>An.</hi> 1623.) all the time of this late <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s reign, ſince there hath been continuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and muſſacres amongſt the Turks, the Jannizaries eluding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the young and weak Emperour, which terrified the Mufti and the Baſſa's ſore, becauſe they had a prophecy, that as a <hi>Mahomet</hi> wan Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, ſo a <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſhould loſe it again to the Chriſtians. <note place="margin">A Prophecy of the year 1698, found in the ſtudy of <hi>Iustus Lypſius.</hi>

Her 8 contrary feathers are the 8 terrible Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſeverall Nations from the North (God's ſcourges) which over-whelmed her faireſt Provinccs, ſunk her State in bloud, and by fire and ſword humbled her as low as the duſt ſhe trod on; <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Alaricus</hi> and his Weſt-Gothes, 2 <hi>Attilas</hi> and his Hunnes, 3 <hi>Genſericus</hi> and his Vandals, 4 <hi>Odoacer,</hi> 5 <hi>Theodoricus</hi> and his Eaſt-Goths, 6 <hi>Totilas</hi> and his Spaniards, 7 <hi>Alboinus</hi> and his Longobards (who depoſed her diminitive <hi>Ceſar Auguſtulus Momyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus)</hi> 8 and laſtly, the inteſtine homebred Faction and Conſpiracy, which proved more pernitious then the reſt (as all included diſeaſes are the worſt) which in the reigns of <hi>Otho</hi> the Great, <hi>Otho</hi> III, and <hi>Frederique</hi> II, ſo often ſtrove to eradicate the Papall Superiority, and reedifie her S. P. Q. R. buried ſo many ages ago out of the ruines of the City. The Head in the midſt is the <hi>Germane</hi> Empire, begun <hi>An.</hi> 801 on Chriſtmas day, by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, which though <hi>verſ.</hi> 32. it long did and yet doth put the Earth in great fear, yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. muſt vaniſh in an inſtant, as did the Wings, and come to nought. The <hi>Germane</hi> Empire thus deſtroied, <hi>verſ.</hi> 35. The Head on the right ſide (the Kingdom of <hi>Spain)</hi> muſt devour the Head on the left ſide, which is the Kingdom of <hi>France.</hi> Therefore it is manifeſt, That the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> though now it flouriſheth in what Glory and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence Earth can afford, muſt ere long be humbled by the power of <hi>Spain,</hi> with many Diſcomfitures, and brought to dolefull ſtreights and great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. I my ſelf have obſerved one remarkable Adjunct of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in particular, how that year (in which the Figures of the Golden Number were equall to the Figures of the year of Chriſt) hath ever proved fatall to that Monarchy for Warre, Bloudſhed, Peſtilence and Famine. It was ſo with them from <hi>An.</hi> 1570 to <hi>An.</hi> 1576. in all which ſeven years, the Guiſian faction made lamentable havock of the Church of God and the Kingdom; ſo ſhall it be in that year in which the finall Tragedy of that Kingdom ſhall be acted, ſix years after which <hi>France</hi> ſhall be no more. But when that ſhall be, no ſign of <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall remain, nor remembrance where the wals of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtood. The LION (which <hi>verſ.</hi> 37. and <hi>chap.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 31. came roaring out of the Wood ſpeaking to the Eagle, and rebuking her for her wickedneſſe) is the WIND which the moſt high God hath kept for <hi>Rome</hi> and her wickedneſſe till the end, even the LION OF THE NORTH (of which you ſhall hear anon a Propheſie of the true <hi>Merlin)</hi> which ſhall reprove the Roman Empire, and caſt before her her ſpoils; he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:165767:18"/>
ſhall ſet her alive in Judgement, rebuke and correct her, and deliver the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of Gods people by Affliction which are preſerved upon his borders and make them joyfull untill the day of Judgement. In the 13 Chapter, <hi>Eſdras</hi> beholds a viſion of a man riſing out of the Sea, and devouring the multitudes of fighters that came againſt him, neither with ſword, ſpear nor any inſtrument of Warre, but only with the fire and ſtorm that came out of his mouth; which is Chriſt the ſon of man, who through a ſea of bloudy perſecutions and tribulations propagated his Goſpel over the Earth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding and devouring the multitudinous Pagans and Idolaters fighting againſt Chriſtians, by the invincible force of the Goſpel. After a long time of the obſtinate wilfulneſſe and fulneſſe of the Gentiles, he ſhall call to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf another peaceable multitude, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12, 40. even the whole Nation of the Jews, out of <hi>Armenia, Tartaria,</hi> and the Eaſtern <hi>India,</hi> whom God ſhall defend and convert to the Goſpel, when he ſhall deſtroy all other Nations upon Earth. Theſe are called the peaceable People, becauſe after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Jews, ſhall come that Miniſteriall Monarchy of the Church over the whole World; that <hi>peaceable and ſtill Time,</hi> when all Kingdoms under heaven ſhall forget fighting one againſt another, Warres ſhall ceaſe in all the World, and ſwords and ſpears ſhall be beaten into Plowſhares and pruning hooks. When the ſeventh Angel blew the Trumpet, <hi>Luther</hi> began his Reformation, then it is, when the <hi>Multitude</hi> ſtood before the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and ſung the new ſong of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and then nevertheleſſe is but the vail only of the Tabernacle opened in heaven, and a great cloud and ſmoak covered that Glory. But it muſt be 180 years after, when the Kingdomes of this World become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and thoſe be deſtroyed that deſtroyed the Earth. For then and not till then ſhall the Temple of God be fully opened in Heaven, and the Ark of his Teſtament (the very ſame modell, which God ſhewed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount) ſhall be ſeen in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> not in a Tabernacle, but in that Temple, which the power of God ſhall make. Then ſhall laſtly, the four Beaſts, the Elders, with all the Angels of Heaven, and all the creatures of Heaven and Earth, and of the Sea and under the Earth fall down before the Throne, and give glory, honour, bleſſing and praiſe unto him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever, and the four Beaſts ſhall ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>I have heard many Jews diſcourſing of this their glorious Reſtauration and Religion to come. They ſay, they never poſſeſſed (no not in the time of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> when their Kingdom was largeſt) an half of that which God promiſed in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> and <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Indeed it is ſaid in <hi>Joſhua, No good thing failed of what God promiſed,</hi> but this is to be underſtood of their peaceable ſettlement in what <hi>Joſhua</hi> then conquer'd, not of the utmoſt boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of what they were to poſſeſſe towards the end of Time. From Euphrates to the red Sea, all the Coaſts on the Weſt to the great Mediterranean Sea, with <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> on the North <hi>Hemath</hi> and <hi>Celoſyria,</hi> even in length
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:165767:19"/>
from <hi>Lebanon</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> was to be the confines of this ſacred Commonwealth. Now if we conſider, what a Moity of this was poſſeſſed by <hi>Lot, Ammon, Eſau,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Tyrus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> with <hi>Syria,</hi> we may plainly ſee, that more then an half was never their own, of what God promiſed. In confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of poſſeſſing which, and all the world beſide in time to come, in their great <hi>Hoſanna</hi> they ſhake Palmes in their hands, in triumph towards the four coaſts of heaven, to intimate that in their univerſall Empire every tree of the wood ſhall clap hands, and ſing for joy. It is ſtrange, and makes me give more credit to <hi>Eſdras</hi> then otherwiſe I would, to ſee how pat he goes with our Saviour Chriſt, in affirming the ſecond Captivity of the Jews to be long, and that their return ſhould be about the ruine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. He relates how the ten Tribes (ſoon after their Captivity by <hi>Salmanaſser)</hi> travelled through a great River or ſtrait (perhaps the Streits of <hi>Anian)</hi> in a long journey of many moneths or years to a Country not inhabited. Yea many good Authors, who write of the Hiſtories of <hi>America,</hi> relate how the <hi>Maxicans</hi> have a Tradition (delivered from father to ſon, time out of minde) of a great multitude coming a great journey into thoſe parts with an Ark car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before them on mens ſhoulders, with their God incloſed therein. Theſe people certainly were Jews, from whom they learned Circumciſion (which our travellers finde in moſt of their Coaſts) with other Rites of Tribes, Heads of Tribes and Families, with ſome handſome Ceremonies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, Funerals and Waſhings, directly the ſame with the Jews or Iſraelites. <note place="margin">A large Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a probable conjecture that the ten Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael were placed by <hi>Salmanaſſer</hi> in <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> &amp; that from thence they paſſed into <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and ſo into <hi>India.</hi>
               </note> But to prove, that the Iſraelites were firſt placed in <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Carmania,</hi> and from thence removed into <hi>India,</hi> let us return a little back, and ſurvey Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures  and ſome approved Authors. When <hi>Salmanaſser</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ten Tribes into Captivity (in the fifth year of the reign of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah)</hi> he was a Prince of ſpacious Dominions and invincible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as comprizing within his Empire all <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Perſia, Meſepotamia, Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> all <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia</hi> inferiour to the confines of <hi>Egypt,</hi> all <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Paleſtine</hi> (ſave only the poor exhauſted Kingdom of <hi>Judah)</hi> and laſtly <hi>Armenia</hi> with all the Coaſts bordering upon the <hi>Caſpian</hi> and <hi>Euxine</hi> ſea, as farre as <hi>Tartaria.</hi> By this it will be hard to define in which Province of his Empire he placed them, out of his Dominions we may well think he would not abandon them. In the 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 6. it is ſaid that he placed them in <hi>Hala</hi> and <hi>Habor</hi> by the River of Gozan, and in the <hi>Cities of the Medes.</hi> Which <hi>Hala</hi> (or rather <hi>Chala)</hi> and <hi>Habor</hi> by affinity of pronuntiation, can be no other then <hi>Colchies</hi> and <hi>Iberia,</hi> two Provinces of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the firſt bordering upon the <hi>Euxine,</hi> the latter upon the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea and the confines of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Eaſt of <hi>Armenia</hi> lies <hi>Media,</hi> in the Cities of which, a great part of the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites were likewiſe placed to inhabit. North of <hi>Armenia</hi> is the entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe immenſe and indiſcoverable Nations of <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> the utmoſt limits of whoſe Kingdoms were never yet fully known. The chief River of which Countries ariſing farre beyond the <hi>Hyperborian</hi> Territories, after a weariſome travel through many Nations and Provinces, disburthens it ſelf at laſt into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> ſea, at the very entrance into <hi>Armenia,</hi> where it is called <hi>Zolga</hi> (though our Mariners call it <hi>Wolga)</hi> which is nothing elſe but a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:165767:19"/>
Metatheſis or a bad pronunciation of the word <hi>Gozan.</hi> So that that ſaying of <hi>Ben-Gorion</hi> is true (if that Manuſcript be his which <hi>Gallo-Belgicus</hi> fathers upon him, yet viſible in <hi>Bibliothecâ Florentinâ) </hi>
               <q rend="margQuotes"> 
                  <hi>Salbumadzar</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>rex Aſſyrius, exciſo Samariae regno, decem illas Tribus, quae à divino cultu tandiu ante deſciverant ad Idololatriam, abductas in Captivitatem conlocavit in Faſso, Alvati, Loride, &amp; Baſcapante civitatibus Colchidos &amp; Iberiae Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carum provinciarum, &amp; in Ecbatana &amp; Bocchu urbibus Mediae juxta Pontum Euxinum, &amp; mare Caſpium.</hi>
               </q> Thus by the teſtimony of this great Rabbi it is manifeſt that the Opinion of thoſe men is fond who think the ten Tribes to be utterly loſt; thus likewiſe is it plain that the Jews Converſion muſt firſt ariſe out of the Eaſt, and that <hi>Faſsum, Alvatis, Loris,</hi> and <hi>Baſcapan</hi> Cities of <hi>Colchis</hi> and <hi>Iberia,</hi> and <hi>Ecbatana</hi> and <hi>Bocchu</hi> Cities of <hi>Media</hi> were the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where <hi>Salmanaſser</hi> (called here <hi>Salbumadzar)</hi> placed theſe Iſraelites in name, but Pagans in nature. And <hi>John Lunclay</hi> in this Pandects of the Turkiſh Hiſtory, <hi>fol.</hi> 769. writes, how there are certain Hoords (Troops or Families) of people near the more Northern parts of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> which retain the names of <hi>Dan, Zebulun</hi> and <hi>Nepthali,</hi> and in the vicinity of <hi>Rega</hi> there is a certain barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Nation of <hi>Letti,</hi> which for three moneths in the year perpetually wander up and down the fields, having theſe words <hi>Jure-ſhele-maſhalom</hi> continually in their mouth, as a kinde of lamentable tune or mournfull Ditty: by which words Authours credibly ſuppoſe are meant Jeruſalem and Damaſcus the two head cities of Judah and Iſrael. He that diligenrly reades the hiſtory of theſe X. Tribes in Scripture, after their revolt from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination with <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in erecting Idolatry, may ſee that they were a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on quickly overgrown with Heatheniſm, cruelty, and barbarouſneſſe, wholly become abominable Pagans in nature, manners, life, condition and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; as if they had had <hi>Numa Pomphilius</hi> to their Father, and not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> the faithfull: they only kept Circumciſion and the names of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors in remembrance, but had quite forgotten the Stories of their religion and piety, thence it came to paſſe that in this their Captivity, being tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and implanted among thoſe Nations, they quickly conjoyned and couni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with them in marriage and affinity (being already long before coupled with them in Idolatry) and ſo ceaſed to be called Iſraelites, but being now all one people, were called by the names of Armenians and Medes. That theſe Iſraeltes likewiſe inhabited part of Tartaria, and from thence ſpread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to India and the Eaſt, and that they likewiſe poſſeſſed a part of the Caucaſian Mountains mingled with a people, which <hi>Herodotus</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (a word not unakin to Turks) is manifeſt by theſe undeniable Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Colchians, Iberians, and a great part of Tartaria uſed Circumciſion in moſt ancient times, long before the building of Rome, which they could not have received from any people elſe but from theſe Iſraelites, who 30. years before the foundation of Rome were ſent to inhabit among them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Crim-Tartars derive their Progeny from <hi>Sampſon</hi> (hence ſo many of them have been called <hi>Camſon,</hi> an obſcure Notion of <hi>Sampſon)</hi> and in imitation of him wear long hair; which could not have been, except they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:165767:20"/>
had had their Originall from thoſe people from whom they had the memory of <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The names likewiſe of <hi>Moſes, Aharon, Cham, Selim,</hi> or <hi>Solyman</hi> (a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Pronunciation of <hi>Shlemo</hi> or <hi>Solomon)</hi> were proper names of men amongſt the Turks long before ever they broke into Aſia. Now what times the Turks firſt broke into Aſia, Chronologers agree not among themſelves: Some ſay they broke through the Caſpian Streits into <hi>Armenia major</hi> (now <hi>Turcoman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia)</hi> An. 844. But I rather ſuppoſe their firſt Irruption into Aſia was 20. years after the death of Alexander the great, about <hi>An. M.</hi> 3718. when the Parthians ſhook off the Macedonian yoke, and began their Empire: for in thoſe times we reade in <hi>Mela, Pliny</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> that a barbarous and ſavage people from the North had invaded and poſſeſſed <hi>Carmania,</hi> which could be no other then this Nation of the Turks. Thus it is plainly manifeſt, that when theſe Iſraelites paſſed into America, they left a great part of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren behinde them in <hi>Aſia, Tartaria,</hi> and <hi>India.</hi> Millions of them are in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and their domineering at this preſent day in <hi>Carmania,</hi> is rightly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Benjamin</hi> the Jew in <hi>Eyre,</hi> by <hi>Mercator, Ortelius,</hi> and other Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, That the Jews were to have a temporal Monarchy in the end of the Roman Empire, is evident likewiſe out of the New Teſtament.

               <p>Sixthly, The life of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in Geneſis hath in it more then Hiſtory. At 17. years of age he was ſold by his Brethren, and ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him his Dreams at thirty. So he lived above 12. years in miſery and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:165767:21"/>
irons. And for thoſe 12. years God rewarded him with 80. years of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in and over all the land of Aegypt. His brethren came and bowed to him according to his Dream of the ſheaves; his father alſo was inferiour and ſubjected to him as he was Viceroy in the government of Aegypt: and was nouriſhed and maintained by him according to his ſecond Dream of the Sun, Moon, and the eleven Stars crouching and making obeiſance. Though his Brethren pitied him not in the anguiſh of his ſoul, yet he forgiveth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth them in Aegypt, and at their deliverance thence marcheth triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before them to Canaan in his Coffin. But yet nevertheleſſe <hi>Jacob</hi> was to ſtay in Canaan, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> was to be unknown to his Brethren till Aegypt be deſtroied by Famine, and yeeld it ſelf to <hi>Joſeph.</hi> And the bones of <hi>Joſeph</hi> too muſt ſtay in Aegypt till 600000 men beſides women and children be delivered them by the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> No departure from Aegypt, no paſſage through the Red-Sea without the bones of <hi>Joſeph. Edom</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Daniels</hi> time ſuffered the ſevereſt puniſhments God could inflict upon a people, and all for afflicting <hi>Eber.</hi> And here is a myſtery not ſo obſerved as obſervable in Scripture. As Aegypt was broken before the firſt Tabernacle was ſet up by <hi>Moſes:</hi> as <hi>Edom</hi> was harrowed by <hi>David</hi> before the firſt Temple was erected by <hi>Solomon:</hi> and thirdly, as <hi>Babel</hi> was Brought to nothing by <hi>Cyrus</hi> before the ſecond Temple was built by <hi>Zorubbabel</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhuah:</hi> ſo ſhall both <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babel,</hi> Turk, Pope, and all Monarchies in the Earth be brought to duſt, before the third Temple be built by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jews in their native Land of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem. Jeruſalem</hi> now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Turks and hereticall Chriſtians ſhall at that time be purged from filth, and be the only Receptacle of the children of God. But when that time ſhall be, I have abundantly ſhewn in the Sections before. And in that ſeaſon ſhall <hi>Benjamin</hi> be ſent down from his good father in the power of his right arm, and <hi>Joſeph</hi> (even <hi>Ben-Joſeph)</hi> ſhall make himſelf known to his Brethren, who did hate him, ſhoot at him, caſt him into the pir, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him to the Gentiles. Which excellent Parallels of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and Chriſt are fully explained in the <hi>Maſsorch, Zoar,</hi> and in <hi>Rabbi-Aſſe,</hi> beſides <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> in the Revelations. Notwithſtanding in citing theſe Jewiſh Traditions, I would not be miſtaken, as if I maintained a ſecond deſcention of our Saviour Chriſt from Heaven, as the Millenaries do; or that the Jews muſt have him come perſonally down from heaven to deſtroy the whole world, and reſtore them to their Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> I mean no ſuch thing. God hath other means to bring his purpoſes to paſſe then, by ſending his Sonne Chriſt to ſojourn the ſecond time upon earth. A ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet a King, muſt work all this for them: yet not a <hi>Moſes</hi> of their own bloud, but a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the North; who ſhall work the works of God in righteouſneſſe, and make peace like a mighty ſtream overflow the whole earth.</p>

The learned Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Philoſophers (who have more throughly ſearched into the ſecrets of Aſtrology) rightlier place their four Monarchies according to the four coaſts of Heaven. 1. The Eaſtern Monarchy of the Aſſyrians. 2. The two Southern Monarchies of the Perſians and Grecians, bounded within the circumference of 3600 miles, or 11 degrees of latitude. 3. The Weſtern Monarchy of the Romans. 4. and laſtly, the Northern Monarchy (but in right accompt the fifth) muſt be of the Northern LION, which to the amazement of Chriſtendome, ſhall ariſe from the Northern Sea, and pitch his Tents in the aſhes of the Eaſtern and Weſtern Monarchies. But now having made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo oft of this V.

For the diſperſion and rejection of the Jews, the revelation of Antichriſt with the Fulneſſe of the Gentiles, was propheſied to be accompliſhed in the fourth Monarchy, all which we ſee are punctually fulfilled. None of which ſhould yet have come to paſſe, if our Saviour Chriſt was not to be incarnate before the end of the Roman Empire. Therefore as the rejection of the Jews with theſe other ſigns and things was to be in the fourth Monarchy; ſo their converſion and remiſſion into the Church, and the glorious eſtate of the Goſpel upon earth muſt be in another fifth Monarchy, which is yet to come.</p>

which I have ſeen of his (ſome of which I have) I cannot ſee how they ſmell any whit of a prophetique ſpirit; they ſpeak him a great Scholar in Aſtrology, but no Prophet. But there was living in K. <hi>Lucius</hi> daies another <hi>Merlin</hi> (called the firſt) a Scottiſh man, and he is the true <hi>Merlin,</hi> and if any Prophecies could be found of his, great credit was to be given to them.

Of his there is but one Prophecie extant, which I found in that antient Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle of <hi>Nennius</hi> of <hi>Bangor</hi> of the <hi>Saxons</hi> (who yet lives in Manuſcript) K. <hi>Lucius</hi> being as yet unconverted from Paganiſme to Chriſtianity, would needs joyn in confederacy with <hi>Santoline</hi> a King of the <hi>Scutti</hi> (now <hi>Scots)</hi> to raiſe warre againſt the Roman Emperour; to which purpoſe he asked councel of <hi>Merlin</hi> what he ſhould do in this matter; who earneſtly dehorted him from his purpoſe; and in the end prevailed. <hi>Merlin</hi> propheſied to him, <q rend="margQuotes">That within leſſe then a ſeſquidecumane period of time, the Eagles head ſhould be cloven in two; one part whereof <hi>Agar</hi> ſhould burn with fire, and <hi>Japhet</hi> the other after the grand revolution of daies.

            <p>Thou therefore the eternall and incomprehenſible Father of lights, the indiviſible God of peace and unity, look down at length upon the afflicted eſtate of thy Goſpel and mournfull face of thy Church, clouded with ſects and ſchiſms, rent by civill combuſtions, dying by the wounds which her ſons have given, and wallowing in that gore which was ſhed by the hands of her own children. Though our ſins have deſerved that we ſhould for ever be caſt out of the ſight of thy countenance, yet reſpect thou the bloud of thy Sonne, crying better things then that of <hi>Abel,</hi> and be once at one again with thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance <hi>Abraham</hi> knows us not, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ignorant of us, but thou art our Father, and in thee ſhall be all our affiance, with whom even the worſt of men have found mercy. Extend the light of thy loving-kindenes to the Tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and return to the many thouſands of Iſrael, for the time to build up Zion is come, and the daies of reſtoring Jeruſalem cannot be prolonged. For why? Thy ſervants think upon her ſtones, and favour the very duſt thereof. But remember <hi>Edom,</hi> O Lord, as thou remembredſt <hi>Babel,</hi> which have cryed ſo oft, Down with it, down with it to the very earth. Pour thy vengeance down upon the Beaſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the red Dragon of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who never knew thy name, that ſo the ſorrowfull ſighings of the Priſoners may come before thee. and thy ſervants be preſerved that are appointed to die. Let thy work be upon the MAN of thy right hand, and upon the Son of man whom thou haſt made ſo ſtrong for thy ſelf, that <hi>Pharaoh, Elam, Meſheck,</hi> with the ſonnes of <hi>Tubal</hi> may fall in the midſt of them that are ſlain by the ſword, and may deſcend into the midſt of hell with all that help them, even the whole multitude of the Uncircumciſed, whoſe Lot is to goe into the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the Earth. There ſhall they have their beds with the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed near thoſe Valiants, which are gone down to the grave, with their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of war, and have laid their ſwords under their heads, becauſe they were the fear of the mighty in the Land of the Living. But what ſhall be ſaid to the Captain of the Nations, or to the Angell deſtroying <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babylon?</hi> Even this, That the Lord hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people ſhall truſt in it. He will leave an afflicted people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord: He ſhall give them a pure Law, that they may pray to him with one conſent. He ſhall open the doors of darkneſſe, the gates of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity ſhall he break down, that the world may be filled with the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the Sea. O thou ſower of diſcord, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of iniquity, how long wilt thou delight to murther, ſpoil and purſue the diſtreſſed? Knoweſt thou not that it will be bitterneſſe in the end? Command the people to return every man from purſuing his brother: for lo, a Nation is riſen againſt you, a mighty Nation and terrible from the Eaſt, whoſe horſes aee fire and his Chariots flames of fire to devour: his men are as ſwift as the Eagle, who will have no compaſſion on the fruit of the womb, nor ſhall their eye pity: They ſhall encompaſſe thy Tents with an intent to lay all waſte before them, but nevertheleſſe be confident and bold

in the Lord of Hoſts: for fire ſhall come down from Heaven and return their wickedneſſe upon their heads, and their doings upon their own pates. O thou worſhip of Iſrael! how wonderfull art thou in thy doings toward the children of men! Bringing light out of darkneſſe, ſtrength out of weakneſſe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Juſtice the mean to the manifeſtation of thy goodneſſe and glory! As for me, I will expect him who is as well the King of Salem, Peace, as <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeck,</hi> the King of Juſtice, all my daies: and will heartily pray for his coming, who ſhall bring every work into judgement, and every thing to a legall triall, whether it be good or evill. He is the Lamb upon the white Throne, before whoſe face Heaven and Earth ſhall fly away, and the Sea be no more found: Death and Hell ſhall give up the dead that are in them, and every Name that is not written in the Book of Life, ſhall be caſt into the Lake of fire. For which time all the Creation groaneth, crying out to be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, and reſtored to the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God. Even ſo, come Lord Jeſus, come quickly, that ſin may be deſtroyed for ever, and righteouſneſſe eternally eſtabliſhed in ſtead thereof, <hi>Amen.</hi>
