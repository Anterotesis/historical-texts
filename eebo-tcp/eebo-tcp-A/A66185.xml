            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Words are part of that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Application, which the <hi>Apostle</hi> here makes of his excellent Discourse concerning the <hi>Exercise of Christian Charity,</hi> in that great Instance of <hi>Condescention</hi> to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities</hi> of our <hi>Weaker Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">See ch. xiv. 1.</note> in the foregoing <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The <hi>Occasion</hi> of it was this:</head>
               <p>There were in those first times, many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Jews,</hi> who tho they were converted to the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts xv. 1.—xxi. 20.</note> yet still continued <hi>zealous for the Law</hi>; and not only carefully observed themselves all the <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of it,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60618:3"/>
but would also by any means impose upon all others also, the observance of them. And how earnest they were upon this account, and how much they hated the <hi>Gentile Converts,</hi> upon whom the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not <hi>think fit to lay any such burden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts xv. 19,—28. Gal. v. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> many Passages both in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> do sufficiently declare.</p>
               <p>But as in all other differences it seldom happens that the whole heat of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie rests only on one side; so here, tho the <hi>Jewish Converts</hi> were both the first beginners of this Dispute, and the more zealous pursuers of it, yet neither were the <hi>Gentile</hi> Christians utterly without fault in it; but so <hi>far stood fast in that liberty, wherewith Christ had made them free,</hi> as not only to despise the weakness and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the others,<note place="margin">Gal. v. 1.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. xi. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> but to be ready almost, even to cut them off from their Communion.</p>
               <p>I need not say how dangerous such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie as this might have proved, nor what a stop it might have put to the progress of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> in those first beginnings of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Great were the difficulties which the <hi>Apostles</hi> underwent on this occasion, whilst they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60618:3"/>
so to menage themselves between these two Parties, as not only not to offend ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but, if it were possible, to bring them Both to such a temper with one another, that neither the <hi>Gentile Convert</hi> might despise the weakness of his <hi>Judaizing</hi> Brother; nor the <hi>Jewish</hi> Votary judge too severely of the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Gentile</hi> Christian.</p>
               <p>And this was the design of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before my <hi>Text.</hi> Where addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as indeed he seems to have done this whole <hi>Epistle,</hi> to the <hi>Gentile Christians</hi>; and whom, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truer Notion of their <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> as to this matter, he therefore calls the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>strong in the Faith:</hi> v. 1.<note place="margin">Rom. xv. 1.</note> He exhorts them in a most admirable Discourse on this Subject through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that whole <hi>Chapter, to bear the Infirmities of the Weak</hi>;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> i. e. not to grieve nor despise them for their mistaken Zeal, but by complying a little, and condescending to their Infirmities, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, if it should please God, to draw them out of their Error. <hi>Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verse 2.</note> And then concludes all in the words of the <hi>Text,</hi> wherein we have,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60618:4"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> A hearty <hi>Prayer</hi> to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, That he would inspire them so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually with a Spirit of <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> that notwithstanding all their differences, they might join unanimously, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> not only in the same <hi>common Worship of God,</hi> but with the same <hi>hearty affection</hi> to one another: <q>Now the God of patience and consolation, grant you to be <hi>like-minded</hi> one towards another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Christ Jesus; that ye may with <hi>one Mind</hi> and <hi>one Mouth</hi> glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>secondly,</hi> An <hi>Exhortation,</hi> as the final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult of his whole <hi>Discourse,</hi> That they should with all <hi>charitable condescention</hi> and <hi>kindness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> one another, and not <hi>despise,</hi> and <hi>censure,</hi> and <hi>deprive</hi> one another, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their <hi>Charity,</hi> or their <hi>Communion</hi>; <q>Wherefore <hi>receive</hi> ye one another, as Christ also <hi>received</hi> us, to the Glory of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In which <hi>words,</hi> as they thus lie before us in the Occasion and Design of them, there are two things that will offer themselves to our consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60618:4"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> An <hi>Exhortation</hi> to these <hi>Dissenting Christians,</hi> and in them to all of us, Not to break either <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> with one another, upon the account of such things wherein we may securely differ; but mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>bear</hi> with one another in our <hi>differences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Chrysost. Theophylact,</hi> &amp;c. in loc.</note> An <hi>Enforcement</hi> of this <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> from two of the greatest Considerations that can possibly engage any Christian to an observance of it; <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From the <hi>Example of Christ</hi> towards us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the greater <hi>Glory</hi> that will hereby redound to <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Wherefore <hi>receive</hi> ye one another, as Christ also <hi>received</hi> us, to the Glory of God.</q>
               <p>I shall make it my endeavour with all the plainess that I can, to pursue both the <hi>Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> and the <hi>Enforcement</hi> in the three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Propositions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That there may be <hi>differences</hi> in matters of lesser moment, between very good and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Christians, without any just reflection either upon the <hi>Men,</hi> or upon their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60618:5"/>II. That these <hi>differences</hi> ought not to hinder such persons from agreeing together, not only in a <hi>common Charity,</hi> but, if it be possible, in a <hi>common Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> too.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That to this End it is the Duty of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> but especially of those who are the <hi>strong in Faith,</hi> not only to pray for such a <hi>Union,</hi> but, as they have opportunity, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to labour Themselves, and earnestly to stir up all Others, to endeavour after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 1.</note>And <hi>first; That there may be</hi> Differences <hi>in matters of lesser moment between very good and zealous Christians, without any just reflection upon the</hi> Men, <hi>or upon their</hi> Religion.</p>
               <p>For proof of which, I think I need go no farther than the very History of my <hi>Text.</hi> I have already said how great a division there was between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and the <hi>Gentile</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, about the <hi>Ritual Observances</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> and with what a Zeal the <hi>Dissenting Parties</hi> managed the Dispute, till they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most lost their <hi>Charity,</hi> and made a deplorable <hi>Schism</hi> in the <hi>Church of Christ.</hi> And yet I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60618:5"/>
no man will say that this was at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory either to the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>common Christianity,</hi> or to the <hi>Infallible Authority</hi> with which the <hi>Apostles</hi> had deliver'd it unto them.</p>
               <p>And for the <hi>Parties</hi> themselves that thus dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd with one another, that they had a true <hi>Zeal</hi> on both sides for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and thought it matter of <hi>Conscience,</hi> the one to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi> these <hi>Ceremonial Institutions</hi> as what God still required of them; the other to <hi>refuse</hi> any such <hi>Imposition,</hi> as not only a needless Burden, but even repugnant to the <hi>Grace of Christ</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them in his <hi>Gospel</hi>; St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts xv. 28. Gal. v. 2.</note> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of this very Argument, does clearly bear witness to them, Ch. xiv. 6. Where he makes use of this very thing as one Reason why they should mutually tolerate one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their <hi>Dissentions; viz.</hi> That however they <hi>differ'd</hi> in their <hi>Notions</hi> as to <hi>these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</hi> yet they were both perfectly agreed in the same common <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>discharge</hi> of their <hi>Duty.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. xiv. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>He that regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

               <p>Is it that in their <hi>Church,</hi> tho there be indeed as many <hi>differences</hi> as in ours, yet this makes not against them, seeing they have a certain Rule, whenever they please,<note place="margin">Bellarm to. 1. p. 1377. de Not.

Because if they <hi>differ</hi> about any Point, they for that very reason, conclude it to be <hi>no matter of Faith.</hi> But besides the Impertinence of this Answer, which amounts to no more than this, that they <hi>do agree</hi> in what they <hi>do agree,</hi> and <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> only in those things in which they <hi>differ</hi>: This is what we say for our selves concerning our Differences; We agree in all those things that are necessary to a <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Saving Faith</hi>; and if we <hi>differ</hi> in matters of lesser moment, 'tis no more than what all other Christians have ever done, and what those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> its self at this day do.</p>
               <p>So that still it must remain, either that those <hi>Differences</hi> which were among the <hi>Christians</hi> of old, and which are among us now, are no <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice</hi> at all to the <hi>common Truth</hi> which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess; or if they be, the Consequence will fall upon those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> no less, that I do not say, and more severely, than upon us, and be of the same Force against <hi>Their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that it can be against <hi>Ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I must carry this <hi>Reflection</hi> a great deal farther; for,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60618:9"/>3<hi>dly.</hi> If once this <hi>Principle</hi> be allowed, That because men differ in some things, they ought not to be credited in any, what then will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, not only of the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> as it now stands in Opposition to <hi>Popery,</hi> but even of <hi>Christianity</hi> its self? For might not a <hi>Turk</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> if he were minded to give himself so much trouble to so little purpose as this late <hi>Author</hi> has done, draw out a large <hi>HISTORY</hi> of the <hi>VARIATIONS</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> among themselves, from the Controversie of the <hi>Text,</hi> unto this day; and then by the very same <hi>Principle</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude against us all, That we have none of us any certain Grounds for Our <hi>Religion,</hi> because the <hi>differences</hi> that are among us, plainly shew, that some of us must be deceived? And to go yet one step farther; Might not a <hi>Sceptick</hi> by the same <hi>Rule,</hi> argue against all <hi>Religion,</hi> and even against all <hi>Reason</hi> too; That the disagreement of mankind in these and many other <hi>Points</hi> of the greatest <hi>Importance,</hi> plainly shews there is no <hi>certainty</hi> in any <hi>thing</hi>; and therefore that we ought not to rely either upon the <hi>one,</hi> or upon the <hi>other?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It remains therefore, that unless we will overthrow all the measures of <hi>Christian Charity</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60618:9"/>
towards our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> and the <hi>common Truth,</hi> I do not say both of <hi>their Faith</hi> and of our own, but even of <hi>Christianity</hi> its self, nay and of all <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in general; We must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That good Christians may <hi>differ</hi> from one another in matters of lesser moment, without any <hi>just Reflection</hi> either upon <hi>themselves</hi> or their <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here therefore I must desire not to be misunderstood. For when I say, that Christians may, without any danger to themselves, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparagement to the Truth of their Religion, <hi>differ</hi> with one another; I mean only (as the <hi>Terms</hi> of my <hi>Proposition</hi> expresly shew) in <hi>les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser matters</hi>; such as do not concern the <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor destroy the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; nor are otherwise so <hi>clearly revealed,</hi> but that Wise and Good Men, after all their Enquiries, may still continue to <hi>differ</hi> in their <hi>Opinions</hi> concerning them. For otherwise, if Interest and Prejudice blind mens eyes, and they <hi>err</hi> because they resolve they will not be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; and so by their own fault continue in mistakes contrary to the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and destructive of <hi>Piety</hi>: If, for instance, Men will profess to believe but in <hi>One God,</hi> and yet

                  <hi>worship Thousands</hi>; If they will read ov<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r the <hi>second Commandment,</hi> and nevertheless both <hi>make</hi> and <hi>bow</hi> down before <hi>Graven Images</hi> in despite of it; If, whilst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they acknowledge <hi>Christ</hi> to have <hi>instituted</hi> the <hi>Blessed Eucharist</hi> in <hi>both kinds,</hi> they <hi>command</hi> it to be <hi>administred</hi> but in <hi>One</hi>; and <hi>pray</hi> in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> tho St <hi>Paul</hi> has spent almost a whole Chapter to shew the Folly and Unreasonableness of it: These are <hi>Errors</hi> in which I am not concerned; and tho I should be unwilling, even here, at all adventures to <hi>pronounce</hi> any <hi>Sentence</hi> against the <hi>Men</hi>; yet I must needs say, <hi>that Religion</hi> cannot be very sound, which stands <hi>corrupted</hi> with so many, and such <hi>fundamental Abuses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this makes the difference between those <hi>Errors</hi> for which we <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and those <hi>Controversies</hi> which sometimes arise among <hi>Protestants</hi> themselves. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are in matters of the greatest consequence, such as tend directly to destroy the <hi>Integrity</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Purity</hi> of our <hi>Worship</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as are in their own nature <hi>destructive</hi> of the very <hi>Essentials</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi> Whereas our differences do not at all concern the <hi>Foundations</hi> either of <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Worship;</hi> and are therefore
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60618:10"/>
such in which Good Men, if they be otherwise <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in their <hi>Enquiry,</hi> may <hi>differ,</hi> without any prejudice to themselves, or any <hi>just reflection</hi> upon the <hi>Truth</hi> of their <hi>common Profession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being thus clear'd, in <hi>answer</hi> to the little Endeavours of one of the latest of our <hi>Adversaries</hi> against us upon this Account; I go on, <hi>Secondly,</hi> to shew,</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>That such</hi> differences <hi>as these,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>ought not to hinder such persons from agreeing together, not only in a</hi> common Charity, <hi>but, if it be possible, in a</hi> common Worship <hi>of</hi> God <hi>too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> here expresly <hi>exhorts</hi> these <hi>dissenting Christians</hi> to, and earnestly <hi>prays</hi> to <hi>God</hi> that he might see accomplished in them. That when they came together to the <hi>publick Offices</hi> of the Church, to offer up their <hi>common Prayers</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> to Him, they might do it, not only in the <hi>same form of words,</hi> but with the <hi>same affection of mind</hi> too, both towards <hi>God,</hi> and towards <hi>one another: Now the God of patience and consolation, grant you to be</hi> like-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>one towards another, according to Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;

that ye may with</hi> one Mind <hi>and</hi> one Mouth <hi>glorifie God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such was their <hi>Duty</hi> to one another then; and we ought certainly no less to esteem the same to be our Duty towards one another now: And</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> As to the business of <hi>Charity;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God forbid that any <hi>differences</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> whatsoever, much less such little ones as those we are now speaking of, should ever make us deny that to our fellow Christians. 'Tis true indeed, our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> once foretold to his <hi>Disciples,</hi> That there should rise up Men from among their <hi>Brethren,</hi> who should upon this account not only <hi>put them out of their Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John c. xvi. 2.</note> but even think that it was a matter of Religion to <hi>kill them.</hi> But they were <hi>Jews,</hi> not <hi>Christians,</hi> who were to do this; and He expresly adds, that 'twas their ignorance of Him and his Religion that should carry them on to so furious and intemperate a Zeal;<note place="margin">—Verse 3.</note> 
                  <hi>For these things,</hi> says he, <hi>shall they do unto you, because they have not known the</hi> Father <hi>nor</hi> Me. And we must confess it, to the scandal of our <hi>Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60618:11"/>
that there are a sort of Men who call themselves <hi>Christians</hi> now, that still continue to fulfil this <hi>Prophecy</hi> in the very Letter of it; who not only <hi>cast us out of their Synagogues, that</hi> we should not much complain of; and, as far as in them lies, cut us off from all the hopes of <hi>Salvation</hi> too; but, to compleat the parallel, openly arm the whole World against us, and teach Men to believe, that 'tis a Work of <hi>Piety</hi> to root us out of it; and therefore, that <hi>whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever killeth us, does do God service.</hi> But in this, as well as in the rest of their <hi>Errors,</hi> they give us but the more effectually to understand how little they have in them of the <hi>true Spirit of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; for sure such things as these they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do, but only that, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> in that other <hi>case</hi> before said, <hi>they have not known the Father nor Him.</hi> And I hope I shall need no Argument to perswade you not to be misled by that which we all of us so justly lament, as one of the most deplorable Corruptions even of <hi>Popery</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christianity</hi> commands us to <hi>love our Enemies</hi>; and sure then we cannot but think it very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reasonable not to <hi>hate our Brethren</hi>; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60618:12"/>
on such an account, as, if it be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, will in this <hi>divided state</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> utterly drive the very name of <hi>brotherly Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> out of it: seeing by whatever Arguments we shall go about to justifie our <hi>uncharitableness</hi> to any Others, they will all equally warrant them to with hold in like manner their <hi>Charity</hi> from us.</p>
               <p>There is no honest, sincere Christian, how <hi>erroneous</hi> soever he may be, but what at least is perswaded that he is in the right; and looks upon Us to be as far from the Truth by differing from Him, as We esteem Him for not agreeing with us. Now if upon the sole account of such differences it be lawful for us to <hi>hate</hi> Another; we must for the very same reason allow it to be as lawful for Him also to <hi>hate</hi> Us. Thus shall we at once invert the <hi>Characteristick</hi> of our Religion;<note place="margin">Joh. 13.35.</note> 
                  <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another</hi>; and turn it into the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Note;</hi> whilst we make our <hi>hatred</hi> to our <hi>Brother</hi> the great mark of our <hi>Zeal</hi> for our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; and conclude him to <hi>love Christ</hi> the <hi>most,</hi> who the <hi>least loves his fellow Christian.</hi>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60618:12"/>How much rather ought we to consider, with our <hi>Apostle,</hi> the <hi>love</hi> of our dear <hi>Master</hi> to us, even whilst we were yet his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> those whom we ought to hope, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their <hi>Errors,</hi> are yet still his <hi>Friends;</hi> and not think those unworthy of our <hi>Charity,</hi> whom we piously presume <hi>God</hi> will not think unworthy of his <hi>Favour</hi>? We suppose them to be mistaken in those things wherein they differ from us, and perhaps they are so; but yet we must consider, that we our selves also are but Men, and therefore may err; and They as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think Us in the wrong, as We do Them: And, for ought I know, we must leave it to the Day of Judgment to decide the Controversie, which of us is in the right.

                  <hi>to bear the Infirmities of the weak</hi>;<note place="margin">—7.</note> and <hi>to receive one another, as Christ also hath received us, to the Glory of God.</hi> But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such <hi>Differences</hi> as these, ought not only not to lessen our <hi>Charity,</hi> but, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not to hinder us from joining together in the same common <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>This was what these <hi>dissenting Christians,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all their Heats and Contentions, nevertheless still continued to do. They did <hi>with one Mouth glorifie God,</hi> even when their differences would not suffer them to do it with <hi>one Heart.</hi> They united together in a <hi>common Worship</hi> of God, tho they could not unite either in Opinion or Affection with one another.</p>
               <p>Indeed where mens <hi>Errors</hi> are such as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do subvert the very <hi>Essentials</hi> of our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worship,</hi> it is then in vain to hope for any <hi>Communion</hi> in the <hi>Publick Service</hi> of God with them. We must not destroy the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> out of a Zeal to enlarge the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of <hi>Christians.</hi> He would be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending Votary indeed, who for the sake
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60618:13"/>
of <hi>praying</hi> to <hi>God</hi> with the <hi>Papist,</hi> would <hi>pray</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> too with him: Who rather than be excluded their <hi>Churches,</hi> would <hi>bow down</hi> before their <hi>Images</hi>; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>worship</hi> their <hi>Host,</hi> but even give up his Right to the <hi>Cup</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> only that he might receive that Holy Sacrament in their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is, no doubt, a very desirable thing to <hi>lessen</hi> the <hi>differences</hi> of <hi>Christians,</hi> and enlarge their <hi>Communion,</hi> as far as ever we can: And it has never gone well with the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> since men have been so narrow spirited as to mix the <hi>Controversies</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> with their <hi>Publick Forms</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; and have made their <hi>Liturgies,</hi> instead of being <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Devotion to God,</hi> become <hi>Tests</hi> and <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Opinions</hi> of their <hi>Brethren.</hi> But yet when all is done, the <hi>Truths</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> must not be sacrificed to the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi>; nor the <hi>Honour</hi> of God be given up, to keep up a <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with one another.</p>
               <p>But where mens <hi>Differences</hi> are in <hi>Points</hi> that do not at all affect their <hi>Religious Service;</hi> or not so much, but that <hi>God</hi> may be very well <hi>worshipp'd,</hi> and yet <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>fellow Christians</hi> preserved too; in such cases as this,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60618:14"/>
our <hi>dissentions</hi> ought not only not to lessen our <hi>Charity,</hi> but not to break our <hi>Unity</hi> neither: We may continue to differ, as the <hi>Christians</hi> in my Text did; and yet <hi>with one Mind, and one Mouth, glorifie God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted them to do.</p>
               <p>And this brings me to the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Last Point.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <note place="margin">Prop. 3.</note>III. <hi>That to this End, it is the Duty of all of us, but especially of the</hi> stronger Christians, <hi>not only to</hi> Pray <hi>for such a</hi> Union, <hi>but also, as they have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, heartily to labour</hi> themselves, <hi>and earnestly to stir up all</hi> others <hi>to</hi> endeavour <hi>after it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not believe there is any <hi>good Christian</hi> so little affected with those unhappy Divisions under which the <hi>Church</hi> at this day labours, as not both heartily to deplore them, and to think that nothing could be too much, that might innocently be done on all hands, for the redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of them. But then I am sure the natural Consequence of this must be, what both my <hi>Text,</hi> and this <hi>Discourse</hi> are designed to exhort you to; <hi>viz.</hi> That we ought every one of us, not only heartily to <hi>pray</hi> for such a <hi>Union,</hi> but
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60618:14"/>
also, as we have opportunity, earnestly to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the attainment of it.</p>
               <p>Indeed for what concerns the whole Body of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> on Earth, so many are the Disputes that have arisen among the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parties and Communions of it, and some of them in <hi>Points</hi> so near to the Foundations of Christianity, that whilst Men resolve to keep fast to their Conclusions, and will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the plainest Arguments to convince them of their <hi>Errors,</hi> 'tis in vain to hope ever to see things brought to such a <hi>Temper,</hi> as we could wish in that. But especially whilst that part which is the most corrupt, is so far from being willing to concur to any such <hi>Union,</hi> that on the contrary, she has cut off all possibility of attaining it. And by arrogating an unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Infallibility</hi> to her self, and <hi>Authority</hi> over all others, will neither <hi>reform</hi> her own <hi>abuses,</hi> nor admit any into her <hi>Communion,</hi> that will not profess the same <hi>Errors,</hi> in which she her self stands involved. So that here, all we can even wish for, is, that Men would at last be so wise, as tho they differ in <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet to <hi>love</hi> as <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> and agree together in a <hi>common Charity,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60618:15"/>
till we shall be so happy as to <hi>unite</hi> in a <hi>common Faith</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for us whom it has pleased <hi>God,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us from the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superstitions</hi> of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to unite together in the common name of <hi>Protestant, Reformed Christians,</hi> would we but as heartily labour after <hi>Peace,</hi> as we are all of us very highly exhorted to it; I cannot see why we who are so happily join'd together in a <hi>common profession of the same Faith,</hi> at least, I am sure in all the <hi>necessary points</hi> of it; and I hope amidst all our <hi>lesser differences,</hi> in a <hi>common love and charity to one another,</hi> should not also be united in the same <hi>common Worship</hi> of God too.</p>
               <p>I will not now enter into any Dispute, to shew how little reason there is for any one to <hi>separate</hi> from the <hi>Offices</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> upon the account of those few Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have sometimes been offer'd to justifie the doing of it. This is a work both too large for such a Discourse; and besides the design of my present Undertaking. And that one Concession of many of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> themselves, who tho they continue <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily</hi> to <hi>separate</hi> from us, yet nevertheless
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60618:15"/>
freely allow of what they call <hi>Occasional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with us, I think sufficiently shews how little real ground there is for those <hi>Scruples,</hi> that have so long detain'd them in an unjust aversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our Worship. Blessed be <hi>God,</hi> who has abundantly justified both the Purity of our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the Innocency of our <hi>Worship,</hi> not only by the general Approbation of the <hi>Reform'd Churches</hi> abroad, who both freely <hi>communicate</hi> with us in our <hi>religious Offices,</hi> and have often given Testimony in favour of them; but in the happy Conviction of many at Home, who were once <hi>Enemies</hi> to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, but who now go with us into the same <hi>House of God as Friends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed the things for which some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake us now, are no other than what they were in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> when yet there was no such thing as <hi>Separation</hi> from our <hi>Communion</hi>: But on the contrary, the old <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> themselves, tho they disliked some things in our <hi>Worship,</hi> yet freely declared they thought it a Crime to <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> upon the account of them. And they who at this day <hi>separate</hi> from us, for the sake of those few <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> that have been made for the <hi>Order</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60618:16"/>
                  <hi>Decency</hi> of our <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> must for the same reason have <hi>separated</hi> from all the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Christian World,</hi> for above 1500 Years; in none of which they might not have found as great, that I do not say, and much greater, occasion of <hi>Offence,</hi> than they can in Ours.</p>
               <p>But yet, since mens <hi>Scruples</hi> are unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and after all that can be said, they will still differ even about <hi>indifferent</hi> things, and be <hi>afraid</hi> many times, where <hi>no Fear is</hi>; and a too long Experience has already shewn us, That if ever we mean to accomplish that <hi>Union</hi> so much recommended to us by our <hi>Apostle,</hi> so advantageous to the Church at all times, but especially at this time so necessary to our Peace and our Establishment, that it seems to be the only way that yet remains to settle and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us; and upon all these accounts so much to be desired by all Good Men, we must seek it by that Rule which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here proposed to the Dissenting Christians of my <hi>Text, We then that are strong in the faith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. xv. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please our selves.</hi> I cannot but think it a Reflection becoming every good Christian among us, but in a more especial manner, worthy the Consideration of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60618:16"/>
such an <hi>Auditory</hi> as this, Whether somewhat may not yet be done for the sake of Peace, and to bring things to such a <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition</hi> of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> and <hi>Bishops</hi> to King <hi>James,</hi> for which they were committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
                  </note> TEMPER, that both <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi> may still be preserved, and yet our <hi>Unity</hi> no longer broken.</p>
               <p>And for <hi>Exhortations</hi> to so good and Christian a Work, shall I set before you the <hi>Example</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> recommended to us in the <hi>Text,</hi> with what a mighty <hi>condescention</hi> he has treated Us; how He came down from Heaven, <hi>and took upon Him the form of a servant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. ii. 6, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made in the likeness of a sinful man, humbled Himself even to the Death upon the Cross for us;</hi> How He still bears not only with our <hi>Infirmities,</hi> but with our <hi>Sins</hi> too; and by all these won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful instances of his <hi>Love</hi> to us, teaches us, says St. <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. iv. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>How we ought also to love one another?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or rather, shall I shew you, how far such a Blessed <hi>Union</hi> as this, would conduce to the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to the <hi>Security</hi> of <hi>our Religion,</hi> and to the promotion of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> among us?</p>
               <p>I need not say what a dishonour our <hi>Divisions</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60618:17"/>
have already brought to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> nor what a stop they have put to the <hi>progress</hi> of it. Great, to be sure, is the <hi>Advantage</hi> which our <hi>Enemies</hi> either have, or at least hoped to have made, by those Contests which they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so much pains both to <hi>bring in,</hi> and to <hi>keep up</hi> among us: And methinks there should need no other Argument to stir up every true Friend to the name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> to endeavour all he can to compose our <hi>Differences,</hi> than this one thing, That we are sufficiently convinced who they are that we <hi>please,</hi> and whose <hi>Interests</hi> we serve, by the continuance of them.</p>
               <p>Let us add to this, what great Obligations our Holy Religion lays upon us,<note place="margin">Rom. xiv. 19.</note> to <hi>follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter those things that make for peace, and whereby we may edifie one another</hi>: How our Saviour has set it down as the very Badge of our Disciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;<note place="margin">Joh. xiii. 35.</note>

                  <hi>To mark them which cause divisions and offences, contrary to the Doctrine which we have learnt, and avoid them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:60618:17"/>With what a scrupulous care did St. <hi>Paul</hi> manage himself between the <hi>dissenting parties</hi> in my <hi>Text?</hi> What admirable <hi>Rules</hi> did he lay down for them to walk by? and with what an affectionate <hi>earnestness</hi> did he enforce them? <hi>If there be any consolation in Christ,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. ii.</note> 
                  <hi>if any comfort of Love, if any fellowship of the Spirit,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">—2.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye be</hi> like-minded, <hi>having the</hi> same Love, <hi>being of</hi> one Accord, <hi>of</hi> one Mind.</p>
               <p>And may I not beg leave, tho not with the <hi>Authority,</hi> yet with the <hi>Charity</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to apply all this to those unhappy <hi>Divisions</hi> that at this day rend in pieces the Church of Christ among us; and beseech you, by all these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing Considerations, to pursue those things which may make for our <hi>Peace;</hi> and for the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of those <hi>breaches,</hi> which the malice of our <hi>Enemies</hi> too successfully begun, and our own <hi>weaknesse</hi> has too fatally kept up among us.</p>
               <p>Never, certainly, was there a time, since our <hi>Divisions</hi> first began, in which we had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason to consider of such a <hi>Union,</hi> or, I hope, a fairer opportunity to promise our selves an Accomplishment of it. Only let us all be as careful to improve it, as I am perswaded
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60618:18"/>
we have all of us not only seem'd to desire, but have indeed earnestly long'd for it.</p>
               <p>Let us shew the sense we have of that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Deliverance</hi> God has given us out of the <hi>hand</hi> of our <hi>Enemies,</hi> by <hi>uniting</hi> our selves in the strictest League of <hi>Friendship</hi> with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have defended our <hi>Church</hi> by our <hi>Arguments;</hi> let us now by our <hi>Charity</hi> settle and establish it, against the like <hi>Dangers</hi> for the time to come.</p>
               <p>This will indeed render both our <hi>selves</hi> and our <hi>Religion</hi> Glorious to the World; and may be a Happy <hi>Augury</hi> that the <hi>blessed time</hi> so long wrapped up in <hi>sacred Prophecy,</hi> is indeed now ready to be revealed: When the <hi>Church of Christ</hi> being purged from those <hi>Corruptions</hi> that have so long defaced its Beauty, shall again appear in its <hi>primitive Purity.</hi> When all <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> being every where abolished, and the <hi>Mystery of Iniquity</hi> laid fully open, and the <hi>Man of Sin</hi> destroy'd; true Religion and sincere Piety shall again reign throughout the World; <hi>God himself shall pitch his Tabernacle among us,</hi>
