            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to my <hi>Education,</hi> I muſt tell thee, it was ſuch a was <hi>in the fear of the Lord,</hi> into which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh thee to haſten, and therein continue all the dayes of thy life: for I aſſure thee, there is no ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but in that ſtate, and in the pure life of innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from which all men by diſobedience are fallen: It's not talking of the <hi>holy life,</hi> but living it, that can give thee an entrance into <hi>Paradice;</hi> for the flaming Sword is turned againſt the <hi>tranſgreſſor,</hi> ſo, that he cannot touch the <hi>tree of life,</hi> much-leſs eat thereof; but with the <hi>Serpent</hi> muſt feed upon <hi>duſt</hi> all the dayes of his life: O, Make haſte Friend, to the life of Obedience, and come down from the barren Mountains leſt thou die, for there is no bread to be had there: Conſult no longer with the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents</hi> carnal reaſonings <hi>in thee,</hi> nor with his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb facs="tcp:105843:3"/>
and buſie <hi>Agents without thee,</hi> perſwading thee, that purity is not to be attained here. Oh! that thou wouldeſt conſider, that <hi>the Soul which ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth muſt die;</hi> and that, <hi>as the tree falls, ſo it lyes:</hi> that <hi>there is no Repentance in the Grave;</hi> nor any other Way to life, but by <hi>keeping the Commandments of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friend,</hi> Thy Enemy is within thee, therefore <hi>look at home,</hi> keep the Watch well there, and (if thou cauſt) <hi>pray that thou enter not into temptation:</hi> for the <hi>Devil</hi> now goes about roaring like a <hi>Lyon,</hi> and is ſeeking whom he may devour Oh! beleeve not thoſe that ſay, The beſt of Gods Children cannot be free from ſin in this life; for I declare to thee, they are all of the black Army of <hi>Satan,</hi> and for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his kingdom are they come to fight, and to make War with the <hi>Lamb</hi> and his followers, who walk with him in white. Remember thou, <hi>That without holineſs no man shall ſee God,</hi> and that <hi>the pure in heart,</hi> and they <hi>only, can ſee him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thou who art flown high in thy comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of aiery Notions <hi>without life,</hi> thou muſt deſcend and dwell in the <hi>Low-valley,</hi> where once thou hadſt ſome ſooting; for thy ſafety is there, and no where elſe: <hi>Come</hi> thou into the <hi>cool of the day,</hi> and hear Gods voice unto thee, who chargeth thee with eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>tree of knowledge of Good and Evil:</hi> Thou haſt loſt thy ſtate of happineſs by hearkning to the Woman [thy fallen Reaſon] who is not to ſpeak in the Church, for thou haſt ſuffered to be marr'd the holy Creation of God in thee, and there is no way leſt now for thee but to come to Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>the light of the world, and life of man;</hi> He it is, though thou haſt deſpiſed him [becauſe his appearance is

            <p>
               <hi>Friend,</hi> What I have further to ſay in this <hi>Preface,</hi> may give thee ſome <hi>light</hi> of the <hi>crooked-wayes</hi> thou art not to walk in, and therefore ſhall proceed to give thee an accompt of my wandring ſteps, which the Lord hath now brought to my remembrance, even from my <hi>Child hood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The fear of God,</hi> I ſay, was before me, even from my <hi>Youth,</hi> ſo that when I was but a School-Boy, I durſt not omit my Morning and Evening Sacrifice of <hi>Prayer</hi> to God, upon any pretence whatſoever: Never did I ſwear an Oath but once, ſince I was born, and that was upon great provocation by a lewd Boy, when I was about twelve yeers of age: But ſuch was the goodneſs of God to me then, that preſently after. I had ſpoken the word, I found trouble in my Conſcience, and condemnation for it many yeers after.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Companions</hi> were moſtly ſuch as were ſober, and freeſt from ſcandal; and I can truly ſay, I <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred my Creator in the dayes of my Youth,</hi> and was a true ſeeker of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of Heaven from ſuch time as I had an underſtanding to believe there was ſuch a <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be ſought after.</p>
            <p>And when I came to be about 16. yeers of age, I then began to <hi>Pray</hi> out of my uſual Form, as find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nought but deadneſs in my Form of Prayers, which I had got, ſo that by little and little I Prayed by rote; and I encreased in yeers, I applyed my
<pb facs="tcp:105843:4"/>
ſelf to Reading <hi>Sermon-Books,</hi> and often to Hear and Write <hi>Sermons</hi> after the choiceſt of the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>-Way, whom I conceived then were moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. Early did I riſe, to Read and Meditate of God, whom I then look'd on at a diſtance from me, [as moſt men do] but <hi>he was in this place, and I knew if not:</hi> the Lord was with me in all my <hi>crooked-wayes</hi> and preſerved me, but I ſaw him not, nor what it was that breathed in me after God: I did not know it was the ſeed of God which was in bondage and groaned to be delivered into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>Often did I with <hi>Tears</hi> beg for pardon of my ſins, and <hi>aſſurance</hi> of my Salvation, which I prized above all the world, and did often ſay within my ſelf, That if I could but gain <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of that, I could be content to be miſerable in this World as long as I ſhould live in it. <hi>Company,</hi> was many-times a burthen unto me, and to be retired and much <hi>alone</hi> was my great delight, that ſo I might freely breath forth my Soul to God for the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of his Love, and to be freed from everlaſting burnings. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>Eternity</hi> was often in my mind, and many-times would this voice ſound in me, <hi>Ariſe ye dead, and come to judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But alas!</hi> What hope of <hi>Aſſurance</hi> could I have of my <hi>Salvation,</hi> whileſt I gave Faith to ſuch <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> as affirmed, That, <hi>the beſt of Gods Saints cannot be free from ſin in this life:</hi> and in the ſame breath alſo ſaid, That the leaſt ſin deſerved the <hi>torments of Hell</hi> fire for ever. May not a poor Soul [who preſſeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>holineſs,</hi>] truly ſay, They are miſerable Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Oh! who can be <hi>aſſured</hi> of his Salvation, or gain <hi>Aſſurance</hi> thereof, that beleeves <hi>falſe Doctrine</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105843:5"/>
to be <hi>true,</hi> and inſtead of living the Holy life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it is not attainable? Can any man be aſſured of his Salvation whileſt he is a ſinner? ſurely no: and if no <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> then ſurely no <hi>Salvation:</hi> for <hi>the Soul that ſinneth muſt die,</hi> and without <hi>holineſs, no man shall ſee the Lord.</hi>

            <p>By this and ſuch like Doctrine, was my life made very uncomfortable: and though I knew little by my ſelf to deſerve the torments of <hi>Hell.</hi> [being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of a ſober life, and free from the groſs pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this world.] Yet the fear of Hell was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> torment unto my mind, inſomuch, that I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wiſh'd I had never been born, or that there had been no God to puniſh me. Yet I can truly ſay, <hi>Religion</hi> was my chief buſinſs and my great delight was in hearing <hi>Sermons,</hi> receiving the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> (as they call it,) to be often converſant in <hi>Faſtings,</hi> and frequent in outward <hi>Worships,</hi> and carnal <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> (all which periſh with the uſing) ſo that I never could have enough of them, <hi>Tears</hi> was my delight, and <hi>mourning</hi> in ſecret was a <hi>refreshing</hi> to my Soul and when I could not <hi>weep,</hi> I <hi>prayed:</hi> and when I could not pray, I wept; and ſometimes I prayed and wept, till I had wept my ſelf to ſilence before the Lord: and when I neither could <hi>weep nor pray,</hi> then trouble and perplexity ſeized on my Spirit, and I ſhould begin to fear the danger of a hard heart, and that the Spirit of <hi>Prayer</hi> was taken from me. <hi>Blaſphemeus</hi> thoughts would ſometimes ſurprize me, and the terrors of Hell get hold upon me, and how to eſcape I knew not No comfort could I receive from any of my <hi>Teachers,</hi> for when by the beſt of their <hi>marks and ſigns</hi> I judged my ſelf in a ſafe condition, yet the witneſs of God would
<pb facs="tcp:105843:5"/>
riſe through all that <hi>falſe peace</hi> which they had ſpoke to me, and accuſe me of being a ſinner.</p>
            <p>And this was my caſe for many yeers, and my condition was very unſafe, (as all theirs is, who are yet in <hi>Egypt,</hi> leaning upon men, and forſaking the Lord.) But the Lord God after long ſeeking to him in ſecret, ſeeing my integrity, and that the deſire of my <hi>Soul</hi> was after him, and to be holy as well as happy, He mercifully brought me out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and delivered me from thoſe cruel <hi>Taskmaſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> of Confuſion, and ſet me at liberty to travel to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Holy Land:</hi> for in all the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> I found no outward Guide to lead me out of my <hi>Egiptian</hi> darkneſs, though ſomething within me would often groan, and ſay, <hi>Return unto thy reſt O my Soul:</hi> thus, I ſay, the Lord pitying my ſoul, pardoning my ſins, winking at my ignorance, and bottling up my tears, ſet me free from bondage.</p>
            <p>That, being delivered out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards <hi>Canaan,</hi> I met with divers ſorts of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers,</hi> with whom I had converſe &amp; acquaintance: As, firſt, with thoſe of the <hi>Independent</hi>-way, but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after a ſhort time, that there was little difference between them and the others, and that the path they went in was too broad, and would not bring me to reſt: I forſook them and travelled forward towards thoſe men of the <hi>Baptized</hi>-way, who for ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I heard and obſerved: but finding that the main ſtreſs of their Argument (that their Way was right) was, becauſe they ſubmitted to the Ordinance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> pleading difficulty (if not impoſſibility) for any to come to <hi>Canaan</hi> unleſs they were <hi>re-baptized,</hi> I ſearch'd into the Doctrine of Baptiſms alſo, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I found, That <hi>Water-Baptiſm,</hi> or <hi>Johns Baptiſm</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:105843:6"/>
was but onto <hi>Repentance,</hi> which was effected in me already, and that it could not waſh away my <hi>inward</hi>

               </gap>ilth, and therefore muſt <hi>decreaſe:</hi> And I conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Apoſtle ſaith, There is (now) but one <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> to wit, that of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and that, that is the <hi>only Baptiſm</hi> for every Chriſtian to be Bapized with, (if he will be cleanſed, and purged from ſin.)</p>
            <p>And conſidering that <hi>Ieſus</hi> himſelf <hi>Baptized</hi> none; and that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he came not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel. And that this Ordinance was only <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> and not relating, to <hi>Chriſtians now.</hi> I left them and their <hi>Water,</hi> and travelled towards thoſe called <hi>Notioniſts</hi> with whom, after I had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled a while, I began to conclude them to be the men that I muſt walk with; and ſo followed them as ſeeing more of truth, (to wit, in the Notion of it) then in any I had met with before, and was much enlightned: but after I had been with them a while, I found I <hi>could not Pray</hi> as I was wont to do, and ſo began to fear I was now further from the right way, then ever I was before; and being now come to the <hi>red Sat,</hi> I had a lingring and ſecret longing to the <hi>Garlick and Onions of Egypt</hi> again, yet the Lord kept me from going back into <hi>Egypt,</hi> (where was no <hi>light</hi> at all) but I walked in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> to and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for many yeers together, filling my head with Notions, and comprehending of Myſteries, which were very pleaſant and delightful unto me. Thus I wandred up and down from one tree of knowledge to another, and in many a by-path I trod, <hi>ſeeking for reſt, but found none:</hi> and though the Spirit of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency often cryed in me, <hi>Return, return,</hi> and come into the narrow-way which leads to life; yet I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered my ſelf that I had been there already, and
<pb facs="tcp:105843:6"/>
that I was now come to the Borders of <hi>Canaan:</hi> one while, conceiving my ſelf there, and ſet down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom: but by and by, a branch from the old Root would ariſe in me, and break forth into paſſion, raſh, and haſty words, and overturn all my Confidence again, and give me to underſtand I was not in that Kingdom, for that there was nothing of Pride, or Paſſion, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit or vain laughter, or fooliſh and idle talking and jeaſting, but giving of thanks, and rejoycing in the Lord continually: and that they who were in that kingdom were <hi>led</hi> by the <hi>Spirit, lived</hi> in the Spirit, and <hi>walked</hi> in the Spirit, and were at <hi>reſt</hi> in the Lord, injoying the fellow ſhip and ſociety of <hi>juſt</hi> mens Spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now,</hi> that I was not here, I was clearly convinced often, and inſtead of enjoying this ſtate; I had the other ſet before me, as my Condition; and the Lord let me ſee how my poor Soul was be-wildred: And then after 14 years wandring up and down, I began to ſee and find my way out and not till then: Then I ſaw my ſelf at a loſs, and in the dark; and was made to confeſs, That if I had periſhed in the <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> yet the Lord was righteous in my deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that when he would have led me by the gentle motions of his Spirit, and <hi>Light in me</hi> yet I Refuſed it, and went forth to men, chuſing the <hi>tree of Knowledge,</hi> and neglecting the <hi>tree of Life,</hi> for my <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

people in the Worlds eſteem, was I <hi>directed</hi> the way to eternal life. But after I was perſwaded of the way to life, and convinced of the <hi>truth</hi> as it is <hi>in Jeſus,</hi> and after the ſeed of the Kingdom began to ſtir in my earthly tabernacle, and to take root to my heart, then the <hi>Enemy</hi> came in the form of an <hi>Angel,</hi> and ſet me on a ſuddain upon the <hi>Pinacle</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> where I was made to beleeve, I ſaw over all the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of truth,</hi> and was ready to ſit down there alſo: But after the Lord in his rich Mercy had let me ſee my danger, and how I had been miſled by the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> of <hi>falſe Light:</hi> He directed me to the <hi>low valley,</hi> there to abide, and aſſured me, that if I would be a <hi>true Diſciple</hi> of Chriſt indeed, I muſt take up the <hi>Croſs daily</hi> and follow him, and be obedient to his <hi>Light</hi> in my Conſcience which convinceth of the moſt ſecret ſin.</p>
            <p>And now, that I may bring in my <hi>Teſtimony</hi> to the truth which was <hi>once</hi> delivered to the <hi>Saints,</hi> and which <hi>now</hi> is again made known to the Children of the moſt High; and, That I may ſet to my <hi>Seal</hi> to the Doctrine of the <hi>Croſs:</hi> I here <hi>Declare,</hi> to all the <hi>Sects</hi> up on earth, and to all people, high and low, Profeſſor, or Prophane, <hi>That the deſpiſed people whom the ſcorners of this age, call</hi> QVAKERS, <hi>are the true Diſciples of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> viz.

               </p>
               <p>God when he made the World, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Heaven and the Earth, and the Earth was without form, and <hi>darkneſs</hi> was upon the face of the deep; And in this ſtate is man in his firſt Creation (through the fall) without form, and <hi>darkneſs</hi> is upon him: But when the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God moved upon the Waters, and ſaid, <hi>Let there be</hi> Light, <hi>there was</hi> light; <hi>and the</hi> Light <hi>he called</hi> Day, <hi>and the</hi> Darkneſs <hi>he called</hi> Night <hi>and the Evening and the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were the firſt Day.</hi>

               <p>Now conſider <hi>Friends,</hi> all you who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own the <hi>Light,</hi> calling it natural, carnal, darkneſs, and inſufficient to guide you;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105843:10"/>
What do you judge of your preſent ſtate and condition? Are you not like the Chaos? And is not your little World without form, and void? And is not dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon the face of your deep imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until the ſpirit of God move up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Waters of inſtability, and his <hi>Light</hi> ſpring forth in your underſtandings from his holy Spirit?</p>
               <p>Oh that you who reject the <hi>Light</hi> would conſider this, that you are ſo far from reſt, that you are not yet come to the firſt dayes work of God in your own hearts!

               <p>Have you not read in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> did <hi>not work many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in his own</hi> Countrey, <hi>becauſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples unbelief there?</hi> I do not ſay, he <hi>could</hi> not work them; but this I affirm, The Lord compels none to ſerve him in the dark; but when he hath enlightened man with his own <hi>Light</hi> (with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105843:11"/>
every man that cometh into the World) man is at his choice whether he will follow and obey the light, yea or no: I ſay, the Lord doth not force the Will of man to obedience, but woes him, and beſeecheth him to be reconciled, knowing the great miſery which will juſtly and inevitably follow the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſobedient ſoul.</p>
               <p>Oh! that I could perſwade all men to obedience, that ſo they may eat of the Tree of Life, which by tranſgreſſion man is falne from, and which he cannot touch leſt he dye.</p>
               <p>And now let none ſay that he is not enlightened, or that he wants power, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the penalty of condemnation for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for the Lord requires nothing of man but what he hath given him full power to do, all power in heaven and in earth being in the Son, and this Son of power is freely offered to every man that will receive him; For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his own Son to dye for loſt man, that he might live; I ſay, he is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given a light to the Gentiles, and a Guide to them, as well as a Glory to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and none are excluded who

               <head>Mans true <hi>Guide</hi> is within him; <hi>Or,</hi> The <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt in Man is the true <hi>Guide</hi> of the Soul.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>PAUL</hi> that eminent Apoſtle of Chriſt, and Son of the <hi>Light,</hi> hath declared, That <hi>whatſoever is to be known of God, is manifeſt in man,</hi> (as is ſaid already) <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. Let none then ſay, Lo here, or lo there; but if they ſhould, hear what our Saviour Chriſt faith, <hi>Go not after them, nor follow them, for the kingdom of God is within you, Luke</hi> 17.21. Now if the Kingdom be within, then of neceſſity muſt mans <hi>guide</hi> be there alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105843:12"/>That Chriſt is the Light and Guide of man, ſee <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. and that he is in his <hi>Saints,</hi> read <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead becauſe of ſin;</hi> and again, <hi>If the spirit of him that raiſed up Ieſus from the dead, dwell in you, be that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodyes by his ſpirit that dwelleth in you, Ver.</hi> 11. and <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. <hi>If any man hath not the spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> And again, <hi>If Chriſt be not in you, then are you reprobates,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
               <p>By all which places it is moſt evident, That Chriſt is the <hi>light</hi> of man, and that he lighteth every man that cometh into the World, of what Countrey or Nation ſoever, and none can deny this unleſs he will unman himſelf, and ſay he is not of the race and generation of manking. So then it is clearly demonſtrated to him that can read the Scriptures, That Chriſt is the Saints Guide, and that he is their hope of glory, in them. And thou that denieſt Chriſt in man to be his Guide, thou art either a reprobate, or no man: For Friend, this is my Teſtimony for the Lord, (and it is the Teſtimony of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at this day, bleſſed for ever be his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105843:12"/>
Name) That Chriſt within is man's true Guide, and alſo man's true Light to walk by, and that in him is life, and the life is the light of men, and that this light ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in darkneſs, and the darkneſs did not comprehend it; read 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.5. Yet now if any ſhall ſay he is in the light, and hateth his Brother, he is in darkneſs, and knoweth not whether he goeth.</p>
               <p>To thee then who art a hater of thy Brother, aſſure thy ſelf that thou art none of the Children of Light, not have I any thing to ſay to thee but this, Thou art condemned already; as well by the Light within thee, as by the children of Light without thee; <hi>For God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16.</p>
               <p>But to the poor ſoul who is ignorant of his true Guide, and is willing to follow him if he knew where to find him, my counſel to him is this, <hi>Look at home;</hi> for thy Saviour is near unto thee, and bleſſed art thou if thou canſt believe it, and obey him.</p>
               <p>To thee I ſay, that art ſeeking thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with all thy heart, and art reſtleſs till thou find him, Know for thy comfort
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105843:13"/>
that he is near to thee, and to every one that is of an upright heart, and is even in thy heart, and in thy mouth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. Seek him not then at a diſtance from thee, or in any outward thing, for he that juſtifies thee, is near unto thee; and if ever thou find him in truth, thou wilt ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, That <hi>he was in this place, and thou knewest is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou have thy Saviour and thy Guide to lead thee by his un-erring and infallible ſpirit? Then ceaſe from man, (whoſe breath is in his Noſtrils) and turn to the living God with whom <hi>onely</hi> the Well-ſprings of life are to be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salvation</hi> is not to be had from the Hills, nor from the Mountains, neither from this divided judgement, or that; but from Jeſus alone, who is <hi>in his Saints the hope of glory,</hi> and is the Saviour of all men, but eſpecially of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>I ſay, The Tabernacle of God is with men, and though he be the High and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one that inhabiteth Eternity, yet is his dwelling alſo with him that is of a lowly heart, and trembleth at his Word.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:105843:13"/>The ſpirit of Chriſt in man is the true Guide, all others are falſe ones; his Light in man is the true light, al others are falſe ones. Oh be not ſo willingly blind as not to ſee it, nor ſo wilfully ignorant as not to know it. He it is that condemneth ſin in the fleſh, and reproves man for a vain thought, or wanton look, when nothing without him can. Turn in the eye of thy mind than, and hearken to his checks and daily reproofs in thee; Knoweſt thou not that the ſtate of reprobation belongs to him that hath not Chriſt in him? Friend, thy Saviour is within thee, and if ever thou know him aright, it muſt be there; for there, O there it is that thee and I have crucified him that is Lord of life; and this is that Jeſus whom the Jews crucified at Jeruſalem, but is now crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the falſe Chriſtians, within them, and by them put again to an open ſhame, as their Streets, Market-places, Cities, Towns and Villages do declare, by ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mocking, ſtoning, cruel whipping, long impriſoning, and perſecuting unto death, his Members.</p>
               <p>But now is come (and is coming) a day of tryal upon all proſeſſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105843:14"/>
and all profeſſors muſt now be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether their faith be true or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed none muſt eſcape the ſiery tryal, but the judgement of the Lord will paſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, high and low, great and ſmall, poor or rich, airy notions as well as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ordinances, (which all perish with the uſing) and now ſeen thorough in this day of light; for the Sun (which hath long ſate in a Cloud) is ariſen to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the inward ſubtilty and hypocriſie, as well as the outward ſuperſtition and idolatry of all hearts.</p>
               <p>Bring thy Works then to the light of Chriſt Jeſus in thy own conſcience, that ſo they may be manifeſt whether they are wrought in God or nou; for he that hideth his ſin, ſhall not proſper.</p>
               <p>And thou who art a ſinner, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt that thou canſt not be freed from them, becauſe the blind guides have told thee ſo, there is little ground for thee to hope for mercy; for the ſinner cannot ſtand before the Lord, nor the wicked in the Congregation of the righteous; nor can any unclean thing enter into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Know thou, that it is ſin that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies thy Saviour, who though he bear
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105843:14"/>
with patience the ſinners burthen for a time, (being preſſed therewith as a Cart with ſheaves) yet thou wilt one day find he will caſt off the heavy burthen upon the ſinners own back, which (when the Lord hath done ſtriving with him) will be too unſupportable for him to bear.</p>
               <p>Oh that no poor ſoul would ſuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be miſlead and deceived by blind Guides in a matter of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the everlaſting ſalvation or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their immortal ſouls; for the Light of Chriſt Jeſus hath appeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thouſands and diſcovered their Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian darkneſs and falſe Doctrine, and can prove them to be ſuch builders as reject the Corner-ſtone, and declare lyes in the Name of the Lord: And for which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Chriſt in his Saints, glory be given to the Father, &amp; to the Son, through the bleſſed Spirit for evermore.</p>
               <p>Chriſt Jeſus is to be known <hi>within</hi> by all who will approve themſelves no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and ſo to be <hi>within</hi> them, as to live his life of meekneſs, of patience, of long-ſufferance, of mercy and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of goodneſe, of gentleneſs, of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and godly fear, of ſelf-denial, of

perſeverance, of faith, of hope, of love, and whatſoever elſe are the fruits of his ſpirit and preſence in us.</p>
               <p>Friends, 'Tis not a Chriſt without that will ſave you, but the ſame Chriſt which dyed at Jeruſalem, muſt live in us, and we in him; and <hi>ſo</hi> muſt we know him even to lead and guide us out of all error, ſin and vanity, into all truth, righteouſneſs, and ſtability, if we ever know him to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; I know your minds have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and peradventure yet are, (as mine was) but I never knew my Saviour (whom I ſought without) until I turned my mind inward, and found him there; No more can ye. If them art ſtill abroad wandring upon the barren Mountains, O come down, for l am well aſſured there is no food there for thy hungry ſoul; The day I ſay is far ſpent, and the night at hand, wander no longer in the coaſts of Egypt, and Land of darkneſs, where no Light is, nor true Guide to lead thee, but haſten into the low Valley, ſearch deep into the bottom of thy heart, come to Meekneſs, Patience, and humility of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and there, O there wilt thou meet with thy true Guide, and that Light

               <p>Friends, Is preaching for hire, and perſecution of your Neighbour, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience-ſake to be miantained by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Is throwing men into Gaols, and ſtealing of their Goods, to be maintained by the Scriptures? Is your taking up the carnal Weapons to defend your Goſpel with, when your ſpirituall Weapons will not do, to be maintained by Scripture? Did Chriſts Miniſters ever rebel againſt the Civil Magiſtrate, and teach men ſo to do, as many of you have done of late, inſtead of being ſubject to the higher Powers? For my own part I wonder not hereat, as knowing that that ſpirit which at preſent guides you, teacheth rebellion and diſobedience as well to God as to man.</p>
               <p>Furthermore:<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105843:25"/>You ſay you are Miniſters of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and yet have perſwaded people to believe that the Commandments of God cannot be kept.</p>
               <p>Reader, to thee who art of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion with them, be but moderate, and let me ask thee this queſtion; For what end (thinkeſt thou) were the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments given by God? Were they to be read onely, or to be painted upon the Steeple-houſe Walls? Will that pleaſe the Lord? Or were they not given to be kept by his ſervants, who enter into life? Hath not the Lord ſaid, He will write them upon his peoples hearts, never to be blotted out? Or can any man be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that doth not keep them?</p>
               <p>Tell me, Doth any man require that of another, which he knows be cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and do? And wilt thou make the Lord ſo hard a Maſter, as to require obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of man if it were not in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to give it, or that the Lord had not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered him?

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105843:25"/>
thou being now in diſobedience, he would keep thee there by his evil inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>O take heed of the Serpents brood, who ſay, The Commandments of God cannot be kept, for they are falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that ſo teach; but aſſure thy ſelf, That if ever thou enter into life, thou muſt keep the Commandments: <hi>David</hi> could keep them under the Law, and ſaid, That <hi>the Commandments of the Lord were not grievous; My ſoul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath kept thy Testimonies, and I love them excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:</hi> And again ſaith he, <hi>I have done thy Commandments:</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>I have kept thy precepts and thy teſtimonies:</hi> Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119, 166, 167, 168.</p>

               <p>And as the keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the entrance into life, ſo are they pronounced bleſſed that keep them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. &amp; <hi>pſal.</hi> 119.2. &amp; Prov. 8.32. And ſaith St. <hi>John, Hereby we know that we know

him, if we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.3. But <hi>he that ſaith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him,</hi> Ver. 4. And again, <hi>Whatſoever we ask</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we receive of him, becauſe we keep his commandments, and do, thoſe things which are pleaſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 John 4.22. <hi>and he that keepeth his commandments, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him, and he in him,</hi> Ver. 24.</p>

               <p>Friends, I even tremble to think on your condition, who break the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and teach men ſo to do, you are ſo far from the Way, the Truth and the Life, that unleſs you ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily repent and turn to the Lord, you will have your portion with hypocrites, where is weeping, wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth for evermore.</p>
               <p>My direction then to you alſo (before it be too late) is, To own the <hi>Light</hi> in

               <p>I ſay unto you therefore again, Own the <hi>Light within you</hi> while you have it, and take it for your <hi>Guide,</hi> for you are gone a whoring from God, and the Spirit of Truth and Holineſs you know not.</p>
               <p>O do not any longer abuſe this <hi>Light,</hi> this <hi>Lamb</hi> of God, for you will one day find him to be the <hi>Lyon</hi> of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> who when his Wrath ſhall be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt you, you muſt be conſumed for ever.</p>
               <p>And now to you who ſay, We are the Learned Miniſters of <hi>England;</hi> We have the Tongues; We have the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals, and we have the many Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and therefore we are beſt able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>To you I ſay this, That the <hi>holy</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are a ſealed Book to all that are not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105843:27"/>
taught of God by the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which you falſly and ignorantly ſay is ceaſed; therefore it is that the unlearned Doctors and others, the Univerſity-men of this age, wreſt them to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; therefore it is, that there are ſo many Errors, Hereſies, Opinions, Sects, and divided Judgements amongſt you, and thoſe who are called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friends,</hi> if you be ignorant of the true Original of all things, to wit, the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unerring Spirit of God by which the holy Scriptures were wrote, you want the key of true knowledge which ſhould open them unto you, and you (with all your learning) muſt ſtay <hi>without,</hi> when the ſimple whom God teacheth, and whom you deſpiſe, can give you the true meaning and mind of God's Spirit, ſhall enter in.</p>
               <p>Oh! remember that the Jews had the Original Tongues before you, and ſpoke them naturally, and more then that, they had amongſt them the true Original him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> the firſt and the laſt, and yet they cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, and choſe a Thief and a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before him; I wiſh from my very ſoul

it were not ſo with you, chuſing <hi>Hebrew, Greek, Latine,</hi> and other Tongues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the naked and ſimple truth of God; I ſay, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> was to the Jews a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, and to the wiſe <hi>Greeks</hi> fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; So is he this day to you, whilſt you are crying up Learning and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wiſdom, and deſpiſe the ſtill and <hi>low voice of Chriſt in you,</hi> which ſpeaks not in the Words of mans Wiſdom.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105843:30"/>
thy Guide more. <hi>Friend,</hi> if ever thou thinkeſt to be victorious, thou muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Lamb; for aſſure thy ſelf, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy will aſſult thee on every ſide, and endeavour thy deſtruction; for know thou, That 'tis through ſufferings and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conflicts with the Enemy, that thou muſt paſs, yea and become a Conqueror too, befoer thou muſt come to reign; The <hi>daily death</hi> thou muſt witneſs, and the <hi>dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Croſse</hi> muſt be born, before the <hi>Crown of Victory</hi> can be obtained; I ſay, Thou muſt follow thy Leader and Captain of Salvation, through all difficulties, if thou wilt be victorious.</p>
               <p>And for thy encouragement, be aſſured of this, <hi>He will never leave thee nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>light</hi> of the Lord then, and as faithful followers of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> let us jurney towards our Land of <hi>Reſt</hi> with unwearied minds; for aſſuredly, The Land is <hi>good,</hi> and will abundantly reward the <hi>Traveller</hi> upon his arrival there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what he could ask or think.</p>
               <p>Many there are whom I believe are gone forth with an honeſt intent to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel ehither, and finding the Way ſtrait,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105843:30"/>
and the journey long, and the Difficulties many, have ſate down by the way; but let ſuch know, there is no <hi>truereſt</hi> on this ſide <hi>Canaan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others there are who have gone forth <hi>to view the holy Land,</hi> and as the <hi>falſe spyes</hi> of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did, ſo have theſe, even brought up an evil report upon the good Land, and have told people, <hi>There is no attaining of it in this life,</hi> for that the Cities are walled, the Enemies are migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and numerous, and too ſtrong to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, <hi>Theſe</hi> have told people, the <hi>holy</hi> life is <hi>unattainable,</hi> and that as long as they live, they cannot be free from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and <hi>theſe</hi> ſit down without hope, <hi>and ſhall never enter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet notwithſtanding there is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement enough for the <hi>faithful Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller,</hi> when he remembers that there were two, to wit, <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who were <hi>true Spyes,</hi> and that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the multitude of falſe Spyes that went forth to view the Land, theſe as faithful Witneſſes For God brought in their Teſtimony, and ſaid, <hi>Let us go up at once, and poſſeſſe it, for we are well able to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome it.</hi> And theſe for their faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105843:31"/>
to the Lord (notwithſtanding the falſe Spyes ill report of the good Land) were brought to poſſeſs the Land which flowed with Milk and Honey, but the reſt <hi>periſhed</hi> in the Wilderneſs for their unbelief, and their children were <hi>wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> there fourty years.</p>
               <p>Now Friend, It is obſervable and very remaakrble, That <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joshuah</hi> (who did enter) had <hi>another ſpirit</hi> then the falſe, Spyes had, <hi>(and followed the Lord fully)</hi> to wit, the Spirit of <hi>Faith,</hi> which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the World, and all the Enemies therein, to the ſoul of men, ſo that the <hi>Believer</hi> and his Seed ſhall poſſeſs the <hi>holy Land,</hi> when all the unbelievers ſhall periſh in the Wildcrneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>And as for the glory of this holy Land, or <hi>New Jernſalem,</hi> (of which <hi>Canaan</hi> was a Type) and the Riches thereof none wil doubt, but all Will confeſs the Land is good, though ſome ſay too good to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained here, or poſſeſſed in this life; I ſay as to this I cannot but bring in my te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, and declare, They are all <hi>falſe Spyes,</hi> and <hi>falſe prophets,</hi> that ſay the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mans ſoul are <hi>not</hi> to be overcome in this life, and that the holy life is not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105843:31"/>
attainable; for he that gives Victory over one ſin, (which I witneſs) will give vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over all ſins if I and thou be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Warriers</hi> in the Army of the <hi>Lamb.</hi> I ſay, our Captain is able to make war w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the Enemy, and not onely give us victory, but alſo an entrance into the <hi>Holy of holies</hi> within the vail <hi>here,</hi> where no falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet can enter, but him who is <hi>the Prieſt for ever</hi> after the order of <hi>Melehizedeck.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore friends, go chearfully on your way in believing; the Enemy is as well before as behind; look not back, neither turn to the right hand, nor to the left, but preſs forward, and in due time you ſhall reap, if you faint not.</p>
               <p>'Tis the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Saints which <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercomes</hi> the World, and all difficulties which the honeſt Traveller ſhall find in his Journey towards the holy Land. And that none may be diſcouraged that he meets with troubles and tryals, let him remember, The greater his tryals are, the ſtronger had his Faith need be; and the bitterer his Travels are, the ſweeter will his Reſt be. If ſome of the Servants of the Lord have through experience ſaid, That the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of this preſent life
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105843:32"/>
are not worthy the <hi>glory</hi> that <hi>ſhall</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, what will they be able to ſay when in is <hi>revealed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is better to ſuffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us proceed on our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with unwearied minds, and in the ſtrength and power of the Lord make war againſt all the Enemies of our Souls, following our Leader, and in the end we ſhall be more then <hi>Conquerors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe there are many preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to holineſs, who with fair ſpeeches do deceive the hearts of people, and by enticing words of mans Wiſdom ſeduce many a well-meaning and honeſt-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Traveller, who is ever and anon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to queſtion whether his way be right. I do adviſe thee as thou loveſt life, and tendereſt the true reſt of thy weary ſoul, keep cloſe to thy Leader, whoſe voice is low, ſpeaking in thee, ſaying, <hi>Go not forth, wander not;</hi> for this I declare, That whilſt thou art unturned to thy Guide <hi>within thee,</hi> or art liſtening to the loud Voice and found of big Words <hi>without</hi> (as I have been) thou canſt finde no <hi>reſt,</hi> though thou travel hard to obtain it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But many there are who with <hi>Martha</hi> do look for the Reſurrection at the laſt day without, and ſo put the day of his Reſurrection <hi>in them,</hi> far from them, (as believing no ſuch thing) and ſaying, How can this be? when in the mean time <hi>Chriſt</hi> lyes <hi>ſlain</hi> in ſome of them; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are ſo far from the holy Life of Chriſt, that they are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and ſome twice pluckt up by the roots, neither knowing their Saviour <hi>within them, nor Without them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Art thou one that knoweſt nothing of the reſurrection of Chriſt in thee, then know that thou art not to look out to a day without thee, for the reſurrection of Chriſt, but in <hi>Spiritual Sodomand Aegypt,</hi> where he lyes <hi>ſtill crucified,</hi> art thou to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

his reſurrection, to wit, <hi>in thy own wicked heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt <hi>before his reſurrection from the Grave, told</hi> Martha, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> I am the the Reſurrection and the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and that he that liveth and believeth in him, ſhould not dye: <hi>Doſt thou believe this?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> after his reſurrection, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto many of his Diſciples <hi>with out them,</hi> and they knew him not <hi>(he being ſpiritual;)</hi> and after he had by many ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Teſtimonies made himſelf known unto them to be <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a Cloud received him out of the ſight of thoſe that ſtood looking after him; Whereupon it was told them by two men who were in white, that ſaid, <hi>To men of Galilee, why ſtand ye here gazing? The ſame Ieſus which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105843:33"/>
hath been taken up from you into heaven, ſhall in like manner come again</hi> to wit, in a Cloud; for ſo he went up.</p>
               <p>Now this (Friend) is a <hi>Myſtery</hi> to the wiſe and learned men of this World, (oh that they knew it) That the <hi>light</hi> of the World, and life of men ſhould come in a <hi>cloud;</hi> but ſo it is, and they are utterly ignorant of this myſterie, though to the children of Light it is made manifeſt and revealed by the Spirit. <hi>They</hi> can tell you that as Chriſt's <hi>firſt</hi> appearance to the World was in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and the fleſhly eye ſaw him; ſo his <hi>ſecond</hi> appearance is in <hi>Spirit,</hi> and no fleſhly eye can behold him, he being now a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>You then who are looking for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of your Saviour with the eye of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> (which is natural, and to come without you) know you, that your eyes will fail you, and your expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations be in vain; for him whom you look for, is a <hi>spirit,</hi> and inviſible to all but to the <hi>Spiritual man.</hi> And While you are looking for his coming to be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſpiritual man can tell You he is <hi>already come,</hi> and converſeth with him daily; and this is the reaſon that the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105843:34"/>
Saints and Servants of Chriſt (who do his Will) can endure ſtocking, ſtoning, mocking, cruel whipping, and tedious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment: Why? Becauſe <hi>they have ſeen &amp; converſed with Jeſus,</hi> who by his power en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables them to ſuffer what man can do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; <hi>He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear.</hi> But thou maiſt ſay unto me, Is there no other <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt then what is in man? And are we not to look for the coming of Chriſt, and the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Bodies alſo at the laſt day?</p>
               <p>For an anſwer to this, Friend, conſider that the reſurrection of Chriſt without, was there where he had been entombed or buried, and there was he to riſe again, that ſo a teſtimony thereof might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the unbeliever, and as encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſtrengthening to the Faith of thoſe that did believe therein. Now Friend, ſo it is, <hi>Chriſt is riſen in his Saints,</hi> and hath appeared unto them <hi>there,</hi> even as he roſe from the Grave, and appeared to his Diſciples, and others without; and though thou wouldſt give large money to us to make falſe Reports of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet we cannot but muſt tell you all, <hi>Chriſt is riſen</hi> from the grave of our ſouls,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105843:34"/>
where he was once, buryed with earthly-mindedneſs and the cares of this World; but the Grave being able to hold him no longer, he is come forth, and is manifeſt to thouſands in this age, who at firſt when he appeared to them without, to wit, in carnal Ordinances, they knew him not, but he being now come in ſpirit accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promiſe, we cannot but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it unto you, being the things which our ears have heard, our eyes ſeen, and our hands handled of the Word of Life, that ſo ye might have fellowſhip with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thou who lookeſt for the reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thy carnal body, I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict thee in thy faith, nor do I deny the reſurrection of the body, nor ſhall I ſay to thee any other thing then what</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid to to the</hi> Corinth, THOU FOOL, That which thou ſoweſt is not quickned except it dye; and that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be, but bare grain, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of wheat or ſome other corn; but God giveth it a body as it pleaſeth him. <hi>Firſt come to the life of Jeſus in thy ſelf, and when thou canſt ſay,</hi> Now I live, yet nor I, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> liveth <hi>in</hi> me, <hi>thou ſhalt better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Reſurrection of the Body;</hi>
