            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS for reducing of <hi>GUINEAS</hi> to their True Value.</head>
            <p>SINCE the Reformation of the Coin of this Kingdom to its Original Standard, by the late Act of Parliament, we yet ſeem to be diſappointed of thoſe Advantages we expected in Trade, (on which the Publick ſo much depends) and is conceived to ariſe from the Diſproportion which ſtill remains between the eſtabliſhed Value of Silver, and the preſent Currency of Guineas, <hi>viz.</hi> 21 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> to 30 <hi>s.</hi> equal to 39 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> From whence it follows,</p>
            <p>That Gold ſhall be imported upon us at ſecond-hand, and the beſt of our Silver, ſo faſt as it comes abroad, be carried out in Paiment thereof; for even now is expected the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of a conſiderable Addition of Gold to the many hundred thouſand Ounces that have been imported ſince the Advance of Guineas. So that it will be impoſſible to prevent the Exportation of our Money: For what we receive in Gold we muſt pay for in Silver, at 39 ½ <hi>per cent.</hi> Loſs.</p>
            <p>That whilſt we have Sums of Money to remit, for the Expence of an Army abroad, the Courſe of Exchange will continue in great Diſproportion to the intrinſick Value of our Silver, <hi>viz.</hi> 30 to 40 <hi>per cent.</hi> Loſs on the publick Remiſſes, and muſt of neceſſity cauſe the Supplies granted to his Majeſty to fall ſhort, and ſo ſtraiten our Affairs, to the Loſs of ſome Advantages we might have over our Enemies, which yet at laſt muſt be paid with Intereſt by the Publick.</p>
            <p>That the Importation of Gold does farther add to the <hi>Over-Ballance</hi> of Trade, and Increaſe of our Debt abroad, which being uſually returned, immediately interferes with the publick Remiſſes, beating down the Exchange, to our great Diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>That from the preſent Courſe of Exchange, it follows, that foreign Commodities can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imported into <hi>England</hi> at moderate rates, and is found to be more than a double Tax upon the People.</p>
            <p>That whilſt the Courſe of Exchange continues thus, no Silver can be imported from <hi>Spain,</hi> and their <hi>Weſt-Indian Flot a</hi> being expected the beginning of next Winter, other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will have Opportunity not only to receive their own, but that alſo which we might have expected as a Supply, while our Silver is continually exhauſting.</p>
            <p>That the unſettled Price of Guineas creates great Confuſion in Trade amongſt the good Subjects of this Kingdom, while 'tis permitted to make a Trade of buying and ſelling them, Men forcing their Creditors to accept their Debts in this Species at 3 or 4 <hi>per cent.</hi> more than the Debtors uſually buy them at; which Inconvenience muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all who are not biaſſed by ſome immediate Profit to themſelves in this pernicious way of dealing.</p>
            <p>That Manufactures and Proviſions being generally paid for in Guineas at thirty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, they muſt needs be bought at Rates in proportion thereto, and ſo dear, that few can be exported to <hi>Turkey, Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> for the Supply of their Markets, and Incouragement of our Factories abroad, and may cauſe a total Loſs of the Expence of many Commodities, as found by Experience in mix'd Serges, Silk and Worſted Stockings, Chenies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Natives ſupplying their Wants otherwiſe; ſo that for a preſent imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Convenience we may loſe the real Advantages of a conſiderable part of our Trade for the future.</p>
            <p>That if Guineas be reduced to a proportionable Value with the Silver Coin of this Kingdom, no more Gold will be imported upon us, but from thoſe Places which naturally produce it, and that alſo in return of our Commodities.</p>
            <p>That our Armies may be paid abroad partly in this Species, and ſo return it from whence it came, and thereby the <hi>Ballance of Trade</hi> be on our ſide, the Conſequence of which will be,</p>
            <p>That the Exchanges for the Reſidue of the Publick Remiſſes and Trade will come to, or exceed the Par, <hi>i. e.</hi> the intrinſick Value of our Coin, whereby our Charges abroad may be defrayed at much leſs Expence of Engliſh Money.</p>
            <p>That foreign Commodities will be brought in on reaſonable Terms: Increaſe the Exportation of our own Commodities for the Supply of foreign Markets, and imploying the Poor of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Silver imported to ſupply the preſent Deficiency, and then no Fear will remain that our New Coin ſhall be ſhipp'd off.</p>
            <p>May it not then be wiſh'd it were conſiſtent with the Prudence and Wiſdom of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, (from whom the trading Part of this Nation have already received ſo great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits) that no more Gold may be coined, that all Stock-jobbing, <hi>i. e.</hi> buying or ſelling of Guineas, be ſtrictly forbidden: And whatever may be the Iſſue, the firſt Loſs will be the beſt, eſpecially when that is rather imaginary than real.</p>
