         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A French Prophecy:
OR, AN
Admonition to the English,
CONCERNING
Their near approaching Danger, and the Means to Escape it.
BEING
A Prediction of a Gentleman of Quality in Languedoc, concerning the
Downfall of the French King, and several other Things relating
to England.
To which is added,
A fuller Account of Archbishop Vsher's Prophecy than has ever yet been
Printed, (agreeing with this,) and attested by the Lord Chief Justice Hale,
and another Person of Honour.</head>
            <head type="sub">Translated from the French Copy. Licens'd <date>Feb. 25. 1690.</date>
            </head>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THe Original <hi>French</hi> of following Admonition I received lately in <hi>Holland</hi> of the
<hi>Author,</hi> whose Name is thereunto subscribed; a Gentleman of an Ancient Family in
<hi>Languedoc,</hi> whose Seat is an ancient Castle of the same Name with himself, about
three English Miles from <hi>Montpeilier,</hi> with a considerable Revenue thereunto belonging.
But he was forced to leave it, and all that he had, after two years Imprisonment, for
his Religion. And this is his Condition at present. The <hi>Author of the Admonition,</hi> which he
mentions, was his Younger Brother, who died near three years since, of about Forty eight
years of Age, a Person, as he saith, of great Piety and Credit, and of extraordinary Knowledge of
things absent and future. And of him our Author received both Admonition before-hand of the
things here said to have happened to him, and an Explication afterward of the Mysteries of them,
and the Signification thereof. He is not without Witnesses of the truth of what he relates; but
they are dispersed into several Parts, and some of them now in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was the Author's Desire to have it committed to the <hi>English</hi> as soon as might be, and my
Good-will to my Country, and desire to serve them, inclined me to lend him my Assistance therein
without much difficulty, both because it doth agree so much with the known Prediction of
Bishop <hi>Usher,</hi> and because the State and Course of Affairs seem to agree but too much with both, in
a manifest tendency to the Accomplishment of them. And that the Reader may not be so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed,
as admonished by it, for his better Direction and Instruction how to use it, I thought fit
to subjoyn the principal part of the Bishop's Predictions: Which I can assure the Reader to be no
Imposture, but True and Genuine, from the Testimony of two Witnesses beyond all Exception:
The one, the late Lord Chief Justice <hi>Hale,</hi> who, when I shewed it him in Writing before ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
was Printed, and desired his Judgment of it, told me he had heard him say the Substance of it,
the Substance of it (repeating those words) twenty times with a great deal of confidence: The
other, a Person whom I ought not to name without License, but of great Honour by Degree, and
much greater by real Worth and Vertue, to whom the words were spoken by the Bishop, and
who committed them to Writing, and was pleased to favour me with the perusal of the Original.</p>

ne s'être pas apperceu, que la colere de
Dieu paroit alummée depuis long temps presque
sur toutes les parties de l'Europe, de sorte qu'il

                  <head>An ADMONITION
to the Christians of England.</head>
                  <p>HE must be very blind, who perceives not
that the Wrath of <hi>GOD</hi> hath long since
been kindled against all parts almost of <hi>Europe;</hi>
so that he seems resolved to destroy all Flesh
<hi>again</hi> as it were with a New Deluge, since it is
but too true, that they have abandon'd themselves
to all kind of Wickedness. <hi>But</hi> the Indignation
of the Almighty hath begun to manifest it self
<hi>more</hi> especially against those who are called Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.
<hi>And</hi> by those means ought we to have
been induced to Repentance and the Reformation
of our Manners. But Heaven and Earth are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that we have not so much as known, <hi>or well
considered,</hi> What it is to afflict our Souls and
amend our Lives. Hence it is that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, which we so little regarded, though
the Decree hath again and again brought forth
so terribly, have been daily more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing.
This we in <hi>France</hi> have been made to
see by Experience, since we neglected the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
which were given to us.</p>
                  <p>It is now <hi>twenty years and upwards,</hi> since
I received a Letter, which admonished Me of Our
approaching Miseries [in <hi>France,</hi>] and the
Means to prevent them: Which were, to call to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the Governours of our Church, and acquaint
them that they should appoint a three days Fast in
that Church, which soever should first be attach'd,
[by Process by our Enemies;] and they should see
the Effects thereof. But I neglected that advice,
not knowing whence it came. But abut <hi>ten years
after,</hi> when I understood that, and saw the Event
of much of that which was foretold, I acquainted
those Gentlemen with it: But they regarded not
what I said. Which made the Consequence so sad.
There are now in <hi>England</hi> divers Ministers, who
were present when I shewed the Letter which was
sent me.</p>
                  <p>The same Advice which was given to me, was
sent also to Madam <hi>Turone,</hi> and to the Sieur
<hi>Rouvigny,</hi> and to Mr. <hi>Gache</hi> Minister of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renton,</hi>
and to the Synod of <hi>Languedock:</hi> And
when the Author, who sent these Admonitions,
understood that nothing was done thrreupon, be
wrote thus to me:</p>
                  <div type="letter">
                     <p>Very unhappy is that Ship, which being sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a grievous Storm, the Mariners will not
be roused even by a Child to pump out the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102337:2"/>
Water, which he sees running in, till he be
forced to cry out, <hi>Every one shift for himself.</hi>
Wo to him who loves not our Lord <hi>Jesus,</hi> and
doth not carry the Divine Crucified One daily
in his Heart.</p>
                     <p>About <hi>Eight or Nine years since</hi> a sudden
stroke as of <hi>Thunder</hi> struck me down in the
Day-time (about Eight in the Morning) according
to three several Warnings thereof given to me three
years before. This was followed about six Weeks
after by a Thunder in the Night: Whereof I had
also been admonished. Whereupon I called up all
who were in Bed in my House; and we went into
the Room where we used to have Prayers, and
there read the Scriptures. While that was doing
it Thundered under my Feet, though the plate was
paved and upon a Rock. We all heard the Noise
of Thunder (<hi>directly</hi>) under Me (who was at a

               <head>Archbishop USHER's PREDICTIONS.</head>
               <p>THe Year before he died, being asked, <hi>Wbether he did believe that Great Persecution of the Church
of God in</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland, (of which he had spoken with great confidence
many years before in time of great Peace) <hi>to be passed, or yet to come?</hi> He said, <hi>That it was yet to
come, and that he did as confidently expect it, as ever he had done;</hi> adding, <hi>That this said Persecution
would fall upon all the Protestant Churches of</hi> Europe. And when it was answered, It might be hoped
that it might have been past in these Nations, by reason of the Devastation and Bloodshed which
had been in the late Civil War: He replied with a very serious and stern Look,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fool not your self with such Hopes; for I tell you, All you have yet seen, hath been but the
Beginning of Sorrows, to what is yet to come upon the Protestant Churches of Christ: Who will
e're long fall under a Sharper Persecution than ever yet has been upon them. And therefore
look you be not found in the <hi>Outward Court,</hi> but a Worshipper in the <hi>Temple</hi> before the Altar.
For Christ will measure all those who profess his Name, and call themselves his People; and the
<hi>Outward Worshippers</hi> he will leave out to be trodden down by the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The <hi>Outward Court</hi> is
the <hi>Formal Christian,</hi> whose Religion lies in performing the <hi>Out-side Duties</hi> of Christianity, without
having an <hi>Inward Life,</hi> and Power of Faith and Love Uniting them to Christ. And those God will
leave to be trodden down and swept away by the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But the <hi>Worshippers within the Temple</hi>
and <hi>before the Altar,</hi> are those who do indeed worship God in Spirit and in Truth, whose Souls
are made his Temple, and he is honoured and adored in the most inward Thoughts of their
Hearts; and they sacrifice their Lusts and vise Affections, yea, and their own Wills to him. And
these God will hide in the Hollow of his Hand, and under the Shadow of his Wings. And this
shall be one great <hi>Difference</hi> between this last and all the other preceding Persecutions: For in
the former, the most eminent and spiritual Ministers and Christians did generally suffer most,
and were most violently fallen upon; but in this last Persecution, these shall be preserved by God
as a Seed to partake of that <hi>Glory,</hi> which shall immediately follow and come upon the Church,
as soon as this Storm shall be over: For as it shall be the <hi>Sharpest,</hi> so it shall be the <hi>Shortest</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
of them all; and shall only take away the gross <hi>Hypocrites</hi> and <hi>Formal Profissors;</hi> but the
<hi>true Spiritual Believers</hi> shall be preserved till the Calamity be overpassed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I think very pertinent that Excellent Passage of his to the same Person, concerning
<hi>Sanctification,</hi> in these words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I must tell you, We do not well understand what <hi>Sanctification</hi> and the <hi>New Creature</hi> are. It
is no less than for a Man to be brought to an intire Resignation of his Will to be Will of God;
and to live in the offering up of his Soul continually in the flames of Love, as a whole Burnt.
Offering to Christ. And how little are many of those, who profess Christianity, experimentally
acquainted with this Work on their Souls!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the Persecution aforesaid are mentioned in the Printed Paper of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
to which I refer the Reader. But one there is not mentioned there, or ever by him
expresly, that I have heard of, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Time.</hi> Of which yet it may be observed, that he seems in
divers Discourses to have intimated it so, as it must be now <hi>very near,</hi> by telling some Persons,
<hi>viz.</hi> such as were ancient, that they should not live to see it, and others that they might, that is
by course of years, and among others Judge <hi>Hale,</hi> who, had he been now living, had been upwards
of Eighty one. Besides, if the same was signified by the Thunder under-ground mentioned by
Mr. <hi>St. Jean,</hi> that seems to agree well with the <hi>Manner</hi> mentioned by the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> of a sudden
unexpected Massacre.</p>
