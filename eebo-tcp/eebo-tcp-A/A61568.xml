            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N obedience to Your Lordships Order I now
present to Your hands, not only the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
You lately heard, but those <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi>
which the straits of time would
not then permit me to deliver. In all
which, I was so far from intending to stir up the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates</hi>
and <hi>Judges</hi> to a <hi>Persecution</hi> of <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
as some ill men have reported, that my only design was
<pb facs="tcp:100317:3"/>
to prevent any occasion of it, by finding out a certain
foundation for a lasting <hi>Union</hi> among our selves. Which
is impossible to be attained, till men are convinced of the
<hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of the present <hi>Separation;</hi> it being
carried on by such Principles as not only overthrow the
present <hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> but any other
whatsoever. For, if it be lawful to separate on a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of greater <hi>Purity,</hi> where there is an <hi>Agreement</hi>
in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>substantial Parts</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi>
as is acknowledged in our Case; then a bare difference of
opinion as to some circumstances of Worship and the best
constitution of Churches will be sufficient ground to break
Communion and to set up new Churches: Which consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great variety of mens fancies about these matters,
is to make an infinite <hi>Divisibility</hi> in <hi>Churches,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any possible stop to farther <hi>Separation.</hi> But, if
after themselves are pleased with condescensions to their
own minds, any think it fit that others should be tied up,
notwithstanding their dissatisfaction; the world will judge
it too great partiality in them to think that none ought to
<hi>separate</hi> but <hi>themselves,</hi> and that the same <hi>Reason</hi>
will hold against themselves in the judgement of others; it
thereby appearing, that it is not <hi>Uniformity</hi> they dislike,
but that they do not prescribe the Terms of it.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I intend not to argue the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
here, (which is at large done in the following
Discourse) but only to shew, how necessary it was in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the laying a Foundation for <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> to
have this matter throughly discussed. And if once the
<pb facs="tcp:100317:3"/>
People be brought to understand and practise their duty as
to <hi>Communion</hi> with our <hi>Churches,</hi> other Difficulties
which obstruct our <hi>Union</hi> will be more easily removed.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to pursue my design in a way sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the nature of it, without sharp and provoking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
on the Persons of any; which often set Friends
at distance, but never reconciled or convinced Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
However, I must expect the Censures of such who
either make our <hi>Divisions,</hi> or make use of them for their
own ends: but I am contented to be made a <hi>sacrifice,</hi> if
thereby I might <hi>close</hi> up the <hi>Breaches</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God Almighty</hi> bless this great <hi>City</hi> and Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
care in the <hi>Government</hi> of it; and grant that <hi>in
this our day, we may yet know the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

Protestant Religion</hi> among us.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> doth
lay the greatest obligations on
mankind to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> by
the strictest commands, the
highest examples, and the most
prevailing arguments; yet so
much have the passions and interests of men
overswai'd the sense of their duty, that as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ought to be more in our <hi>wishes,</hi> so nothing
seems more remote from our <hi>hopes,</hi> than the <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Peace</hi> of the <hi>Christian World.</hi> Not that
there is any impossibility in the thing, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
difficulty, if all men were such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as they ought to be; but as long as men
pursue their several factions and designs under
the colour and pretence of zeal for Religion; if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100317:5"/>
they did not find Names and Parties ready fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that were suitable to their ends, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of their designs would make them. So
that till mens corruptions are mortified, and
their passions subdued to a greater degree than
the world hath yet found them, it is in vain to
expect a state of peace and tranquillity in the
Church. We need not go far from home for a
sufficient evidence of this; for although our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
are such as the wiser Protestants abroad
not only condemn but wonder at them; yet it
hath hitherto puzzled the wisest persons among
us to find out wayes to compose them; not so
much from the distance of mens opinions and
practices, as the strength of their prejudices and
inclinations.<note place="margin">Judges 5. 15, 16.</note> What those <hi>divisions of Reuben</hi> of
old were, which caused <hi>such thoughts and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of heart,</hi> we neither well understand, nor
doth it much concern us: but the continuance,
if not the widening, of these unhappy breaches
among our selves do give just cause for many
sad reflections. When neither the miseries we
have felt, nor the calamities we fear; neither the
terrible judgements of God upon us, nor the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
deliverances vouchsafed to us, nor the
common danger we are yet in, have abated mens
heats, or allayed their passions, or made them
more willing to unite with our established
Church and Religion. But instead of that, some
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100317:5"/>
rather stand at a greater distance if not defiance,
and seem to entertain themselves with hopes of
new revolutions; others raise fresh calumnies
and reproaches, as well as revive and spread
abroad old ones; as though their business were
to make our breaches wider, and to exasperate
mens spirits against each other; at such a time,
when Reason and common security, and above
all our Religion obligeth us <hi>to follow after the
things that make for peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 19.</note> 
               <hi>and things wherewith one
may edifie another;</hi> and not such as tend to our
mutual destruction; as most certainly our divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and animosities do. Yet all parties pretend
to a zeal for Peace, so they may have it in their
own way; by which it appears that it is not
Peace they aim at but Victory; nor Unity so
much as having their own wills. Those of the
<hi>Roman Church</hi> make great boasts of their Unity
and the effectual means they have to preserve it;
but God deliver us from such cruel wayes of
Peace, and such destructive means of Unity as
Treachery and Assassinations, and an Inquisition.
<hi>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>destruction and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
are in their wayes; and the way of Peace they have
not known.</hi> But it were happy for us, if all those
who agree in renouncing the Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of the Roman Church, could as easily
join together in the great duties of our common
Religion, that is, in our Prayers, and Praises,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100317:6"/>
and Sacraments, and all solemn acts of Divine
Worship. For this would not only take off the
reproach of our Adversaries, who continually
upbraid us with our Schisms and Separations,
but it would mightily tend to abate mens passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to remove their prejudices, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
their inclinations, and thereby lay a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
for a blessed Union among our selves.
Which would frustrate the great design of our
enemies upon us, who expect to see that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
destroyed by our own folly, which they
could not otherwise hope to accomplish by their
utmost care and endeavour. And we may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope for a greater blessing of God upon us,
when we offer up our joint Prayers and Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to him,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 8.</note> 
               <hi>lifting up,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>holy hands
without wrath and disputing.</hi> This is therefore a
thing of so great consequence to our Peace and
Union, that tends so much to the Honour of
God, and our common Safety and Preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that no person who hath any real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
for these things, can deny it to be
not only just and fitting, but in our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
necessary to be done, if it can be made
appear to be lawful, or that they can do it with a
good Conscience.</p>
            <p>And this is the subject I design to speak to at
this time; and for that purpose have made choise
of these words of the Apostle, <hi>Nevertheless, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100317:6"/>
we have already attained, let us walk by the same
rule, let us mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For our better understanding the full scope and
meaning of the Apostle in these words, we are
to consider, that an unhappy Schism, or wilful
breach of the Churches Unity, had begun in the
Apostles times, upon the difference that arose
concerning the necessity of keeping the Law of
<hi>Moses.</hi> And that which made the <hi>Schism</hi> the more
dangerous, was that the first beginners of it
pretended a Commission from the Apostles

               <hi>Now I beseech you

had been busie at <hi>Philippi</hi> to make a party there
too, therefore the Apostle to prevent their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
makes use of this following method.</p>
            <p>1. He exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to an unanimous
and constant resolution, in holding fast to the
faith of the Gospel, in spight of all the threats
and malice of their enemies:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hil. 1. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>That ye stand fast
in one spirit, with one mind, striving together for the
faith of the Gospel; and in nothing terrified by your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries.</hi>
If once the fears of troubles and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
make men afraid to own and maintain their
Religion; it will be an easie matter for their
enemies first to divide, and then to subdue them.
But their courage and unanimity in a good
Cause baffles the attempts of the most daring Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
and makes them willing to retreat
when they see they can neither disunite them nor
make them afraid.</p>
            <p>2. He beseeches them in the most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and affectionate manner, not to give
way to any differences or divisions among them,
<hi>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hil. 2. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>if any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100317:7"/>
comfort of love, if any fellowship of the spirit, if any
bowels and mercies; fulfil ye my joy, that ye be like
minded, having the same love; being of one accord, of
one mind.</hi> As though he had said unto them, I have
seen the miserable effects of divisions in other
Churches already; how our Religion hath been
reproached, the Gospel hindred, and the Cross
of Christ rendred of little or no effect by reason
of them; let me therefore intreat you, if you
have any regard to the Peace and Welfare of
your own souls; if you have any sense of your
duty you owe to one another as members of the
same body; if you have any tenderness or pity
towards me, avoid the first tendencies to any
breaches among you; entertain no unjust suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
or jealousies of each other, shew all the
kindness you are able to your fellow members;
live as those that are acted by the same soul
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) carry on the same design; and as much
as possible prevent any differences in opinions
amongst you.</p>
            <p>3. He warns them and gives cautious against
some persons from whom their greatest danger
was, <hi>viz.</hi> such as pretended a mighty zeal for
the Law: And very well understanding the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of their designs under their specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
he bestows very severe characters upon
them, vers. 2. <hi>Beware of Dogs, beware of evil workers,
beware of the Concision.</hi> All which Characters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100317:8"/>
relate to the breaches and divisions which they
made in the Christian Churches; which like
<hi>Dogs</hi> they did tear in pieces, and thereby did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
mischief, and so were <hi>evil workers;</hi> and
by the <hi>Concision</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> understands such a
cutting in pieces as tends to the destruction of a
thing; and therefore, saith he, the Apostle called
them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they endeavoured to cut in pieces, and
thereby to destroy the Church of God. But lest
they should give out that St. <hi>Paul</hi> spoke this out
of a particular pique he had taken up against
the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> he declares that as to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
intention and design of the Law it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
in Christians, vers. 3. <hi>For we are the
Circumcision which worship God in the spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in Christ Iesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</hi>
And for his own part, he had as much reason
to glory in legal priviledges as any of them all,
<hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5, 6. but the excellency of the Gospel
of Christ had so prevailed upon his mind, that
he now despised the things he valued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and made it his whole business to attain
to the glorious reward which this Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth.
This he pursues from <hi>vers.</hi> 7, to
<hi>vers.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>4. Having done this, he perswades all
good Christians to do as he did, vers. 15. <hi>Let us
therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded.</hi> But
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100317:8"/>
because many disputes and differences as to opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and practice might happen among them, he
therefore lays down two Rules for them to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
themselves by.</p>
            <p>1. If any happen'd to differ from the body of
Christians they lived with, they should do it with
great Modesty and Humility, not breaking out
into factions and divisions, but waiting for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
information, which they may expect that God
will give upon a diligent and sober use of the best
means; <hi>And if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God
shall reveal even this unto you.</hi> By leaving them to
Gods immediate care for farther illumination, he
doth not bid them depend upon extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;
but requires them to wait upon God in
his own way, without proceeding with the false
Apostles to the wayes of Faction and Separation,
and in the mean time to go as far as they could.</p>
            <p>2. For those who were come to a firmness and
settlement of judgement upon the Christian prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
he charges them by all means to preserve
Unity and Peace among themselves. <hi>Whereto we
have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let
us mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein the Apostle supposes two things.</p>
            <p>I. The necessity of one fixed and certain
Rule, notwithstanding the different attainments
among Christians. <hi>Nevertheless, whereto we have
already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100317:9"/>
II. The duty and obligation which lies upon
the best Christians to observe it. He doth not
speak to the ignorant and unthinking multitude;
not <hi>to the licentious rabble,</hi> nor <hi>to the carnal and
worldly Church;</hi> which some think are only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous
of Uniformity; but to the very best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
to those <hi>who had got the start of others</hi>
(as the words here signifie) that they would be
an example of Peace and Unity to their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>The necessity of one fixed and certain</hi> Rule,
<hi>notwithstanding the different attainments, of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which Phrase seems to
be a continuation of the former allusion to a Race.
For as <hi>Eustathius</hi> observes,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad. 3.</note> the first thing the Greeks
were wont to do as to their exercises, was to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribe
the bounds within which they were to
be performed. That which fixed and determined
these limits was called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by the Greeks, and
<hi>Regula</hi> and <hi>Lineae</hi> by the Latins: thence <hi>transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lire
lineas</hi> in <hi>Cicero</hi> is to commit a fault, to break
the bounds within which we are confined.</p>
            <p>All the question is, what the Apostle means by
this <hi>Rule,</hi> whether only a Rule of Charity and
mutual forbearance, with a liberty of different
practice; or such a <hi>Rule</hi> which limits and dermines
the manner of practice. It cannot be the former,
because that is the case, the Apostle had spoken to
just before. <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwise minded;</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100317:9"/>
therefore now subjoining this with respect to those
who had gone beyond them, he doth imply such
an agreement and uniformity of Practice as doth
lie in observing the same standing Rule. For
which we must consider, that they understood al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
what orders and directions he had given
them when a Church was first formed among
them; and therefore when the Apostle mentions
a Rule without declaring what it was, we have
reason to believe, it was such a Rule which they
very well knew, which he had given to them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
So we find elsewhere the Apostle refers to
such Rules of Government and Order, which he
had given to other Churches, and were already
received and practised among them. For the
<hi>Apostles</hi> did not write their Epistles for the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Churches, but they were already in being;
only they took notice of any disorders among
them, and reformed abuses, and left some things
to <hi>their own</hi> directions, when they should come
among them. <hi>And the rest will I set in order when
I come. As the Lord hath called every one, so let him
walk;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 34.</note> 
               <hi>and so ordain I in all the Churches.</hi> Which
shews that the Apostles did not leave all persons
to act as they judged fit,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 17.</note> but did make Rules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
their practice, and obliging them to
uniformity therein. For might not men pretend
that these were not things in themselves necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and might be scrupled by some Persons, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100317:10"/>
therefore were not fit to be imposed upon any?
But I do not find that the Apostles on this account
did forbear giving Rules in such cases, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
Christians to observe them; and that not on
the meer Authority of Apostles, but as Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of Churches, whose business it is to take
care of the welfare and preservation of them.
There are many things which seem very little
and inconsiderable in themselves, whose conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
and tendency is very great; and the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Governours lies in preventing the danger
of little things, and keeping the zeal of well-meaning
persons within its due bounds. For,
those who are engaged below in the Valley, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in small parties, and pursuing their advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
do run into their enemies Camp before
they are aware of it, may receive an unexpected
check from their Commanders in chief, who from
the higher ground espie the hazard they are in by
their over-forwardness, and the arts which their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
use in drawing them into little Companies
to fight separately, and the danger they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
bring upon the whole Army; and therefore send
them a peremptory order to give over fighting by
themselves and make good their retreat into the
Body of the Army: They wonder, they complain,
they think themselves hardly used; but no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
man blames their Generals who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
their safety more than they do themselves,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100317:10"/>
and know the allowing them the Liberty they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
would endanger the destruction of them all.
The Wisdom and Conduct of Governours, is quite
another thing from the Zeal and Courage of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Persons; who knowing their own resolution
and integrity, think much to be controlled; but
those who stand upon higher Ground and see
further than they can do, must be allowed a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
capacity of judging what makes for the safety
of the whole, than they can have: and such things
which they look on in themselves, and therefore
think them mean and trifling, the other look
upon them in their consequence, and the influence
they may have upon the publick safety. It were
extreamly desirable that all good and useful men
should enjoy as much satisfaction as might be, but if
it cannot be attained without running great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards
of unsettling all, it is then to be considered,
whether the general safety or some mens particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
satisfaction be the more desirable. And
this is that, which the example of the Apostles
themselves gives us reason to consider, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there were many doubts and scruples in
their times about several Rites and Customes,
yet the Apostles did give Rules in such cases, and
bind Christians to observe them; as we find in
that famous decree made upon great deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 28</note>
in a Council of the Apostles at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
wherein they determined those things which they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100317:11"/>
knew were then scrupled, and continued so to
be afterwards, whereever the Judaizing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
prevailed. But notwithstanding all their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction,
the Apostles continued the same
Rule; and S. <hi>Paul</hi> here requires the most forward
Christians to mind their Rule, and to preserve
Peace and Unity among themselves.</p>
            <p>But doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 14th Chapter of his Epistle
to the <hi>Romans</hi> lay down quite another Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> only
of mutual forbearance in such cases, where men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied
in conscience?</p>
            <p>I answer, that the Apostle did act like a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Governour, and in such a manner, as he
thought, did most tend to the propagation of the
Gospel, and the good of particular Churches. In
some Churches that consisted most of <hi>Iews,</hi> as
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time did, and where
they did not impose the necessity of keeping the
Law on the Gentile Christians (as we do not find
they did at <hi>Rome)</hi> the Apostle was willing to have
the Law buried as decently, and with as little
noise as might be; and therefore in this case, he
perswades both parties to Forbearance and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
in avoiding <hi>the judging and censuring one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, 6, 10.</note>
since <hi>they had an equal regard to the honour
of God in what they did.</hi> But in those Churches,
where the false Apostles made use of this pretence,
of the Levitical Law being still in force, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the Churches, and to separate the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100317:11"/>
of Christians; there the Apostle bids them
beware of them, and their practices; as being of
a dangerous and pernicious consequence. So
that the preserving the Peace of the Church, and
preventing Separation was the great measure,
according to which, the Apostle gave his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and that makes him so much insist on this
advice to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that whatever their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments
in Christianity were, they should <hi>walk
by the same Rule, and mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. We take notice of the Duty and obligation
that lies upon the best Christians, <hi>to walk by the same
Rule, to mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence arise two very considerable En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries.</p>
            <p>1. How far the obligation doth extend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with an established Rule, and to preserve the
Peace of the Church we live in?</p>
            <p>2. What is to be done, if men cannot come
up to that Rule? For the Apostle speaks only
of such as have attained so far; <hi>Whereto we have
already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. How far the obligation doth extend to
comply with an established Rule, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Peace of the Church we live in? This
I think the more necessary to be spoken to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I cannot perswade my self that so many
scrupulous and conscientious men as are at this
day among us would live so many years in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100317:12"/>
a known sin; <hi>i. e.</hi> in a state of Separation
from the Communion of a Church, which in
Conscience they thought themselves obliged to
communicate with. It must be certainly some
great mistake in their judgements must lead them
to this; (for I am by no means willing to impute it
to passion and evil designs) and out of the hearty
desire I have, if possible, to give satisfaction in this
matter, I shall endeavour to search to the bottom of
this dangerous mistake, to which we owe so much
of our present distractions and fears.</p>
            <p>But for the better preventing all mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the design of my Discourse, I desire it
may be considered</p>
            <p>1. That I speak not of the Separation or distinct
Communion of <hi>whole Churches</hi> from each other;
which according to the Scripture, Antiquity and
Reason, have a just Right and Power to Govern
and Reform themselves. By <hi>whole Churches,</hi> I
mean, the <hi>Churches</hi> of such <hi>Nations,</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the decay of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> resumed
their just Right of Government to themselves,
and upon their owning Christianity, incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into one Christian Society, under the same
common ties and Rules of Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Such as the Church of <hi>Macedonia</hi> would have
been, if from being a Roman Province it had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Christian Kingdom, and the Churches of
<hi>Thessalonica, Philippi</hi> and the rest had united together.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100317:12"/>
And so the several Churches of the <hi>Lydian</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consular
Asia,</hi> if they had been united in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and Governed by the same Authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the same Rules, might have been truly called
the <hi>Lydian Church.</hi> Just as several Families uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
make one Kingdom, which at first had a
distinct and independent Power, but it would
make strange confusion in the world to reduce
Kingdoms back again to Families, because at first
they were made up of them. Thus National
Churches are National Societies of Christians,
under the same Laws of Government and rules of
Worship. For the true notion of a <hi>Church</hi> is no
more than of a Society of men united together for
their Order and Government according to the
Rules of the Christian Religion. And it is a great
mistake, to make the notion of a <hi>Church</hi> barely to
relate to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship;</hi> and consequently that
the adequate notion of a Church, is <hi>an Assembly
for Divine Worship;</hi> by which means they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
the name of Churches to particular
Congregations. Whereas, if this held true, the
Church must be dissolved assoon as the <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is broken up; but if they retain the nature of a
Church, when they do not meet together for
Worship, then there is some other bond that unites
them; and whatever that is, it constitutes the
Church. And if there be one Catholick Church
consisting of multitudes of particular Churches
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100317:13"/>
consenting in one Faith; then why may there
not be one National Church from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the same Articles of Religion, and the
same Rules of Government and Order of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship?
Nay, If it be mutual consent and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
which makes a Church, then why
may not National Societies agreeing together
in the same Faith, and under the same Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and Discipline, be as truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Church, as any particular Congregation?
For, is not the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>France</hi> as truly a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
consisting of so many Provinces; as the
Kingdom of <hi>Ivetot</hi> once was in <hi>Normandy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rob. Coenalis Hist. Gallic. l. 2. p. 126.</note> which
consisted of a very small territory? Among the

such an <hi>Assembly,</hi> which had the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Governing</hi>
and determining matters of Religion as well as
the affairs of <hi>State.</hi> For the Senate of 500 being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed

in the last of which, an account of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi>
was taken and of other matters which concerned
Religion; as in the <hi>Comitia Calata</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> From

And in this sense I shall shew afterwards, the
word was used in the first Ages of the Christian
Church, as it comprehended the Ecclesiastical
Governours and the People of whole Cities; and
why many of these Cities being united under one
Civil Government, and the same Rules of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
should not be called one National Church, I
cannot understand.<note place="margin">Sacrilegious desertion, p. 35.</note> Which makes me wonder
at those who say <hi>they cannot tell what we mean
by the Church of England;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Separation yet no Schism, p. 59.</note> in short we mean, that
Society of Christian People which in this Nation
are united under the same Profession of Faith, the
same Laws of Government, and rules of Divine
Worship. And every Church thus constituted, we
do assert to have a just Right of Governing it self,
and of reforming Errors in Doctrine and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
in Worship.</p>
            <p>On which Ground, we are acquitted from the
imputation of Schism in the separation from the
Roman Church, for we only resume our just
Rights, as the Brittish Nation did, as to Civil
Government, upon the Ruine of the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>2. I do not intend to speak of the Terms upon
which Persons are to be admitted among us to
the Exercise of the <hi>Function</hi> of the <hi>Ministry;</hi> but
of the Terms of <hi>Lay-communion; i. e.</hi> those which are
necessary for all Persons to joyn in our Prayers and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100317:14"/>
Sacraments and other Offices of Divine Worship.
I will not say, there hath been a great deal of
Art used to confound these two, (and it is easie
to discern to what purpose it is;) but I dare say,
the Peoples not understanding the difference of
these two Cases hath been a great occasion of the
present Separation. For in the Judgement of some
of the most impartial men of the Dissenters at this
day, although they think the case of the <hi>Ministers</hi>
very hard on the account of <hi>Subscriptions</hi> and
<hi>Declarations</hi> required of them; yet they confess
very little is to be said on the behalf of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
from whom none of those things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
So that the People are condemned in their
Separation, by their own Teachers; but how
they can preach lawfully to a People who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a fault in hearing them, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>3. I do not confound bare <hi>suspending Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in some particular Rites,</hi> which persons
do modestly scruple, and using it in what they
judge to be lawful; with either <hi>total,</hi> or at least
<hi>ordinary forbearance of Communion in what they
judge to be lawful; and proceeding to the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Separate Congregations, i. e.</hi> under other
Teachers, and by other Rules than what the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
Religion allows. And this is the present
case of <hi>Separation</hi> which I intend to consider, and
to make the <hi>sinfulness</hi> and <hi>mischief</hi> of it appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:100317:14"/>
But that I may do it more convincingly, I will
not make the difference wider than it is; but lay
down impartially the <hi>state</hi> of the present Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
between us and our <hi>dissenting Brethren,</hi> about
<hi>Communion</hi> with our Churches.</p>
            <p>1. They unanimously confess they find no fault

               </note> we are told, <hi>they had after the Plague

with our Churches was in it self lawful and
good.</hi> Who could have imagined otherwise,
than that after the weight of <hi>so many Reasons,</hi>
and such a general consent among them, they
should have all joyned with us in what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
judged to be lawful, and in many cases a
duty? But instead of this, we have rather since
that time found them more inclinable to courses
of separation, filling the people with greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
against our Communion, and gathering
them into fixed and separate Congregations;
which have proceeded to the choice of new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
upon the death of old ones; and except
some very few, scarce any, either of their
Preachers or People here, come ordinarily to the
publick Congregations. And this is that which at
present we lament as a thing which unavoidably
tends to our common ruine, if not in time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100317:15"/>
for by this means the hearts of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are alienated from each other, who apprehend
the differences to be much greater than their
Teachers will allow, when they are put to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
their minds; and our common enemies take
as much advantage from our differences, as if
they were really far greater than they are.</p>
            <p>But you may ask, what then are the grounds
of the present Separation? for that there is such a
thing is discernible by all, but what the reasons of
it are is hard to understand after these concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
yet it is not conceivable that conscientious
men can in such a juncture of affairs persist in so
obstinate and destructive a course of separation,
unless they had something at last fit to answer
the <hi>twenty Reasons</hi> of their own Brethren against
it?</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to give my self satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a matter of so great moment to the Peace
and Preservation of this Church, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the Protestant Religion among us; which
I never expect to see survive the destruction of
the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the utmost I can find in the best Writers
of the several Parties, amounts to these two things.</p>
            <p>1. That although they are in a state of sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from our Church, yet this separation is no
sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:100317:16"/>
2. That a State of Separation would be a sin, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their meeting in different places, yet they are
not in a state of Separation.</p>
            <p>And herein lies the whole strength of the several
<hi>Pleas</hi> at this day made use of to justifie the <hi>Separate
Congregations:</hi> both which I shall now examine.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Some plead,</hi> that it is true they have distinct and
separate Communions from us, but it is no sin, or
culpable separation so to have. For, <hi>say they,</hi>
Our Lord Christ instituted only Congregational Churches,<note place="margin">Discourse concerning-Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Love, Church-Peace and Unity, <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note>
or particular Assemblies for Divine Worship, which having
the sole Church power in themselves, they are under no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of Communion with other Churches, but only to
preserve Peace and Charity with them. <hi>And to this
doctrine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Baxters</hi> true and only way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>A. D. 1680. p.</hi> 111.</note> 
               <hi>others of late approach so near,
that they tell us,</hi> that to devise new species of Churches
(beyond Parochial or Congregational) without Gods Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and to impose them on the world (yea in his name)
and call all Dissenters Schismaticks, is a far worse usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
than to make or impose new Ceremonies or Liturgies.
<hi>Which must suppose Congregational Churches to
be so much the Institution of Christ, that any other
Constitution above these is both unlawful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable.
Which is more than the Independent
Brethren themselves do assert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to clear the practice of <hi>Separation</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sin on this account, two things are necessary to
be done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:100317:16"/>
1. To prove that a Christian hath no obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to external Communion beyond a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Church.</p>
            <p>2. That it is lawful to break off Communion
with other Churches, to set up a particular inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Church.</p>
            <p>1. That a Christian hath no obligation to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Communion beyond a particular Congregational
Church. <hi>They do not deny,</hi> that men by Baptism
are admitted into the Catholick visible Church as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it;<note place="margin">Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 49. 52.</note> and that there ought to be a sort of Communion
by mutual Love among all that belong to this Body: <hi>and
to do them Right,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 54.</note> 
               <hi>they declare</hi> that they look upon
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Generality of the Nation
professing Christianity, to be as sound and healthful a part
of the Catholick Church, as any in the World. <hi>But then
they say,</hi> Communion in ordinances must be only in such
Churches as Christ himself instituted by unalterable Rules,<note place="margin">p. 59.</note>
which were only particular and Congregational Churches.</p>
            <p>Granting this to be true, how doth it hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
not to be a sin to separate from our Parochial
Churches; which according to their own conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
have all the Essentials of true Churches?
And what Ground can they have to separate and
divide those Churches, which for all that we can
see, are of the same nature with the Churches
<hi>planted</hi> by the Apostles at <hi>Corinth, Philippi</hi> or <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica?</hi>
But I must needs say further, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet seen any tolerable proof, that the Churches
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100317:17"/>
planted by the Apostles were limited to Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.
It is possible, at first, there might be
no more Christians in one City than could meet
in one Assembly for Worship; but where doth it
appear, that when they multiplied into <hi>more
Congregations,</hi> they did make <hi>new</hi> and <hi>distinct
Churches,</hi> under new Officers with a <hi>Separate
Power</hi> of <hi>Government?</hi> Of this, I am well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
there is no mark or footstep in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
or the whole History of the Primitive
Church. I do not think it will appear credible
to any considerate man, that the 5000 Christians
in the Church of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> made <hi>one stated and
fixed Congregation for divine Worship;</hi> not if
we make all the allowances for <hi>strangers</hi> which
can be desired: but if this were granted, where
are the unalterable Rules that assoon as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
became too great for one <hi>particular Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
they must become a new Church under pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Officers and an independent Authority?</p>
            <p>It is very strange, that those who contend so
much for the Scriptures being a perfect Rule of
all things pertaining to Worship and Discipline,
should be able to produce nothing in so necessary
a Point. If that of which we read the clearest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
in Scripture, must be the Standard of all
future Ages, much more might be said for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
Churches to <hi>private families,</hi> than to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Congregations.</hi> For, do we not read of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100317:17"/>
               <hi>the Church that was in the House of</hi> Priscilla <hi>and</hi> Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
<hi>at</hi> Rome;<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 3. 5.</note> of the <hi>Church that was in the House of</hi>
Nymphas <hi>at</hi> Colosse;<note place="margin">Colos. 4. 15 Philem. <hi>v.</hi> 2.</note> and in <hi>the House of</hi> Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>at</hi> Laodicea? Why then should not Churches
be reduced to particular <hi>Families,</hi> when by that
means they may fully enjoy the Liberty of their
Consciences, and avoid the scandal of breaking the
Laws? But if, notwithstanding such plain exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
men will extend <hi>Churches</hi> to <hi>Congregations
of many Families;</hi> why may not others extend
<hi>Churches</hi> to those Societies which consist of <hi>many
Congregations?</hi> Especially considering, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
when they instituted Churches, did appoint
such Officers in them, as had not barely a respect
to those already converted, but to as many as by
their means should be added to the Church; as
<hi>Clemens</hi> affirms in his Epistle; <hi>The Apostles,</hi> saith he,
<hi>went about in Cities and Countries preaching the Gospel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Clem. Ep. ad Corinth, <hi>p.</hi> 55.</note>
               <hi>and appointed their First-fruits, having made a spiritual
trial of them, for Bishops and Deacons, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
of those who were to believe.</hi> From hence the number
of Converts were looked on as an accession to the
Original Church, and were under the care and
Government of the Bishop and Presbyters, who
were first settled there. For although when the
Churches increased, the occasional meetings
were frequent in several places; yet still there
was but <hi>one Church,</hi> and <hi>one Altar,</hi> and <hi>one Baptistry,</hi>
and <hi>one Bishop,</hi> with many <hi>Presbyters</hi> assisting
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100317:18"/>
him. And this is so very plain in Antiquity, as
to the Churches planted by the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in several parts, that none but a great stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to the History of the Church
can ever call it in question.<note place="margin">

<hi>Calvin,</hi> a person of great and deserved
reputation among our Brethren,
looks upon this as a matter out of
dispute among learned men, that
a Church did not only take in the Christians of a
whole City, but of the adjacent Country too:
and the contrary opinion is a very novel and late
fancy of some among us, and hath not age enough
to plead a Prescription. It is true, after some
time in the greater Cities, they had distinct places
allotted, and Presbyters fixed among them; and
such allotments were called <hi>Titles</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and
<hi>Laurae</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Parishes</hi> in other places;
but these were never thought then to be new
Churches, or to have any independent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in themselves; but were all in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Bishop and his College of Presbyters,
of which multitudes of examples might be
brought from most authentick Testimonies of
Antiquity; if a thing so evident needed
any proof at all. And yet this distribution
even in Cities was so uncommon in those elder
times, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> takes notice of it as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
thing at <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and therefore it
is probably supposed there was no such thing in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100317:18"/>
all the Cities of <hi>Creet</hi> in his time.<note place="margin">Petav. not. in Epiphan. haer. 69. n. 1.</note> And if we
look over the antient Canons of the Church, we
shall find two things very plain in them, (1.) That
the notion of a Church was the same with that of
a Diocese;<note place="margin">Canon. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caen. 6. 15, 16.</note> or such a number of Christians as
were under the inspection of a Bishop.<note place="margin">Constan. c. 6.</note> (2.) That
those Presbyters who rejected the Authority of
their Bishop,<note place="margin">Chalced. 17. 20, 26.</note> or affected <hi>separate meetings,</hi> where
no fault could be found with the Doctrine of a
Church,<note place="margin">Antioc. c. 2.</note> were condemned of Schism.<note place="margin">Codex Eccl.</note> So the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of <hi>Eustathius Sebastenus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Afric. c. 53. c. 55.</note> who withdrew
from the publick Congregations on pretence of
greater sanctity and purity, in <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil.</note> were
condemned by the Council at <hi>Gangrae;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gangr. c. 6.</note> so were
those who separated from their Bishops,<note place="margin">Concil. Const. c. 6.</note> though
otherwise never so orthodox, by the Council at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. c. 10, 11.</note> and the Council at <hi>Carthage;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
before St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had so justly complained of
the Schism of <hi>Felicissimus</hi> and his Brethren,<note place="margin">Cyprian. Ep. 40, 42.</note> who
on pretence of some disorders in the Church of
<hi>Carthage</hi> had withdrawn to the Mountains; and
there laid the Foundation of the <hi>Novatian</hi> Schism.
But when false Doctrine was imposed on
Churches,<note place="margin">Theod. Eccl. hist. l. 1. c. 22. l. 2. c. 24. c. 17.</note> as by the <hi>Arian</hi> Bishops at <hi>Antioch,</hi> then
the people were excused in their separation; so
at <hi>Rome</hi> when <hi>Felix</hi> was made Bishop; and at
<hi>Sirmium</hi> when <hi>Photinus</hi> published his Heresie;<note place="margin">Vincent. c. 16.</note> but
I do not remember one instance in Antiquity,
wherein <hi>separation</hi> from <hi>Orthodox Bishops</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100317:19"/>
setting up <hi>Meetings</hi> without their Authority and
against their consent, was acquitted from the sin
of <hi>Schism.</hi> Indeed some Bishops have sometimes
refused Communion with others upon great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors;
as <hi>Theognostus</hi> and St. <hi>Martin</hi> with the
<hi>Ithacian</hi> party on the account of the death of <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillian;</hi>
but this doth not at all reach to the case
of Presbyters separating from Bishops, with
whom they agree in the same Faith. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> did, I confess, continue
their separate Meetings after his banishment, and
the coming in of <hi>Arsacius:</hi> but although they
withdrew in his time, being unsatisfied in the
manner of his choice; yet when <hi>Atticus</hi> restored
the name of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> to the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of the
<hi>Church,</hi> they returned to communion with their
Bishop,<note place="margin">Baron. A. D. 404. n. 41. 412. n. 47.</note> as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> himself advised them (as
appears by <hi>Palladius)</hi> which is far from justifying
the wilfull separation of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>People</hi> from
the <hi>Communion</hi> of their <hi>Bishops,</hi> when they do agree
in the <hi>same Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. But suppose the first Churches were barely
<hi>congregational,</hi> by reason of the small number
of Believers at that time, yet <hi>what obligation
lies upon us to disturb the Peace of the Church
we live in to reduce Churches to their infant-state?</hi>
They do not think it necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the first <hi>Community of Goods,</hi> which was far
more certainly practised, than Congregational
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100317:19"/>
Churches;<note place="margin">Joh. 13. 14.</note> they do not think it necessary <hi>to wash one
anothers feet,</hi> although Christ did it, and bad his
Disciples <hi>do as he did:</hi> they believe that the first
civil Government was appointed by God himself
over Families; do they therefore think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
bound to overthrow Kingdoms to bring
things back to their first institution? If not, why
shall the Peace of the Church be in so much
worse a condition than that of the Civil-state?
It is very uncertain whether the Primitive form
were such as they fancy; if it were, it is more
uncertain whether it were not so from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the times, than from any instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ; but it is most certainly our duty
to preserve Peace and Unity among Christians;
and it is impossible so to do if men break all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in pieces for the fancy they have taken up of
a Primitive Platform. It is a great fault among
some who pretend to great niceness in some <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Duties,</hi> that they have so little regard to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative
Duties:</hi> For that which may be a duty in
one case, when it comes to thwart a greater Duty,
may be none. This Doctrine we learn from our
blessed Saviour in the case of the obligation of the
Sabbath;<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 7.</note> which he makes to yield to duties of
Mercy. And can we think that a Duty lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, which in our circumstances makes a far
greater Duty impracticable? Is there any thing
Christ and his Apostles have charged more upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100317:20"/>
the Consciences of all Christians, than studying
to preserve Peace and Unity among Christians?<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 19.</note>
This is that <hi>we must follow after,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 11.</note> even when it
seems to fly from us; this is that, <hi>we must apply our
minds to,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>and think it our honour to promote;</hi> this is that
which <hi>the most perfect Christians are the most zealous
for;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 2, 3.</note> this is that, for the sake of which we are
commanded to practise <hi>meekness, humility, patience,
self-denial and submission to Governours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> And after all
this, can we imagine the attaining of such an end
should depend upon mens conjectures, whether
five thousand Christians in times of persecution
could make one Assembly for Worship? Or
whether all the Christians in <hi>Ephesus</hi> or <hi>Corinth</hi>
made but one Congregation? On what terms can
we ever hope for Peace in the Church, if such
Notions as these be ground enough to disturb it?
What stop can be put to Schisms and Separations,
if such pretences as these be sufficient to justifie
them? Men may please themselves in talking of
preserving <hi>Peace and Love</hi> under separate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions;
but our own sad experience shews the
contrary; for as nothing tends more to unite mens
hearts than joyning together in the same Prayers
and Sacraments; so nothing doth more alienate
mens affections, than withdrawing from each
other into separate Congregations. Which tempts
some to spiritual Pride and scorn and contempt of
others, as of a more <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>worldly Church</hi> than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100317:20"/>
themselves; and provokes others to lay open the
follies, and indiscretions and immoralities of those
who pretend to so much Purity and Spirituality
above their Brethren.</p>
            <p>2. Others confess,<note place="margin">True way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, part 3. ch. 1. Sect. 40.</note> 
               <hi>that to live in a state of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from such Churches, as many at least of
ours are, were a sin;</hi> for they say, <hi>that causeless re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
Communion with true Churches is Schism, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if it be joyned with setting up Anti-Churches unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
against them;</hi> but this they deny that they do,
although they Preach when and where it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by Law; and worship God, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Sacraments by other Rules and after a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
manner than what our Church requires. This
is not dealing with us with that fairness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
which our former Brethren used; for they
avow the fact of <hi>separation,</hi> but deny it to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;
these owning it to be sinful, have no other
refuge left but to deny the fact, which is evident
to all Persons. For do they not do the very
same things and in the same manner, that the
others do; how comes it then to be <hi>separation</hi> in
some and not in others? They are very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to confess a <hi>separation,</hi> because they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
condemned it with great severity; and yet
they do the same things for which they charged
others as guilty of a <hi>sinful separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For, the</hi> Assembly <hi>of</hi> Divines <hi>urged their</hi> dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<hi>to comply with their</hi> Rules <hi>of</hi> Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100317:21"/>
               <hi>and charged them with</hi> Schism <hi>if they did it
not; whereas they only desired to enjoy such li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as to their</hi> separate Congregations, <hi>as is now
pleaded for by our</hi> dissenting Brethren.<note place="margin">Papers for Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, printed 1648. <hi>p. 16. p.</hi> 20, 21.</note> This, <hi>say
they,</hi> would give countenance to a perpetual Schism and
Division in the Church, still drawing away some from the
Churches under the Rule, which also would breed irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
between the Parties; and would introduce all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Confusion. <hi>And they thougt it a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
thing for them to desire</hi> distinct and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
Congregations, as to those parts of worship where
they could joyn in Communion with them: <hi>and they
thought no Person was to be indulged</hi> as to any
Error or Scruple of Conscience;<note place="margin">P. 22.</note> 
               <hi>but with this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi>
that in all other parts of worship they joyn with the
Congregation wherein they live; <hi>and be under the
Government to be established. To this the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Brethren answered,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 25.</note> that such a variation,
or forbearance could neither be a Schism, nor endanger it;
and that the great cause of Schism hath been a strict obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of all to Uniformity; that as long as in their sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Congregations they did practise most of the same
things, and the most substantial in their Rule, it could
not be called a total separation, especially considering, that
they professed their Churches to be true Churches; and
that they had occasional Communion with them,<note place="margin">P. 28, 29, 30.</note> 
               <hi>which is
the very same Plea made use of at this day
among us. To which the Assemblies party
smartly replied,</hi> that since they acknowledged their
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100317:21"/>
Churches to be so true,<note place="margin">P. 47.</note> that they could occasionally join
in all Acts of worship, they conceived they were bound to
act with them in joint Communion by one Common Rule,
and not by different Rules and in separated Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">P. 55.</note>
               <hi>And they add,</hi> that to leave all ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in any Church with dislike, when opposition or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
offers it self, is to separate from such a Church in
the Scripture sense; such separation was not in being in
the Apostles times, unless it were used by false Teachers;
all who professed Christianity held Communion together,
as in one Church, notwithstanding differences of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">P. 56.</note>
or corruptions in Practice; <hi>and that,</hi> if they
can hold occasional Communion without sin, they know no
reason why it may not be ordinary without sin too, and
then separation would be needless. <hi>To which they
subjoin these remarkable words, which I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish our Brethren at this day would think se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
upon,</hi> To separate from those Churches ordinarily
and visibly with whom occasionally you may joyn without
sin, seemth to be a most unjust separation. <hi>So that
whatever false colours and pretences some men
make use of to justifie their present practice, if
the judgement of their own Brethren may be taken
upon the most weighty debate, and most serious
deliberation, it is no better than plain and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>
separation. <hi>And I must needs say, I never
saw any Cause more weakly defended, no, not
that of</hi> Polygamy <hi>and</hi> Anabaptism, <hi>than that of</hi>
those, <hi>who allow it to be lawful to join in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100317:22"/>
with us, and yet go about to vindicate
the</hi> separate Meetings <hi>among us, from the guilt
of a</hi> sinful separation. <hi>For although they allow</hi>
our Churches to be true, <hi>and</hi> that it is lawful to
communicate with them, <hi>which is the most plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Plea they have, this is so far from extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that it doth aggravate the fault; for as the
Brethren of the Assembly said,</hi> Though they do not
pronounce an affirmative Iudgement against us;<note place="margin">P. 71.</note> yet the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
separating is a tacit and practical condemning of our
Churches, if not as false, yet as impure.</p>
            <p>But whatever may be said as to other Pleas for
their present practices, my Text seems to afford
the strongest of all, <hi>viz.</hi> that men are to be pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to go no farther than <hi>they have already attained,</hi>
and not to be strained up to an <hi>uniformity</hi> beyond
the dictates of their Consciences, but to be let
alone, as the Apostle directs in the foregoing
verse, <hi>If any one be otherwise minded, he must be left to
God,</hi> and that manifestation of his will, which he
will be pleased to give him.</p>
            <p>The clearing of this will give a full answer to
the second enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What is to be done, if men cannot come up to the
Rule prescribed.</p>
            <p>To this therefore I answer in these particulars.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>This can never justifie men in not doing
what they lawfully may do.</hi> For this Rule of
the Apostle makes Communion necessary, as far
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100317:22"/>
as it is lawful; and that upon the account of the
general obligation lying upon all Christians to
do what in them lies for preservation of the
Peace of the Church. <hi>Therefore as far as ye have
attained walk by the same Rule, do the same things;</hi>
which words, saith <hi>Cajetan,</hi> the Apostle subjoyns
to the former, left the persons he there speaks to
should think themselves excused from going as
far as they can as to the same Rule. Which
plainly shews that men are bound in Conscience
to go as far as they can; and I cannot see how it
is consistent with that <hi>tenderness of Conscience</hi>
which our Brethren pretend to, for so many of
them to live so many years in a neglect of that
Communion with our Church, which themselves
judge to be lawful.</p>
            <p>I dare say, if most of the Preachers at this day
in the <hi>separate Meetings</hi> were soberly asked their
judgements, whether it were lawful for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to joyn with us in the publick Assemblies,
they would not deny it; and yet the People that
frequent them, generally judge otherwise. For
it is not to be supposed, that faction among them
should so commonly prevail beyond interest;
and therefore if they thought it were lawful for
them to comply with the Laws, they would do
it. But why then is this kept up as such a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
secret in the breasts of their Teachers? Why
do they not preach it to them in their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100317:23"/>
Is it for fear, they should have none left
to preach to? that is not to be imagined of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
and conscientious men. Is it lest they should
seem to condemn themselves, while they preach
against <hi>Separation</hi> in a <hi>Separate Congregation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I confess, looks oddly, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a mans mind in such a case, may out of
meer shamefacedness keep him from declaring a
Truth which flies in his face, while he speaks it.</p>
            <p>Is it that they fear the reproaches of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
which some few of the most eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
among them, have found they must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
if they touch upon this Subject (for I know
not how it comes to pass, that the most <hi>Godly
People</hi> among them, can the least endure to be told
of their faults.) But is it not as plainly written
by S. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 10.</note> 
               <hi>If I yet please men I should not be the Servant of
Christ; as Woe be unto me if I preach not the Gospel?</hi> If they
therefore would acquit themselves like honest and
conscientious men, let them tell the people plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they look on <hi>our Churches as true Churches, and
that they may lawfully communicate with us in Prayers and
Sacraments;</hi> and I do not question but in time, if
they find it lawful, they will judge it to be their
Duty. For it is the Apostles Command here,
<hi>Whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same
Rule, let us mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>If the bare dissatisfaction of mens Consciences do
justifie the lawfulness of Separation, and breaking an
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100317:23"/>
established Rule, it were to little purpose to make any
Rule at all.</hi> Because it is impossible to make any,
which Ignorant and injudicious men shall not
apprehend to be in some thing or other against
the dictates of their <hi>Consciences.</hi> But because what we
say may not weigh so much with them in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as what was said on this Occasion by their
own <hi>Brethren</hi> in the <hi>Assembly,</hi> I shall give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their <hi>Iudgement</hi> in this matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>dissenting Brethren</hi> were not so much want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to their <hi>Cause,</hi> as not to plead <hi>tenderness</hi> of
<hi>Conscience</hi> with as much advantage and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as any men now can do it. To which they
answer,</p>
            <p>1. That though tenderness of Conscience may
justifie non-communion in the thing scrupled,<note place="margin">Papers for Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, p. 51. <hi>V.</hi> p. 61.</note>
yet it can never justifie Separation.</p>
            <p>We much doubt, <hi>say they,</hi> whether such tenderness
of Conscience, as ariseth out of an opinion, <hi>cui potest
subesse falsum,</hi> (which may be false) when the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is so tender, that it may be withal an erring Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
can be a sufficient ground to justifie such a material Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
as our Brethren plead for; For though it may
bind, to forbear or suspend the Act of Communion in that
particular wherein men conceive they cannot hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
without sin (nothing being to be done contrary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Conscience) yet it doth not bind to follow such a positive
prescript as possibly may be divers from the Will and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of God, of which kind we conceive this of gathering
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100317:24"/>
Separated Churches out of other true Churches to be one.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>That it is endless to hope to give satisfation
to erring Consciences.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 66.</note> The Grounds, <hi>say they,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which this Separation is desired, are such upon which
all other possible scruples which erring consciences may in any
other cases be subject unto, may claim the priviledge of a
like Indulgence. And so this Toleration being the first, shall
indeed but lay the Foundation and open the gap, whereat as
many divisions in the Church, as there may be scruples in
the minds of men, shall upon the self same equity be let in.
<hi>And again,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 68.</note> that this will make way for infinite Divisions
and sub-divisions; and give Countenance to a perpetual
Schism,<note place="margin">p. 73.</note> and Division in the Church.</p>
            <p>3. That scruple of conscience <hi>is no</hi> protection against
Schism;<note place="margin">p. 68.</note> no cause of Separating; nor doth it take off cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Separation from being Schism,<note place="margin">p. 73.</note> which may arise from
Errors of Conscience as well as carnal and corrupt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and therefore they conceive the causes of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must be shewn to be such as <hi>ex natura rei</hi> will bear
it out.</p>
            <p>4. That the Apostles notwithstanding the differences of
mens Iudgements did prescribe Rules of Uniformity.<note place="margin">p. 111.</note> For,
<hi>say they,</hi> they suppressed the contentions of men by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Churches of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 16. and ordain
the same practice in all the Churches, notwithstanding our
Brethrens distinction of difference of light. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 17.
And did not the Apostles bind the burden of some necessary
things on the Churches, albeit there were in those Churches
gradual differences of light?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:100317:24"/>
5. That the Apostle by this Rule in the Text,<note place="margin">p. 113, 114.</note> did not
intend to allow Brethren who agree in all substantials of
Faith and Worship, to separate from one another, in those
very substantials wherein they agree. Is this, <hi>say they,</hi>
to walk by the same Rule, and to mind the same things, to
separate from Churches in those very things wherein we
agree with them?<note place="margin">p. 115.</note> We desire no more of them than we are
confident was practised by the Saints at <hi>Philippi,</hi> namely
to hold practical Communion in things wherein they doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
agree.</p>
            <p>6. That there is a great deal of difference between Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
over mens Consciences,<note place="margin">ibid.</note> and Rules of Uniformity.
<hi>For the</hi> dissenting Brethren <hi>charged the Assembly,</hi>
with setting up an Uniformity for Uniformities sake, <hi>i. e.</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
Uniformity so much, as not to regard mens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and without respect had to the varieties of Light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in
matters of a lesser nature; which, <hi>say they,</hi> will prove
a perfect tyranny, and it is in effect to stretch a low man to
the same length with a taller, or to cut a tall man to the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of one that is low, for Uniformities sake. <hi>To which
the others answer,</hi> That they do not desire Uniformity
for the sake of Tyranny, but only for order, and order for
Edification. But for ought they could perceive, any thing
that is One must be judged the foundation of Tyranny
<hi>(which are their own words.)</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 116.</note> As to variety of light,
they desired their Brethren to answer them in this one thing,
whether some must be denied liberty of their Conscience in
matter of practice, or none? If none, then, <hi>say they,</hi> we
must renounce our Covenant and let in Prelacy again; and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100317:25"/>
all others ways; if a denial of liberty unto some may be
just, then Uniformity may be settled notwithstanding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of lights,<note place="margin">p. 117.</note> without any Tyranny at all. As to their si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude,
they grant it to be pretty and plausible; but such
arguments are popular and inartificial, having more of flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
than substance in them. For did not they endeavour
to raise lower Churches to a greater height? would they
permit other Church-Governments if it were in their power,
because men must not for Uniformities sake be pared or
stretched to the measure of other men? would they endure
the lower suckers at the root of their tree to grow till they
had killed the tree it self? <hi>Ad populum phaleras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we see the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s
<hi>endeavour</hi> after <hi>Uniformity</hi> is acquitted from <hi>Tyranny</hi>
over the Consciences of men by the Judgement
of the most learned of the <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Divines;</hi>
for such we do not question they chose to manage
this debate, upon which the turn of their whole
affairs depended.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>A wilful Error or mistake of Conscience doth by no
means excuse from sin.</hi> Thus if a man think himself
bound to <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> by a <hi>sinful Separation;</hi> that
<hi>Separation</hi> is nevertheless a <hi>sin</hi> for his thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bound to do it.<note place="margin">Act. 26. 9.</note> For <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>thought himself bound
to do many things against the name of</hi> Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
yet he calls himself <hi>a blasphemer and the greatest of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13, 15.</note>
for what he did under that obligation of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Joh. 16. 2.</note>
The <hi>Iews</hi> thought themselves bound in
<hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>do God service,</hi> but it was a horrible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100317:25"/>
when they took <hi>killing the Apostles to be any
part of it.</hi> From whence it appears, that men may
do very bad things, and yet think themselves
<hi>bound in Conscience</hi> to do them. I do not hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that the pretence of <hi>Conscience</hi> is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
because it may be abused to so ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
for no man that hath any <hi>Conscience</hi> will
speak against the <hi>Power</hi> of it, and he that declares
against it, hath no reason to be regarded in what he
saith. But that which ought to be inferred from
hence, is, that men ought not to rest satisfied
with the present dictates of their <hi>Consciences,</hi> for
notwithstanding them, they may commit very
great sins. I am afraid, the common mistating
the <hi>Case</hi> of an <hi>Erroneous Conscience</hi> hath done a great
deal of Mischief to conscientious men, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd
them into great security, while they are
assured they do act according to their Consciences.
For the <hi>question</hi> is generally put, <hi>How far an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
Conscience doth oblige?</hi> And when men hear
that they must <hi>not act against their Consciences though
they be mistaken,</hi> they think themselves safe enough,
and enquire no further. But if they would consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that no mans <hi>Conscience</hi> alters the nature of
<hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> in things; that what <hi>God</hi> hath made
a <hi>Duty</hi> or a <hi>Sin</hi> remains so, whatever a mans <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
doth judge concerning them; that no mans
Conscience can strictly oblige him either to <hi>omit a
Duty,</hi> or to <hi>commit a sin;</hi> the utmost <hi>Resolution</hi> of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100317:26"/>
the Case comes to this, That a man may be so
perplexed and entangled by an <hi>erroneous Conscience</hi>
that he may be under a necessity of sinning, if he
acts either with or against it. Not that God ever
puts a man under the necessity of sinning, (for
then it would be no sin to him, if it were unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)
but that by their own neglect and carelesness,
without looking after due information, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on with violent <hi>Prejudices,</hi> which was the
case of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> (and I wish it were not
of many Christians) they may make false and rash
<hi>judgements</hi> of things, and so <hi>sin</hi> either in doing or
not doing what their <hi>Consciences</hi> tell them they are
bound to do.</p>
            <p>The most material Question then, in the case
of an <hi>erroneous Conscience,</hi> is, What <hi>Error of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
doth excuse a man from <hi>Sin</hi> in following the
<hi>Dictates</hi> of it? For, if the <hi>Error</hi> be wholly <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary;
i. e.</hi> if it be caused by <hi>invincible Ignorance,</hi>
or after using the <hi>best means</hi> for due information
of his <hi>Conscience,</hi> though the <hi>Act</hi> may be a fault in
it self, yet it shall not be imputed to him as a <hi>Sin;</hi>
because it wanted the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> by
which the <hi>Will</hi> is determined; but if men fall
into <hi>Wilful Errors of Conscience; i. e.</hi> if they form
their <hi>Iudgements</hi> rather by <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> and
<hi>Interest</hi> than from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or just <hi>Rules</hi> of
<hi>Conscience;</hi> if they do not examine things fairly on
both sides, praying for divine direction; if they
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100317:26"/>
have not patience to hear any thing against their
opinion, but run on blindly and furiously,
they may in so doing <hi>Act</hi> according to their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi>
and yet they may be in as great danger of
committing heinous sins as S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi>
were. Thus if men through the <hi>Power</hi> of an <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
Conscience</hi> may think themselves bound to
make <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> to diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
Laws and to break in pieces the <hi>Communion</hi> of
that <hi>Church,</hi> which they are, or ought to be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of, they may satisfie themselves that they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
their <hi>Consciences,</hi> and yet for want of due care
of informing themselves and judging aright, those
very Actions may be <hi>Wilful</hi> and <hi>Damnable Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing now remains but to make <hi>Application</hi>
of what hath been said to our own Case. And
that shall be to two sorts of Persons, 1. to those
who <hi>continue</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of our Church, 2. to
those who <hi>dissent</hi> from it.</p>
            <p>I. To those who <hi>continue</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of
our <hi>Church. Let us walk by the same Rule, and mind
the same things.</hi> Let us study the Unity and Peace,
and thereby the Honour and Safety of it. While
we keep to <hi>one Rule,</hi> all People know what it is to
be of our Church; if men set up their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
above the Rule, they charge it with imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
if they do not obey the Rule, they make
themselves wiser than those that made it. It hath
not been either the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100317:27"/>
which have ever given advantage to the Enemies
of it; but the indiscretion of some in going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them; and the inconstancy of others in not
holding to them.</p>
            <p>Such is the <hi>Purity</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> such the <hi>Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of its <hi>Principles,</hi> such the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and
<hi>Piety</hi> of its <hi>Devotions,</hi> that none who are true
Friends to any of these, can be enemies to it. Let
us take heed we do not give too much occasion to
our enemies to think the worse of our <hi>Church</hi> for
our sakes. It is easie to observe, that most quarrels
relating to <hi>Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Frames</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are
more against <hi>Person</hi> than <hi>things;</hi> when they are
unsatisfied with their management, then they
blame the <hi>Government;</hi> but if themselves were in
place, or those they love and esteem, then the
Government is a good thing, if it be in good
mens hands. Thus do mens judgements vary as
their interests do.</p>
            <p>And so as to <hi>Churches,</hi> we find <hi>Uniformity</hi> and
<hi>Order</hi> condemned as <hi>Tyrannical,</hi> till men come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Power</hi> themselves, and then the very same
things and arguments are used and thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good and substantial, which before were weak
and sophistical. Those who speak now most
against the <hi>Magistrates Power</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion</hi>
had <hi>ten substantial Reasons</hi> for it,<note place="margin">

<hi>Popery,</hi> the <hi>common Sink</hi> of all <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Heresies.</hi>
But, if there be not much to be said against the
<hi>Churches Constitution,</hi> then they are ready to lay load
upon the <hi>Persons</hi> of the <hi>Governours</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of
it; and thence pretend to a necessity of <hi>Separation</hi>
for a <hi>purer Communion.</hi> Let us endeavour to remove
this objection, not by recrimination (which is
too easie in such cases) but by living suitably to
our holy Religion, by reforming our own lives,
and redressing (what in us lies) the <hi>Scandals</hi> and
<hi>Disorders</hi> of others. Let us by the innocency and
unblameableness of our lives, the life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of our devotions, the meekness and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of our behaviour in our own Cause, our Zeal
and Courage in Gods, add a lustre to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and bring others to a <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi>

<hi>calling it</hi> a renting the Church, the disgrace of Religion,
the advancement of Pride, Schism and Contention, the
Offence of the Weak, the grief of the Godly, who be better
settled, the hardening of the Wicked, and the recovery or
rising again of Antichristianism; nay, even persecuting
the Lord Iesus in his Hoast, which they revile in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
which they dishonour; and in his Servants whose
footsteps they slander, whose Graces they despise, whose
Office they trample upon with disdain. <hi>These are the

was it such a sin then? And is it none now? Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our</hi> Brethren <hi>at this day, do believe it to be a</hi>
Sin <hi>for the</hi> People <hi>to</hi> separate, <hi>or they do not: If
not, it must either be, that there are new and
harder terms of Communion, which were not
then; which is so far from being true, that they
confess them to be rather easier for the People: or
it must be, that they are gone off from the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
principles of their Predecessors, which they
are unwilling to own. If they do believe it
to be a</hi> Sin, <hi>why do they suffer the People to
live in a known Sin? Why do they encourage

have been aware of;
and on that account have
told the <hi>People</hi> of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the <hi>Principles of Separation,</hi> as to the interest
of <hi>Religion</hi> in general, and the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> in
particular among us.</p>
            <p>Certainly, Nothing would tend more to our
common security than for all true and sincere
Protestants to lay aside their prejudices, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes,
and to joyn heartily in <hi>Communion</hi> with us:
which many of their <hi>Teachers</hi> at this day allow to
be lawful. And how can they satisfie themselves
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100317:30"/>
in hazarding our Religion by not doing that,
which themselves confess lawful to be done?</p>
            <p>(2.) But if we are not yet ripe for so great a
mercy as a perfect Union, yet I would intreat
our <hi>Brethren</hi> to make way for it by hearkning to
these following <hi>Advices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Not to give encouragement to rash and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
zeal;</hi> which rends all in pieces, and makes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
impossible. Those who see least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
things, are usually the fiercest condenders about
them: and such eager Disputants are fitter to
make quarrels than to end them; for they can be
<hi>contentious</hi> for <hi>Peace-sake,</hi> and make new <hi>differences</hi>
about the <hi>ways</hi> of <hi>Unity.</hi> Wisdom and Sobriety,
a good judgement, a prudent temper, and freedom
from prejudice will tend more to end our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
than warm Debates, and long Disputations;
which as <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> said once of Councils,
<hi>seldom have had any good end.</hi> But there is a more
fiery sort of zeal, and more dangerous than this;
which may lie smothering for a time, till it meets
with suitable matter and a freer vent, and then
it breaks out into a dreadful flame. This we
have already seen such dismal effects of in this age,
that we should think there were less need to give
men caution against it again, were it not to be
feared, that where Reason connot prevail, Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
will not. All that we can say to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that may be like to move them, is, that if
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100317:31"/>
their <hi>blind zeal</hi> transport them, as it did <hi>Sampson,</hi>
to pull down the <hi>House</hi> over their <hi>Heads,</hi> they
will be sure to perish themselves in the fall of
it; but here will lie the great difference of the
case, while they and their Friends perish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>Philistims</hi> without will rejoyce to make
others the instruments to execute their designs.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Not to be always complaining of their hardships
and Persecutions;</hi> as though no People had suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so much since the days of <hi>Dioclesian;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the severity of Laws hath been tempered
with so much gentleness in the execution of them,
that others have as much complained of <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi>
as they of <hi>Persecution.</hi> It doth not look like
the <hi>Patience,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> of the
<hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> to make such noise and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
of their suffering so much, when <hi>they</hi> would
have been rather thankful that they suffered no
more. Is this the <hi>way to Peace,</hi> to represent their
case still to the world in an exasperating and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
manner? Is this the way to incline their <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi>
to more <hi>condescension,</hi> to represent them to
the <hi>People</hi> as an <hi>Ithacian persecuting Party?</hi> Where
are the <hi>Priscillians</hi> that have been put to death by
their instigation? What do such insinuations
mean, but that our <hi>Bishops</hi> are the followers of
<hi>Ithacius</hi> and <hi>Idacius</hi> in their <hi>cruelty;</hi> and they of the
good and meek Bishop S. <hi>Martin,</hi> who refused
Communion with them on that account? If men
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100317:31"/>
do entertain such kind thoughts of themselves,
and such hard thoughts of their <hi>Superiors,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they <hi>plead for,</hi> they have no inclination to
<hi>Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Not to condemn others for that which themselves
have practised, and think to be lawful in their own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</hi>
What outcries have some made against the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> as <hi>Cruel</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
and requiring <hi>Uniformity?</hi> And yet do
not such men, even at this day, contend for the
<hi>Obligation</hi> of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> which binds men <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after uniformity in Doctrine, Discipline and
Worship?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 1. 7</note> But they want the ingenuity of <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezek,</hi>
to reflect on <hi>the Thumbs and the Toes, which
they have cut off from others;</hi> and think themselves
bound to do it again, if it were in their power.
Who could have been thought more moderate in
this way, than those who went upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

From all which it appears, the true Controversie
is not about the <hi>Reasonableness</hi> of <hi>Uniformity;</hi> but
who shall have the <hi>Power</hi> of prescribing the <hi>Rules</hi>
of it. Is it not now a very hard case, that the
<hi>Church of England</hi> must be loaded with bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,
and exposed to the common hatred of
all <hi>Parties</hi> for the sake of that, which every one of
them would practise if it were in their <hi>Power;</hi>
and think it very justifiable so to do?</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Not to inflame the Peoples heats, by making
their differences with the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England <hi>to appear
to be greater than they are.</hi> Let them deal honestly
and faithfully with them, by letting them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that they look on <hi>our Churches as true Churches,
and occasional Communion</hi> at least with them to be
<hi>lawful:</hi> (and it is hard to understand, if <hi>occasional
Communion</hi> be <hi>lawful,</hi> that <hi>constant Communion</hi> should
not be a <hi>Duty.)</hi> This were the way to abate mens
great prejudices, and to soften their Spirits, and to
prepare them for a closer Union. But if instead
of this, they endeavour to darken and confound
things, and cast mists before their eyes, that they
cannot see their way clear before them; all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
men will conclude, they prefer some
little interests of their own, before the honour of
<hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of his <hi>Church.</hi>

suspicions in Peoples minds concerning us.</hi> This hath
been one of the most successful arts of keeping up
the distance and prejudices that have been so great
among us, <hi>viz.</hi> by private whispers, by false sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,
by idle stories, by unreasonable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation

as these, great mischief hath been done among us,

sets men at a greater distance from our <hi>Church,</hi>
than the apprehending that we are not <hi>hearty</hi> and

to charge particular <hi>Persons,</hi> but our <hi>Church</hi> it self
with <hi>Marching towards Popery.</hi> What injustice,

fasten such an imputation upon a <hi>Church</hi> that hath
hitherto continued (and long may it do so) the

some mens coldness and indifferency in Religion;
others uncertainty and running from one extreme

a wonderful influence upon changing mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,

Religion to exchange one folly for another. If
