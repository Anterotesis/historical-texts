            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The return of it unto you (whose interest and property therein is greater than can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by any dedication) may peradventure at the first sight, have the like operation upon you which those words of Jospeph's brethren had upon their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jacob. <hi>Is not this thy sons Coat?</hi> But upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther insight into, and more inward acquaintance with it, you shall find that he who took a great part of your heart with him out of this World, Hath distilled into this work so much of those sweet spirits and graces which were fragrant in him while he lived; as may represent and continew unto you, the fruition of him in that which was his better part: besides whom you had no other object of maternall affection, and by whom there was left no other off-spring, but the fruit of his studies and pen; the more lively characters of
<pb facs="tcp:49555:3"/>
his heart and spirit, of which this is the last; drawn forth unto the life immediately before his death; left as a legacy to the people of God, and as an account of his expence of that time, which by reason of bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infirmities could not be imployed in the service of the Common-wealth in Parliament whereof he was a Member; There is not a line added to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by any other pencill, neither did it need any thing but midwifery to bring it forth into the World, and present it unto you as <hi>his,</hi> or (if you please) as <hi>him.</hi> The honour of which service pardon me, if I claim as of a kind of right, upon my acquaintance with his studies, and his both frequent communications with me, and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions put upon me, for the greater part of twenty years together, in which he lived under my Ministery, and in intimate correspondence with me, whereby he put me into a greater debt to him than I can exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by this acknowledgment, which indeed might lessen my testimonie by misprision of partiality, had he not left a blessed memory behind him for my justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and incouragement: If I should set forth his spirituall abilities to the life, which I decline, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to point out the way and means of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement to so great a measure and maturity of them, and thereby render the point at which he aimed, attainable by others that shall transcribe his copy, by shewing the line in which he moved to it. The method or discipline which God used towards him at his first entrance into the school of Christ, was not unlike to that of the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> wherein through the frequent recesses of the spirit, and Gods turning the dark side of the cloud towards him, he was exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised with fresh agitations &amp; discomposures of spirit,
<pb facs="tcp:49555:3"/>
so as (like massive bodies) he could not settle upon his true center without previous trepidation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he converted his studies and indeavours to the settlement of his spirituall estate, and began to search the Scriptures for the treasure hidden in that field, which together with his assiduity in hearing the word Preached, his sucking the sweet out of such Books as had marrow and experience in them, his constant trade with Heaven by Prayer, his communication of experience, and conversation with such as knew Jesus Christ, brought him to such <hi>firmness of consistence</hi> in his own spirit, as one that was the better rooted by former shakings, to such <hi>fixedness</hi> in his <hi>principles,</hi> as one that did not onely understand the truth of them, but had tasted the goodness, and felt the power of them, to such <hi>riches</hi> of <hi>spirituall experiences,</hi> as he became the resort of troubled consciences, and a dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous artist in swathing up tender and weak infants in grace, and to such <hi>spiritualty of affection,</hi> as in whom the primogeniall virtue and sence of Gods dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons toward, and impressions upon him in his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or (as the Scripture speaks) the <hi>love of his espousalls</hi> continued fresh and vigorous: As for his proficiency and progress in the way of Christianity, it was thus advanced in matter of knowledge or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, his chiefest inquiry upon any point was <hi>cui bono,</hi> of what proper use and conducement it was unto pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall holiness, or fruition of good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Searching out the nutrimentall pith or marrow that was in it, and not greatly ingaging his thoughts into opinions of contention or mere notion, which had no kernell.

            <head>TO THE READER, In way of ARGUMENT and APPLICATION.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL Scripture was written by the holy men of God, as they were moved or inspired by the holy Ghost, but this of the Psalms was not onely written by a holy man, but by a holy man in holy frames, who was not onely moved by the spirit to write them, but was in the spirit when he pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them; not so much acted by externall impulsion, as inward affection, warmth of zeal, and sensible experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; For the Psalms being to be a speciall part of the worship of God in all ages of the Church, whereby God not onely speaks to us (as in other Scripture) but we to him, in Prayer and praise, (the Arguments of almost all of them) were therefore dictated by another spirit, than other Scripture, by the spirit of grace and operation, not onely of illumination, prophesie, or inspiration; to shew us, how God is to be worshipped, not onely by holy regenerate men (such as were all the sacred pen-men) but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part of a regenerate man; else, Prayers nor praises neither come down from heaven, nor go up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; It was not enough to be a Priest to offer Sacrifice, but it must be done by a holy man with holy fire. And therefore should we sing the Psalms of David in the
<pb facs="tcp:49555:6"/>
spirit of David, and read them as he writ them, with frameable tempers to the matter treated. Of all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, our meditation in the perusall of this Book of the Psalmes (so full of practicall Gospel) ought to be sweet and spirituall, of which one rightly affirms; <hi>Let all the rest of the Scripture be the body, and this is the heart, so full of heavenly affections:</hi> Every Psalm whereof is a spirituall pang, or fresh gail, breathed by the holy Ghost on Davids heart, and penned by him, and the rest, <hi>in instanti,</hi> in heat of affection: His writing is his feeling, and so should be thy reading; the musick of the Temple should make musick in the living Temples of the holy Ghost, the sons of Sion: therefore have I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured not onely to render the proper, but also the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive meanings of the Psalmists by congruous enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to move the affections, as well as to inform the judgement: That so Davids spirit in these Psalms may be transmigrated into the experienced Reader in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable power &amp; <hi>energie,</hi> wherewith they were conceived &amp; digestedly put over by him to the Church; whereof (as of Christ) he was a most lively type, wading through so many dangers, temptations, ebbings, flowings, yea, and sins too, to create him to be a Looking-glass for the Church and Spouse of Christ, who may be black yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and can never pass through any condition of sin or suffering, where first he hath not led the way, and shewen the issue, whose varieties of providences, states, and tempers made him of such an evangelicall spirit in the time of the Law, as that God stiles him <hi>a man after his own heart</hi>; so that in him we see, that neither great sins nor great afflictions can seperate us from the love and approbation of God, though the one may cost us dear, and the other may lay us low, yet neither the one nor the other
<pb facs="tcp:49555:6"/>
can build up such a partition wall, but that the grapling irons of Faith, Prayer, and Repentance are able to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it, and make way for us to the throne of grace, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if we can but come, we shall be sure to speed; for grace can deny grace to none, that graciously ask it. And therefore if ever we will gain that <hi>Encomium</hi> of being as he was, after Gods own heart, (who ever loves a zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous penitent, better than a luke-warm innocent) it must be by improving all advantages to the encrease of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-growth, thus. If at any time God in his wisdom let us fall, or Satan by his subtility and strength give us a fall, or we by our weakness catch a fall, all which, may be in one and the same sin, then know, that that sin is thine advantage or opportunity, which thou art to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to mount thee to a higher rise of Gospel-ground, and step forward towards more grace by the fresh exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, or exercise of fresh faith and humiliation, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more pleased with us when we penitently and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully confess our sin (wherein David was very ingenuous) than displeased when we commit it. For though we are not to sin that grace may abound, yet when we have sinned, its both our wisdom and duty too, to look that grace do abound, and that we make a sanctified sin of it. Acts of sinning in the regenerate (contrary to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy) lessening the habits of sin. And so if we fall into afflictions, there is another opportunity. (for the promise is, that <hi>all shall work for good,</hi> and that, <hi>going in and out,</hi> we shall find pasture) yea, even a price in our hands, which if improved by the exercise of seasonable and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table graces, will ready us in our Gospel-way, better than any trade-wind or constant gail of providence can ever do. Severall conditions make exceedingly for setting forth the Art of God in the second Creation, as severall
<pb facs="tcp:49555:7"/>
creatures do his skill in the first, which variety in both makes us to abound not onely with necessaries but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which Scripture calls <hi>things both new and old,</hi> which no one condition unvaried can possibly render us capable of, for it is said, all things work <hi>together</hi> for good <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alluding to the Art of the Apothecary in the mixing of various and diverse Simples, no one whereof alone is able to work that effect that many joyntly can. And when I speak of change of states, I mean inward as well as outward, for the soul would be as a cake unturned, excellent in something and stark naught in othersome, or as a vessel unemptied, taking taint by long standing in any one condition, and therefore God hath ordered it, that the soul as the Sea shall purge it sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And again presseth hard upon the Lord to shew himself for him against them that have no interest in his special and saving favour, (onely share in his common mercies) which he hath, and prizeth as an happiness above all,</p>

The Psalm is without title, and for the matter of it, drives on no one particular subject, but partly by the Psalmists own example, and partly by rule is represented what is requisit to enter a man into, and carrie him through a holy life, specially in an afflicted state;

This particular Psalm it is conceived was composed when the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> flourished, wherein he insists much upon the supremacie and empire of God over all in general, and his people in special, promising as high as he is to set God above him, confessing him onely to be great, that rules and does all by an Almighty power and greatness, consound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his enemies, and exercising all manner of grace to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and though just, yet beneficent, deserving praise from all, but his saints especially, who are under the covenant and Kingdom of grace, which hath been so powerfully administred in their behalfs, and shall continue to the end of the world, as it hath done from the beginning, for the preservation of his people by him, who is pitiful to the oppressed to right and raise them.
