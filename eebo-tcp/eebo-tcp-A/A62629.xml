            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſending Judgments upon a people</hi>; And that is <hi>to reclaim them from their ſins.</hi> This indeed is the intention of all Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſations towards us in this World. The end of all his mercies and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, is to take us off from ſin, and to oblige and win us to our duty: So the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4, That the deſign of Gods <hi>goodneſs, and long-ſuffering, and forbearance towards us,</hi> is, <hi>to lead us to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is the way wherein God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to deal with us. The way of Judgment and ſeverity is that which he is more averſe from, a courſe which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly takes with us, and not without ſome difficulty and reluctancy, <hi>He doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men:</hi> And were it not that we are ſuch perverſe Creatures as not to be wrought upon by kindneſs, ſo wild as not to be tamed by gentle uſage, God would not handle us in any other way. It is our obſtinacy and intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs to the methods of his goodneſs which conſtraineth, and almoſt forceth him againſt his inclination, to take the Rod into his hand, and to chaſtiſe us with it. He would draw us with <hi>the cords of love,</hi> and <hi>the bands of a man,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:37901:8"/>
(as he expreſſeth himſelf in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>), but we will not follow him: And therefore we provoke him to turn theſe Cords into whips, and to change the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle methods of his kindneſs into ways of harſhneſs and ſeverity.</p>
            <p>And yet when he comes to take this courſe with us, he ſtill, like a kind and tender-hearted Father, aims at our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage. He deſigns kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the ſons of men by all thoſe judgments which do not kill them, and cut them off from the opportunity and poſſibility of improving them. If he ſend Evils upon us, it is that thereby he may do us ſome greater good: If he afflict us, it is not becauſe it is pleaſant to him to deal harſhly with us, but becauſe it is profitable and neceſſary for us to be ſo dealt withall: And if at any time he imbitter our lives by miſeries and ſufferings, it is becauſe he is loth to ſee us periſh in pleaſant ways, and chuſeth rather to be ſomewhat ſevere towards us, than ſuffer us to be utterly undone.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Moſes</hi> declares to have been the great end of all the ſevere Providences of God towards the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in their long wandring in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and all the difficulties and hardſhips
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37901:8"/>
they were there exerciſed withall for the ſpace of forty years, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15, 16: <hi>Who led thee through that great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Wilderneſs, wherein were fiery Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Scorpions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the afflicting providences of God are not only apt in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to do us good, but which is a more expreſs argument of the Divine goodneſs, God intends and aims at this end by them: He does not ſend Judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Theatre of the World for his ſport and paſtime, nor ſet on one part of his Creation to bait another for his own diverſion: He does not, like ſome of the cruel <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, take pleaſure to exerciſe men with dangers, and to ſee them play bloody prizes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p>Nay, he does nothing that is ſevere out of humour and paſſion, as our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parents many times do. Indeed he is angry with us for our ſins; but yet ſo as ſtill to pity our perſons: And when his Providence makes uſe of any ſharp and cutting inſtruments, it is with this merciful deſign, to let out our corruption: If he caſt us into the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37901:9"/>
Furnace of affliction, it is that he may refine and purifie us from our droſs.</p>
            <p>So that though the Judgments of God be Evils in themſelves, yet conſidering the intention of God in them, they are no real objections againſt his goodneſs, but rather arguments for it; as will appear if we conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Judgments of God are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the cure of a far greater Evil of another kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are proper for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of far greater Evils of the ſame kind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They are not only proper to theſe Ends, but in many caſes very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>The Judgments of God are very proper for the cure of a far greater Evil of another kind</hi>; I mean the <hi>Evil of ſin.</hi> We take wrong meaſures of things, when we judg thoſe to be the greateſt Evils which afflict our bodies, wound our reputation, and impoveriſh our Eſtates. For thoſe certainly are far the greateſt, which affect our nobleſt Part; which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate our underſtandings, and deprave our wills, and wound and defile our ſouls. What corrupt humours are to the body, that ſin is to the ſouls of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37901:9"/>
men, their diſeaſe and their death.</p>
            <p>Now it is very agreeable with the goodneſs and mercy of the Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, to adminiſter to us whatever is proper for the cure of ſo great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. If we make our ſelves ſick, that is our own folly, and no fault of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian; but we are beholden to him if he recover us, though it be by very bitter and unpleaſing means. All tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judgments which are ſhort of Death, are properly Medicinal; and if we will but ſuffer them to have their kindly operation upon us, they will work a cure; and how grievous and diſtaſtful ſoever they may be for the preſent, they will prove mercies and bleſſings in the iſſue. Upon this account <hi>David</hi> reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons afflictions among the happy bleſſings of his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.72, <hi>It is good for me</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>that I have been afflicted</hi>; And he gives the reaſon of it in the ſame <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ver. 67, <hi>Before I was afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I went aſtray, but now have I learn'd thy precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that though all afflictions are Evils in themſelves, yet they are good for us; becauſe they diſcover to us our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, and tend to our cure: They are a ſenſible argument and conviction to us
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37901:10"/>
of the evil and danger of ſin. We are commonly ſuch <hi>fools</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, who <hi>make a mock of ſin</hi>; and like Children, will be playing with the edge of it till it cut and wound us: We are not ſufficiently ſenſible how great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil it is, till we come to feel the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal effects and conſequences of it. And therefore to rectify our apprehenſions concerning it, God makes us to ſuffer by it. Thus <hi>Elihu</hi> deſcribes to us the happy effect of afflictions upon ſinners, <hi>Job</hi> 36.8, 9, 10, <hi>If they be bound in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and held in cords of affliction, then God ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſion that they have exceeded. He openeth alſo their ear to diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from their iniquity.</hi> God doth but invite and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat us by his mercies, but his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have a more powerful and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandng voice. <hi>When he holds men in cords of affliction, then he openeth their ear to diſcipline.</hi> In our proſperity we are many times incapable of counſel and inſtruction; but when we are under Gods correcting hand, then are we fit to be ſpoken withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Judgments of God are likewiſe <hi>proper for the preventing of far
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37901:10"/>
greater evils of the ſame kind</hi>; I mean farther puniſhments. In ſending of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judgments upon ſinners, God u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually proceeds with them by degrees: Firſt he lets flye ſeveral ſingle ſhots at them, and if upon theſe they will take warning and come in, they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the broad-ſides and volleys of his wrath.</p>
            <p>But the great advantage of all is, that temporal Judgments may prove to us the opportunities of preventing the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unſpeakable torments of a long Eternity. For all Judgments which are not final, leaving men a ſpace of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, have in them the mercy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve, which by a ſerious and timely return to God, may be improv'd into a Pardon.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that adverſity and afflictions do uſually diſpoſe men, and put them into a fit temper for Repentance; They fix our minds, and make us ſerious, and are apt to awaken us to conſideration, and ſuggeſt to us ſuch thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations as theſe: If temporal evils be ſo grievous, how inſupportable then will be the extreme and endleſs torments of the next life? If in this day of Gods grace and patience we ſometimes meet
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37901:11"/>
with ſuch ſeverity, what may we not look for in the day of vengeance? If theſe drops of Gods wrath which now and then fall upon ſinners in this world, fill them with ſo much anguiſh and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, how deplorably miſerable will thoſe wretches be upon whom the ſtorms of his fury ſhall fall? Who would ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to continue in ſin, when the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſeries and calamities which we feel in this life, are but a ſmall and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable earneſt of thoſe woful wages which ſinners ſhall receive in the Day of Recompences?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Judgments of God are <hi>not only proper to theſe Ends, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes very neceſſary.</hi> Our condition many times is ſuch, as to require this ſevere way of proceeding, becauſe no other courſe that God hath taken, or can take with us, will probably do us good. God does not delight in the miſeries and calamities of his Creatures, but we put him upon theſe extremities; or rather his own goodneſs and wiſdom together, do prompt and direct him to theſe harſh and rigorous ways. May be we have brought our ſelves into that dangerous ſtate, and the malignity of our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſuch, that it is not to be remov'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37901:11"/>
without violent Phyſick; and that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be adminiſtred to us without making us deadly ſick.</p>
            <p>So that the Judgments of God which are many times <hi>abroad in the earth,</hi> are nothing elſe but the wiſe Methods which the great Phyſitian of the World uſes for the cure of Mankind; They are the Rods of his School, and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of his Providence, that <hi>the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the world may learn righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> They are a merciful invention of Heaven, to do men that good which many times nothing elſe will; and to work that bleſſed effect upon us, which neither the wiſe counſels and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods Word, nor his milder and gentler dealings with us can uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p>Thus we find in the <hi>Parable,</hi> Luk. 15. that the Providence of God makes uſe of hunger and extreme neceſſity to bring home the <hi>Prodigal</hi>; and by him our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour repreſents to us the temper of moſt ſinners: For till we have ſpent that ſtock of mercies which God hath given us, till we come to be pinch'd with want, and are <hi>ready to periſh,</hi> we are not apt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain thoughts of <hi>returning to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37901:12"/>It may be there are ſome ſinners which are more tractable and eaſie to be reduced to goodneſs, that are not ſo headſtrong and obſtinate in their way, but that they may be reclaimed by mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſofter means: But there are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a great many ſenſleſs and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinners, who are madly and furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent upon their own ruin: Now to treat theſe fairly, with the allurements of kindneſs, and the gentle arts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, would be to no purpoſe: The only way that is left of dealing with them, is rigour and ſeverity. When ſinners are thus beſides themſelves, ſome thing that looks like Cruelty is perhaps the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mercy that can be ſhown to them; nothing ſo proper for ſuch perſons as a dark Room, and a ſpare Diet, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Uſage; <hi>A Rod for the back of Fools,</hi> as the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
            <p>Thus have I done with the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I propounded to ſpeak to, <hi>namely, The merciful deſign and intention of God in ſending Judgments upon a People,</hi> which is, to bring them to Repentance, and by Repentance to prevent their Ruin. I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Reaſon of the continuance of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37901:12"/>
Gods Judgments, viz.</hi> becauſe the people were not reclaimed by them; therefore <hi>his anger is not turned away, but</hi> his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, becauſe <hi>the people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And how can it be expected it ſhould be otherwiſe; When incorrigibleneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Judgments of God is a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſo high a nature, a ſign of a moſt deprav'd and incorrigible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and an argument of the greateſt obſtinacy in evil? Upon this account we find that the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God in <hi>Scripture</hi> brands <hi>Ahaz</hi> as a ſingular and remarkable ſort of ſinner, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22.) becauſe, <hi>in the time of his diſtreſs he ſinned yet more againſt the Lord.</hi> The longer <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Judgments of God, the more ſtill they were harden'd, and the more they were plagu'd: <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.23, after God had there threatned his people with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſore Judgments for their ſins, he tells them, that if they <hi>will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by all theſe things,</hi> he will <hi>puniſh them ſeven times more,</hi> and after that, <hi>ſeven times more for their ſins:</hi> And if in ſuch a caſe the juſt God will puniſh ſeven times more, we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37901:13"/>
that ſins after Judgments are ſeven times greater.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28, after a long and dreadful Catalogue of Curſes there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in caſe of their diſobedience, God at laſt threatens them with a Forreign <hi>Enemy,</hi> that ſhould <hi>diſtreſs them in their gates</hi>; And if they would not be reclaim'd by all this, he tells them, That he hath ſtill more and greater Judgments for them in ſtore, <hi>v.</hi> 58, and 59, <hi>If thou wilt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to do all the words of this law, that thou mayeſt fear this great and glorious Name,</hi> THE LORD THY GOD, <hi>then the Lord will make thy Plagues won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.</hi> If we be of ſo ſtrange and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous a diſpoſition, as to grow worſe under Judgments, God will deal with us after an unuſual and prodigious manner, he will make our <hi>plagues wonderful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This incorrigible temper the <hi>Prophets</hi> of old every where make the great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of the ſin of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 1.4, 5, <hi>Ah ſinful Nation! a people laden with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>; and after a great many other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to ſet forth what heinous ſinners they were, he ſums up all in this, That they were ſo far from being reform'd by the ſeveral Judgments of God which had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37901:13"/>
been inflicted upon them, that they were the worſe for correction; <hi>Why ſhould they be ſtricken any more? they will revolt more and more.</hi> So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9, 10, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> though brought very low, is repreſented as of the ſame refractory temper, <hi>Strangers have devour'd his ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But they do not return to the Lord, nor ſeek him for all this.</hi> I will mention but one <hi>Text</hi> more (and methinks it bears but too near a reſemblance with our own condition, both in reſpect of the judgments which have been upon us, and our carriage under them,) <hi>Amos</hi> 4. where God upbraids his people ſeveral times with this, as the great aggravation of their ſins, That they continued impenitent under all thoſe terrible Judgments of God which had been upon them; <hi>I have ſent among you</hi> (ſays he) <hi>Famine</hi>; and then <hi>Peſtilence</hi>; and then the <hi>Sword</hi>; and laſt of all a terrible <hi>Fire</hi> which had almoſt utterly conſumed them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>I have overthrown ſome of you as I overthrew Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah, and ye were as a firebrand pluckt out of the burning: yet have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37901:14"/>
ye not return'd unto me.</hi> And becauſe all theſe Judgments had not been effectual to reclaim them, He tells them that he was reſolved to go on in puniſhing; and therefore he bids them to expect it, and prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it, <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael; and becauſe I will do this unto thee, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to meet thy God, O Iſrael.</hi> When God hath begun to puniſh a people, and they are not amended by it, the honour of his Juſtice is concern'd to proceed, and not to give over. By every ſin that we commit, we offend God; but if he ſmite us, and we ſtand out againſt him, then do we contend with him, and ſtrive for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. And when the ſinner is upon theſe ſtubborn and inſolent terms, then <hi>prepare to meet thy God</hi>; A bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Sarcaſme,</hi> as if man could be a match for God, and a poor weak creature in any wiſe able to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him to whom Power belongs. There's a ſevere expreſſion concerning Gods dealing with ſuch perverſe and obſtinate ſinners, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.26, <hi>With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37901:14"/>
froward,</hi> or, as the words may more properly and conveniently be render'd, <hi>with the froward thou wilt wreſtle.</hi> God will not be outbrav'd by the ſins of men; and therefore if we continue impeninent we have all the reaſon in the world to expect that God will go on to puniſh.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer to our ſelves, and to conſider our own caſe; which is in truth ſo very bad that we may almoſt be afraid to conſider it. The wiſe and good God, like a prudent and indulgent Father, hath uſed all the arts of his Providence towards this Nation, to reclaim us. He hath invited us to him by many bleſſings, but we would not come;<note rend="inter">Biſhop <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon.</hi>
               </note> ſo that (to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row an apt illuſtration from a great Divine of our own) we have forced him to deal with us as <hi>Abſalom</hi> did with <hi>Joab</hi>; he ſent one civil meſſage to him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another; but he would not come; at laſt he ſets on fire his Corn-field to try whether that would bring him: This courſe God hath taken with us; we would not be perſwaded by meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37901:15"/>
of kindneſs (by his many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and favours) to return to him, and therefore hath he ſent amongſt us the terrible meſſengers of his wrath. Firſt we were engag'd in a <hi>Foreign War</hi>; and though God was pleas'd to give us ſome conſiderable ſucceſs in it, yet it ſeems our provocations were ſo great, that he was reſolv'd to puniſh us. He was loth to let us <hi>fall into the hands of men</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took the work into his own hand, and puniſh'd us himſelf, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a Peſtilence</hi> amongſt us, the ſoreſt and moſt deſtructive that hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len this Nation for many Ages. But we did not upon this, return to him; and therefore his fierce anger kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fearful <hi>Fire</hi> amongſt us, which hath laid the honour of our Nation, one of the greateſt and richeſt Cities in the World in the duſt; and that by ſo ſudden and irreſiſtible, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and amazing a devaſtation as, in all the circumſtances of it is, ſcarce to be parallel'd in any Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but moſt of us were mightily affected with this Judgment
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37901:15"/>
whilſt it was upon us. So aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a calamity, could not but make us open our eyes a little, and awaken us to conſideration; Even the <hi>rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> though he had all his life-time been immers'd in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, yet could not but <hi>lift up his eyes when he was in Flames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely God expects, that ſuch Judgments as theſe ſhould not only rouze us a little for the preſent, but that they ſhould have a permanent operation and effect upon us, and work a thorough and laſting refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation amongſt us; but yet I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that this dreadful Fire hath had no other influence upon us, but what it uſes to have upon Metals, which are only melted by it for the preſent, but when the Fire is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they ſuddenly cool and return to their former hardneſs.</p>
            <p>One would have thought, that the ſenſe of ſuch a calamity as this, ſhould have remain'd longer upon us. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks God ſeem'd to ſay to us after this Judgment as he did once to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37901:16"/>
Zeph.</hi> 3.7, <hi>Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive inſtruction</hi>; but we (like them) have been but the more forward to provoke him, (<hi>they roſe early and corrupted their doings</hi>) we have after all this <hi>harden'd our hearts from his fear, and refuſed to return.</hi> And therefore God is now come to one of his laſt Judgments, <hi>Our Enemy diſtreſſeth us in our Gates.</hi> God hath begun to <hi>let us fall into the hands of men,</hi> and by giving our Enemies a ſudden and fatal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon us, hath ſmitten us with <hi>a Breach great as the Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were terrible calamities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to come ſo thick and ſo ſwiftly upon us, <hi>like deſolation, and as a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind.</hi> Such a quick ſucceſſion of Judgments, treading almoſt upon one anothers heels, does but too plainly declare that God is highly incens'd againſt us. For ſurely theſe are not the wounds of a Friend, but the terrible aſſaults of an Enemy. They do not look like the diſpleaſure of a Father, but the ſeverity of a Judg; not like <hi>viſitation,</hi> but like <hi>vengeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37901:16"/>And beſides theſe more viſible Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Nation, we are by a ſecret curſe of God inſenſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed in our riches and ſtrength. We are, I know not how, ſtrangely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſht in the midſt of plenty, and almoſt undone by victories. And which adds to our miſery, few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſeem to be ſufficiently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it, or to take any notice by what ſilent ſteps and impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible degrees (like gray hairs and the infirmities of old age) poverty and weakneſs are ſtealing in upon us; ſo that we may fitly apply to our ſelves, what the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſays of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, Hoſ.</hi> 7.9, <hi>Strangers have devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtrength, and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and yet he knoweth it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And our condition, as we are a <hi>Church,</hi> is not much better. How is this famous <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> of ours, which was once the admiration of her Friends, and the envy of her Enemies, ſunk and declin'd in her glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and reduc'd into a very narrow compaſs? So that ſhe is <hi>left</hi> like <hi>the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37901:17"/>
Daughter of Sion, (Iſa.</hi> 1.8.) <hi>as a Cottage in a Vineyard, as a Lodge in a garden of Cucumbers, as a beſieged City</hi>; ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and hem'd in on all parts, by the impudence of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> the inſolencies of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the turbulency of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; all which do every day viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and apace gain ground upon her, and diſtreſs her on every ſide; juſt as the condition of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church is deſcrib'd before my Text, <hi>The Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians before, and the Philiſtines behind, both ready to devour Iſrael with open mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely it is not for nothing that God hath brought us thus low, that he hath ſent all theſe Judgments upon us, and that he doth ſtill threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten us with more: The reaſon is plain, becauſe we are ſtill impenitent; <hi>the people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them.</hi> There hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an univerſal degeneracy amongſt us, and there is ſtill, I fear, a general impenitency, <hi>the people turneth not,</hi> &amp;c. Notwithſtanding all thoſe diſmal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which our eyes have ſeen, wickedneſs doth ſtill prevail in the Nation, and overflows it like a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37901:17"/>
mighty Deluge; ſo as to overſpread all Ranks and Orders of men: And not only ſo, but is grown impudent, and appears <hi>with a whores forehead</hi>; all kind of modeſty ſeems to have forſaken the ſinners of this Age.</p>
            <p>And is this Repentance? to live in filthy and abominable luſts, to teare the Name of God by horrid Oaths and Imprecations; to be Atheiſtical and prophane, and by an unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled boldneſs to turn the <hi>Word of God</hi> it ſelf, and the graveſt and moſt ſerious matters of Religion into <hi>Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery?</hi> This is not <hi>to turn to him that ſmiteth us,</hi> but to turn upon him and ſmite him again. And yet ſuch cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and clamorous ſins as theſe, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt come to be the garb and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nation, and to be aecoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the wit and gallantry of the Age.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Shall not God viſit for theſe things? ſhall not his ſoul be aveng'd on ſuch a Nation as this?</hi> Yes, he hath viſited; and 'tis for theſe things that <hi>the wrath of God</hi> hath been ſo manifeſtly <hi>revealed from Heaven</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37901:18"/>
us. For this cauſe, <hi>miſery and deſtruction</hi> have been <hi>in our ways, and the way of peace have we not known,</hi> becauſe there hath been <hi>no fear of God before our eyes.</hi> Hence it is, that <hi>God's anger is not turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill, becauſe the people turneth not to him that ſmiteth them, neither do they ſeek the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But do not we <hi>ſeek God</hi>? Do we not every day acknowledg our ſins to him, and pray that he would <hi>have mercy upon us miſerable offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>grant, that we may hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter live godly, righteous and ſober lives?</hi> Do not we <hi>ſeek the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> when we continually beg of him to ſave and <hi>deliver us from the hand of our enemies?</hi> Indeed we do thus <hi>ſeek</hi> him, but we ſhould firſt <hi>turn to him</hi>; otherwiſe, if we hope our prayers will prevail with God to do us good, we do but <hi>truſt in lying words.</hi> If we go on in our ſins, our very pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will <hi>become ſin,</hi> and encreaſe our guilt: For <hi>the prayer of the wicked</hi> (that is, of one that is reſolv'd to continue ſo) <hi>is an abomination to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37901:18"/>
Lord.</hi> Can we think it reaſonable for men to addreſs themſelves to God after this manner? <hi>Lord, though we have no mind to turn to thee, yet we pray thee turn away thine anger from us; though we are reſolv'd not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our ſins, yet we make no doubt but that thy mercy will forgive them: Give peace in our time, O Lord, that we may purſue our luſts ſecurely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſturbance: Deliver us, we pray thee, from the hands of our Enemies, that we may ſin againſt thee without fear all the days of our lives.</hi> Would it not be horrible impudence and impiety to put up any ſuch petitions to God? And yet this, I fear, is the moſt genuine interpretation of our prayers and lives compar'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And if this be our caſe, what can we expect? God may give us peace with our Enemies, but then he will find out ſome other way to puniſh us: For if we ſtill perſiſt in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm and Prophaneneſs, in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God and of his holy Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in our ſcorn and deriſion of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in our abominable luſts and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37901:19"/>
horrid impieties, what can we look for, but that God ſhould <hi>be angry with us until he have conſum'd us, and there be no eſcaping</hi>? Nothing can be a ſadder preſage of our ruin, than not to be reform'd by thoſe dreadful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God which have been upon us. This was that which brought fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> that they had held out ſo obſtinately againſt ſo many Judgments, and had been <hi>hardned under ten Plagues.</hi> To be impenitent after ſuch ſevere corrections, is to poyſon our ſelves with that which is intended for our Phyſick, and by a <hi>miraculous</hi> kind of obſtinacy to turn the <hi>Rods</hi> of God into <hi>Serpents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now perhaps ſome will be apt to ſay, That theſe are things fit for men of our <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> becauſe it is our Trade and we live by it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are ſo, things very fit to be ſaid, and withall very fit for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to conſider, who profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian, and who owns the belief of a God, and a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and another World. And if they be ſo, where is the fault? Is it,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37901:19"/>
that there is a peculiar Profeſſion of men whoſe proper work it is to tell men of their faults, and to perſwade them to reform? No, there is no harm in that neither. Is it then that they live by their Profeſſion, and yet would be believed? Yes, there lies the force of the objection. To which I ſhall only at preſent return this anſwer, That men do not argue thus in other caſes, where yet the reaſon ſeems to be the very ſame. In mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern their <hi>Bodies</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> the <hi>Phyſitian</hi> and the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer</hi> are believ'd, though it is verily thought that they live by their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions as well as we; why then ſhould men deal ſo partially and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equally only with their <hi>Souls</hi>? Were we not mov'd by better principles, and ſway'd by the arguments and conſiderations of another World, we might, for ought we know, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very whit as much advantage to our ſelves, ſuffer men to be quiet, and to ſleep on ſecurely in their ſins; If we did not believe our ſelves in theſe matters, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that we might with as much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37901:20"/>
gravity and confidence cry <hi>Peace, Peace, when there is no Peace,</hi> and flatter men with as much art, and with as good a grace as any of thoſe can do, who <hi>live delicately, and wear ſoft clothing?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>we believe</hi> the threatnings of God, and <hi>therefore do we ſpeak: We know the terrour of the Lord,</hi> and therefore we endeavour to <hi>perſwade men.</hi> And O! that we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to <hi>break off their ſins by righteouſneſs,</hi> and to <hi>turn every one from the evil of his way, and from the violence that is in his hands:</hi> And then, <hi>who can tell but God may turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger that we periſh not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The good God make us all wiſe, to know in this our day the things that belong to our peace, before they be hid from our eyes; and grant that we may all turn to him that hath ſmitten us, by Repentance and real Reformation of our lives; that God may be pleas'd to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37901:20"/>
turn away his Anger from us, and to ſtretch out his hand for our Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which we humbly beg of him for the ſake of Chriſt. To whom with the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which the Word of God and our own Reaſon offer to us to diſcourage us from ſin this is none of the leaſt conſiderable, that he that once engages in a vicious courſe is in danger to proceed in it, being inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly trained on from one degree of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs to another: ſo that the farther he advanceth, his retreat grows more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, becauſe he is ſtill puſhed on with a greater violence. All errour, as well of practiſe as of judgment, is endleſs; and when a man is once out of the way, the farther he ſhall go on the harder he
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37901:23"/>
will find it to return into the right way. Therefore there is great reaſon why men ſhould be often cautioned againſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of ſin: or if they have been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as to be engaged in a bad courſe, why they ſhould be warned to break it off pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently and without delay, leſt by degrees they be hardened in their wickedneſs, till their caſe grow deſperate and paſt remedy. And to this purpoſe is the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> advice here in the <hi>Text; Exhort one another dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which words I ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">1. Endeavour to repreſent to you the growing danger of ſin; and by what ſteps and degrees bad habits do inſenſibly gain upon men, and harden them in an evil courſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall from this conſideration take occaſion to ſhew what great reaſon and need there is to warn men of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and to endeavour to reſcue them out of it. And then</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſhall apply my ſelf to the duty here in the Text, of <hi>exhorting</hi> men with all earneſtneſs and importunity to reſiſt the beginnings of ſin; or if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37901:23"/>
entred upon a wicked courſe, to make haſte out of this dangerous ſtate; <hi>leſt any of you be hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to repreſent to you the growing danger of ſin; and by what ſteps and degrees bad habits do inſenſibly gain upon men, and harden them in an evil courſe. All the actions of men which are not natural, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from deliberation and choice, have ſomething of difficulty in them, when we begin to practiſe them; becauſe at firſt we are rude and unexerciſed in that way: but after we have practiſed them awhile, they become more eaſie: And when they are eaſie, we begin to take pleaſure in them: And when they pleaſe us, we do them frequently, and think we cannot repeat them too often: And by frequency of acts a thing grows into a habit: And a confirmed habit is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond kind of Nature: And ſo far as any thing is natural, ſo far it is neceſſary, and we can hardly do otherwiſe; nay, we do it many times when we do not think of it. For by vertue of a habit, a mans mind or body becomes pliable and encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch kind of actions as it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37901:24"/>
to, and does as it were ſtand bent and charged ſuch a way; ſo that being touched and awakened by the leaſt occaſion it breaks forth into ſuch or ſuch actions. And this is the natural progreſs of all habits indifferently conſidered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be good or bad.</p>
            <p>But vicious habits have a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and are of a quicker growth. For the corrupt nature of a man is a rank ſoil, to which vice takes eaſily, and wherein it thrives apace. The mind of man hath need to be prepared for piety and virtue; it muſt be cultivated to that end, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with great care and pains: But vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are weeds that grow wild and ſpring up of themſelves. They are in ſome ſort natural to the ſoil, and therefore they need not to be planted and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 'tis ſufficient if they be neglected and let alone. So that vice having this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from our nature, it is no wonder if occaſion and temptation eaſily draw it forth.</p>
            <p>But that we may take a more diſtinct account of the progreſs of ſin, and by what ſteps vice gains upon men, I ſhall mark out to you ſome of the chief and more obſervable gradations of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37901:24"/>1. Men begin with leſſer ſins. No man is perfectly wicked on the ſudden.<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Juven.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Sunt quaedam vitiorum elementa; there are certain rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vice,</hi> in which men are firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and then they proceed by degrees to greater and fouler crimes. For ſin hath its infancy and tender age, and its ſeveral ſtates of growth. Men are not ſo totally degenerate but at firſt they are aſhamed when they venture upon a known ſin, though it be but ſmall in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. Hence it is that at firſt men are very ſollicitous to palliate and hide their faults by excuſes; but after they have frequently committed them, and they grow too viſible to be concealed, then they will attempt to defend and maintain them; and from thence they come by degrees to take pleaſure in them, and in thoſe that do the ſame things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. After men have been ſome time ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in theſe leſſer ſins, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of theſe they are prepared and diſpoſed for greater: ſuch as lay waſte the conſcience, and offer more violence to the light and reaſon of their minds. By degrees a ſinner may grow to be ſo hardy as to attempt thoſe crimes which at firſt he could not have had the thought
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37901:25"/>
of committing without horrour. Like <hi>Hazael,</hi> who when he was told by the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> what barbarous cruelties he ſhould one day be guilty of towards the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when he ſhould come to be King of <hi>Syria,</hi> he abominated the very thought and mention of them; <hi>Is thy ſervant a dog that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi> and yet, for all this, we know he did it afterward. 'Tis true indeed when a ſinner is firſt tempted to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a more groſs and notorious ſin, his conſcience is apt to boggle and ſtart at it, he doth it with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and regret; the terrours of his own mind, and the fears of damnation, are very troubleſome to him: But this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wears off by degrees; and that which at firſt was difficult, does by frequent practice and long cuſtome become tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a man hath proceeded thus far, he begins to put off ſhame, one of the greateſt reſtraints from ſin which God hath laid upon humane nature. And when this curb once falls off, there is then but little left to reſtrain and hold us in. At firſt ſetting out upon a vicious courſe men are a little nice and delicate, like young Travellers, who at firſt are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37901:25"/>
at every ſpeck of dirt that lights up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; but after they have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, and have travelled a good while in foulways, it ceaſeth to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to them to be daſhed and beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After this, it is poſſible, men may come to approve their vices. For if mens judgments do not command their Wills and reſtrain their luſts it is great odds but in proceſs of time the vicious inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Wills will put a falſe byaſs upon their judgments: And then it is no wonder if men come to boaſt of their ſins, and to glory in their vices, when they are half perſwaded that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and commendable qualities. Thus much is certain in experience, that ſome men have gotten ſo perfect a habit of ſome ſins, as not to know and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice many times when they commit them: As in the caſe of ſwearing, which ſome men have ſo accuſtomed themſelves to, that without any conſideration they do of courſe put an oath or two into every ſentence that comes from them. And it hath been obſerved of ſome perſons that they have told an untruth ſo often, and averr'd it with ſo much confidence, till at laſt, forgetting that it was a lie at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37901:26"/>
firſt, they themſelves have in proceſs of time believed it to be true.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From this pitch of wickedneſs men commonly proceed to draw in others, and to make proſelytes to their vices. Now this ſignifies not only a great approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin, but even a fondneſs for it, when men are not content to ſin upon their own ſingle accounts, but they muſt turn zealous agents and factors for the Devil; become <hi>teachers</hi> of ſin and <hi>miniſters of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> and are factiouſly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to propagate together with their Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical principles their lewd practices, and to draw followers and Diſciples after them.</p>
            <p>And when they are arrived to this height, it is natural for them to hate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, and to reſiſt the means of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery; to quarrel againſt all the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that ſhall be offered to them, and to count thoſe their greateſt enemies who have ſo much courage and kindneſs as to deal plainly with them, and to tell them the truth. And then all the wiſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Gods Word, and the moſt gentle and prudent admonitions in the world, when they are tendered to ſuch perſons, ſerve only to provoke their ſcorn or their paſſion. And ſurely that man is in a ſad
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37901:26"/>
caſe, that is ſo diſpoſed that in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he will turn the moſt effectual means of his amendment into the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new and greater ſins.</p>
            <p>But that which renders the condition of ſuch perſons much more ſad and deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable is, that all this while God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his grace from them. For every degree of ſin cauſeth the Holy Spirit of God with all his bleſſed motions and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to retire farther from them: And not only ſo, but the Devil (that evil <hi>Spirit</hi> which the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, <hi>works effectually in the children of diſobedience</hi>) does according as men improve in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, get a greater and a more eſtabliſh'd dominion over them. For as they who are reclaimed from an evil courſe, are ſaid in <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>reſcued out of the ſnare of the Devil,</hi> and to be <hi>turned from the power of Satan unto God</hi>; So, on the other hand, the farther men advance in the ways of ſin, ſo much the farther they depart from God, from under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of his grace, and the care of his protection and providence; and they give the Devil, (who is not apt to neglect his advantages upon them) greater opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities every day to gain the firmer poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:37901:27"/>And thus, by paſſing from one degree of ſin to another, the ſinner becomes har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in his wickedneſs, and does inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly ſlide into that ſtate in which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miraculous grace of God he is like for ever to continue. For the mind of man, after it hath been long accuſtomed to evil, and is once grown old in vice, is almoſt as hard to be rectified, as it is to recover a body bowed down with age to its firſt ſtreightneſs. The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks of ſome that <hi>commit ſin with greedineſs,</hi> and <hi>that drink up iniquity as the Oxe drinketh up water,</hi> with a mighty appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and thirſt, as if they were not able to refrain from it. And to expreſs to us the miſerable condition of ſuch perſons, it repreſenteth them as perfect ſlaves to their vices, that have <hi>ſold</hi> themſelves to do wickedneſs, and <hi>are led captive by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at his pleaſure.</hi> And when men have brought themſelves to this paſs, they are almoſt under a fatal neceſſity of ſinning on. I do not believe that God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely predeſtinated any man to ruin; but by a long courſe of wilful ſins men may in a ſort predeſtinate themſelves to it, and chooſe wickedneſs ſo long till it almoſt become neceſſary; and till they have brought themſelves under all imaginable
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37901:27"/>
diſadvantages of contributing any thing towards their own recovery; being bound in the chains of their own wickedneſs, and held in the cords of their ſins: Nay, like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> not only bound by thoſe luſts which they have embraced, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe robbed of all their ſtrength where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould break looſe from thoſe bonds. God grant that none of us may ever have the woful experience of it: But I am horribly afraid it is too true, that a ſinner may arrive to that confirmed ſtate of impiety as almoſt totally to loſe his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do better: He may attain to that perfection in vice, as to continue to be a bad man upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly ſays <hi>Cato</hi> was virtuous,<note rend="inter">

Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his ſpots?</hi> It is the <hi>Scripture</hi> compariſon to ſet forth to us how hard a thing it is for a man to be brought to goodneſs, that hath been long accuſtomed to do evil. He that is thus deeply engaged and entangled in a bad courſe, will ſcarce ever have the heart and reſolution to break looſe from it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be forced violently out of it by ſome ſevere affliction, by a ſharp ſickneſs,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37901:28"/>
or by a terrible calamity, or by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent apprehenſions of death and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of a future Judgment. Nor will theſe be effectual neither to change ſuch a perſon, without an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Gods grace; which, conſidering the greatneſs and the continuance of his provocations, he hath very little reaſon to expect or hope God ſhould ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him. Wretched man! that haſt brought thy ſelf into this miſerable ſtate, out of which there is but juſt a poſſibility left of thy being reſcued: that haſt neglected thy diſeaſe ſo long, till it is almoſt too late to apply remedies: that haſt provoked God ſo far, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch a prodigious height, that thou haſt reaſon almoſt to deſpair both of his grace and aſſiſtance for thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and of his mercy for thy par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. I ſpeak not this to diſcourage e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the greateſt of ſinners from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Though their caſe be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difficult, yet it is not quite deſperate. For <hi>thoſe things which ſeem impoſſible with men, are poſſible with God.</hi> But I ſpeak it on purpoſe to ſtop ſinners in their courſe; and to diſcourage men from going on in ſin till they be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of it; and have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37901:28"/>
brought themſelves by inſenſible degrees, into that dangerous and difficult ſtate which I have all this while been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to you. I come now to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> thing I propounded, which was; from this conſideration to ſhew what great reaſon and need there is to warn men of this danger; and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reſcue them out of it. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> directs this precept to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>Exhort one another daily, leſt any of you be hardened through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin.</hi> That is, leſt you be harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by degrees, and be finally ruined. And ſurely, every man is concerned to do what in him lies to reſcue his brother from ſo imminent a danger; It is every ones place and duty to endeavour to ſave thoſe whom he ſees ready to periſh: Much more does it concern thoſe who are peculiarly ſet apart for this work; I mean, the Miniſters of Gods holy Word; whoſe proper office and buſineſs it is to <hi>exhort</hi> and <hi>warn every man day and night</hi>; who are <hi>ſet as watchmen to the houſe of Iſrael</hi>; and <hi>whoſe blood,</hi> in caſe any of them miſcarry through our neglect, <hi>ſhall be required at our hands.</hi> So that if we believe the threatnings of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37901:29"/>
God, which we declare to others; if we have any apprehenſion of the dreadful miſery of another world; if we have any ſenſe of our own duty and ſafety; if we have any pity for periſhing ſouls, we cannot but be very importunate with ſinners to look about them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their danger, and to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeriouſly of the miſerable event and iſſue of a wicked life: We cannot but be earneſt with them to <hi>break off their ſins, and to give glory to God by repentance, before darkneſs come, and their feet ſtumble upon the dark mountains.</hi> When we are convinced more fully than we can deſire, that <hi>miſery and deſtruction are in their ways</hi>; when we plainly ſee the <hi>evil day</hi> haſting toward them a-pace, and <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction coming upon them like a whirlwind</hi>; heaven above threatning them, and <hi>hell beneath moving her ſelf to meet them at their coming,</hi> can we poſſiby do leſs than to warn ſuch perſons to <hi>flee from the wrath which is to come,</hi> and out of a ſad apprehenſion of the danger that hangs over them, to caution them againſt it, and endeavour with all our might to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue them from the miſery which is ready to ſwallow them up? Indeed one would be apt to think it a very vain thing
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37901:29"/>
to diſſwade men from being miſerable; to uſe great vehemency of argument to hinder a man from leaping into a pit, or from running into the fire; to take great pains to argue a ſick man into a deſire of health, and to make a priſoner content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have his ſhackles knocked off, and to be ſet at liberty; one would think all this were perfectly needleſs: But yet we ſee in experience ſin is a thing of ſo ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a nature, as to make men inſenſible of their danger, although it be ſo near, and ſo terrible. It is not ſo with men in other caſes: When we labour of any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſtemper, it is much to find a man that is patient of his diſeaſe; but when our ſouls are mortally ſick, that we ſhould be contented with our condition, and fond of our diſeaſe, that we ſhould fight with our Phyſitian, and ſpurn at our remedy; this ſurely is the height of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, for men to be thus abſolutely bent upon their own ruin, and to reſolve to make away themſelves forever. And we who are the Meſſengers of God to men, muſt be born of the rocks, and have hearts <hi>harder than the nether milſtone,</hi> if we can patiently look on and endure to ſee men periſh, without uſing our utmoſt endeavour to ſave them. Therefore I ſhall in the</p>

            <p n="1">1. To perſwade thoſe who are yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of great crimes, to reſiſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of ſin, leſt it gain upon them by degrees.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To preſs and urge thoſe that are already entered upon a wicked courſe, that they would make haſte out of this dangerous ſtate; <hi>leſt,</hi> at laſt, <hi>they be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To perſwade thoſe who are yet in ſome meaſure innocent, to reſiſt the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of ſin leſt it gain upon them by degrees. Vice may eaſily be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at firſt. 'Tis like a ſlight diſeaſe; which is eaſie to be cured, but dangerous to be neglected. The firſt approaches of ſin and temptation are uſually very modeſt; but if they be not diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced they will ſoon grow upon us, and make bolder attempts. Every incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to ſin, every compliance with temptation is a going down the hill: While we keep our ſtanding we may command our ſelves; but if we once put our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37901:30"/>
ſelves into violent motion downward, we cannot ſtop when we pleaſe.</p>
            <q>Omne in praecipiti vitium ſtetit—</q>
            <p>
               <hi>All Vice ſtands upon a Precipice</hi>; and to engage in any ſinful courſe, is to run down the hill. And if we once let looſe the propenſions of our nature, we cannot ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the reins and govern them as we pleaſe: If we give way to <hi>preſumptuous ſins,</hi> they will quickly get <hi>dominion over us.</hi> It is much eaſier not to begin a bad courſe, than to put a ſtop to our ſelves after we have begun it. <hi>Stulta res eſt nequitiae modus.</hi>
               <note rend="inter">Seneca.</note> 'Tis a fond thing for a man to think to ſet bounds to himſelf in any thing that is bad; to reſolve to ſin in number, weight and meaſure, with great temperance and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and government of himſelf: That he will commit this ſin, and then give over; entertain but this one temptation, and after that he will ſhut the door and admit of no more. Our corrupt hearts when they are once in motion, they are like the raging ſea, to which we ſet no bounds, nor ſay to it <hi>hitherto thou ſhalt go and no further.</hi> Sin is very cunning and deceitful, and does ſtrangely gain upon
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37901:31"/>
men when they once give way to it. It is of a very bewitching nature, and hath ſtrange arts of addreſs and inſinuation: The giving way to a ſmall ſin does mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly prepare and diſpoſe a man for a greater: By giving way to one little vice after another, the ſtrongeſt reſolution may be broken. For though it be not to be ſnapt in ſunder at once, yet by this means it is untwiſted by degrees, and then 'tis eaſie to break it one thread after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis ſcarce imaginable of what force one ſinful action is to produce more: For ſin is very teeming and fruitful; and though there be no <hi>bleſſing</hi> annext to it, yet it does ſtrangely <hi>encreaſe and multiply.</hi> As there is a connexion of one virtue with another, ſo vices are linkt together, and one ſin draws many after it. When the Devil tempts a man to commit any wickedneſs, he does as it were lay a long train of ſins; and if the firſt temptation take, they give fire to one another. Let us then reſiſt the beginnings of ſin; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then we have moſt power, and ſin hath leaſt. This is the <hi>firſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To perſwade thoſe who are already engaged in a wicked courſe, to make haſte out of this dangerous ſtate. And there is no other way to get out of it but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37901:31"/>
that is, by a real change and reformation of our lives; for herein the nature of true repentance does conſiſt. And without this all the devices which men uſe, to get rid of the guilt of their ſins, are vain and to no purpoſe. 'Tis not to be done by a formal confeſſion and abſolution, nor by a long pilgrimage, nor by one of thoſe little Tickets from <hi>Rome,</hi> which they call <hi>Indulgences.</hi> A wiſe man would much ſooner perſwade himſelf that God would not at all puniſh the ſins of men, than that he would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them ſo eaſily, and receive great offenders to favour upon ſuch ſlight terms. Let us not deceive our ſelves; there is one plain way to Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> ſincere repentance, and a holy life; and there is no getting thither by tricks. And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this change of our lives, all our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and faſting, and humiliation for ſin, which at this ſeaſon we make profeſſion of, will ſignifie nothing. There is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent paſſage of the Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 34.25, 26, <hi>He that waſheth himſelf after the touching of a dead body, if he touch it again, what availeth his waſhing? ſo is it with a man that faſteth for his ſins, and goeth again and doth the ſame things, who will hear his prayer, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37901:32"/>
what doth his humbling profit him?</hi> There is this plain difference between trouble for ſin and repentance; ſorrow only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects ſins paſt, but repentance is chiefly preventive of ſins for the future: And God therefore requires that we ſhould be troubled for our ſins, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to leave them.</p>
            <p>And to oblige us to a vigorous and ſpeedy reſolution in this matter, let us conſider that we have engaged too far al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in a bad courſe; and that every day our retreat will grow more dangerous and difficult; that by our delays we make work for a ſadder and longer repentance, than that which we do now ſo ſtudiouſly decline: Let us conſider likewiſe, that our life is concerned in the caſe; that <hi>except we repent and turn, we ſhall die</hi>; and that the evil day may overtake us, while we are deliberating whether we ſhould avoid it or not: that vice is ſo far from being mortified by age, that by every days continuance in it we encreaſe the power of it; and ſo much ſtrength as we add to our diſeaſe, we certainly take from our ſelves: And this is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble weakning of us, when we do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe our own ſtrength, but the enemy gets it, and imploys it againſt us. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37901:32"/>
of ſin appears in nothing more than in keeping men off from this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work, and perſwading them to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all upon the unreaſonable hopes of the mercy of God, and the uncertain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a future repentance. I do not think there are any here but do either believe, or at leaſt are vehemently afraid that there is another life after this; and that a wicked life, without repentance, muſt unavoidably make them miſerable in another world; and that to caſt off all to a death-bed repentance, puts things upon a mighty hazard. And they have a great deal of reaſon to think ſo: For alas, how unfit are moſt men at ſuch a time for ſo great and ſerious a work as repentance is, when they are unfit for the ſmalleſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: And how hard is it for any man, then to be aſſured of the truth and reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his repentance, when there is no ſufficient opportunity to make trial of the ſincerity of it. I deny not the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the thing; but it is much to be feared that the repentance of a dying ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is uſually but like the ſorrow of a malefactor when he is ready to be turned off; he is not troubled that he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Law, but he is troubled that he muſt die. For when death is ready to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37901:33"/>
ſeiſe upon the ſinner, and he feels himſelf dropping into deſtruction, no wonder if then the mans ſtomack come down, and he be contented to be ſaved; and ſeeing he muſt ſtay no longer in this world, be deſirous to go to Heaven rather than Hell; and in order to that, be ready to give ſome teſtimonies of his repentance: no wonder if when the rack is before him, this extort confeſſion from him; and if in hopes of a pardon he make many large promiſes of amendment, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare his reſolurion of a new and better life. But then it is the hardeſt thing in the world to judg, whether any thing of all this that is done, under ſo great a fear and force, be real. For a ſick man as he hath loſt his appetite to the moſt pleaſant meats and drinks, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his ſinful pleaſures and fleſhly luſts are at the ſame time nauſeous to him; and for the very ſame reaſon: For ſickneſs having altered the temper of his body, he hath not at that time any guſt or rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh for theſe things. And now he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt ſin, juſt as a man that hath no ſtomach is reſolved againſt meat. But if the fit were over, and death would but raiſe his ſiege, and remove his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a little farther from him, it is to be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37901:33"/>
feared that his former appetite would ſoon return to him, and that he would ſin with the ſame eagerneſs he did before. Beſides, how can we expect that God ſhould accept of his repentance at ſuch a time; when we are conſcious to our ſelves, that we did reſolve to put off our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance till we could ſin no longer. Can we think it fit for any man to ſay thus to God in a dying hour;
<q>Lord, now the world leaves me, I come to thee. I pray thee give me eternal life, who could never afford to give thee one good day of my life: Grant that I may live with thee, and enjoy thee for ever, who could never endure to think upon thee. I muſt confeſs that I could never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to leave my ſins out of love to thee, but now I repent of them for fear of thee: I am conſcious to my ſelf that I would never do any thing for thy ſake; but yet I hope thy goodneſs is ſuch, that thou wilt forgive all the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of my life, and accept of this forced ſubmiſſion which I now make to thee. I pray thee do not at laſt fruſtrate and diſappoint me in this deſign which I have laid, of ſinning while I live, and getting to heaven when I die.</q>
Surely no man can think it fit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37901:34"/>
to ſay thus to God; and yet I am afraid this is the true interpretation of many a mans repentance who hath defer'd it till he comes to die. I do not ſpeak this to diſcourage repentance even at that time. It is always the beſt thing we can do. But I would by all means diſcourage men from putting off ſo neceſſary a work till then. 'Tis true indeed when 'tis come to this, and a ſinner finds himſelf going out of the world, if he have been ſo fooliſh and ſo cruel to himſelf, as to put things upon this laſt hazard; repentance is now the only thing that is left for him to do; this is his laſt remedy, and the only refuge he has to fly to: And this is that which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in this caſe ought by all means to put the man upon, and earneſtly to perſwade him to. But when we ſpeak to men in other circumſtances, that are well and in health, we dare not for all the world en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them to venture their ſouls upon ſuch an uncertainty. For to ſpeak the beſt of it, it is a very dangerous remedy; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when men have deſignedly contrived to rob God of the ſervice of their beſt days, and to put him off with a few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſighs and tears at the hour of death. I deſire to have as large apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the mercy of God as any man; but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37901:34"/>
withall, I am very ſure that he is the hardeſt to be impoſed upon of any one in the world. And no man that hath any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy apprehenſions of the Deity, can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him to be ſo eaſie, as to forgive men upon the laſt word and intimation of their minds; and to have ſuch a fondneſs for offenders as would reflect upon the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of any Magiſtrate and Governour upon earth. God grant that I may ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour to live a holy and virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life; and may have the comfort of that when I come to die: And that I may never be ſo unwiſe as to venture all my hopes of a bleſſed eternity upon a death-bed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
            <p>I will conclude all with thoſe excellent ſayings of the Son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> (Eccleſ. 5.6, 7.16.11, 12.18.21, 22, <hi>Say not, Gods mercy is great, and he will be pacified for the multitude of my ſins. For mercy and wrath is with him; he is mighty to forgive, and to pour out diſpleaſure: And as his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is great, ſo are his corrections alſo. Therefore make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day: For ſuddenly ſhall the wrath of the Lord come forth, and in thy ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thou ſhalt be deſtroyed. Humble thy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37901:35"/>
ſelf before thou be ſick, and in the time of ſins ſhew repentance. Let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vows in due time, and defer not till death to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.</hi>

               </note> tells us, That <hi>to ſave a man out of the fire, was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proverbial ſpeech.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that naturally ariſeth is this, <hi>That men may hold all the Fundamentals of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and yet may ſuperadd other things whereby they may greatly endanger their ſalvation.</hi> What thoſe things were, which ſome among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> built upon the foundation of Chriſtianity, whereby they endanger'd their Salvation, we may probably conjecture, by what the Apoſtle reproves in this Epiſtle, as the tolerating of <hi>inceſtuous marriages,</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in <hi>Idol-feaſts,</hi> &amp;c. And eſpecially by the doctrine of the falſe Apoſtles, who at that time did ſo much diſturb the peace of moſt Chriſtian Churches, and who are ſo often and ſo ſeverely reflected upon in this Epiſtle. And what their <hi>Doctrine</hi> was, we have an account <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>viz.</hi> that they impoſed upon the <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians, <hi>Circumciſion, and the obſervation of the Jewiſh Law,</hi> teaching, that <hi>unleſs they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, and kept the Law of Moſes, they could not be ſaved.</hi> So that they did not only build theſe Doctrines upon <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:37901:38"/>
but they made them equal with the <hi>Foundation,</hi> ſaying, that <hi>unleſs men belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and practiſed ſuch things, they could not be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to this <hi>Obſervation,</hi> I ſhall reduce my diſcourſe to theſe two Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall repreſent to you ſome <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which have been built upon the <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> to the great hazard and danger of mens <hi>ſalvation.</hi> And to be plain, I mean particularly by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall enquire, whether our grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>poſſibility</hi> of ſalvation (though with great hazard) to thoſe in the communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and their denying it to us, be a reaſonable argument and encouragement to any man to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that Church.</p>
            <p>And there is the more reaſon to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things, when ſo many <hi>ſeducing Spirits</hi> are ſo active and buſie to pervert men from the <hi>truth</hi>; and when we ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſo many and their <hi>Religion</hi> ſo eaſily parted. For this reaſon theſe two Conſiderations ſhall be the ſubject of the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> We will conſider ſome <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath built upon the <hi>foundation</hi> of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37901:39"/>
               <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> to the great hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of mens <hi>ſalvation.</hi> It is not denied by the moſt judicious <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do hold all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Chriſtian Faith which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation. But that which we charge upon them, as a juſt ground of our ſeparation from them, is, <hi>the impoſing of new Doctrines and Practices upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> which were never taught by our Saviour, or his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and which are either directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, or too apparently deſtructive of a good life. And I begin,</p>
            <p n="1">1. With their <hi>Doctrines.</hi> And, becauſe I have no mind to aggravate leſſer matters, I will ſingle out four or five points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which they have added to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and which were neither taught by our Saviour and his Apoſtles, nor own'd in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity. And the</p>
            <p>Firſt which I ſhall mention, and which being once admitted, makes way for as many errors as they pleaſe to bring in, is, their <hi>Doctrine of Infallibility.</hi> And this they are very ſtiff and peremptory in, though they are not agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, where this <hi>Infallibility</hi> is ſeated;
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37901:39"/>
whether in <hi>the Pope alone,</hi> or a <hi>Council alone,</hi> or <hi>in both together,</hi> or in <hi>the diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive body of Chriſtians.</hi> But they are ſure they have it, though they know not where it is.</p>
            <p>And is this no prejudice againſt it? can any man think, that this <hi>priviledg</hi> was at firſt conferred upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that Chriſtians in all Ages did believe it, and had conſtant recourſe to it, for determining their differences, and yet that that very Church, which hath enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and uſed it ſo long, ſhould now be at a loſs where to find it? Nothing could have fallen out more unluckily, than that there ſhould be ſuch differences among them, about that which they pretend to be the onely means of ending all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
            <p>There is not the leaſt intimation in Scripture of this <hi>priviledg</hi> confer'd upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; nor do the Apoſtles, in all their Epiſtles, ever ſo much as give the leaſt direction to Chriſtians to appeal to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> for a determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the many differences, which even in thoſe times happen'd among them. And it is ſtrange they ſhould be ſo ſilent in this matter, when there were ſo many <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to ſpeak of it, if our Saviour had
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37901:40"/>
plainly appointed ſuch an <hi>infallible Judg</hi> of controverſies, for this very end, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the differences that ſhould happen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Chriſtians. It is ſtrange, that the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> in their diſputes with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſhould never appeal to this <hi>Judg</hi>; nay, it is ſtrange they ſhould not conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it, in all caſes, it being ſo ſhort and expedite a way for the ending of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. And this very conſideration to a wiſe man is inſtead of a thouſand arguments, to ſatisfie him that in thoſe times no ſuch thing was believed in the world.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Doctrine of Infallibility,</hi> if it be not true, is of ſo much the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious conſequence to Chriſtianity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the conceit of it does confirm them that think they have it, in all their other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; and gives them a pretence of aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Authority to themſelves, to impoſe their own fancies and miſtakes upon the whole Chriſtian world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Doctrine</hi> about <hi>Repentance</hi>; Which conſiſts in confeſſing their ſins to the Prieſt; which if it be but accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any degree of <hi>contrition,</hi> does up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>abſolution</hi> received from the Prieſt put them into a ſtate of <hi>ſalvation,</hi> though they have lived the moſt lewd and debauched
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37901:40"/>
lives that can be imagin'd; than which nothing can be more plainly deſtructive of a good life. For if this be true, all the hazard that the moſt wicked man runs of his ſalvation, is only the danger of ſo <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a death</hi> as gives him no ſpace for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and abſolution. A caſe that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſo rarely, that any man that is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addicted to his luſts, will be content to venture his ſalvation upon this hazard; and all the arguments to a good life will be very inſignificant to a man that hath a mind to be wicked, when remiſſion of ſins may be had upon ſuch cheap terms.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Doctrine of Purgatory</hi>; By which they mean a ſtate of temporary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments after this life, from which men may be releaſed, and tranſlated into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by the prayers of the living, and the ſacrifice of the <hi>Maſs.</hi> That this Doctrine was not known in the primitive Church, nor can be proved from Scripture, we have the free acknowledgment of as learned and eminent men as any of that Church; which is to acknowledg that it is a ſuperſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture upon the Chriſtian Religion. And though in one ſenſe, it be indeed a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver</hi> upon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity, conſidering the vaſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37901:41"/>
revenues which this Doctrine (and that of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> which depends upon it) brings into that Church; yet I doubt not, but in the Apoſtles ſenſe, it will be found to be <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble.</hi> But how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoever it be, it is too gainful a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be eaſily parted withall.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> A hard <hi>word,</hi> but I would to God that were the worſt of it; the <hi>thing</hi> is much more difficult. I have taken ſome pains to conſider other Religions that have been in the world, and I muſt freely declare, that I never yet, in any of them, met with any Article or Propoſition, impoſed upon the belief of men, half ſo unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and hard to be believed as this is: And yet this, in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, is eſteemed one of the moſt principal Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian Faith; though there is no more certain foundation for it in Scripture, than for our Saviours being ſubſtantially changed into all thoſe things which are ſaid of him, as that he is a <hi>rock,</hi> a <hi>vine,</hi> a <hi>door,</hi> and a hundred other things.</p>
            <p>But this is not all. This Doctrine hath not only <hi>no certain Foundation</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but I have a far heavier charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, namely, that it undermines the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37901:41"/>
very foundation of Chriſtianity it ſelf· And ſurely nothing ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be a part of the <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> which deſtroys the <hi>reaſon</hi> of our belief of the whole. And that this Doctrine does ſo, will appear evidently, if we conſider what was the main argument which the Apoſtles uſed to convince the world of the <hi>truth of Chriſtianity</hi>; and that was this, <hi>That our bleſſed Saviour, the Author of this Doctrine, wrought ſuch and ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and particularly that he roſe again from the dead:</hi> And this they proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were eye-witneſſes of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and had ſeen him and converſed with him after he was riſen from the dead. But what if their ſenſes did deceive them in this matter? then it cannot be denied, but that the main proof of Chriſtianity falls to the ground.</p>
            <p>Well! We will now ſuppoſe (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does) <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to have been one principal part of the Chriſtian Doctrine, which the Apoſtles preached. But if this Doctrine be true, then all mens ſenſes are deceived in a plain ſenſible matter, wherein 'tis as hard for them to be deceived, as in any thing in the world: For two things can hardly be imagin'd more different, than a <hi>little bit</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37901:42"/>
of water, and the whole <hi>body</hi> of a man.</p>
            <p>So that the Apoſtles perſwading men to believe this Doctrine, perſwaded them not to truſt their ſenſes, and yet the argument which they uſed to perſwade them to this was built upon the direct contrary principle, that <hi>mens ſenſes are to be truſted.</hi> For if they be not, then notwithſtanding all the evidence the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles offer'd for the reſurrection of our Saviour, he might not be riſen; and ſo the faith of Chriſtians was vain. So that they repreſent the Apoſtles as abſurdly as is poſſible, <hi>viz.</hi> going about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men out of their ſenſes, by virtue of an argument, the whole ſtrength whereof depends upon the certainty of ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And now the matter is brought to a fair iſſue. If the teſtimony of <hi>ſenſe</hi> be to be relied upon, then <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is falſe: If it be not, then no man is ſure that Chriſtianity is true. For the utmoſt aſſurance that the Apoſtles had of the truth of Chriſtianity, was the teſtimony of their own ſenſes concerning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours miracles; and this teſtimony every man hath againſt <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> From whence it plainly follows, that no man (no not the Apoſtles themſelves) had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37901:42"/>
more reaſon to believe <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> to be true, than every man hath to believe <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation</hi> to be falſe. And we who did not ſee our Saviours Miracles (as the Apoſtles did) and have only a credible relation of them, but do ſee the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> have leſs evidence of the <hi>truth of Chriſtianity</hi> than of the <hi>falſhood</hi> of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But cannot God impoſe upon the ſenſes of men, and repreſent things to them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than they are? Yes, undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And if he hath revealed that he doth this, are we not to believe him? Moſt certainly. But then we ought to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that he hath made ſuch a Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which <hi>Aſſurance</hi> no man can have, the certainty of ſenſe being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>I ſhall preſs the buſineſs a little farther. Suppoſing the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> and that theſe words [<hi>This is my Body</hi>] if they be in Scripture, muſt neceſſarily be taken in the ſtrict and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe, I ask now, What greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence any man has, that theſe words [<hi>This is my Body</hi>] are in the Bible, than every man has that the Bread is not chang'd in the Sacrament? Nay no man has ſo much; for we have only the evidence of <hi>one</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:37901:43"/>
ſenſe that theſe words are in the Bible, but that the Bread is not chang'd we have the concurring teſtimony of <hi>ſeveral</hi> of our ſenſes. In a word, if this be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that the <hi>Senſes</hi> of all men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in one of the moſt plain ſenſible matters that can be, there is no certain means left either to convey or prove a <hi>Divine Revelation</hi> to men; nor is there any way to confute the groſſeſt impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures in the World: For if the clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all mans ſenſes be not ſufficient for this purpoſe, let any man, if he can, find a better and more convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I will inſtance but in one Doctrine more; And that ſhall be, their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>depoſing Kings</hi> in caſe of Hereſie, and abſolving their Subjects from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to them. And this is not a meer <hi>ſpeculative Doctrine,</hi> but hath been put in practice many a time by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> as every one knows that is vers'd in Hiſtory. For the troubles and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were occaſion'd by this very thing, make up a good part of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſeveral Ages.</p>
            <p>I hope no body expects that I ſhould take the pains to ſhew, that this was not the Doctrine of our Saviour and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37901:43"/>
nor of the Primitive Chriſtians. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> are many of them ſo far from pretending this, that in ſome times and places, when it is not ſeaſonable and for their purpoſe, we have much a-do to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them that ever it was their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. But if <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> be their Doctrine, <hi>this</hi> is; for they came both out of the ſame Forge, I mean the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> under Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. And if (as they tell us) <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> was then eſtabliſh'd, ſo was <hi>this.</hi> And indeed one would think they were Twins, and brought forth at the ſame time, they are ſo like one another, that is, both of them ſo monſtrouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come now in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, to conſider ſome <hi>Practices</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; which I am afraid will prove as bad as her <hi>Doctrines.</hi> I ſhall inſtance in theſe five.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their celebrating of their Divine ſervice <hi>in an unknown tongue.</hi> And that not only contrary to the practice of the primitive Church, and to the great end and deſign of Religious worſhip, which is the edification of thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, (and it is hard to imagine how men can be edified by what they do
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37901:44"/>
not underſtand) but likewiſe in direct contradiction to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who hath no leſs than a whole Chapter, wherein he confutes this practice as fully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns it as plainly, as any thing is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the whole Bible. And they that can have the face to maintain that this practice was not condemned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or that it was allowed and uſed in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, need not be aſhamed to ſet up for the defence of any paradox in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Communion <hi>in one kind.</hi> And that notwithſtanding, that even by their own acknowledgment, our Saviour inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it in both kinds, and the primitive Church adminiſtred it in both kinds. This I muſt acknowledg is <hi>no addition</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, but <hi>a ſacrilegious taking away</hi> of an eſſential part of the Sacrament. For the <hi>Cup</hi> is as eſſential a part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as the <hi>Bread</hi>; and they might as well, and by the ſame authority, take away the one as the other, and both as well as either.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Their worſhipping of <hi>Images.</hi> Which practice (notwithſtanding all their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions about it, which are no other but what the <hi>Heathens</hi> uſed in the ſame caſe) is as point-blank againſt the <hi>ſecond
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37901:44"/>
Commandment,</hi> as a <hi>deliberate</hi> and <hi>malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous killing</hi> of a man is againſt the <hi>ſixth.</hi> But if the caſe be ſo plain, a man would think that at leaſt the Teachers and Guides of that Church ſhould be ſenſible of it. Why, they are ſo, and afraid the people ſhould be ſo too; And therefore in their ordinary <hi>Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Manuals</hi> of Devotion, they leave out the <hi>ſecond Commandment,</hi> and divide the <hi>tenth</hi> into two to make up the number; leſt if the common people ſhould know it, their Conſciences ſhould ſtart at the doing of a thing ſo directly contrary to the plain command of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The worſhipping of the <hi>bread</hi> and <hi>wine</hi> in the Euchariſt, out of a falſe and groundleſs perſwaſion, <hi>that they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially changed into the body and blood of Chriſt.</hi> Which if it be not true (and it hath good fortune if it be, for certainly it is one of the moſt incredible things in the whole World) then by the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeveral of their own learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they are guilty of <hi>groſs idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The worſhip and invocation of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>; and particularly of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which hath now for ſome Ages been a principal part of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Now a man may juſtly wonder
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37901:45"/>
that ſo conſiderable a part of Religion, as they make this to be, ſhould have no manner of foundation in the Scripture. Does our Saviour any-where ſpeak one word concerning the worſhipping of Her? Nay, does he not take all occaſions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain all extravagant apprehenſions and imaginations concerning the honour due to Her, as foreſeeing the degeneracy of the Church in this thing? When he was told that his Mother and Brethren were without: <hi>Who</hi> (ſays he) <hi>are my mother and my brethren? He that doth the will of my Father, the ſame is my mother, and ſiſter, and brother.</hi> And when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man brake forth into that rapture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the bleſſed Mother of our Lord, <hi>Bleſſed is the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee ſuck!</hi> Our Saviour diverts to another thing, <hi>Yea rather, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are they that hear the word of God and keep it.</hi> Does either our Saviour or his Apoſtles in all their particular Precepts and directions concerning Prayer, and the manner of it, and by whom we are to addreſs our ſelves to God, give the leaſt intimation of praying to the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or making uſe of her Mediation? And can any man believe, that if this had been the <hi>practice</hi> of the Church from the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37901:45"/>
beginning, our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his Apoſtles would have been ſo ſilent about ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable a part of Religion; Inſomuch that in all the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles I do not remember that her Name is ſo much as once mentioned? And yet the worſhip of her is at this day in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath been ſo for ſeveral Ages, a main part of their publick worſhip, yea and of their private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions too; in which it is uſual with them to ſay <hi>ten Ave Maries</hi> for <hi>one Pater No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> that is, for one Prayer they make to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, they make ten addreſſes to the bleſſed Virgin; for that is the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obſerved in their <hi>Roſaries.</hi> He that conſiders <hi>this,</hi> and had never ſeen the <hi>Bible,</hi> would have been apt to think, that there had been more ſaid concerning <hi>Her</hi> in Scripture, than either concerning <hi>God,</hi> or our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi>; and that the New Teſtament were full from one end to the other of precepts and exhortations to the worſhipping of Her; and yet when all is done, I challenge any man to ſhew me ſo much as one ſentence in the whole Bible that ſounds that way. And there is as little in the Chriſtian Writers of the firſt three hundred years. The truth is, <hi>this practice</hi> began to creep in among
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37901:46"/>
ſome ſuperſtitious people about the middle of the <hi>fourth century</hi>; And I remember particularly, that <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who lived about that time, calls it the <hi>Hereſie of the Women.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have given you ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſeveral <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have built upon the Foundation of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> Much more might have been ſaid of them; but from what hath been ſaid, any man may eaſily diſcern how dangerous they are to the ſalvation of men.</p>
            <p>I proceed now in the Second place.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider, whether our granting <hi>a poſſibility of ſalvation,</hi> though with great hazard, to thoſe in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and their denying it to us, be a ſufficient argument and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to any man to quit our Church and go to theirs. And there is the more need to conſider this, becauſe this is the great <hi>popular argument,</hi> wherewith the <hi>emiſſaries</hi> and <hi>agents</hi> of that Church are wont to aſſault our people. <hi>Your Church</hi> (ſay they) <hi>grants that a Papiſt may be ſaved; Ours denies that a Proteſtant can be ſaved: therefore it is ſafeſt to be of our Church, in which ſalvation, by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of both ſides, is poſſible.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:37901:46"/>For anſwer to this, I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that this is ſo far from being a <hi>good argument,</hi> that it is ſo intolerably <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſophiſtical,</hi> that any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man ought to be aſham'd to be catch'd by it. For either it is good of it ſelf, and ſufficient to perſwade a man to relinquiſh our Church, and to paſs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to theirs, without entring into the merits of the cauſe on either ſide, and without comparing the Doctrines and Practiſes of both the Churches together, or it is not. If it be not ſufficient <hi>of it ſelf</hi> to perſwade a man to leave our Church, without comparing the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines on both ſides, then it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and there is nothing got by it. For if upon examination and comparing of Doctrines, the one appear to be <hi>true,</hi> and the other <hi>falſe,</hi> this alone is ſufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to any man to cleave to that Church where the true Doctrine is found; and then there is no need of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that this argument is good in it ſelf, without the examination of the Doctrines of both Churches; this ſeems a very ſtrange thing for any man to affirm, <hi>That it is reaſon enough to a man to be of any Church, whatever
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37901:47"/>
her Doctrines and Practices be, if ſhe do but damn thoſe that differ from her, and if the Church that differs from her do but allow a poſſibility of ſalvation in her Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But they who uſe this <hi>argument,</hi> pretend that it is ſufficient of it ſelf; and therefore I ſhall apply my ſelf to ſhew, as briefly and plainly as I can, the miſerable <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>inſufficiency</hi> of it, to ſatisfie any mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or prudence to change his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And to this end I ſhall,
<list>
                  <item>1. Shew the weakneſs of the <hi>principle</hi> upon which this <hi>argument</hi> relies.</item>
                  <item>2. Give ſome <hi>parallel inſtances</hi> by which it will clearly appear that it concludes falſe.</item>
                  <item>3. I ſhall take notice of ſome <hi>groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities</hi> that follow from it.</item>
                  <item>4. Shew how unfit it is to work upon thoſe to whom it is propounded. And</item>
                  <item>5. How improper it is to be urged by thoſe that make uſe of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall ſhew the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> upon which this <hi>argument</hi> relies; And that is this, <hi>That whatever different parties in Religion agree in, is ſafeſt to be choſen.</hi> The true conſequence of which <hi>principle,</hi> if it be driven to the head, is, to perſwade men to forſake Chriſtianity, and to make them take up in the principles of <hi>natural Religion,</hi> for in theſe all Religions do agree.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37901:47"/>
For if this <hi>principle</hi> be true, and ſignifie any thing, it is dangerous to embrace any thing wherein the ſeveral parties in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion differ; becauſe that only is ſafe and prudent to be choſen wherein all agree. So that this <hi>argument,</hi> if the foundation of it be good, will perſwade further than thoſe who make uſe of it deſire it ſhould do; for it will not only make men forſake the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> but <hi>Popery</hi> too; and which is much more conſiderable, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I will give ſome <hi>parallel inſtances,</hi> by which it will clearly be ſeen that this <hi>argument</hi> concludes falſe. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> denied the Baptiſm of the Catholicks to be good, but the <hi>Catholicks</hi> acknowledged the Baptiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> to be valid. So that both ſides were agreed, that the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was good; therefore the ſafeſt way for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> (according to this <hi>argument</hi>) was to be Baptized again by the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the acknowledgment of both ſides, Baptiſm among them was valid.</p>
            <p>But to come nearer to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Several in that Church hold <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Infallibility of the Pope, and the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of depoſing and killing Kings for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> to be <hi>de fide,</hi> that is, neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37901:48"/>
of Faith, and conſequently, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever does not believe them, cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But a great many <hi>Papiſts,</hi> though they believe theſe things to be no matters of Faith, yet they think thoſe that hold them may be ſaved, and they are generally very favourable towards them. But now, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this <hi>argument,</hi> they ought all to be of their opinion in theſe points, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both ſides are agreed, that <hi>they that hold them may be ſaved</hi>; but one ſide po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſays, that <hi>men cannot be ſaved if they do not hold them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Text furniſheth me with as good an inſtance to this purpoſe as can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. St. <hi>Paul</hi> here in the Text acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of thoſe <hi>who built hay and ſtubble upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity; that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> though with great difficulty, and, as it were, <hi>out of the fire.</hi> But now among thoſe builders with hay and ſtubble, there were thoſe who denied the poſſibility of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſalvation, and of thoſe who were of his mind. We are told of ſome who built the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Ceremonies and obſervances upon the foundation of Chriſtianity, and ſaid, that unleſs men were Circumciſed and kept the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> they could not be ſaved. So that by this argument St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:37901:48"/>
and his followers ought to have gone over to thoſe <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe it was acknowledged on both ſides that they might be ſaved. But theſe <hi>Judaizing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> were as uncharitable to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and other Chriſtians, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is now to us; for they ſaid poſitively, <hi>that they could not be ſaved.</hi> But can any man think, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have been mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this argument, to leave a ſafe and certain way of ſalvation, for that which was only poſſible, and that with great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and hazard? The argument, you ſee, is the very ſame, and yet it concludes the wrong way; which plainly ſhews, that it is a <hi>contingent argument,</hi> and concludes uncertainly and by chance, and therefore no man ought to be moved by it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall take notice of ſome <hi>groſs abſurdities</hi> that follow from it. I ſhall mention but theſe two:</p>
            <p n="1">1. According to this <hi>principle,</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſafeſt to be on the <hi>uncharitable ſide.</hi> And yet uncharitableneſs is as bad an evidence, either of a true Chriſtian, or a true Church, as a man would wiſh. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is one of the moſt eſſential marks of Chriſtianity; and what the Apoſtle ſaith of particular Chriſtians, is as true of whole Churches, that <hi>though they have all Faith,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37901:49"/>
yet if they have not Charity, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant that no Charity teacheth men to ſee others damned, and not to tell them the danger of their condition. But it is to be conſider'd, that the damning of men is a very hard thing; and therefore whenever we do it, the caſe muſt be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully plain. And is it ſo in this matter? They of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that we embrace all the Doctrines of our Saviour, contain'd in the Apoſtles Creed, and determined by the Four firſt General Councils: And yet they will not allow this, and a good life, to put us within a poſſibility of ſalvation, becauſe we will not ſubmit to all the innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they would impoſe upon us. And yet I think there is ſcarce any <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Practice</hi> in difference between them and us, which ſome or other of their moſt learned Writers have not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, either not to be ſufficiently contained in Scripture, or not to have been held and practiſed by the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; ſo that nothing can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe their uncharitableneſs towards us. And they pay dear for the little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage they get by this <hi>argument</hi>; for they do what in them lies, to make themſelves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37901:49"/>
no Chriſtians, that they may prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the truer and more Chriſtian Church; A <hi>medium</hi> which we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make uſe of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this <hi>argument</hi> were good, then by this trick a man may bring over all the world to agree with him in an error, which another does not account damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whatever it be; provided he do but damn all thoſe that do not hold it; and there wants nothing but <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> to do this. But is there any ſenſe, that another mans boldneſs and want of charity ſhould be an argument to move me to be of his opinion? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not illuſtrate this better, than by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a skilful Phyſician and a Mountebank. A <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>skilful Phyſician</hi> is modeſt, and ſpeaks <hi>juſtly</hi> of things: He ſays, that ſuch a method of cure which he hath directed is ſafe, and withall, that that which the <hi>Mountebank</hi> preſcribes, may poſſibly do the work, but there is great hazard and danger in it: But the <hi>Mountebank,</hi> who never talks of any thing leſs then <hi>infallible cures,</hi> (and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the more <hi>Mountebank,</hi> the ſtronger pretence to <hi>infallibility</hi>), he is <hi>poſitive</hi> that that method which the <hi>Phyſician</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes will deſtroy the patient, but his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37901:50"/>
receipt is infallible, and never fails. Is there any reaſon in this caſe, that this man ſhould carry it, meerly by his <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence?</hi> And yet if this <hi>argument</hi> be good, the ſafeſt way is to reject the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> advice, and to ſtick to the <hi>Mountebanks.</hi> For both ſides are agreed, that there is a poſſibility of cure in the <hi>Mountebank</hi>'s method, but not in the <hi>Phyſician</hi>'s; and ſo the whole force of the argument lies in the <hi>confidence</hi> of an <hi>ignorant man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. This <hi>argument</hi> is very unfit to work upon <hi>thoſe</hi> to whom it is propounded: For either they believe we ſay true in this, or not. If they think we do not, they have no reaſon to be moved by what we ſay. If they think we do, why do they not take in all that we ſay in this matter? Namely, that though it be poſſible for ſome in the communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be ſaved, yet it is very hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous; and that they are in a ſafe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already in our Church. And why then ſhould a <hi>bare poſſibility,</hi> accompany'd with infinite and apparent hazard, be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any man to run into that danger?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, This <hi>argument</hi> is very improper to be urged by thoſe who make uſe of it. Half of the ſtrength of it lies in this, that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37901:50"/>
we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> acknowledg, that <hi>it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible a Papiſt may be ſaved.</hi> But why ſhould they lay any ſtreſs upon this? What matter is it, what we Hereticks ſay, who are ſo damnably miſtaken in all other things? Methinks, if there were no other reaſon, yet becauſe we ſay it, it ſhould ſeem to them to be unlikely to be true. But I perceive, when it ſerves for their purpoſe we have ſome little credit and authority among them.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope every one is in ſome meaſure ſatisfied of the <hi>weakneſs of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> which is ſo tranſparent, that no wiſe man can honeſtly uſe it, and he muſt have a very odd underſtanding that can be cheated by it. The truth is, it is a <hi>caſual and contingent argument,</hi> and ſometimes it concludes right, and oftner wrong; and therefore no prudent man can be moved by it, except only in one caſe, when all things are ſo equal on both ſides, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the whole world to determine him; which ſurely can never happen in matters of Religion neceſſary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. No man is ſo weak, as not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in the change of his Religion, the <hi>merits</hi> of the <hi>cauſe it ſelf</hi>; as not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> of the Churches on both ſides; as not to take
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37901:51"/>
notice of the <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> of both Parties, together with all other things which ought to move a conſcientious and a prudent man: And if upon enquiry there appear to be a clear advantage on either ſide, then this <hi>argument</hi> is needleſs, and comes too late, becauſe the work is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done without it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that the great hazard of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare upon account of the <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> which I have mentioned) ought to deter any man much more from that Religion, than the acknowledged poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſalvation in it, ought to encourage any man to the embracing of it: Never did any Chriſtian Church build ſo much <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> upon the <hi>foundation</hi> of Chriſtianity; and therefore <hi>thoſe that are ſaved in it, muſt be ſaved,</hi> as it were, <hi>out of the fire.</hi> And though <hi>Purgatory</hi> be not meant in the Text, yet it is a Doctrine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſuted to their manner of building; for there is need of an <hi>ignis purgatorius,</hi> of a <hi>fire</hi> to try their work what it is, and to <hi>burn</hi> up their <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble.</hi> And I have ſo much Charity (and I deſire always to have it) as to hope, that a great many among them who live piouſly, and have been almoſt inevitably detain'd in that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37901:51"/>
Church by the prejudice of education and an invincible ignorance, will upon a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral repentance</hi> find mercy with God; and <hi>though their work ſuffer loſs and be burnt,</hi> yet <hi>they themſelves may eſcape, as out of the fire.</hi> But as for thoſe who have had the opportunities of coming to the knowledg of the truth, if they continue in the errors of that Church, or apoſtatize from the truth, I think their condition ſo far from being ſafe, that there muſt be extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favourable circumſtances in their caſe to give a man hopes of their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the <hi>two</hi> things I propounded to ſpeak to. And I am ſorry that the <hi>neceſſary defence</hi> of our Religion, againſt the <hi>reſtleſs importunities</hi> and <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts</hi> of our adverſaries upon all ſorts of perſons, hath engaged me to ſpend ſo much time in matters of diſpute, which I had much rather have employed in another way. Many of you can be my witneſſes, that I have conſtantly made it my buſineſs, in this great Preſence and Aſſembly, to plead againſt the <hi>impieties</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> of men; and have endeavour'd, by the beſt arguments I could think of, to gain men over to a <hi>firm belief</hi> and ſerious <hi>practice</hi> of the main things of Religion. And, I do aſſure you, I had much rather perſwade
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37901:52"/>
any one to be a good man, than to be of any party or denomination of Chriſtians whatſoever. For I doubt not, but <hi>the belief of the ancient Creed,</hi> provided we entertain nothing that is deſtructive of it, <hi>together with a good life, will certainly ſave a man</hi>; and without this no man can have reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hopes of ſalvation, no not in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church, if there were any ſuch to be found in the world.</p>
            <p>I have been, according to my opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, not a negligent obſerver of the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and humour of the ſeveral Sects and Profeſſions in Religion. And upon the whole matter, I do in my conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be the beſt conſtituted Church this day in the world; and that, as to the main, the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> of it, are excellently framed to make men <hi>ſoberly Religious:</hi> Securing men on the one hand, from the wild freaks of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi>; and on the other, from the groſs follies of <hi>Superſtition.</hi> And our Church hath this peculiar advantage above ſeveral Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that we know in the world, that it acknowledgeth a due and juſt ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>civil Authority,</hi> and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been untainted in its <hi>loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now ſhall every trifling conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37901:52"/>
be ſufficient to move a man to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh ſuch a Church? There is no greater diſparagement to a mans underſtanding, no greater argument of a light and ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mind, than raſhly to change ones Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. <hi>Religion</hi> is our greateſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all other, and it is not every <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle argument,</hi> no nor a great noiſe about <hi>infallibility,</hi> nothing but very <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>convincing evidence,</hi> that ſhould ſway a man in this caſe. But they are utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, who make a change of ſuch concernment, upon the inſinuations of one ſide only, without ever hearing what can be ſaid for the Church they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and brought up in, before they leave it. They that can yield thus eaſily to the impreſſions of every one that hath a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and intereſt to make <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> may at this rate of diſcretion change their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> twice a day, and inſtead of <hi>morning</hi> and <hi>evening Prayer,</hi> they may have a <hi>morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and an <hi>evening Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, for Gods ſake, and for our own Souls ſake, and for the ſake of our Reputation, let us conſider and <hi>ſhew our ſelves men</hi>; Let us not ſuffer our ſelves to be ſhaken and carried away with every wind; Let us not run our ſelves into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger when we may be ſafe. Let us ſtick to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37901:53"/>
the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> of our <hi>common belief,</hi> and build upon them gold, and ſilver, and precious ſtones, I mean, the <hi>virtues and actions of a good life</hi>; and if we would do this, we ſhould not be apt to ſet ſuch a value upon <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble.</hi> If we would ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live <hi>holy and virtuous lives,</hi> we ſhould not need to caſt about for a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> which may furniſh us with eaſie and indirect ways to get to Heaven.</p>
            <p>I will conclude all with the Apoſtles Exhortation; <hi>Wherefore, my beloved Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, be ye ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of peace, which brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd of the ſheep, by the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in every good work, to do his will; working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom he Glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N theſe words there are two things contained, The Deſcription of a good man, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of his goodneſs. 1. The Deſcription of a good man. He is ſaid to be one that <hi>loves the Law</hi> of God, that is, that loves to meditate upon it, and to practiſe it. 2. The Reward of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law.</hi> The word <hi>Peace</hi> is many times uſed in Scripture in a very large ſenſe, ſo as to comprehend all kind of happineſs: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignifies outward peace and quiet in oppoſition to war and contention; and ſometimes inward peace and contentment in oppoſition to inward trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. I underſtand the <hi>Text</hi> chiefly in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37901:55"/>
this laſt ſenſe, not wholly excluding either of the other.</p>
            <p>My deſign at preſent from theſe words is, to recommend Religion to men from the conſideration of that inward peace and pleaſure which attends it. And ſurely nothing can be ſaid more to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Religion in the opinion of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men than this. For the aim of all Philoſophy, and the great ſearch of wiſe men, hath been how to attain peace and tranquillity of mind. And if Religion be able to give this, a greater commendation need not be given to Religion.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon this Argument, I ſhall premiſe <hi>two</hi> things by way of Caution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe kind of Obſervations are not to be taken too ſtrictly and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, as if they never failed in any one inſtance. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved long ſince, that moral and proverbial ſayings are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be true generally and for the moſt part; and that is all the truth that is to be expected in them: As, when <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>Train up a child in the way wherein he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not depart from it:</hi> This is not to be ſo taken, as if no child that is piouſly educated did ever miſcarry afterwards, but that the good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of children is the beſt way to make good men, and commonly approved
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37901:55"/>
to be ſo by experience. So here, when it is ſaid that <hi>great peace have they that love Gods Law</hi>; the meaning is, that Religion hath generally this effect, though in ſome caſes, and as to ſome perſons, it may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally hindered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When I ſay that Religion gives peace and tranquillity to our minds, this is chiefly to be underſtood of a Religious ſtate, in which a man is well ſettled and confirmed, and not of our firſt entrance into it, for that is more or leſs troubleſome according as we make it. If we begin a religious courſe betimes, before we have contracted any great guilt, and before the habits of ſin be grown ſtrong in us, the work goes on eaſily, without any great conflict or reſiſtance. But the caſe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe when a man breaks off from a wicked life, and becomes religious from the direct contrary courſe, in which he hath been long and deeply engaged. In this caſe no man is ſo unreaſonable as to deny, that there is a great deal of ſenſible trouble and difficulty in the making of this change; but when it is once made, peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort will ſpring up by degrees, and daily encreaſe, as we grow more confirmed and eſtabliſhed in a good courſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>two</hi> things being premiſed, I ſhall now endeavour to ſhew, that Religion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37901:56"/>
gives a man the greateſt pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of mind, and that there is no true peace, nor any comparable pleaſure to be had in a contrary courſe. And that from theſe two heads. From <hi>Teſtimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; and from the <hi>Nature of Religion,</hi> which is apt to produce peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of mind.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt,</hi> From <hi>Teſtimony of Scripture.</hi> I ſhall ſelect ſome of thoſe <hi>Texts</hi> which are more full and expreſs to this purpoſe, <hi>Job</hi> 22.21, ſpeaking of God, <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf now with him, and be at peace. To acquaint our ſelves with God,</hi> is a phraſe of the ſame importance with <hi>coming to God,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking of him,</hi> and many other like expreſſions in Scripture, which ſignifie nothing elſe but to become religious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.38, <hi>Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace:</hi> Or, as theſe words are rendred, according to the LXX. in our old Tranſlation, <hi>Keep innocency, take heed to the thing that is right, for that ſhall bring thee peace at the laſt.</hi> Prov. 3.17, Where <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which with him is but another name for <hi>Religion,</hi> ſays, <hi>Her ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace.</hi> Iſa. 32.17; <hi>The work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi> Matt. 11.28, 29, <hi>Come unto me all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37901:56"/>
ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Now <hi>to come to Chriſt,</hi> is to become his Diſciples, to believe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe his Doctrine; for ſo our <hi>Saviour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf in the next words; <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, and ye ſhall find reſt for your ſouls.</hi> Rom. 2.10, <hi>Glory and honour and peace to every man that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And on the contray; the <hi>Scripture</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the condition of a ſinner to be full of trouble and diſquiet. <hi>David,</hi> though he was a very good man, yet when he had grievouſly offended God, the anguiſh of his mind was ſuch, as even to diſorder and diſtemper his body, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.2, 3, 4, <hi>Thine arrows ſtick faſt in me, and thy hand preſſeth me ſore; there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger, neither is there any reſt in my bones, becauſe of my ſin; for mine iniquities are gone over mine head, and as an heavy burthen they are too heavy for me.</hi> Iſa. 57.20, 21, <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt; there is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.7.8, <hi>Miſery and deſtruction are in their paths, and the way of peace they know not; they have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves crooked paths, whoſoever goeth therein ſhall not know peace.</hi> Rom. 2.9, <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37901:57"/>You ſee how full and expreſs the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is in this matter. I come now in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> place, To give you a more particular account of this, from the <hi>Nature of Religion,</hi> which is apt to produce peace and tranquillity of mind. And that I ſhall do in theſe three particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Religion is apt to remove the chief cauſes of inward trouble and diſquiet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It furniſheth us with all the true cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of peace and tranquillity of mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The reflection upon a religious courſe of life, and all the actions of it, doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yield great pleaſure and ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, Religion is apt to remove the chief cauſes of inward trouble and diſquiet.</hi> The chief cauſes of inward trouble and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent are theſe <hi>two, Doubting</hi> and anxiety of mind, and <hi>Guilt</hi> of Conſcience. Now Religion is apt to free us from both theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>Doubting</hi> and anxiety of mind. Irreligion and Atheiſm makes a man full of doubts and jealouſies whether he be in the right, and whether at laſt things will not prove quite otherwiſe than he hath raſhly determined. For though a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour never ſo much to ſettle himſelf in the principles of Infidelity, and to perſwade his mind that there is no God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that there are no rewards to be hoped for, nor puniſhments to be feared
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37901:57"/>
in another life; yet he can never attain to a ſteddy and unſhaken perſwaſion of theſe things: And however he may pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with witty reaſonings againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon belief of mankind, and ſmart repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their arguments, and bold and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant raillery about theſe matters; yet I dare ſay, no man ever ſate down in a clear and full ſatisfaction concerning them. For when he hath done all that he can to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon himſelf out of Religion, his conſcience ever and anon recoyls upon him, and his natural thoughts and apprehenſions riſe up againſt his reaſonings, and all his wit and ſubtilty is confuted and born down by a ſecret and ſtrong ſuſpicion, which he can by no means get out of his mind, that things may be otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon hereof is plain, becauſe all this is an endeavour againſt nature, and thoſe vigorous inſtincts which God hath planted in the minds of men to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For whenever our minds are free, and not violently hurried away by paſſion, nor blinded by prejudice, they do of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves return to their firſt and moſt natural apprehenſions of things. And this is the reaſon why, when the Atheiſt falls into any great calamity, and is awakened to an impartial conſideration of things, by the apprehenſion of death and judgment, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37901:58"/>
deſpairs of enjoying any longer thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for the ſake of which he hath all this while rebelled againſt Religion, his courage preſently ſinks, and all his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fail him, and his caſe is now too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to admit of jeſting, and at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his ſoul he doubts of all that which he aſſerted with ſo much confidence, and ſet ſo good a face upon before; and can find no eaſe to his mind, but in retreating from his former principles, nor no hopes of conſolation for himſelf, but in acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that God whom he hath denied, and imploring his mercy whom he hath affronted.</p>
            <p>This is always the caſe of theſe perſons when they come to extremity; not to mention the infinite checks and rebukes, which their own minds give them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſions; ſo that 'tis very ſeldom that theſe men have any tolerable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves, but are forced to run away from themſelves into company, and to ſtupify themſelves by intemperance, that they may not feel the fearful twitches and gripings of their own minds.</p>
            <p>Whereas he who entertains the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion, and therein follows his own natural apprehenſions, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral voice of mankind, and is not conſcious to himſelf, that he knowingly and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37901:58"/>
lives contrary to theſe principles, hath no anxiety in his mind about theſe things; being verily perſwaded they are true, and that he hath all the reaſon in the world to think ſo; And if they ſhould prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (which he hath no cauſe to ſuſpect) yet he hath this ſatisfaction, that he hath taken the wiſeſt courſe, and hath conſulted his own preſent peace and future ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, infinitely better than the Atheiſt hath done, in caſe he ſhould prove to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For it is a fatal miſtake to think there is no God, if there be one; but a miſtake on the other hand hath no future bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences depending upon it; nor indeed any great preſent inconvenience, Religion only reſtraining a man from doing ſome things, from moſt of which it is good he ſhould be reſtrained however: ſo that at the worſt, the religious man is only miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but the Atheiſt is miſerable if he be miſtaken: <hi>miſerable</hi> beyond all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and paſt all remedy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another, and indeed a principal cauſe of trouble and diſcontent to the minds of men is <hi>Guilt.</hi> Now Guilt is a conſciouſneſs to our ſelves that we have done amiſs; and the very thought that we have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs is apt to lie very croſs in our minds, and to cauſe great anguiſh and confuſion. Beſides that Guilt is always attended with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37901:59"/>
Fear, which naturally ſprings up in the mind of man from a ſecret apprehenſion of the miſchief and inconvenience that his ſin will bring upon him, and of the vengeance that hangs over him from God, and will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertake him either in this world, or the other.</p>
            <p>And though the ſinner, while he is in full health and proſperity, may make a ſhift to divert and ſhake off theſe fears; yet they frequently return upon him, and upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very little noiſe of danger, upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of any calamity that comes near him, his guilty mind is preſently jealous that it is making towards him, and is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly levelled againſt him. For he is ſenſible that there is a juſt power above him, to whoſe indignation he is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally liable, and therefore he is always in fear of him; and how long ſoever he may have ſcaped puniſhment in this world, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but dread the vengeance of the other; And theſe thoughts are a continual diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance to his mind, and <hi>in the midſt of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter make his heart heavy</hi>; And the longer he continues in a wicked courſe, the more he multiplies the grounds and cauſes of his fears.</p>
            <p>But now Religion frees a man from all this torment, either by preventing the cauſe of it, or directing to the cure; either
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37901:59"/>
by preſerving us from guilt, or clearing us of it in caſe we have contracted it. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves us from guilt by keeping us inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and in caſe we have offended, it clears us of it, by leading us to repentance and the amendment of our lives; which is the onely way to recover the favour of God, and the peace of our own conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to ſecure us againſt all apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of danger from the divine Juſtice; though not abſolutely from all fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in this world, yet from that which is the great danger of all, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and torment of the world to come. And by this means a man's mind is ſetled in perfect peace, Religion freeing him from thoſe tormenting fears of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine diſpleaſure, which he can upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms rid himſelf of; whereas the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is always ſowing the ſeeds of trouble in his own mind, and laying a foundation of continual diſcontent to himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Religion removes the chief grounds of trouble and diſquiet, ſo it <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to us all the true cauſes of peace and tranquillity of mind.</hi> Whoever lives accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of Religion, lays theſe three great foundations of peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is ſatisfied that in being religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous he doth that which is moſt reaſonable.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37901:60"/>2. That he ſecures himſelf againſt the greateſt miſchiefs and dangers, by making God his Friend.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That upon the whole matter he do's in all reſpects moſt effectually conſult and promote his own intereſt and happineſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He is ſatisfied that he does that which is moſt reaſonable. And it is no ſmall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be juſtified to our ſelves, to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that we are what we ought to be, and do what in reaſon we ought to do; that which beſt becomes us, and which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the primitive intention of our Being is moſt natural, for whatever is natural is pleaſant. Now the practice of piety towards God, and of every other grace and virtue which Religion teacheth us, are things reaſonable in themſelves, and what God when he made us, intended we ſhould do. And a man is then pleaſed with himſelf, and his own actions, when he doth what he is convinced he ought to do; and is then offended with himſelf, when he goes againſt the light of his own mind, by neglecting his duty, or doing contrary to it; for then his conſcience checks him, and there is ſomething within him that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, and puts him into diſorder; As when a man eats or drinks any thing that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom, it offends his ſtomach. and puts his body into an unnatural and a reſtleſs ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:37901:60"/>For every thing is then at reſt and peace, when it is in that ſtate in which Nature intended it to be; and being violently forced out of it, it is never quiet till it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it again. Now Religion and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of its virtues, is the natural ſtate of the ſoul, the condition to which God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it. As God made man a Reaſonable creature, ſo all the acts of Religion are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſuitable to our nature: And our ſouls are then in health, when we are what the Laws of Religion require us to be, and do what they command us to do. And as we find an unexpreſſible eaſe and pleaſure when our body is in its perfect ſtate of health, and on the contrary every diſtemper cauſeth pain and uneaſineſs; ſo is it with the ſoul. When Religion go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all our inclinations and actions, and the temper of our minds, and the courſe of our lives is conformable to the precepts of it, all is at peace. But when we are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and live in any vitious practice, how can there be peace, ſo long as we act unreaſonably, and do thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we neceſſarily create trouble and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to our ſelves? How can we hope to be at eaſe, ſo long as we are in a ſick and diſeaſed condition? Till the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in us be wrought out, our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits will be in a perpetual tumult and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37901:61"/>
and it is as impoſſible for us to enjoy the peace and ſerenity of our minds, as it is for a ſick man to be at eaſe: He may uſe what arts of diverſion he will, and change from one place and poſture to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but ſtill he is reſtleſs, becauſe there is that within him which gives him pain and diſturbance. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi> Such men may diſſemble their condition, and put on the face and appearance of pleaſantneſs and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but God, who ſees all the ſecrets of mens hearts, knows it is far otherwiſe with them. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another ground of peace which the religious man hath, is, That he hath made God his Friend. Now Friendſhip is peace and pleaſure both; It is mutual love, and that is a double pleaſure; And it is hard to ſay which is the greateſt, the pleaſure of loving God, or of knowing that he loves us. Now whoever ſincerely endeavours to pleaſe God, may reſt perfectly aſſured that God hath no diſpleaſure againſt him; for <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, and his countenance ſhall behold the upright,</hi> that is, he will be favourable to ſuch perſons. As <hi>he hates the workers of iniquity,</hi> ſo <hi>he takes pleaſure in them that fear him, in ſuch as keep his covenant and remember his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to do them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:37901:61"/>And being aſſured of his favour, we are ſecured againſt the greateſt dangers and the greateſt fears; and may ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Return then unto thy reſt, O my ſoul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee: The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear; The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> What can reaſonably trouble or diſcontent that man who hath made his peace with God, and is reſtored to his favour, who is the beſt and moſt powerful friend, and can be the ſoreſt and moſt dangerous enemy in the whole World?</p>
            <p n="3">3. By being religious we do moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually conſult our own intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. A great part of Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in moderating our appetites and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and this naturally tends to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of our minds. He that lives piouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and virtuouſly acts according to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in ſo doing maintains the preſent peace of his own mind; and not only ſo, but he lays the foundation of his future happineſs to all Eternity. For Religion gives a man the hopes of eternal life: And all pleaſure does not conſiſt in preſent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; there is a mighty pleaſure alſo, in the firm belief and expectation of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good; and if it be a great and a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, it will ſupport a man under a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:37901:62"/>
great many preſent evils. If Religion be certainly the way to avoid the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and to bring us to happineſs at laſt, we may contentedly bear a great many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for its ſake. For though all ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be grievous, yet it is pleaſant to eſcape great dangers, and to come to the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mighty good, though it be with great difficulty and inconvenience to our ſelves. And when we come to heaven (if ever we be ſo happy as to get thither) it will be a new and a greater pleaſure to us, to remember the pains and troubles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we were ſaved and made happy.</p>
            <p>So that all theſe, put together, are a firm foundation of peace and comfort to a good man. There is a great ſatisfaction in the very doing of our duty, and acting rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably, though there may happen to be ſome preſent trouble and inconvenience in it. But when we do not only ſatisfie our ſelves in ſo doing, but likewiſe pleaſe him whoſe favour is better than life, and whoſe frowns are more terrible than death; when in doing our duty we directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our own happineſs, and in ſerving God do moſt effectually ſerve our own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, what can be imagined to miniſter more peace and pleaſure to the mind of man?</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>ſecond thing.</hi> Religion furniſheth us with all the true cauſes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:37901:62"/>
of peace and tranquillity of mind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, The Reflection upon a religious and virtuous courſe of life doth afterwards yield a mighty pleaſure and ſatisfaction.</hi> And what can commend Religion more to us, than that the remembrance of any pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and virtuous action gives us ſo much contentment and delight? So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficulty and reluctancy we may find in the doing of it, to be ſure, there is peace and ſatisfaction in the looking back upon it. No man ever reflected upon himſelf with regret for having done his duty to God or man; for having lived ſoberly, or righteouſly, or godly in this preſent world. Nay, on the contrary, the conſcience of any duty faithfully diſcharged, the memory of any good we have done, does refreſh the ſoul with a ſtrange kind of pleaſure and joy. <hi>Our rejoycing is this</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) the teſtimony of our conſciences, that in all ſimplicity and godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, on the other ſide, the courſe of a vicious life, all acts of impiety to God, of malice and injuſtice to men, of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and exceſs in reference to our ſelves, do certainly leave a ſting behind them. And whatever pleaſure there may be in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent act of them, the memory of them is ſo tormenting, that men are glad to uſe all
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37901:63"/>
the arts of diverſion to fence off the thoughts of them. One of the greateſt troubles in the world to a bad man is to look into himſelf, and to remember how he hath lived. I appeal to the conſciences of men whether this be not true.</p>
            <p>And is not here now a mighty difference between theſe two courſes of life; that when we do any thing that is good, if there be any trouble in it, it is ſoon over, but the pleaſure of it is perpetual: when we do a wicked action, the pleaſure of it is ſhort and tranſient, but the trouble and ſting of it remains for ever? The reflection upon the good we have done, gives a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfaction to our minds; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of any evil committed by us leaves a perpetual diſcontent.</p>
            <p>And, which is yet more conſiderable, a religious and virtuous courſe of life does then yield moſt peace and comfort, when we moſt ſtand in need of it; in times of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and at the hour of death. When a man falls into any great calamity, there is no comfort in the world like to that of a good conſcience: This makes all calm and ſerene within, when there is nothing but clouds and darkneſs about him. So <hi>David</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of the good man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the upright there ariſeth light in darkneſs.</hi> All the pious and virtuous actions that we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37901:63"/>
do, are ſo many ſeeds of peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſown in our conſciences, which will ſpring up and flouriſh moſt in times of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble and diſtreſs. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous, and gladneſs for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in heart.</hi> And, at the hour of death, <hi>The righteous hath hopes in his death,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> And what a ſeaſonable refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is it to the mind of man, when the pangs of death are ready to take hold of him, and he is juſt ſtepping into the other world, to be able to look back with ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction upon a religious and well-ſpent life? Then, if ever, the comforts of a good man do overflow, and a kind of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſprings up in his mind, and he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the hopes of the glory of God. And that is a true and ſolid comfort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which will ſtand by us in the day of adverſity, and ſtick cloſe to us when we have moſt need of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But with the ungodly it is not ſo:</hi> His guilt lies in wait for him eſpecially againſt ſuch times, and is never more fierce and raging than in the day of diſtreſs; ſo that according as his troubles without are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, ſo are his ſtings within. And ſurely affliction is then grievous indeed, when it falls upon a galled and uneaſie mind. Were it not for this, outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions might be tolerable; the <hi>ſpirit of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37901:64"/>
a man might bear his infirmities, but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at the hour of death. How does the guilt of his wicked life then ſtare him in the face? What ſtorms and tempeſts are raiſed in his ſoul? which make it like the troubled ſea when it cannot reſt. When Eternity, that fearful and amazing ſight, preſents it ſelf to his mind, and he feels himſelf ſinking into the regions of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is every moment in a fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of meeting with the juſt reward of his deeds; with what regret does he then remember the ſins of his life? and how full of rage and indignation is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf for having neglected to know, when he had ſo many opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of knowing them, the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to his peace; and which, becauſe he hath neglected them, are now, and likely to be for ever, hid from his eyes?</p>
            <p>And if this be the true caſe of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and wicked man, I need not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply words, but may leave it to any mans thoughts, in which of theſe conditions he would be. And ſurely the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is ſo very plain, that there can be no difficulty in the choice.</p>
            <p>But now, though this diſcourſe be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, yet for the full clearing of this matter, it will be but fair to conſider what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37901:64"/>
may be ſaid on the other ſide; And the rather, becauſe there are ſeveral objections which ſeem to be countenanced from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which is enough to overthrow the moſt plauſible ſpeculation. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That wicked men ſeem to have a great deal of pleaſure and contentment in their vices.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Religion impoſeth many harſh and grievous things, which ſeem to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with that pleaſure and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I have ſpoken of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That thoſe who are religious, are many times very diſconſolate and full of trouble.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>firſt.</hi> I deny not that wicked men have ſome pleaſure in their vices; but when all things are rightly computed, and juſt abatements made, it will amount to very little. For it is the loweſt and meaneſt kind of pleaſure, it is chiefly the pleaſure of our bodies and our ſenſes, of our worſt part; the pleaſure of the beaſt, and not of the man; that which leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, and which we were leaſt of all made for. Thoſe ſenſual pleaſures which are lawful, are much inferiour to the leaſt ſatisfaction of the mind; and when they are unlawful, they are always inconſiſtent with it. And <hi>what is a man profited,</hi> if to gain a little ſenſual pleaſure, he loſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37901:65"/>
the peace of his ſoul? Can we find in our hearts to call that pleaſure, which robs us of a far greater and higher ſatisfaction than it brings? The delights of ſenſe are ſo far from being the chief pleaſure for which God deſigned us, that, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he intended we ſhould take our chief pleaſure in the reſtraining and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating of our ſenſual appetites and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and in keeping them within the bounds of Reaſon and Religion.</p>
            <p>And then, It is not a laſting pleaſure. Thoſe fits of mirth which wicked men have, how ſoon are they over? Like a ſudden blaze, which after a little flaſh and noiſe is preſently gone. It is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of a very great and experienced man in theſe matters, <hi>Like the crackling of thorns under a pot</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon), ſo is the laughter of the fool,</hi> that is, the mirth of the wicked man; it may be loud, but it laſts not.</p>
            <p>But, which is moſt conſiderable of all, the pleaſures of ſin bear no proportion to that long and black train of miſeries and inconveniences which they draw after them. Many times, poverty and reproach, pains and diſeaſes upon our bodies, <hi>indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil.</hi> So that if theſe pleaſures were greater than
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37901:65"/>
they are, a man had better be without them, than purchaſe them at ſuch dear rates.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>ſecond.</hi> That Religion impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth many harſh and grievous things, which ſeem to be inconſiſtent with that pleaſure and ſatisfaction I have ſpoken of: As, the bearing of perſecution, repentance and mortification, faſting and abſtinence, and many other rigours and ſeverities. As to perſecution; This Diſcourſe doth not pretend that Religion exempts men from outward troubles, but that, when they happen, it ſupports men under them, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any thing elſe. As for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and mortification; this chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns our firſt entrance into Religion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wicked life, which I acknowledged, in the beginning of this diſcourſe, to be very grievous: But this doth not hinder, but that though Religion may be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome at firſt to ſome perſons, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins and crimes have made it ſo, it may be pleaſant afterwards when we are accuſtomed to it. And whatever the trouble of repentance be, it is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs we reſolve to be miſerable; for <hi>except we repent we muſt periſh.</hi> Now there is always a rational ſatisfaction in ſubmitting to a leſs inconvenience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy and prevent a greater. As for Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37901:66"/>
and abſtinence; which is many times very helpful and ſubſervient to the ends of Religion, there is no ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary trouble in it, if it be diſcreetly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, as is worth the ſpeaking of. And as for other rigours and ſeverities, which ſome pretend Religion does impoſe, I have only this to ſay, that if men will play the fool, and make Religion more troubleſome than God hath made it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help that: And, that this is a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Religion, which ſome in the world have made, as if it did chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not in pleaſing God, but in diſpleaſing and tormenting our ſelves. This is not to paint Religion like her ſelf, but rather like one of the <hi>Furies,</hi> with nothing but whips and ſnakes about her.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>third.</hi> That thoſe who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious are many times very diſconſolate and full of trouble. This, I confeſs, is a great Objection indeed, if Religion were the cauſe of this trouble; but there are other plain cauſes of it, to which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, rightly underſtood, is not acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As, falſe and miſtaken principles in Religion. The imperfection of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and obedience to God. And a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly temper and diſpoſition. <hi>Falſe and miſtaken principles in Religion.</hi> As this for one; That God does not ſincerely
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37901:66"/>
deſire the ſalvation of men, but hath from all eternity effectually barr'd the greateſt part of mankind from all poſſibility of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that happineſs which he offers to them; and every one hath cauſe to fear that he may be in that number. This were a melancholly conſideration indeed, if it were true; but there is no ground either from Reaſon or Scripture to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any ſuch thought of God. Our <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is of our ſelves</hi>; and no man ſhall be ruined by any decree of God, who does not ruin himſelf by his own fault.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, <hi>the imperfection of our Religion and obedience to God.</hi> Some, perhaps, are very devout in ſerving God, but not ſo kind and charitable, ſo juſt and honeſt in their dealings with men. No wonder if ſuch perſons be diſquieted; the natural conſciences of men being not more apt to diſquiet them for any thing, than for the neglect of thoſe moral duties, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light teacheth them. Peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is the effect of an impartial and univerſal obedience to the laws of God; and I hope no man will blame Religion for that which plainly proceeds from the want of Religion.</p>
            <p>Or laſtly. <hi>A melancholly temper and diſpoſition</hi>; which is not from Religion, but from our nature and conſtituion, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37901:67"/>
therefore Religion ought not to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with it.</p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavoured, as brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly as I could, to repreſent to you what peace and pleaſure, what comfort and ſatisfaction, Religion, rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and ſincerely practiſed, is apt to bring to the minds of men. And I do not know by what ſort of Argument Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can be more effectually recommended to wiſe and conſiderate men. For in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading men to be religious, I do not go about to rob them of any true pleaſure and contentment, but to direct them to the very beſt, nay indeed the onely way of attaining and ſecuring it.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak this in great pity and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe who make it their great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to pleaſe themſelves, but do grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſtake the way to it. The direct way is that which I have ſet before you, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and virtuous life, <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly and righteouſly and godly in this preſent world. A good man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) is ſatisfied from himſelf:</hi> He hath the pleaſure of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wiſe, and acting reaſonably; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of being juſtified to himſelf in what he doth, and of being acquitted by the ſentence of his own mind. There is a great pleaſure in being innocent, becauſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37901:67"/>
that prevents guilt and trouble; It is pleaſant to be virtuous and good, becauſe that is to excel many others; and it is pleaſant to grow better, becauſe that is to excel our ſelves: Nay, it is pleaſant even to mortifie and ſubdue our luſts, becauſe that is Victory: It is pleaſant to command our appetites and paſſions, and to keep them in due order, within the bounds of Reaſon and Religion, becauſe this is a kind of Empire, this is to govern. It is naturally pleaſant to rule and have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over others, but he is the great and the abſolute Prince who commands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This is <hi>the Kingdom of God within us,</hi> a dominion infinitely to be preferred before all <hi>the Kingdoms of this world, and the glory of them.</hi> It is <hi>the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,</hi> deſcribed by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> which conſiſts <hi>in righteouſneſs and peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In a word; The pleaſure of being good and of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, is the chief happineſs of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>But now the wicked man deprives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all this pleaſure, and creates per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſcontent to his own mind. O the torments of a guilty conſcience! which the ſinner feels more or leſs all his life long. But, alas, thou doſt not yet know the worſt of it, no not in this World.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37901:68"/>
What wilt thou do when thou comeſt to die? What comfort wilt thou then be able to give thy ſelf? or what comfort can any one elſe give thee? when thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is miſerably rent and torn, by thoſe waking furies, which will then rage in thy breaſt, and thou knoweſt not which way to turn thy ſelf for eaſe; then, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at laſt, the Prieſt is unwillingly ſent for, to patch up thy conſcience as well as he can, and to appeaſe the cryes of it; and to force himſelf out of very pity and good nature, <hi>to ſay, peace, peace, when there is no peace.</hi> But alas man! what can we do? what comfort can we give thee, when thine iniquities teſtifie againſt thee to thy very face? <hi>How can there be peace,</hi> when thy luſts and debaucheries, thy impieties to God and thy injuries to men, have been ſo many? <hi>How can there be peace,</hi> when thy whole life hath been a continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and provocation of Almighty God, and a perpetual violence and affront to the light and reaſon of thy own mind?</p>
            <p>Therefore whatever temptation there may be in ſin at a diſtance, whatever pleaſure in the act and commiſſion of it, yet remember that it always goes off with trouble, and <hi>will be bitterneſs in the end.</hi> Thoſe words of <hi>Solomon</hi> have a terrible
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37901:68"/>
ſting in the concluſion of them, <hi>Rejoyce O young man in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes; but know, that for all theſe things God will bring thee into judgment.</hi> This one thought which will very often unavoidably break into our minds (that <hi>God will bring us into judgment</hi>) is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to daſh all our contentment, and to ſpoil all the pleaſure of a ſinful life. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect to be quiet in thine own mind, and to have the true enjoyment of thy ſelf, till thou liveſt a virtuous and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life.</p>
            <p>And if this diſcourſe be true (as I am confident I have every mans conſcience on my ſide) I ſay, if this be true, let us venture to be wiſe and happy, that is, to be Religious. Let us reſolve to <hi>break off our ſins by repentance,</hi> to <hi>fear God and keep his Commandments,</hi> as ever we deſire to avoid the unſpeakable torments of a guilty mind, and would not be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally uneaſie to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Grant we beſeech thee, Almighty God, that we may every one of us know and do in this our day the things that belong to our peace, before they be hid from our eyes.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37901:69"/>
And the God of peace which brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd of the ſheep, by the blood of the everlaſting Covenant, make us perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in us always that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom be glory for ever and ever.</hi> Amen.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE two great cauſes of the ruin of men, are <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>want of conſideration.</hi> Some do not believe the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Religion, or at leaſt have by arguing againſt them rendered them ſo doubtful to themſelves, as to take away the force and efficacy of them: But theſe are but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37901:71"/>
ſmall part of mankind, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe who periſh for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering theſe things. For moſt men take the principles of Religion for granted, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> and a <hi>Providence,</hi> and a <hi>State of Rewards and Puniſhments after this life,</hi> and never entertained any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable doubt in their minds to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: But for all this, they never attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the proper and natural conſequences of theſe principles, nor applyed them to their own caſe; They never ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the notorious inconſiſtency of their lives with this belief, and what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons they ought to be who are verily perſwaded of the truth of theſe things.</p>
            <p>For no man that is convinced that there is a God, and conſiders the neceſſary and immediate conſequences of ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, can think it ſafe to affront Him by a wicked life: No man that believes the infinite happineſs and miſery of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and conſiders withall that one of theſe ſhall certainly be his portion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he demeans himſelf in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, can think it indifferent what courſe he takes. Men may thruſt away theſe thoughts, and keep them out of their minds for a long time; but no man that enters into the ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37901:71"/>
of theſe matters, can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly think it a thing indifferent to him whether he be happy or miſerable for ever.</p>
            <p>So that a great part of the evils of mens lives would be cured, if they would but once lay them to heart; would they but ſeriouſly conſider the conſequences of a wicked life, they would ſee ſo plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſo urgent a neceſſity for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of it, that they would not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to continue any longer in it. This courſe <hi>David</hi> took here in the Text, and he found the happy ſucceſs of it; <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words there are theſe two things conſiderable.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The ſucceſs of this courſe. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced actual and ſpeedy reformation; <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies; I made haſte and delayed not to keep thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the two heads of my fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe; which when I have ſpoken to, I ſhall endeavour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37901:72"/>
my ſelf and you to take the ſame courſe which <hi>David</hi> here did, and God grant that it may have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We will conſider <hi>the courſe which</hi> David <hi>here took</hi> for the reforming of his life; <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> or, as the words are rendered in our old Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>I called mine own ways to remembrance.</hi> And this may either ſignifie a general ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and examination of his life, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferently the good or bad actions of it: Or elſe, which is more probable, it may ſpecially refer to the ſins and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of his life; <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> that is, I called my ſins to remembrance. Neither of theſe ſenſes can be much amiſs in order to the effect mentioned in the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives; and therefore neither of them can reaſonably be excluded, though I ſhall principally inſiſt upon the later.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This <hi>thinking of our ways</hi> may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a general ſurvey and examination of our lives, reſpecting indifferently our good and bad actions. For <hi>Way</hi> is a Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical word, denoting the courſe of a mans life and actions. <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> that is, I examined my life, and called
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37901:72"/>
my ſelf to a ſtrict account for the actions of it; I compared them with the Law of God, the rule and meaſure of my duty, and conſidered how far I had obeyed that Law, or offended againſt it; how much evil I had been guilty of, and how little good I had done, in compariſon of what I might and ought to have done: That by this means I might come to underſtand the true ſtate and condition of my ſoul, and diſcerning how many and great my faults and defects were, I might amend whatever was amiſs, and be more careful of my duty for the future.</p>
            <p>And it muſt needs be a thing of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe, for men to ſet apart ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular times for the examination of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they may know how accounts ſtand between God and them. <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> (or whoever were the Author of thoſe <hi>golden verſes</hi> which paſs under his name) doth eſpecially recommend this practice to his Scholars, every night before they ſlept, to call themſelves to account for the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the day paſt; enquiring wherein they had tranſgreſſed, what good they had done that day, or omitted to do. And this no doubt is an admirable means to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove men in vertue, a moſt effectual way to keep our conſciences continually wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and tender, and to make us ſtand in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37901:73"/>
awe of our ſelves, and afraid to ſin, when we know before-hand that we muſt give ſo ſevere an account to our ſelves of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action.</p>
            <p>And certainly it is a great piece of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to make up our accounts as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as we can, that our repentance may in ſome meaſure keep pace with the errors and failings of our lives, and that we may not be oppreſſed and confounded by the inſupportable weight of the ſins of a whole life falling upon us at once; and that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at the very worſt time, when we are ſick and weak, and have neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding nor leiſure to recollect ourſelves, and to call our ſins diſtinctly to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, much leſs to exerciſe any fit and proper acts of repentance for them. For there is nothing to be done in Religion when our Reaſon is once departed from us; then darkneſs hath overtaken us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and <hi>the night is come when no man can work.</hi> But though we were never ſo ſenſible, and ſhould do all we can at that time, yet after all this, how it will go with us God alone knows. I am ſure it is too much preſumption for any man to be confident that one general and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed act of repentance will ſerve his turn for the ſins of his whole life. Therefore there is great reaſon why we ſhould often
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37901:73"/>
examine our ſelves, both in order to the amendment of our lives, and the eaſe of our conſciences when we come to dye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>thinking of our ways</hi> may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and ſpecially refer to the ſins and miſcarriages of our lives: <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> that is, I called my ſins to remembrance; I took a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the errors of my life, and laid them ſeriouſly to heart; I conſidered all the circumſtances and conſequences of them, and all other things belonging to them; and reaſoning the matter through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with my ſelf, came to a peremptory and fixed reſolution of breaking off this wicked courſe of life, and betaking my ſelf to the obedience of God's Laws. And the <hi>conſideration of our ways</hi> taken in this ſenſe (which ſeems to be the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable meaning of the Words) may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably imply in it theſe following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The taking of a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our ſins, together with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumſtances and aggravations of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A hearty trouble and ſorrow for them; <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> that is, I laid them ſadly to heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſerious conſideration of the evil and unreaſonableneſs of a ſinful courſe.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:37901:74"/>4. A due ſenſe of the fearful and fatal conſequences of a wicked life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A full conviction of the neceſſity of quitting this courſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. An apprehenſion of the poſſibility of doing this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The taking of a particular account of our ſins, together with the ſeveral circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and aggravations of them.</hi> And to this end, we may do well to reflect particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly upon the ſeveral ſtages and periods of our lives, and to recollect at leaſt the principal miſcarriages belonging to each of them. And the better to enable us hereto, it will be uſeful to have before our eyes ſome abridgement or ſummary of the Laws of God, containing the chief heads of duties and ſins, of vertues and vices; For this will help to bring many of our faults and neglects to our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which otherwiſe perhaps would have been forgotten by us. We ſhould likewiſe conſider the ſeveral relations wherein we have ſtood to others, and how far we have tranſgreſſed or failed of our duty in any of thoſe reſpects.</p>
            <p>And having thus far made up our ſad account, we may in a great meaſure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the number and greatneſs of our ſins; abating for ſome particulars which are ſlipp'd out of our memory, and for
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37901:74"/>
ſins of ignorance, and dayly infirmities, which are innumerable. By all which we may ſee, what vile wretches and grievous offenders we have been: eſpecially if we take into conſideration the ſeveral heavy circumſtances of our ſins, which do above meaſure aggravate them; the heinouſneſs of many of them, as to their nature, and the injurious conſequences of them to the perſon, or eſtate, or reputation of our neighbour; their having been committed againſt the clear knowledg of our duty, againſt the frequent checks and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our conſciences, telling us when we did them that we did amiſs; againſt ſo many motions and ſuggeſtions of Gods Holy Spirit, ſo many admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs from others; and contrary to our own moſt ſerious vows and reſolutions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed at ſeveral times, eſpecially upon the receiving of the bleſſed Sacrament, and in times of ſickneſs and diſtreſs: and all this notwithſtanding the plaineſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods will to the contrary, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the terrors of the Lord, and the wrath of God revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men; notwithſtanding the cruel ſufferings of the Son of God for our ſins, and the moſt merciful offers of pardon and reconciliation in his blood: Add to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37901:75"/>
this the ſcandal of our wicked lives to our holy Religion, the ill example of them to the corrupting and debauching of others, the affront of them to the Divine Authority, and the horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of them to the mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and patience of God, to which we have ſuch infinite obligations. Thus we ſhould ſet our ſins in order before our eyes, with the ſeveral aggravations of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A hearty <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> for ſin; <hi>I thought on my ways,</hi> that is, I laid my ſins ſadly to heart. And ſurely whenever we remember the faults and follies of our lives, we cannot but be inwardly touched and ſenſibly grieved at the thoughts of them; we cannot but hang down our heads, and ſmite upon our breaſts, and be in pain and heavineſs at our very hearts. I know that the tempers of men are very different, and therefore I do not ſay that tears are abſolutely neceſſary to repentance, but they do very well become it; and a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ſenſe of ſin will almoſt melt the moſt hard and obdurate diſpoſition, and fetch water out of a very rock. To be ſure, the conſideration of our ways ſhould cauſe inward trouble and confuſion in our minds. The leaſt we can do when we have done amiſs, is to be ſorry for it, to condemn
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37901:75"/>
our own folly, and to be full of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſpleaſure againſt our ſelves for what we have done, and to reſolve never to do the like again. And let us make ſure that our trouble and ſorrow for ſin have this effect, <hi>to make us leave our ſins</hi>; and then we ſhall need to be the leſs ſolicitous about the degrees and outward expreſſions of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſerious conſideration of the evil and unreaſonableneſs of a ſinful courſe.</hi> That ſin is the ſtain and blemiſh of our natures, the reproach of our reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the diſeaſe and the deformity of our ſouls, the great enemy of our peace, the cauſe of all our fears and troubles: That whenever we do a wicked action, we go contrary to the cleareſt dictates of our reaſon and conſcience, to our plain and true intereſt, and to the ſtrongeſt tyes and obligations of duty and gratitude. And which renders it yet more unreaſonable, ſin is a voluntary evil which men wilfully bring upon themſelves. Other evils may be forced upon us, whether we will or no; a man may be poor or ſick by misfortune, but no man is wicked and vitious but by his own choice. How do we betray our folly and weakneſs, by ſuffering our ſelves to be hurried away by every fooliſh luſt and paſſion, to do things which we know
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37901:76"/>
to be prejudicial and hurtful to our ſelves; and ſo baſe and unworthy in themſelves, that we are aſhamed to do them, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the preſence of a wiſe man, but even of a child or a fool. So that if ſin were followed with no other puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the guilt of having done a ſhameful thing, a man would not by intemperance make himſelf a fool and a beaſt; one would not be falſe and unjuſt, treacherous or unthankful, if for no other reaſon, yet out of meer greatneſs and generoſity of mind, out of reſpect to the dignity of his nature, and out of very reverence to his own reaſon and underſtanding. For let Witty men ſay what they will in defence of their vices, there are ſo many natural acknowledgments of the evil and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of ſin, that the matter is paſt all denial: Men are generally galled and uneaſie at the thoughts of an evil action, both before and after they have committed it; they are aſhamed to be taken in a crime, and heartily vexed and provoked whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are upbraided with it; and 'tis very obſervable, that though the greater part of the world was always bad, and vice hath ever had more ſervants and followers to cry it up, yet never was there any Age ſo degenerate, in which Vice could get the better of Vertue in point of general
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37901:76"/>
eſteem and reputation: Even they whoſe wills have been moſt enſlaved to ſin, could never yet ſo far bribe and corrupt their underſtandings, as to make them give full approbation to it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A due ſenſe of the fearful and fatal conſequences of a wicked life.</hi> And theſe are ſo ſad and dreadful, and the danger of them ſo evident, and ſo perpetually threatning us, that no temptation can be ſufficient to excuſe a man to himſelf and his own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for venturing upon them. A principal point of wiſdom is to look to the End of things; not only to conſider the preſent pleaſure and advantage of any thing, but alſo the ill conſequences of it for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to ballance them one againſt the other.</p>
            <p>Now ſin in its own nature tends to make men miſerable. It certainly cauſes trouble and diſquiet of mind: And to a conſiderate man, that knows how to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the eaſe and ſatisfaction of his own mind, there cannot be a greater argument againſt ſin, than to conſider that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking of it is the only way to find reſt to our ſouls.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, every vice is naturally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome particular miſchief and inconvenience, which maketh it even in this life a puniſhment to it ſelf; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37901:77"/>
the providence of God and his juſt judgment upon ſinners ſtrikes in to height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the miſchievous conſequences of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſe. This we have repreſented in the Parable of the Prodigal; his riotous courſe of life did naturally and of it ſelf bring him to want, but the providence of God likewiſe concurred to render his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition more miſerable, <hi>at the ſame time there aroſe a mighty famine in the land</hi>; ſo that he did not only want wherewithall to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himſelf, but was cut off from all hopes of relief from the abundance and ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of others. Sin brings many miſeries upon us, and God many times ſends more and greater than ſin brings; and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we go on in a ſinful courſe, the more miſeries and the greater difficulties we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve our ſelves in.</p>
            <p>But all theſe are but light and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, in compariſon of the dreadful miſeries of another world; to the danger whereof, every man that lives a wicked life doth every moment expoſe himſelf. So that if we could conquer ſhame, and had ſtupidity enough to bear the infamy and reproach of our vices, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braidings of our conſciences for them, and the temporal miſchiefs and inconveniences of them; though for the preſent gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our luſts we could brook and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37901:77"/>
with all theſe, yet the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the end and iſſue of a ſinful courſe, is an invincible objection againſt it, and never to be anſwered; though the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our ſenſual appetities and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations ſhould be able to bear down all temporal conſiderations whatſoever, yet methinks the intereſt of our everlaſting happineſs ſhould lye near our hearts, the conſideration of another world ſhould mightily amaze and ſtartle us; the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of eternal darkneſs, and the diſmal thought of being miſerable for ever, ſhould effectually diſcourage any man from a wicked life. And this danger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually threatens the ſinner, and may, if God be not merciful to him, happen to ſurprize him the next moment. And can we make too much haſte, to flye from ſo great and apparent a danger? When will we think of ſaving our ſelves, if not when (for ought we know) we are upon the very brink of ruine, and juſt ready to drop into deſtruction?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Upon this naturally follows, <hi>a full conviction of the neceſſity of quitting this wicked courſe.</hi> And neceſſity is always a powerful and over-ruling argument, and doth rather compel than perſwade: And after it is once evident leaves no
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37901:78"/>
place for further deliberation. And the greater the neceſſity is, it is ſtill the more cogent argument. For whatever is neceſſary, is ſo in order to ſome end; and the greater the end, the greater is the neceſſity of the means without which that end cannot be obtained. Now the chief and laſt end of all Reaſonable creatures is happineſs, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is neceſſary in order to that, hath the higheſt degree of rational and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſity. We are not capable of happineſs, till we have left our ſins, for <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though men are convinced of this neceſſity, yet this doth not always enforce a preſent change; becauſe men hope they may continue in their ſins, and remedy all at laſt by repentance. But this is ſo great a hazard in all reſpects, that there is no venturing upon it: And in matters of greateſt concernment wiſe men will run no hazards, if they can help it. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this danger, that he would not defer his repentance and the change of his life for one moment; <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies: I made haſte and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37901:78"/>
This</hi> day, <hi>this</hi> hour, for ought we know, may be the laſt opportunity of making our peace with God. Therefore we ſhould make haſte out of this dangerous ſtate, as <hi>Lot</hi> did out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> leſt fire and brimſtone overtake us. He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not promiſe himſelf the next moment, hath a great deal of reaſon to ſeize upon the preſent opportunity. While we are <hi>lingering</hi> in our ſins, if God be not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to us, we ſhall be conſumed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>make haſte,</hi> ſinner, and <hi>eſcape for thy life, leſt evil overtake thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, <hi>An apprehenſion of the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of making this change.</hi> God who deſigned us for happineſs at firſt, and after we had made a forfeiture of it by ſin, was pleaſed to reſtore us again to the capacity of it by the Redemption of our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, hath made nothing neceſſary to our happineſs that is impoſſible for us to do, either of our ſelves, or by the aſſiſtance of that grace which he is ready to afford us, if we heartily beg it of him. For that is poſſible to us, which we may do by the aſſiſtance of another, if we may have that aſſiſtance for asking: And God hath promiſed to <hi>give his holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> So that notwithſtanding
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37901:79"/>
the great corruption and weakneſs of our natures, ſince the grace of God which brings ſalvation hath appeared, it is not abſolutely out of our power to leave our ſins, and to turn to God: For that may truly be ſaid to be in our power, which God hath promiſed to enable us to do, if we be not wanting to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>So that there is nothing on Gods part to hinder this change. He hath ſolemnly declared, that he ſincerly deſires it, and that he is ready to aſſiſt our good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions to this purpoſe. And moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, when he tell us, that <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he ſhould turn from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and live</hi>; that <hi>he would have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the truth</hi>; that <hi>he would not that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> He means plainly as he ſaith, and doth not ſpeak to us with any private reſerve or nice diſtinction between his ſecret and revealed will, that is, he doth not decree one thing, and declare the contrary. So far is it from this, that if a ſinner entertain ſerious thoughts of returning to God, and do but once move towards him, how ready is he to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37901:79"/>
receive him! This is, in a very lively manner, deſcribed to us in the Parable of the <hi>Prodigal Son,</hi> who when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home, and <hi>was yet a great way off,</hi> what haſte doth his Father make to meet him? <hi>he ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran.</hi> And if there be no impediment on Gods part, why ſhould there be any on ours? One would think all the doubt and difficulty ſhould be on the other ſide, Whether God would be pleaſed to ſhew mercy to ſuch great offenders as we have been. But the buſineſs doth not ſtick there. And will we be miſerable by our own choice, when the Grace of God hath put it into our power to be happy? I have done with the firſt thing, The courſe which <hi>David</hi> here took for the reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his life; <hi>I thought on my ways.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The ſucceſs of this courſe.</hi> It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced actual and ſpeedy reformation. <hi>I turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies; I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And if we conſider the matter throughly, and have but patience to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out the caſe with our ſelves, and to bring our thoughts and deliberations to ſome iſſue, the concluſion muſt naturally be, the quitting of that evil and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37901:80"/>
courſe in which we have lived. For ſin and conſideration can not long dwell together. Did but men conſider what ſin is, they would have ſo many unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable objections againſt it, ſuch ſtrong fears and jealouſies of the miſerable iſſue and event of a wicked life, that they would not dare to continue any longer in it.</p>
            <p>I do not ſay, that this change is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made at once. A ſtate of ſin and holineſs are not like two Ways that are juſt parted by a line, ſo as a man may ſtep out of the one full into the other; but they are like two Ways that lead to two very diſtant places, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are at a good diſtance from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the farther any man hath tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled in the one, the further he is from the other; ſo that it requires time and pains to paſs from the one to the other. It ſometimes ſo happens, that ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are by a mighty conviction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and by a very extraordinary and over-powering degree of Gods grace, almoſt perfectly reclaimed from their ſins at once, and all of a ſudden <hi>tranſlated out of the Kingdom of darkneſs into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</hi> And thus it was with many of the firſt Converts to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37901:80"/>
Chriſtianity; as their prejudices againſt the Chriſtian Religion were ſtrong and violent, ſo the holy Spirit of God was pleaſed to work mightily in them that believed. But in the uſual and ſetled methods of Gods grace, evil habits are maſtered and ſubdued by degrees, and with a great deal of conflict, and many times after they are routed they rally and make head again; and 'tis a great while before the contrary habits of grace and virtue are grown up to any conſiderable degree of ſtrength and maturity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man come to that confirmed ſtate of goodneſs, that he may be ſaid to have conquered and mortified his luſts. But yet this ought not to diſcourage us. For ſo ſoon as we have ſeriouſly begun this change, we are in a good way, and all our endeavours will have the acceptance of good beginnings, and God will be ready to help us; and if we purſue our advantages, we ſhall every day gain ground, and the work will grow eaſier upon our hands; and we who moved at firſt with ſo much ſlowneſs and difficulty, ſhall after a while be enabled to run the ways of Gods commandments with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight.</p>
            <p>I have done with the two things I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37901:81"/>
to ſpeak to from theſe words, The <hi>courſe</hi> here preſcribed, and the <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs</hi> of it. And now to perſwade men to take this <hi>courſe,</hi> I ſhall offer two or three Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Conſideration is the proper act of Reaſonable creatures. This argument God himſelf uſes, to bring men to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of their evil ways, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8, <hi>Remember, and ſhew your ſelves men; bring it again to mind, O ye tranſgreſſors.</hi> To conſider our ways, and to call our ſins to remembrance, is to ſhew our ſelves men. 'Tis the great fault and infelicity of a great many, that they generally live without thinking, and are acted by their preſent inclinations and appetites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration of the future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of things, and without fear of any thing, but of a preſent and ſenſible danger; like Brute creatures, who fear no evils but what are in view, and juſt ready to fall upon them: Whereas to a prudent and conſiderate man, a good or evil in reverſion is capable of as true an eſtimation, proportionably to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtance of it, as if it were real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent. And what do we think has God given us our reaſon and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for, but to foreſee evils at a diſtance,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37901:81"/>
and to prevent them; to provide for our future ſecurity and happineſs, to look up <hi>to God our Maker, who hath taught us more than the Beaſts of the earth, and made us wiſer than the Fowls of heaven</hi>; but to conſider what we do, and what we ought to do, and what makes moſt for our future and laſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and what againſt it? What can a Beaſt do worſe, than to act without any conſideration and deſign, than to purſue his preſent inclination without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of true danger? The moſt dull and ſtupid of all the brute creatures can hardly exerciſe leſs reaſon than this comes to. So that for a man not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his ways, is to the very beſt intents and purpoſes, to be <hi>without underſtanding, and like the beaſts that periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is the end of Gods patience and long-ſuffering towards us, to bring us to conſideration. The great deſign of Gods <hi>goodneſs,</hi> is to <hi>lead men to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He winks at the ſins of men, that they may repent.</hi> He bears long with us, and delays the puniſhment of our ſins, and doth not execute judgment ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he is loth to ſurprize men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction; becauſe he would give them the liberty of ſecond thoughts, time
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37901:82"/>
to reflect upon themſelves, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they have done, and to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon themſelves into repentance. <hi>Conſider this all ye that forget God, leſt</hi> his patience turn into fury, and <hi>he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſideration is that which we muſt all come to, one time or other. Time will come, when we ſhall conſider and cannot help it; when we ſhall not be able to divert our thoughts from thoſe things, which we are now ſo loth to think upon. Our conſciences will take their opportunity, to bring our ways to remembrance, when ſome great calamity or affliction is upon us. Thus it was with the Prodigal, when he was brought to the very laſt extremity, and <hi>was ready to periſh for hunger,</hi> then <hi>he came to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> When we come to die, then we ſhall think of our ways with trouble and vexation enough; And how glad would we then be, that we had time to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them? And perhaps while we are wiſhing for more time, Eternity will ſwallow us up. To be ſure, in the other world, a great part of the miſery of wicked men will conſiſt in furious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon themſelves, and the evil actions of their lives. 'Tis ſaid of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37901:82"/>
               <hi>Rich</hi> voluptuous man in the <hi>Parable,</hi> that <hi>in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments</hi>; as if he had never conſidered and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf till that time. But alas! it will then be too late to conſider: For then conſideration will do us no good; it will ſerve to no other purpoſe, but to aggravate our miſery, and to multiply our ſtings, and to give new life and rage to thoſe Vultures which will perpetually prey upon our hearts. But how much a wiſer courſe would it be, to conſider theſe things in time, in order to our eternal peace and comfort; to think of them while we may redreſs them, and avoid the diſmal conſequences of them, than when our caſe is deſperate and paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</p>
            <p>And now what can I ſay more, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade every one of us to a conſideration of our <hi>own ways?</hi> We are generally apt to buſie our ſelves in obſerving the errors and miſcarriages of our neighbours, and are forward to mark and cenſure the faults and follies of other men; but how few deſcend into themſelves, and turn their eyes inward, and ſay, <hi>What have I done?</hi> 'Tis an excellent ſaying of <hi>Antoninus</hi> the great <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher, No man was ever unhappy, for not prying into the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:37901:83"/>
and condition of other men; but that man is neceſſarily unhappy, who doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve himſelf, and conſider the ſtate of his own ſoul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is our proper work; and <hi>now</hi> is a proper ſeaſon for it, when we pretend to God and men to ſet apart a ſolemn time for the examination of our ſelves, and for a ſerious review of our lives, in order to humiliation and repentance, to the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and amendment of what is amiſs. And though we would venture to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with men, yet let us not diſſemble with God alſo: <hi>For ſhall not he that pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the heart conſider it, and he that keepeth thy ſoul, ſhall not he know it; and ſhall not he render to every man according to his ways?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know it is a very unpleaſant work which I am now putting you upon, and therefore no wonder that men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo backward to it; becauſe it will of neceſſity give ſome preſent diſturbance to their minds. They whoſe lives have been very vicious, are ſo odious a ſight, ſo horrid a ſpectacle to themſelves, that they cannot endure to reflect upon their own ways; of all things in the world they hate Conſideration, and are ready to ſay to it, as the evil Spirit did in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37901:83"/>
to our Saviour, <hi>What have I to do with thee? Art thou come to torment me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time?</hi> But let not this affright us from it; for whatever trouble it may cauſe at preſent, it is the only way to prevent the anguiſh and the torments of Eternity.</p>
            <p>The things which I have offered to your conſideration, are of huge moment and importance. They do not concern your bodies and eſtates, but that which is more truly your ſelves, your immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls, the deareſt and moſt durable part of your ſelves: and they do not concern us for a little while, but forever. Let me therefore beſpeak your moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious regard to them, in the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after he had ſet the law of God before them, togeher with the bleſſings promiſed to obedience, and the terrible curſes threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the tranſgreſſion of it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46, <hi>Set your hearts to the words which I teſtifie to you this day, for it is not a vain thing, becauſe it is your life. Your life,</hi> your <hi>eternal life</hi> and happineſs depends upon it.</p>
            <p>And beſides a tender regard to your ſelves and your own intereſts, which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks every man, out of a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37901:84"/>
of being happy, and dread of being miſerable, ſhould be forward enough to conſider: Be pleaſed likewiſe to lay to heart the influence of your example upon others. I ſpeak now to a great many perſons, the eminence of whoſe rank and quality renders their examples ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to be able almoſt to give authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either to Virtue or Vice. People take their faſhions from you, as to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of their minds as well as their bodies. So that upon you chiefly depends the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine or reformation of manners, our hopes or deſpair of a better world. What way ſoever you go, you are followed by troops. If you run any ſinful or dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous courſe, you cannot <hi>periſh alone in your iniquity,</hi> but <hi>thouſands will fall by your ſide, and ten thouſands at your right hands:</hi> And on the contrary, 'tis very much in your power, and I hope in your wills and deſigns, to be the ſovereign reſtorers of piety and virtue to a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Age. It is <hi>our</hi> part indeed to exhort men to their duty, but 'tis <hi>you</hi> that would be the powerful and effectual preachers of righteouſneſs: We may endeavour to make men proſelytes to vertue, but you would infallibly draw diſciples after you: We may try to perſwade, but you
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37901:84"/>
could certainly prevail, either to make men good, or to reſtrain them from being ſo bad.</p>
            <p>Therefore conſider your ways, for the ſake of others as well as your ſelves. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what you have done, and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what is fit for you to do, and if you do it not, what will be the end of theſe things? And to help you forward in this work, it is not neceſſary that I ſhould rip up the vices of the Age, and ſet mens ſins in order before them. It is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that you your ſelves ſhould call your own ways to remembrance. We have every one a faithful Monitor and Witneſs in our own breaſts, who, if we will but hearken to him, will deal impartially with us, and privately tell us the errors of our lives. To this Monitor I refer you, and to the grace of God, to make theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions effectual.</p>
            <p>Let us then every one of us, in the fear of God, <hi>ſearch and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord.</hi> Let us <hi>take to our ſelves words, and ſay</hi> to God, with thoſe true Penitents in Scripture, <hi>I have ſinned, what ſhall be done unto thee, O thou preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of men? Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth, I will abhor my ſelf, and repent in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37901:85"/>
duſt and aſhes.</hi> For <hi>ſurely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I will not offend any more; that which I know not, teach thou me, and if I have done iniquity I will do no more. O that there were ſuch an heart in us! O that we were wiſe, that we underſtood this, that we would conſider our latter end!</hi> And God, of his infinite mercy, inſpire into every one of our hearts this holy and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py reſolution; for the ſake of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour and Redeemer, to whom with the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately going before, you have the courſe which <hi>David</hi> took for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of his life, and the ſucceſs of that courſe; <hi>I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</hi> A ſerious reflection upon the paſt errors and miſcarriages of his life, produced the reformation of it. And you have a conſiderable circumſtance add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the words that I have now read to you, <hi>viz.</hi> that this reformation was ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and without delay, <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</hi> Upon due conſideration of his former life, and a full conviction of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a change, he came to a reſolution of a better life, and immediately put this
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37901:87"/>
reſolution in execution; and to declare how preſently and quickly he did it, he expreſſes it both affirmatively and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; after the manner of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who when they would ſay a thing with great certainty and <hi>emphaſis,</hi> are wont to expreſs it both ways, <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not</hi>; that is, I did with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſpeed betake my ſelf to a better courſe.</p>
            <p>And this is the natural effect of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; and the true cauſe why men delay ſo neceſſary a work, is, becauſe they ſtifle their reaſon, and ſuffer themſelves to be hurried into the embraces of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent objects, and do not conſider their latter end, and what will be the ſad iſſue and event of a wicked life. For if men would take an impartial view of their lives, and but now and then reflect upon themſelves, and lay to heart the miſerable and fatal conſequences of a ſinful courſe, and think whither it will bring them at laſt, and that the end of theſe things will be death and miſery: If the carnal and ſenſual perſon would but look about him, and conſider how many have been ruin'd in the way that he is in, how many lye <hi>ſlain and wounded in it, that it is the way to hell, and leads down to the chambers of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37901:87"/>
death,</hi> this would certainly give a check to him, and ſtop him in his courſe.</p>
            <p>For it is not to be imagined, but that <hi>that</hi> man who hath duly conſidered what ſin is, the ſhortneſs of its pleaſures, and the eternity of its puniſhment, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve immediately to break off his ſins, and to live another kind of life. Would any man be intemperate and walk after the fleſh, would any man be unjuſt and defraud or oppreſs his neighbour, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and live in the contempt of God and Religion, or allow himſelf in any wicked courſe whatſoever, that conſiders and believes a Judgment to come, and that becauſe of theſe things the terrible vengeance of God will one day fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of diſobedience? It is not credible, that men who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeriouſly to the meditation of theſe matters, ſhould venture to continue in ſo imprudent and dangerous a courſe, or could by any temptation whatſoever be trained on one ſtep farther in a Way that does ſo certainly and viſibly lead to ruin and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>So that my work at this time ſhall be, to endeavour to convince men of the monſtrous folly and unreaſonableneſs of delaying the reformation and amendment
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:37901:88"/>
of their lives; and to perſwade us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve upon it, and having reſolved, to ſet about it immediately and without delay; in imitation of the good man here in the Text, <hi>I made haſte, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</hi> And to this end, I ſhall</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider the reaſons and excuſes which men pretend for delaying this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary work, and ſhew the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall add ſome farther Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, to engage us effectually to ſet about this work ſpeedily and without delay.</p>
            <p n="1">I. We will conſider a little the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and excuſes which men pretend for delaying this neceſſary work, and not only ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of them, but that they are each of them a ſtrong reaſon and powerful argument to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many pretend, that they are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly convinced of the great neceſſity of leaving their ſins and betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a better courſe, and they fully intend to do ſo; only they cannot at preſent bring themſelves to it, but they hope hereafter to be in a better temper
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37901:88"/>
and diſpoſition, and then they reſolve by Gods grace to ſet about this work in good earneſt, and to go through with it.</p>
            <p>I know not whether it be fit to call this a Reaſon; I am ſure it is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cheat and deluſion that any man can put upon himſelf. For this plainly ſhews, that thou doſt not intend to do this, which thou art convinced is ſo neceſſary, but to put it off from day to day. For there is no greater evidence that a man doth not really intend to do a thing, than when notwithſtanding he ought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all accounts, and may in all reſpects better do it at preſent than hereafter, yet he ſtill puts it off. Whatever thou pretendeſt, this is a meer ſhift to get rid of a preſent trouble: It is like gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good words and making fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to a clamorous and importunate creditour, and appointing him to come another day, when the man knows in his conſcience that he intends not to pay him, and that he ſhall be leſs able to diſcharge the debt then, than he is at preſent. Whatever reaſons thou haſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reforming thy life now, will ſtill remain and be in as full force hereafter, nay, probably ſtronger than they are at
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37901:89"/>
preſent. Thou art unwilling now, and ſo thou wilt be hereafter, and in all likelihood much more unwilling. So that this reaſon will every day improve upon thy hands, and have ſo much the more ſtrength, by how much the longer thou continueſt in thy ſins. Thou haſt no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world againſt the preſent time, but only that 'tis <hi>preſent</hi>; why, when here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after comes to be preſent, the reaſon will be juſt the ſame. So that thy preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs is ſo far from being a juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt it, that 'tis a good reaſon the other way; becauſe thou art unwilling now, and like to be ſo, nay, more ſo hereafter; if thou intendenſt to do it at all, thou ſhouldſt ſet about it immediately, and without delay.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another reaſon which men pretend for the delaying of this work, is the great difficulty and unpleaſantneſs of it. And it cannot be denied, but that there will be ſome bitterneſs and uneaſineſs in it, proportionably to the growth of evil ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and the ſtrength of our luſts, and our greater or leſs progreſs and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in a ſinful courſe: So that we muſt make account of a ſharp conflict, of ſome pain and trouble in the making of this change, that it will coſt us ſome pangs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37901:89"/>
and throws before we be born again. For when nature hath been long bent another way, it is not to be expected that it ſhould be reduced and brought back to its firſt ſtrenghtneſs without pain and violence.</p>
            <p>But then it is to be conſidered, that how difficult and painful ſoever this work be, it is neceſſary; and that ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule all other conſiderations whatſoever: that if we will not be at this pains and trouble, we muſt one time or other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure far greater, than thoſe which we now ſeek to avoid: that it is not ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as we imagine, but our fears of it are greater than the trouble will prove; if we were but once reſolved upon the work and ſeriouſly engaged in it, the greateſt part of the trouble were over; it is like the fear of children to go into the cold water, a faint trial increaſeth their fear and apprehenſion of it; but ſo ſoon as they have plunged into it, the trouble is over, and then they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der why they were ſo much afraid. The main difficulty and unpleaſantneſs is in our firſt entrance into Religion; it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently grows tolerable, and ſoon after eaſie, and after that by degrees ſo pleaſant and delightful, that the man would not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37901:90"/>
for all the world return to his former evil ſtate and condition of life.</p>
            <p>We ſhould conſider likewiſe, what is the true cauſe of all this trouble and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; 'Tis our long continuance in a ſinful courſe that hath made us ſo loth to leave it; 'Tis the cuſtom of ſinning that renders it ſo troubleſome and uneaſie to men to do otherwiſe; 'Tis the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our guilt, heightned and inflamed by many and repeated provocations, that doth ſo gall our conſciences, and fill our ſouls with ſo much terror; 'Tis becauſe we have gone ſo far in an evil way, that our retreat is become ſo difficult; and becauſe we have delayed this work ſo long, that we are now ſo unwilling to go about it; and conſequently, the longer we delay it, the trouble and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of a change will encreaſe daily upon us. And all theſe conſiderations are ſo far from being a good reaſon for more delays, that they are a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to the contrary: Becauſe the work is difficult now, therefore do not make it more ſo; and becauſe your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays have encreaſed the difficulty of it, and will do more and more, therefore delay no longer.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another pretended encouragement
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37901:90"/>
to theſe delays, is the great mercy and patience of God. He commonly bears long with ſinners, and therefore there is no ſuch abſolute and urgent neceſſity of a ſpeedy repentance and reformation of our lives. Men have not the face to give this for a reaſon; but yet for all that, it lies at the bottom of many mens hearts: So <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8.11, <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpeedily, therefore the hearts of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not always thus. There are few of us but have ſeen ſeveral inſtances of Gods ſeverity to ſinners, and have known ſeveral perſons ſurprized by a ſudden hand of God, and cut off in the very act of ſin, without having the leaſt reſpite given them, without time or liberty ſo much as to ask God forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to conſider either what they had done, or whither they were a-going. And this may be the caſe of any ſinner, and is ſo much the more likely to be thy caſe, becauſe thou doſt ſo boldly preſume upon the mercy and patience of God.</p>
            <p>But if it were always thus, and thou wert ſure to be ſpared yet awhile lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37901:91"/>
what can be more unreaſonable and diſingenuous, than to reſolve to be evil becauſe God is good, and becauſe he ſuffers ſo long, to ſin ſo much the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and becauſe he affords thee a ſpace of repentance, therefore to delay it and put it off to the laſt? The proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Gods goodneſs is to lead men to repentance, and he never intended his patience for an encouragement to men to continue in their ſins, but for an opportunity and an argument to break them off by repentance.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the pretended reaſons and encouragements to men to delay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and the reformation of their lives, and you ſee how groundleſs and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they are; which was the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I propounded to ſpeak to.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall add ſome farther conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, to engage men effectually to ſet about this work ſpeedily, and without delay. And becauſe they are many, I ſhall inſiſt upon thoſe which are moſt weighty and conſiderable, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very curious and ſolicitous about the method and order of them: For provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they be but effectual to the end of perſwaſion, it matters not how inartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37901:91"/>
they are rang'd and diſpoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider, that in matters of great and neceſſary concernment, and which muſt be done, there is no greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a weak and impotent mind, then irreſolution; to be undermined, where the caſe is ſo plain, and the neceſſity ſo urgent; to be always about doing that, which we are convinced muſt be done.</p>
            <q>Victuros agimus ſemper, nec vivimus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam.</q>
            <p>We are always intending to live a new life, but can never find a time to ſet about it. This is as if a man ſhould put off eating and drinking and ſleeping from one day and night to another, till he have ſtarved and deſtroyed himſelf. It ſeldom falls under any mans deliberation, whether he ſhould live or not, if he can chuſe; and if he cannot chuſe, 'tis in vain to deliberate about it. It is much more abſurd to deliberate, whether we ſhould live virtuouſly and religiouſly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and righteouſly in the world; for <hi>that</hi> upon the matter is to conſult, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man ſhould be happy or not: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath determined this for us, and we need not reaſon about it; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37901:92"/>
we ought not to delay that which we are convinced is ſo neceſſary in order to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, that Religion is a great and a long work; and asks ſo much time, that there is none left for the delaying of it. To begin with Repentance, which is commonly our firſt entrance into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: This alone is a great work, and is not only the buſineſs of a ſudden thought and reſolution, but of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and action: 'Tis the abandoning of a ſinful courſe, which we cannot leave till we have in ſome degree maſtered our luſts; for ſo long as they are our maſters, like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> they will keep us in bondage, and <hi>not let us go to ſerve the Lord.</hi> The habits of ſin and vice are not to be plucked up and caſt off at once; as they have been long in contracting, ſo without a miracle, it will require a competent time to ſubdue them and get the victory over them: for they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered juſt by the ſame degrees that the habits of grace and virtue grow up and get ſtrength in us.</p>
            <p>So that there are ſeveral duties to be done in Religion, and often to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated; many graces and virtues are to be long practiſed and exerciſed, before
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37901:92"/>
the contrary vices will be ſubdued, and before we arrive to a confirmed and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſtate of goodneſs; ſuch a ſtate as can only give us a clear and comfortable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the ſincerity of our reſolution and repentance, and of our good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards God. We have many luſts to mortifie, many paſſions to govern and bring into order; much good to do, to make what amends and reparation we can for the much evil we have done: We have many things to learn; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to unlearn, to which we ſhall be ſtrongly prompted by the corrupt incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of our nature, and the remaining power of ill habits and cuſtoms: and perhaps we have ſatisfaction and reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make for the many injuries we have done to others, in their perſons, or eſtates, or reputations: In a word, we have a <hi>body of ſin</hi> to put off, which clings cloſe to us, and is hard to part with; we have to <hi>cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, and to perfect holineſs in the fear of God</hi>; to encreaſe and improve our graces and virtues; to <hi>add to our faith knowledg,</hi> and <hi>temperance,</hi> and <hi>patience,</hi> and <hi>brotherly kindneſs,</hi> and <hi>charity</hi>; and <hi>to abound in all the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37901:93"/>
by Jeſus Chriſt to the praiſe and glory of God:</hi> We have to be uſeful to the world, and exemplary to others in a holy and virtuous converſation; our <hi>light is ſo to ſhine before men, that others may ſee our good works, and glorifie our father which is in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And do we think all this is to be done in an inſtant, and requires no time? That we may delay and put off to the laſt, and yet do all this work well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough? Do we think we can do all this in time of ſickneſs and old age, when we are not fit to do any thing, when <hi>the ſpirit of a man</hi> can hardly <hi>bear the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> of nature, much leſs a guilty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and <hi>a wounded ſpirit?</hi> Do we think that when the day hath been idlely ſpent and ſquandered away by us, that we ſhall be fit to work when the night and darkneſs comes? When our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is weak, and our memory frail, and our will crooked, and by a long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of ſinning obſtinately bent the wrong way, what can we then do in Religion? what reaſonable or acceptable ſervice can we then perform to God? when our can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is juſt ſinking into the ſocket, how ſhall <hi>our light ſo ſhine before men, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may ſee our good works?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:37901:93"/>Alas! the longeſt life is no more than ſufficient for a man to reform himſelf in, to repent of the errors of his life, and to amend what is amiſs; to put our ſouls into a good poſture and preparation for another world, to train up our ſelves for eternity, and to make our ſelves <hi>meet to be made partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider, what a deſperate hazard we run by theſe delays. Every delay of repentance is a venturing the main chance. It is uncertain whether hereafter we ſhall have time for it, and if we have time, whether we ſhall have a heart to it, and the aſſiſtance of Gods grace to go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough with it. God indeed hath been graciouſly pleaſed to promiſe pardon to repentance, but he hath no-where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed life and leiſure, the aids of his grace and holy Spirit to thoſe who put off their repentance: He hath no-where promiſed acceptance to meer ſorrow and trouble for ſin, without <hi>fruits meet for repentance, and amendment of life:</hi> He hath no-where promiſed to receive them to mercy and favour, who only give him good words, and are at laſt contented to condeſcend ſo far to him, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to leave their ſins when they can
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:37901:94"/>
keep them no longer. Many have gone thus far in times of affliction and ſickneſs, as to be awakened to a great ſenſe of their ſins, and to be mightily troubled for their wicked lives, and to make ſolemn promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and profeſſions of becoming better; and yet upon their deliverance and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very all hath vaniſhed and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and their <hi>righteouſneſs hath been as the morning cloud, and as the early dew which paſſeth away:</hi> And why ſhould any man, meerly upon account of a death-bed repentance, reckon himſelf in a better condition than thoſe perſons, who have done as much, and gone as far as he; and there is no other difference between them but this, that the repentance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was tryed, and proved inſincere, but the <hi>death-bed repentance</hi> never came to a tryal; and yet for all that, God knows whether it were ſincere or not, and how it would have proved if the man had lived longer. Why ſhould any man, for offering up to God the meer refuſe and dregs of his life, and the days <hi>which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath no pleaſure in,</hi> expect to receive the reward of eternal life and happineſs at his hands?</p>
            <p>But though we do not deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay this work ſo long, yet ought we to

conſider, that all delays in a matter of this conſequence are extreamly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; becauſe we put off a buſineſs of the greateſt concernment to the future; and in ſo doing, put it to the hazard whether ever it ſhall be done: For the future is as much out of out power to command, as it is to call back the time which is paſt. Indeed if we could arreſt time, and ſtrike off the nimble wheels of his Charriot, and like <hi>Joſhua</hi> bid the Sun ſtand ſtill, and make opportunity tarry as long as we had occaſion for it; this were ſomething to excuſe our delay, or at leaſt to mitigate and abate the folly and unreaſonableneſs of it: But this we cannot do. It is in our power, under the influence of Gods grace and holy Spirit, to amend our lives now, but it is not in our power to live till to morrow; and who would part with an eſtate in hand, which he may preſently enter upon the poſſeſſion of, for an uncertain reverſion? And yet thus we deal in the great and everlaſting concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our ſouls; we trifle away the preſent opportunities of ſalvation, and vainly promiſe to our ſelves the future; we let go that which is in our power, and fondly diſpoſe of that which is out of our power, and in the hands of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:37901:95"/>Lay hold then upon the preſent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, and look upon every action thou doſt, and every opportunity of doing any, as poſſibly thy laſt; for ſo it may prove, for any thing thou canſt tell to the contrary. If a mans life lay at ſtake, and he had but one throw for it, with what care and with what concernment would he manage that action? What thou art doing next may, for ought thou knoweſt, be for thy life, and for all eternity. So much of thy life is moſt certainly paſt, and God knows thou haſt yet done little or nothing towards the ſecuring of thy fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs: It is not certain, how much or how little is remaining, therefore be ſure to make the beſt uſe of that little which may be left, and wiſely to manage the laſt ſtake.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Seeing the delay of repentance doth mainly rely upon the hopes and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of a future repentance, let us conſider a little how unreaſonable theſe hopes are, and how abſurd the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is which men take from them. To ſin in hopes that hereafter we ſhall repent, is to do a thing in hopes that we ſhall be one day mightily aſhamed of it, that we ſhall one time or other be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily grieved and troubled that we have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37901:95"/>
done it: It is to do a thing in hopes that we ſhall afterwards condemn our ſelves for it, and wiſh a thouſand times we had never done it; in hopes that we ſhall be full of horrour at the thoughts of what we have done, and ſhall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure up ſo much guilt in our conſciences as will make us a terror to our ſelves, and be ready to drive us even to deſpair and diſtraction. And is this a reaſonable hope? Is this a fitting encouragement for a wiſe man to give to himſelf, to any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And yet this is plainly the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens going on in their ſins, in hopes that hereafter they ſhall repent of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If you be ſtill reſolved to delay this buſineſs, and put it off at preſent; conſider well with your ſelves, how long you intend to delay it. I hope not to the laſt; not till ſickneſs come, and death make his approaches to you. This is next to madneſs, to venture all upon ſuch an after game. 'Tis juſt as if a man ſhould be content to be ſhipwrackt, in hope that he ſhall afterwards eſcape by a plank, and get ſafe to ſhore. But I hope none are ſo unreaſonable; yet I fear that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have a mind to put it off to old age, though they do not care to ſay ſo. <hi>Seneca</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:37901:96"/>
expoſtulates excellently with this ſort of men;
<q>Who ſhould enſure thy life till that time? Who ſhall paſs his word for thee, that the providence of God will ſuffer all things to happen and fall out, juſt as thou haſt deſigned and forecaſt them? Art thou not aſhamed to reſerve the reliques of thy life for thy ſelf, and to ſet apart only that time to be wiſe and virtuous in, which is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? How late is it then to begin to llve well, when thy life is almoſt at an end? What a ſtupid forgetfulneſs is it of our mortality, to put off good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions to the fiftieth or ſixtieth year of our age, and to reſolve to begin to do better at <hi>that</hi> time of life, to which but very few perſons have reached?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps thou art not altogether ſo unreaſonable, but deſireſt only to reſpite this work, till the firſt heat of youth and luſt be over, till the cooler and more conſiderate part of thy life come on: <hi>that</hi> perhaps thou thinkeſt may be the fitteſt and moſt convenient ſeaſon. But ſtill we reckon upon uncertainties, for perhaps that ſeaſon may never be: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be ſure it is much more in our power, by the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, which is never wanting to the ſincere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37901:96"/>
of men, to conquer our luſts now, and to reſiſt the moſt heady and violent temptations to vice, than either to ſecure the future time, or to recover that which is once paſt and gone.</p>
            <p>Some ſeem yet more reaſonable, and are content to come lower, and deſire only to put it off for a very little while. But why for a little while? why till to morrow? To morrow will be as this day, only with this difference, that thou wilt in all probability be more unwilling and indiſpoſed <hi>then.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that there is no <hi>future</hi> time which any man can reaſonably pitch upon. All delay in this caſe is dangerous, and as ſenſeleſs as the expectation of the <hi>Ideot,</hi> deſcribed by the <hi>Poet</hi>; who being come to the river ſide, and intending to paſs over, ſtays till all the water in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be gone by, and hath left the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel a dry paſſage for him.
<q>
                  <l>—at ille</l>
                  <l>Labitur, &amp; labetur in omne volubilis aevum.</l>
               </q>
But the river runs, and runs, and will run, and if he ſhould ſtay a thouſand years, will never be the nearer being dry.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:37901:97"/>
So that if the man muſt go over, and there be a neceſſity for it, (as there is for Repentance) the only wiſe reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be taken in this caſe, is to wade or ſwim over as well as he can, becauſe the matter will never be mended by tarrying.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> conſider what an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able happineſs it is, to have our minds ſettled in that condition, that we may without fear and amazement, nay, with comfort and confidence, expect death and judgment. Death is never far from any of us, and the general Judgment of the world may be nearer than we are aware of; for <hi>of that day and hour knoweth no man:</hi> And theſe are two ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things; and nothing can free us from the terror of them, but a good conſcience; and a good conſcience is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be had, either by innocence, or by repentance and amendment of life. Happy man! who by this means is at peace with God, and with himſelf; and can think of death and judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dread and aſtoniſhment. For <hi>the ſting of death is ſin</hi>; and the terror of the great day only concerns thoſe, who have lived wickedly and impenitently, and would not be perſwaded, neither
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37901:97"/>
by the mercies of God, nor by the fear of his judgments, to repent and turn to him: But if we have truely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken our ſins, and do ſincerely endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live in obedience to the Laws and Commands of God, the more we think of death and judgment, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter matter of joy and comfort will theſe things be to us: For <hi>bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he comes ſhall find ſo doing.</hi> Let us therefore, as ſoon as poſſibly we can, put our ſelves into this poſture and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; according to that advice of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.35, 36, <hi>Let your loins be girded about, and your lamps burning, and ye your ſelves like unto men that wait for their Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I hope that enough hath been ſaid, to convince men of the great unreaſonableneſs and folly of theſe delays; nay, I believe, moſt men are convinced of it by their own thoughts, and that their conſciences call them fools a thouſand times for it: But O that I knew what to ſay, that might prevail with men, and effectually perſwade them to do that, which they are ſo abundantly convinced is ſo neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37901:98"/>And here I might addreſs my ſelf to the ſeveral ages of perſons. You that are <hi>young</hi> and have hitherto been in a good meaſure innocent, may prevent the Devil, and by an early piety give God the firſt poſſeſſion of your ſouls; and by this means, never be put to the trouble of ſo great and ſolemn a repentance, having never been deeply engaged in a wicked life: You may do a glorious, I had almoſt ſaid a meritorious thing, in cleaving ſtedfaſtly to God, and reſolving to ſerve him, when you are ſo importunately court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo hotly aſſaulted by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the World. However, you may not live to be old; therefore upon that conſideration begin the work preſently, and make uſe of the opportunity that is now in your hands.</p>
            <p>You that are grown up to <hi>ripeneſs of years,</hi> and are in the full vigor of your age; <hi>you</hi> are to be put in mind, that the heat and inconſiderateneſs of youth is now paſt and gone; that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and conſideration are now in their perfection and ſtrength; that this is the very age of prudence and diſcretion, of wiſdom and warineſs: So that now is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37901:98"/>
the proper time for you to be ſerious, and wiſely to ſecure your future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe that are <hi>old, they</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould need no body to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, that it is now high time for them to begin a new life, and that the time paſt of their lives is too much to have ſpent in ſin and folly. There is no trifling where men have a great work to do, and but little time to do it in. Your Sun is certainly going down and neer its ſetting; therefore you ſhould quicken your pace, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that your journey is never the ſhorter becauſe you have but little time to perform it in. Alas man! thou art juſt ready to dye, and haſt thou not yet begun to live? Are thy paſſions and luſts yet unſubdued, and have they had no other mortification than what age hath given them? 'Tis ſtrange to ſee, how in the very extremities of old age, many men are as if they had ſtill a thouſand years to live, and make no preparation for death, though it dogs them at the heels, and is juſt come up to them and ready to give them the fatal ſtroke.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us not put off this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37901:99"/>
work of reforming our ſelves, in what part and age of our lives ſoever we be. <hi>To day, whilſt it is called to day, leaſt any of you be hardened tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the decitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> Nay, to day is with the lateſt to begin this work, had we been wiſe we would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun it ſooner. 'Tis Gods infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to us, that it is not quite too late, that the day of Gods patience is not quite expired, and the door ſhut againſt us. Therefore do not defer your repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the next ſolemn time, to the next occaſion. of receiving the bleſſed Sacrament: Do not ſay, I will then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and become a new man, after <hi>that</hi> I will take leave of my luſts and ſin no more. For let us make what haſte we can, we cannot poſſibly make too much.</p>
            <q>—properat vivere nemo ſatis.</q>
            <p>No man makes haſte enough to be good, to <hi>ceaſe to do evil, and to learn to do well.</hi> Be as quick as we will, life will be too nimble for us, and go on faſter than our work does; and death will go nigh to prevent us, and ſurprize us unawares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:37901:99"/>Do, do <hi>ſinner</hi>; abuſe and neglect thy ſelf yet a little while longer, till the time of regarding thy ſoul and working out thy own ſalvation be at an end, and all the opportunities of minding that great concernment be ſlipped out of thy hands, never to be recovered, never to be called back again; no, not by thy moſt earneſt wiſhes and deſires, by thy moſt fervent prayers and tears; and thou be brought into the condition of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Eſau,</hi> who for once deſpiſing the Bleſſing, loſt it for ever; <hi>and found no place of repentance, though he ſought it carefully with tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude: Art thou convinced, that thy eternal happineſs depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on following the advice which hath now been given thee? Why then, do but behave thy ſelf in this caſe, as thou and all prudent men are wont to do in matters which thou canſt not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to be of far leſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If a man be travelling to ſuch a place, ſo ſoon as he finds himſelf out of the way, he preſently ſtops and makes towards the right way, and hath no inclination to go wrong any farther: If a man be ſick, he will be well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37901:100"/>
if he can, and not put it off to the future: Moſt men will gladly take the firſt opportunity that preſents it ſelf, of being rich or great; every man almoſt catches at the very firſt offers of a great place or a good purchaſe, and ſecures them preſently if he can, leaſt the opportunity be gone, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſnatch theſe things from him. Do thou thus ſo much more, in matters ſo much greater. Return from the error of thy way, be well, ſave thy ſelf, as ſoon as poſſibly thou canſt. When hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs preſents it ſelf to thee, do not turn it off, and bid it come again to morrow. Perhaps thou mayeſt never be ſo fairly offered again; perhaps the day of ſalvation may not come again to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; nay, perhaps <hi>to thee</hi> to morrow may never come. But if we were ſure that happineſs would come again, yet why ſhould we put it off? Does any man know how to be ſafe and happy to day, and can he find in his heart to tarry till to morrow?</p>
            <p>Now the God of all mercy and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, give every one of us the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and grace, to <hi>know</hi> and to do <hi>in this our day, the things that belong to our peace, before they be hid from our

            <p>From which words I ſhall endeavour, by Gods aſſiſtance, to lay men open to themſelves, and to repreſent to every one of us the truth of our condition; and then leave it to the grace of God, and every mans ſerious conſideration, to make the beſt uſe of it.</p>
            <p>And it will conduce very much to the clearing of this matter, to conſider brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the occaſion of theſe words. And this will beſt appear by attending ſtedfaſtly to the main ſcope and deſign of this <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> And I think that no man that reads it with attention can doubt, but that it is particularly deſigned againſt the impious Sect of the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>; who, as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> tell us, ſprang from <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and pretended to extraordinary <hi>knowledg</hi> and illumination, from whence they had the name of <hi>Gnoſticks</hi>; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this glittering pretence, they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves in all manner of impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vicious practice, <hi>turning the grace of God into laſciviouſneſs,</hi> as St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of them.

For, as the <hi>ancient Fathers</hi> tell us, they pretended that whatever they did, they could not ſin: And this our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> intimates in the beginning of this <hi>Epistle, If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And they held it lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſtianity to avoid perſecution; and not only ſo, but alſo to joyn with the Heathen in perſecuting the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; which ſeems to be the reaſon why the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſo often taxeth them for <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to their Brethren</hi>; and calls them <hi>Murderers.</hi>

            <p>I ſhall briefly explain the words, and then conſider the matter contained in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:37901:104"/>
               <hi>By the children of God, and the children of the Devil,</hi> are meant good and bad men; It being uſual in the phraſe of Scripture, to call perſons or things which partake of ſuch a nature or quality, the children of thoſe who are eminently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with that nature and diſpoſition. Thus they who are of the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and do the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are called <hi>Abraham's children:</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thoſe who in their diſpoſition and actions imitate God, are called <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God</hi>; and on the contrary, thoſe that addict themſelves to ſin and impiety are counted of another race and deſcent, they reſemble the Devil, and belong to him as the Chief and Head of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>By <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> is here meant univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal goodneſs and conformity to the Law of God, in oppoſition to ſin which is the tranſgreſſion of that Law.</p>
            <p>By being <hi>manifeſt,</hi> is meant, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by good and bad men are really diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; ſo that every one that will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his condition by this mark, may know of which number he is, and to what Party he belongs.</p>
            <p>I come now to the main argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the words, which is to give us a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37901:105"/>

            </p>

We will conſider the character and mark of difference between a good and bad man, which is here in the Text, <hi>Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God</hi>; which implies likewiſe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that <hi>whoſoever doth righteouſneſs, is of God.</hi> Now in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37901:105"/>
this phraſe, he only who lives in all the commandments of God blameleſs, can be ſaid to <hi>do righteouſneſs:</hi> But in this ſenſe <hi>there is none that doth righteouſneſs, no not one,</hi> and conſequently none could be the Children of God; but the Text ſuppoſes ſome to be ſo, and therefore by <hi>doing righteouſneſs</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be underſtood to mean ſomething that is ſhort of perfect and unſinning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. So that the queſtion is, What <hi>doing of righteouſneſs</hi> is ſufficient to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate a man a <hi>Child of God,</hi> and to put him into a ſtate of grace and favour with Him.</p>
            <p>And I do not intend nicely to ſtate this matter. 'Tis not perhaps poſſible to be done; nothing being more difficult, than to determine the very utmoſt bounds and limits of things, and to tell exactly and juſt to a point where the line of difference between Virtue and Vice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtate of a good and bad man is to be placed: And if it could be done, it would be of no great uſe; for I take it to be no part of my buſineſs to tell men how many faults they may have, and how little goodneſs, and yet be <hi>the children of God:</hi> but rather to acquaint them, what degrees of holineſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37901:106"/>
are neceſſary to give men a clear and comfortable evidence of their good eſtate towards God; and then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, in order to their peace and aſſurance, to endeavour after ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to ſtate the buſineſs ſo far as is neceſſary to give men a ſufficient knowledg of their condition, I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider who they are that in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſenſe may be ſaid to be <hi>doers of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> or <hi>not doers of it.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> lays down the Rule negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall therefore</p>
            <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, enquire who they are that in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſenſe may be ſaid <hi>not to do righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They that live in the general courſe of a wicked life; in the practiſe of great and known ſins, as injuſtice, intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, filthy and ſenſual luſts, profane neglect and contempt of God and Religion; ſo that by the whole courſe and tenour of their actions, it is plain beyond all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial that <hi>there is no fear of God before their eyes.</hi> Concerning theſe the caſe is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident, that it ſeems too mild and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle an expreſſion to call them <hi>not doers of righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They who live in the habitual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37901:106"/>
of any one known ſin, or in the neglect of any conſiderable part of their known duty. For any vicious habit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominates a man, and puts him into an evil ſtate.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They who are guilty of the ſingle act of a very heinous and notorious crime; as a deliberate act of blaſphemy, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, perjury, fraud or oppreſſion, or of any other crime of the like enormity. For though ordinarily one ſingle act of ſin doth not denominate one a bad man, when the general courſe of the mans life is contrary; yet the ſingle acts of ſome ſorts of ſins are ſo crying and heinous, and do ſo ſtare every mans conſcience in the face, that they are juſtly eſteemed to be of equal malignity with vicious habits of an inferiour kind; becauſe they do almoſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe a great depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mind, and a monſtrous aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God and goodneſs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that deliberately commits them. And they who are guilty in any of theſe three degrees now mentioned, are moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>not doers of righteouſneſs,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is <hi>manifeſt</hi> that they are not <hi>the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, I ſhall enquire who they are, that in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſenſe may
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37901:107"/>
be ſaid to <hi>do righteouſneſs.</hi> In ſhort, they who in the general courſe of their lives do keep the Commandments of God. And thus the <hi>Scripture</hi> generally expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this matter, by <hi>keeping the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> and by <hi>having reſpect to all his commandments,</hi> by <hi>obedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt,</hi> by being <hi>holy in all manner of converſation</hi>; by <hi>abſtaining from all kind of evil,</hi> by <hi>cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> and by <hi>practiſing holineſs in the fear of God:</hi> To which I ſhall add the deſcription which St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us of the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Luk. 1.6, <hi>They were both righteous before God, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the commandments and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lord blameleſs.</hi> All which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions do plainly ſignifie the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of our lives and actions, in the general courſe and tenour of them, to the Laws and commands of God. And this implies theſe two things; That <hi>the tenour of our lives and actions be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Laws of God:</hi> And that <hi>theſe actions be done with a ſincere and upright mind,</hi> out of regard to God and another World, and not for low and temporal ends.</p>
            <p>And I chuſe rather to deſcribe a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37901:107"/>
man by the actual conformity of the general courſe of his actions to the Law of God, than (as ſome have done) by a ſincere Deſire or reſolution of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. For a deſire may be ſincere for the time it laſts, and yet vaniſh before it come to any real effect. And how inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently ſoever it was intended, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great miſtake in Divinity, and of very dangerous conſequence to the ſouls of men, to affirm that a Deſire of grace is grace; and conſequently, by the ſame reaſon, that a deſire of obedience, is obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. A ſincere deſire and reſolution to be good is indeed a good beginning, and ought by all means to be cheriſhed and encouraged; but yet it is far enough from being the thing deſired, or from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accepted for it in the eſteem of God: For God never accepts the Deſire for the deed, but where there is no poſſibility, no opportunity of doing the thing deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but if there be, and the thing be not done, there is no reaſon to imagine that the deſire in that caſe ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as if the thing were done. For inſtance, If a man give alms according to his ability, and would give more if he were able, in this caſe the deſire is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the deed. And of this caſe it is
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37901:108"/>
and no other, that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12, <hi>If there be firſt a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> That is, God interprets and accepts the charity of men according to the largeneſs of their hearts, and not according to the ſtraitneſs of their fortunes: But it is a great miſtake, to draw a general conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from this Text, that in all caſes God accepts the will for the deed. For though a man ſincerely deſire and reſolve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his life (as I doubt not many men often do) but do it not, when there is time and opportunity for it, theſe deſires and reſolutions are of no account with God; all this <hi>righteouſneſs is but as the morning cloud, and as the early dew which paſſeth away.</hi> Men are not apt to miſtake ſo groſly in other matters. No man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves hunger to be meat, or thirſt to be drink; and yet there is no doubt of the truth and ſincerity of theſe natural deſires. No man thinks that covetouſneſs or a greedy deſire to be rich, is an eſtate; or that ambition or an inſatiable deſire of honour is really advancement: Juſt ſo, and no otherwiſe, a deſire to be good is righteouſneſs. The <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> caution a little before the Text may fitly be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37901:108"/>
to this purpoſe, <hi>Little children, let no man deceive you: He that doth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is righteous, even as he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Not but that the beſt of men do ſometimes fall through infirmity, and are betrayed by ſurpriſe, and born down by the violence of temptation; but if the general courſe of our actions be a <hi>doing of righteouſneſs,</hi> the grace of the Goſpel, in and through the merits of our bleſſed Saviour, doth accept of this imperfect but ſincere obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew, that by this mark every man may, with due care and diligence, arrive at the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his ſpiritual eſtate and condition. <hi>By this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil: Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God.</hi> By which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> means, that this is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al mark of difference betwixt good and bad men, and that whereby they very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten manifeſt themſelves to others; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the courſe of their lives is eminently pious and virtuous, or notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly impious and wicked. But becauſe it doth not ſo much concern us curiouſly to enquire into, much leſs ſeverely to cenſure the ſtate of other men, I ſhall
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37901:109"/>
only conſider at preſent, how far by this mark and character every man may make a certain judgment of his own good or bad condition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this character, as I have explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, he that is a bad man may certainly know himſelf to be ſo, if he will but conſider his condition, and do not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deceive and delude himſelf. As for thoſe who are vicious in the general courſe of their lives, or have been guilty of the act of ſome heinous and notorious ſin, not yet repented of; their caſe is ſo plain, for the moſt part, even to themſelves, that they can have no manner of doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. Such men ſtand continually convicted, and condemned by the ſentence of their own minds: and whenever they reflect upon themſelves (which they do as ſeldom as they can) they are <hi>a terrour to themſelves,</hi> and full of amazement and fearful expectation of judgment. Not but that, even in ſo plain a caſe, many men do uſe great endeavour to cheat themſelves; and would be very glad to find out ways to reconclle a wicked life with the hopes of Heaven, and to gain the favour, at leaſt the forgiveneſs of God, without repentance and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their lives. And to this end they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37901:109"/>
are willing to confeſs their ſins, and to undergo any Pennance that ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon them, that only excepted which only can do them good, I mean, real reformation. And when the Prieſt hath abſolv'd them, they would fain believe that God hath forgiven them too; however, they return to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe, and being ſtrongly addicted to their luſts, between ſtupidity and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh hopes, they at laſt come to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate reſolution, to venture all upon the abſolution of the Prieſt, <hi>Et valeat quantum valere poteſt,</hi> let it have what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it can; though I dare ſay, that in their moſt ſerious thoughts they are hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly afraid it will do them no good.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe who are ſinners of a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer rate, and perhaps allow themſelves only in one kind of vice, they likewiſe have reaſon to conclude themſelves in a bad condition; eſpecially if they conſider that he who lives in the breach of any one commandment of God is guilty of all, becauſe he contemns that authority which enacted the whole Law. And 'tis eaſie for any man to diſcern the habit of any ſin in himſelf; as when he frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commits it, when he takes up no firm
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37901:110"/>
reſolutions againſt it, when he uſeth no competent care to avoid the temptations to it, nor puts forth any vigorous endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to break off from it; or however, ſtill continues in the practice of it. For the cuſtomary practice of any known ſin, is utterly inconſiſtent with ſincere reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and endeavours againſt it; there being no greater evidence of the inſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of reſolutions and endeavours in any kind, than ſtill to go on to do contrary to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By this character likewiſe, they that are ſincerely good may generally be well aſſured of their good condition, and that they are <hi>the children of God.</hi> And there are but two things neceſſary to evidence this to them; That the general courſe and tenour of their actions be agreeable to the Laws of God; and That they be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and upright in thoſe actions. And both theſe every man may ſufficiently know concerning himſelf; for if the Laws of God be plain, and lye open to every mans underſtanding, then is it as eaſie for every man to know when he obeys God and keeps his commandments, as when he obeys the commands of his Father or his Prince, and when he keeps the known
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37901:110"/>
Laws of the Land. And no ſenſible and conſiderate man ever had any doubt of this kind; for if a man can know any thing, he can certainly tell when he keeps or breaks a known Law; ſo that all doubts of this nature are frivolous and idle pretences to cover mens faults, and ſuch as they would be aſhamed to alledg in any other caſe.</p>
            <p>And a good man may likewiſe know when he obeys God ſincerely. Not but that men often deceive themſelves with an opinion, or at leaſt a groundleſs hope of their own ſincerity; but if they will deal fairly with themſelves, and uſe due care and diligence, there are very few caſes (if any) wherein they may not know their own ſincerity in any act of obedience to God: For what can a man know concerning himſelf, if not the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of his own intentions? If any man ſhould in earneſt tell me, that he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much whether he had that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for me which he made profeſſion of, and that he was afraid that his affection to me was not real and ſincere, I confeſs I ſhould doubt of it too; becauſe I ſhould certainly conclude that no man could know that matter ſo well as he himſelf. And there is no doubt but whoever hath
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37901:111"/>
a hearty kindneſs for another, and a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire to ſerve and pleaſe him, knows he has it. And accordingly good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men in Scripture do every where with great confidence and aſſurance appeal to God, concerning the integrity and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their hearts towards him: <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in the <hi>old</hi> Teſtament; and in the <hi>new</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> for himſelf and <hi>Timothy,</hi> makes this ſolemn profeſſion of their ſincerity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12, <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity we have our converſation in the world.</hi> And I cannot call to mind ſo much as any one paſſage in Scripture, from whence it can be collected that any good man ever doubted of his own ſincerity: And to ſay the truth, it would not be modeſty but impudence in any man to declare that he ſuſpects himſelf of hypocriſie; good men have always abhorred the thoughts of it. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of Job,</hi> and yet he could not bear to have his integrity queſtioned. It was a brave and a generous ſpeech of his, <hi>Till I dye, I will not remove my integrity from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet it hath ſo happened, that <hi>this</hi> is become a very common doubt among religious people; and they have been ſo
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37901:111"/>
unreaſonably cheriſhed in it, as to have it made a conſiderable evidence of a mans ſincerity to doubt of it himſelf. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſaid in Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9, <hi>That the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked; who can know it?</hi> which is true concerning our future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions and actions; no man knowing how his mind may change hereafter. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle did <hi>Hazael</hi> think that ever he ſhould do thoſe things which the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him. But though this be true in it ſelf, yet 'tis not the meaning of that Text. For the Prophet in that <hi>chapter</hi> plainly makes uſe of this conſideration of the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and deceitfulneſs of mans heart, as an argument to take off the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> from <hi>truſting in the arm of fleſh,</hi> and in thoſe promiſes which were made to them of forreign aſſiſtance from <hi>Egypt:</hi> Becauſe men may pretend fair, and yet deceive thoſe that rely upon them; for <hi>the heart of man is deceitful and deſperately wicked,</hi> and none but God knows whether mens inward intentions be anſwerable to their outward profeſſions; for <hi>he ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart and tryeth the reins.</hi> And this, I verily believe, is all that the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> here intends, That there is a great deal of fraud and deceit in the hearts of bad
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37901:112"/>
men, ſo that no man can rely upon their promiſes and profeſſions; but God knows the hearts of all men. But now becauſe God alone knows the hearts of all men, and the ſincerity of their intentions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, doth it from hence follow that it is a thing either impoſſible or very difficult for any man to know the ſincerity of his own preſent intentions and actions? To make any ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were to <hi>condemn the generation of Gods children,</hi> thoſe holy and excellent men in Scripture, <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who do ſo frequently appeal to God concerning their own integrity. And ſurely when the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man knows the things of a man, but the ſpirit of a man which is in him,</hi> he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſes that every man is conſcious to the motions and intentions of his own mind. I have inſiſted the longer upon this, that I might from the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſtroy an imagination, which is not only untrue in it ſelf, but has likewiſe been a very great hindrance to the peace and comfort of many good men.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Let us enquire whence it comes to paſs, that notwithſtanding this, ſo many perſons are at ſo great uncertainty about their ſpiritual condition. For the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:37901:112"/>
of this matter, we will diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The grounds of the falſe hopes and confidence of men really bad, concerning their good condition. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The cauſeleſs doubts and jealouſies of men really good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their bad condition. And <hi>thirdly,</hi> The juſt cauſes of doubting in others. As for the troubles and fears of men who are notoriouſly bad, and live in the practice of known vices, theſe do not fall under our conſideration: If they be troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their condition, it is no more than what they ought to be; and if they be only doubtful of it, it is leſs than they ought to be. To perſons in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is only counſel to be given, to leave their ſins and become better; but no comfort to be adminiſtred to them, till firſt they have followed that counſel: For till they reform, if they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be in a bad condition, they think juſt as they ought, and as there is great reaſon; and no body ſhould go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to perſwade them otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, we will conſider the grounds of the falſe hopes and confidence of men really bad concerning their good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I do not now mean the worſt of men, but ſuch as make ſome ſhew and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37901:113"/>
of goodneſs. It is very unpleaſing to men to fall under the hard opinion and cenſure of others, but the moſt grievous thing in the world for a man to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by himſelf; and therefore it is no wonder that men uſe all manner of ſhifts to avoid ſo great an inconvenience as is the ill opinion of a mans ſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf and his own condition.</p>
            <p>Some therefore rely upon the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith and their being baptized into it. But this is ſo far from being any exemption from a good life, that it is the greateſt and moſt ſolemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to it. Doſt thou believe the Doctrine of the Goſpel? thou of all men art inexcuſable if thou alloweſt thy ſelf in ungodlineſs and worldly luſts.</p>
            <p>Others truſt to their external Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they frequent the Church and ſerve God conſtantly, they pray to him, and hear his word, and receive the bleſſed Sacrament: But let us not deceive our ſelves, God is not mocked. All this is ſo far from making amends for the impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of our lives, that on the contrary, the impiety of our lives ſpoils all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of our devotions. <hi>He that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away his ear from hearing the Law (that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:37901:113"/>
is,</hi> from obeying it) <hi>even his prayer ſhall be an abomination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others, who are ſenſible they are very bad, depend very much upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, eſpecially if they ſet ſolemn times apart for it. And there is no doubt but that a ſincere repentance will put a man into a good condition: But then it is to be conſidered, that no repentance is ſincere but that which produceth a real change and reformation in our lives. For we have not repented to purpoſe, if we return again to our ſins. It is well thou art in ſome meaſure ſenſible of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarriage, but thou art never ſafe till thou haſt forſaken thy ſins; thy eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition towards God is not chang'd, till thou haſt really alter'd thy ſelf and the courſe of thy life.</p>
            <p>Others ſatisfie themſelves with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of ſome particular graces and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Juſtice, and Liberality, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. And is it not a thouſand pities that thy life is not all of a piece, and that all the other parts of it are not anſwerable to theſe; that thou ſhouldeſt loſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſo much real goodneſs, out of thy fondneſs to any one vice or luſt; that when <hi>thou art not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> for <hi>lack</hi> of one or two things
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:37901:114"/>
more thou ſhouldſt fall ſhort of it? Haſt thou never heard what the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>he who offends in one point is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour of the whole Law?</hi> To make a man a good man, all parts of goodneſs muſt concur, but any one way of wickedneſs is ſufficient to denominate a man bad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Some, who are very careful of their outward carriage and converſation, but yet are conſcious to themſelves of great ſecret faults and vices, when they can find no comfort from themſelves, and the teſtimony of their own conſciences, are apt to comfort themſelves in the good opinion which perhaps others have of them. But if we know our ſelves to be bad, and <hi>our own hearts do condemn us</hi>; it is not the good opinion of others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us which can either alter or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our condition. They may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their charity, and yet thou none for thy confidence. Truſt no body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy ſelf rather than thy ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no body can know thee ſo well as thou mayſt know thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch as theſe, are the hopes of the hypocrite, which <hi>Job</hi> elegantly compares to <hi>the ſpiders web,</hi> finely and artificially wrought, but miſerably thin and weak; ſo that we our ſelves may ſee
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37901:114"/>
through them, and if we lay the leaſt ſtreſs upon them they will break. They are but pleaſant dreams and deluſions, which whenever we are awaken'd to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of our condition by apprehenſions of approaching death and judgment, will preſently vaniſh and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear; ſo the ſame <hi>holy man</hi> tells us, <hi>Job</hi> 27.8, <hi>What is the hope of the hypocrite, when God taketh away his Soul</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We will conſider in the next place the cauſeleſs doubts and jealouſies of men really good, concerning their bad condition. For as ſome are prone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all reaſon to delude themſelves with vain hopes of their good condition, ſo others are apt as unreaſonably to torment themſelves with groundleſs fears and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies that their eſtate is bad. And of theſe doubts there are ſeveral occaſions, the chief whereof I ſhall mention, by which we may judg of the reſt that are of the like nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are afraid that they are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated from all eternity, and therefore they cannot be the <hi>children of God.</hi> This is ſo unreaſonable, that if it were not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al cauſe of trouble to ſome perſons, it did not deſerve to be conſidered. For no man that ſincerely endeavours to pleaſe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37901:115"/>
God and to keep his commandments, hath from Scripture the leaſt ground to ſuſpect any latent or ſecret decree of God againſt him, that ſhall work his ruin. But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the decrees of God be concerning the eternal ſtate of men, ſince they are ſecret to us, they can certainly be no rule either of our duty or comfort. And no man hath reaſon to think himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of God, either from eternity, or in time, that does not find the marks of Reprobation in himſelf, I mean an evil heart and life. By this indeed a man may know that he is out of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the preſent, but he hath no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all, from hence to conclude that God hath from all eternity and for ever caſt him off. That God calls him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and affords to him the ſpace and means of it, is a much plainer ſign that God is willing and ready to have mercy on him, than any thing elſe is, or can be, that God hath utterly caſt him off. And therefore for men to judg of their condition by the decrees of God which are hid from us, and not by his word which is <hi>near us and in our hearts,</hi> is as if a man wandring in the wide ſea, in a dark night when the heaven is all clouded about him, ſhould yet reſolve to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:37901:115"/>
ſteer his courſe by the ſtars, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee, but only gueſs at; and neglect the Compaſs, which is at hand and would afford him a much better and more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain direction. This therefore is to be rejected as a fond and groundleſs imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and which ought to trouble no body, becauſe no body doth, nor can know any thing concerning it. <hi>Moſes</hi> hath long ſince very well determin'd this matter, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29, <hi>Secret things belong unto the Lord our God, but thoſe things which are revealed, unto us, and to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Good men are conſcious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of many frailties and imperfections, and therefore they are afraid of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But God conſiders the infirmities of our preſent ſtate, and expects no other obedience from us, in order to our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him, but what this ſtate of imperfection is capable of: And provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſincere endeavour and general courſe of our lives be to pleaſe him and keep his Commandments, the terms of the Goſpel are ſo merciful, that our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall not be imputed to us, ſo as to affect our main ſtate, and to make us ceaſe to be the children of God. And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37901:116"/>
though we may be guilty of many errours and ſecret ſins which eſcape our notice and obſervation, yet it is not impoſſible for us to exerciſe ſuch a repentance for theſe as will be available for their pardon. For we have to deal with a merciful God, who is pleaſed to accept of ſuch an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and of ſuch a repentance as we are capable of performing. Now there is a great difference between thoſe ſins which require a particular repentance before we can hope for the pardon of them, (as all great and deliberate and preſumptuous ſins do, which are never committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our knowledg, and are ſo far from ſlipping out of our memory, that they are continually flying in our faces, and we cannot forget them if we would) and ſins of infirmity occaſion'd by ſurpriſe and violence of temptation, through ignorance or inadvertency: For a general repentance, ſuch as we every day exerciſe in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions and prayers to God, may ſuffice for theſe. I ſpeak not this to hinder any from a more particular repentance of all their known failings, the more particular the better; but to remove the groundleſs fears and jealouſies of men about their main eſtate and condition. And if any ask, how I know that a general repentance
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:37901:116"/>
will ſuffice for theſe kind of ſins; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Becauſe more than this in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is impoſſible; ſo that either we muſt reſt ſatisfied that God will forgive them upon theſe terms, or conclude that they ſhall not be forgiven at all, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole tenour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: I ſay, in many caſes, more than this is impoſſible, becauſe ſins of ignorance, and thoſe common errours and frailties of human life, which <hi>David</hi> calls <hi>ſecret ſins,</hi> are not particularly known to us when they are committed, and conſequently it is impoſſible that we ſhould particularly repent of them. And therefore in this caſe there can be no doubt but that God doth accept of a general repentance, as he did from <hi>David</hi> when he made that humble confeſſion and prayer to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.12, <hi>Who can underſtand his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours? cleanſe thou me from ſecret ſins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They are afraid their obedience is not ſincere, becauſe it proceeds many times from fear, and not always out of pure love to God. For anſwer to this: It is plain from Scripture, that God propounds to men ſeveral motives and arguments to obedience; ſome proper to work upon their <hi>fear,</hi> as the threatnings of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſome upon their <hi>hope,</hi> as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37901:117"/>
of bleſſing and reward; others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>love,</hi> as the mercies and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. From whence it is evident he intended they ſhould all work upon us. And accordingly the Scripture gives us inſtances in each kind. <hi>Noah moved with fear</hi> obeyed God in <hi>preparing an Ark: Moſes had reſpect unto the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Mary Magdalen loved much.</hi> And as it is hard to ſay, ſo it is not neceſſary to determine juſt how much influence and no more each of theſe hath upon us: It is very well if men be reclaimed from their ſins and made good, by the joint force of all the conſiderations which God offers to us. To be ſure, Love is the nobleſt and moſt generous principle of obedience, but fear commonly takes the firſt and faſteſt hold of us, and in times of violent temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is perhaps the beſt argument to keep, even the beſt of men, within the bounds of their duty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another cauſe of doubting in good men is, from a ſenſe of their imperfect performance of the duties of Religion, and of the abatement of their affections towards God at ſome times. They have many wandring thoughts in prayer and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exerciſes of devotion, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for their life keep their minds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:37901:117"/>
intent on what they are about. This we ſhould ſtrive againſt as much as we can, and that is the utmoſt we can do; but to cure this wholly is impoſſible, the infirmity of our nature and the frame of our minds will not admit of it: And therefore no man ought to queſtion his ſincerity, becauſe he cannot do that which is impoſſible for men to do.</p>
            <p>And then for the abatement of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to God and Religion at ſome times, this naturally proceeds from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of mens tempers, by reaſon of which it is not poſſible that the beſt of men ſhould be able always to maintain and keep up the ſame degree of zeal and fervour towards God. But our comfort is, that God doth not meaſure mens ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity by the Tides of their affections, but by the conſtant bent of their reſolutions, and the general tenour of their life and actions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another cauſe of theſe doubts is, that men expect more than ordinary and reaſonable aſſurance of their good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſome particular revelation from God, and extraordinary impreſſion upon their minds, to that purpoſe, which they think the Scripture means by the <hi>teſtimony</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>earneſt of the Spirit.</hi> God
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:37901:118"/>
may give this when, and to whom he pleaſes; but I do not find he hath any where promiſed it. And all that the Scripture means by thoſe phraſes of the <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>ſeal,</hi> and <hi>earneſt of the Spirit,</hi> is to my apprehenſion no more but this, That the Holy Spirit which God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Chriſtians in ſo powerful and ſenſible a manner was a <hi>ſeal</hi> and <hi>earneſt</hi> of their reſurrection to eternal life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that plain Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11, <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.</hi> But then, who they are that have the Spirit of God, is only to be known by the real fruits and effects of it. If we be <hi>led by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>walk in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and <hi>do not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> then <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt dwelleth in us.</hi> But this is very far from an immediate and extraordinary revelation from the Spirit of God to the minds of good men, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in particular that they are the children of God. I know not what pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar favour God may ſhew to ſome, but I know no ſuch thing, nor ever yet met with any wiſe and good man that did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it of himſelf: And I fear that in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:37901:118"/>
moſt of thoſe who pretend to it, it is either meer fancy or groſs deluſion.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As for the caſe of <hi>melancholy,</hi> it is not a reaſonable caſe, and therefore doth not fall under any certain rules and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. They who are under the power of it, are ſeldom fit to take that counſel which alone is fit to be given them; and <hi>that</hi> is, not to believe themſelves concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, but to truſt the judgment of others rather than their own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. In other caſes every man knows himſelf beſt, but a melancholy man is moſt in the dark as to himſelf. This cauſe of trouble and doubting is very much to be pitied, but hard to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſs by phyſick, or by time, or by chance. One may happen to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may hit the humour of a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy man, and ſatisfie him for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but Reaſon muſt needs ſignifie very little to thoſe perſons, the nature of whoſe diſtemper it is to turn every thing that can be ſaid for their comfort into objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But beſides thoſe who miſtake their condition, either by preſuming it to be better, or fearing it to be worſe than it is; there are likewiſe others who upon good grounds are doubtful of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37901:119"/>
and have reaſon to be afraid of it: Thoſe I mean, who have ſome beginnings of goodneſs, which yet are very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: They have good reſolutions, and do many things well, but they often fall, and are frequently pull'd back by thoſe evil inclinations and habits which are yet in a great meaſure unſubdued in them. Theſe I cannot liken better than to the <hi>Borderers</hi> between two Countries, who live in the marches and confines of two powerful Kingdoms, both which have a great influence upon them, ſo that it is hard to ſay whoſe ſubjects they are, and to which Prince they belong: Thus it is with many in Religion, They have pious inclinations, and have made ſome fair at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts towards goodneſs; they have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to refrain from ſin, and to reſiſt the occaſions and temptations to it; but ever and anon they are maſtered by their old luſts, and carryed off from their beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions; and perhaps upon a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration they repent and recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again; and after a while are again entangled and overcome.</p>
            <p>Now the caſe of theſe perſons is really doubtful, both to themſelves and others. And the proper direction to be given them, in order to their peace and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:37901:119"/>
is by all means to encourage them to go on and fortifie their good reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; to be more vigilant and watchful over themſelves, to ſtrive againſt ſin and to reſiſt it with all their might. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſucceſs of their endeavours in this conflict, the evidence of their good condition will every day clear up and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more manifeſt: The more we grow in grace, and the ſeldomer we fall into ſin, and the more even and conſtant our obedience to God is, ſo much the greater and fuller ſatisfaction we ſhall have of our good eſtate towards God: For <hi>the path of the juſt is as the ſhining light, which ſhines more and more unto the perfect day:</hi> And <hi>the work of righteouſneſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſneſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only make two or three Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from what hath been diſcourſed upon this Argument, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence we learn the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſins of Omiſſion as well as Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; <hi>Whoſoever doth not righteouſneſs, is not of God.</hi> The mere neglect of any of the great duties of Religion, of piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and of kindneſs and charity to men, though we be free from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37901:120"/>
of great ſins, is enough to caſt us out of the favour of God, and to ſhut us for ever out of his kingdom; <hi>I was hungry and ye gave me no meat, thirſty, and ye gave me no drink, ſick and in priſon and ye viſited me not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore depart ye curſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is evident from what hath been ſaid, That nothing can be vainer than for men to live in any courſe of ſin and impiety, and yet to pretend to be the Children of God, and to hope for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. The Children of God will do the works of God, and whoever hopes to enjoy him hereafter will endeavour to be like him here; <hi>Every man that hath this hope in Him, purifies himſelf, even as He is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. You ſee what is the great mark and character of a mans good or bad condition; <hi>whoſoever doth righteouſneſs is of God, and whoſoever doth not righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is not of God.</hi> Here is a plain and ſenſible evidence by which every man that will deal honeſtly with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mſelf may certainly know his own condition; and then according as he finds it to be, may take comfort in it, or make haſte out of it. And we need not aſcend into heaven nor go down
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37901:120"/>
into the deep, to ſearch out the ſecret counſels and decrees of God; there needs no anxious enquiry whether we be of the number of Gods elect: If we daily mortifie our luſts, and grow in goodneſs, and take care to add to our faith and knowledg, temperance and patience and charity, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſtian graces and vertues, we certainly take the beſt courſe in the world to <hi>make our calling and election ſure.</hi> And without this, it is impoſſible that we ſhould have any comfortable and well grounded aſſurance of our good condition. This one mark of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteouſneſs</hi> is that into which all other ſigns and characters, which are in Scripture given of a good man, are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſolved: And this anſwers all thoſe various phraſes, which ſome men would make to be ſo many ſeveral and diſtinct marks of a <hi>child of God</hi>; As whether we have the true knowledg of God and divine illumination, for <hi>hereby we know that we know him if we keep his commandments:</hi> Whether we ſincerely love God, for <hi>this is the love of God that we keep his commandments:</hi> And whether God loves us, for <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37901:121"/>
his countenance will behold the upright.</hi> Whether we be regenerate and born of God, for <hi>whoſoever is born of God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not:</hi> Whether we have <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God witneſſing with our Spirits that we are the children of God,</hi> for <hi>as many as have the Spirit of God are led by the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>by the Spirit do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the deeds of the fleſh:</hi> Whether we belong to Chriſt, and have an intereſt in him or not, for <hi>they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and luſts thereof:</hi> In a word, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the promiſe of heaven and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life belong to us, for <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> but if we <hi>have our fruit unto holineſs, the end</hi> will be <hi>everlaſting life.</hi> So that you ſee at laſt, the Scripture brings all to this one mark, <hi>viz.</hi> holineſs and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of God, or a vicious and wicked life; <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt, and the children of the Devil: Whoſoever doth not righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then deal impartially with our ſelves, and bring our lives and actions to this tryal; and never be at reſt till the matter be brought to ſome iſſue, and we have made a deliberate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:37901:121"/>
of our condition, whether we be <hi>the children of God</hi> or not. And if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a full and fair examination, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences give us this teſtimony, that by the grace of God we have <hi>denyed ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and worldly luſts,</hi> and have <hi>lived ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and righteouſly and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world,</hi> we may take joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in it; for <hi>if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God:</hi> But if upon the ſearch and tryal of our ways our caſe appear clearly to be otherwiſe, or if we have juſt cauſe to doubt of it, let us not venture to continue one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer in ſo uncertain and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a condition. And if we deſire to know the way of Peace, the Scripture hath ſet it plainly before us, <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well: Come now and let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your ſins be as ſcarlet they ſhall be white as ſnow: Let the wicked forſake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Though our caſe be very bad, yet it is not deſperate; <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all men
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37901:122"/>
to be embraced, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners:</hi> And he is ſtill willing to ſave us, if we be but willing to leave our ſins, and to ſerve him in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs the remaining part of our lives. We may yet be <hi>turned from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God:</hi> We who have ventured ſo long upon the brink of ruin, may yet by the infinite mercies of God, and by the power of his grace, be reſcu'd from the baſe and miſerable ſlavery of the Devil and our luſts <hi>into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have endeavoured, with all the plainneſs I could, to repreſent every man to himſelf, and to let him clearly ſee what his condition is towards God, and how the caſe of his ſoul and of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs ſtands. And I do verily believe that what I have ſaid in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the truth of God, to which we ought all gladly to yield and render up our ſelves. For <hi>great is Truth, and mighty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things:</hi> She is faithful and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial in her counſels, and though ſhe be not always welcome, yet 'tis always wiſe to hearken to her, for in great kindneſs and charity ſhe lets men know their condition and the danger of it, that they may take
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37901:122"/>
care to prevent it: <hi>With her is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of perſons, and in her judgment there is no unrighteouſneſs.</hi> I will conclude all with that excellent advice of a Heathen Philoſopher,<note rend="inter">
                  <hi>Antonin.</hi> lib. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Make it no longer a matter of diſpute what are the marks and ſigns of a good man, but immediately ſet about it, and endeavour to become ſuch an one.</hi>

But when I conſider the infinite patience of God with ſinners, and how long <hi>his ſpirit ſtrives with them</hi>; why ſhould we, <hi>we</hi> who are ſinners our ſelves, think much to bear with ſinners, and patiently to contend with their obſtinacy and perverſeneſs? When
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37901:125"/>
I conſider that our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> the great Preacher and Pattern of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, did not give over the worſt of men, nor deſpair of their recovery: this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſhould make us, who are <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours for Chriſt,</hi> unwearied in <hi>beſeeching men in his ſtead to be reconciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of this we have a famous inſtance in this <hi>Chapter:</hi> The Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as they had done ſeveral times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, came to hear our Saviour: He treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them very kindly, and converſed fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with them; at this the Phariſees were diſpleaſed, and murmured, and this unreaſonable murmuring of theirs gave occaſion to the three <hi>Parables</hi> in this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which our Saviour does at once anſwer the objection of the Phariſees, and give all poſſible encouragement to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of theſe great ſinners. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Phariſees, by letting them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that he was about the beſt work in the world, the moſt acceptable to God, and matter of greateſt joy to all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inhabitants. Inſtead of a ſevere reproof of their uncharitableneſs, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers that calmly to their conſideration which ought in all reaſon to convince them, that he was no ways to blame for
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37901:125"/>
this familiar converſation of his with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; having no other deſign upon them but to reclaim them from their vices, and to make them fit company for the beſt of men; that he was a ſpiritual Phyſitian, and therefore his proper work and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment lay among his Patients. And then, inſtead of terrifying theſe ſinners, who ſeemed to come with a good mind to be inſtructed by him, he gently inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the moſt winning arguments and the greateſt encouragements to repentance by ſhewing how ready God was, after all their ſins and provocations, to receive them to his grace and favour, provided they did ſincerely repent and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a better courſe: And not only ſo, but that the repentance of a ſinner is great joy to the great King of the world, and to all that holy and heavenly hoſt that attend upon him.</p>
            <p>From which method of our Saviour, in treating ſo great ſinners ſo gently, I cannot but make this obſervation, for my own uſe, as well as for others; That it is good to give, even the greateſt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, all the encouragement we can to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and though men have been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo bad, yet if they have but this one good quality left in them, that they are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37901:126"/>
patient to be inſtructed, and content to hear good counſel, we ſhould uſe them kindly, and endeavour to recover them by the faireſt means; not ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding them for their having been bad, as encouraging them to become bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe our Saviour uttered <hi>three</hi> Parables; of <hi>the recovery of a loſt ſheep</hi>; of <hi>finding a loſt piece of money</hi>; of <hi>the return of a prodigal ſon to his father.</hi> And though they all aim at the ſame ſcope and deſign, yet our Saviour uſeth this variety, not only to convey the ſame thing to ſeveral capacities in a more acceptable manner, one ſimilitude happening to hit one perſon, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another; but likewiſe to inculcate ſo weighty a matter the more upon his hearers, and to fix it more deeply in their minds.</p>
            <p>The words which I have read are the Moral or Application of the firſt <hi>Parable,</hi> concerning a man who had an hundred ſheep, and having loſt one, leaves the ninety and nine to go to ſeek that which was loſt; and having found it, with great joy brings it home. By which our Saviour gives us to underſtand, what joy God, and the bleſſed Spirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37901:126"/>
take in the converſion of a ſinner. <hi>I ſay unto you, that likewiſe joy ſhall be in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which need no repentance.</hi> Than which nothing could have been more proper, both to ſilence the uncharitable murmuring of the Phariſees againſt our Saviour, for converſing with publicans and ſinners to ſo good an end; and likewiſe to encourage ſinners to repent: For why ſhould the Phariſees be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at that, which was ſo great a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to God and the holy Angels? and what greater encouragement to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance than this, that God is not only wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive the returning ſinner, but that the news of his repentance is enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in heaven with ſo much joy, that if it be poſſible for the bleſſed Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of that place to have any thing added to their happineſs, this will be a new acceſſion to it?</p>
            <p>There are <hi>three</hi> things in the words which require a very careful explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How we are to underſtand the <hi>joy</hi> that is <hi>in heaven</hi> at the converſion of a ſinner?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who are here meant by the <hi>juſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37901:127"/>
perſons that need no repentance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. With what reaſon it is here ſaid, that there is <hi>more joy in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine juſt perſons who need no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is ſomething of difficulty in each of theſe, which deſerves our heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and attentive conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">I. How we are to underſtand the <hi>joy that is in heaven at the repentance of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</hi> And this (as indeed this whole paſſage of our Saviours) we are not to underſtand too ſtrictly and rigorouſly, but as ſpoken in a great meaſure after the manner of men, and by way of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to our capacity, ſo far as the perſons here ſpoken of are capable of any addition to their joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>As it refers <hi>to God,</hi> it ſeems very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the happineſs and perfection of the Divine nature to ſuppoſe Him really capable of joy, any more than of grief or any other paſſion. Becauſe this would be to imagine ſome new acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his pleaſure and happineſs, which being always infinite, can never have any thing added to it. And therefore we are
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37901:127"/>
to underſtand this, as it relates to God, in the ſame manner as we do infinite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages of Scripture, where humane paſſions are aſcribed to him, to be ſpoken by way of condeſcenſion, and after the language and manner of the ſons of men; and to ſignifie only thus much to us, that the converſion of a ſinner is a thing highly pleaſing and acceptable to God.</p>
            <p>As it refers to <hi>Angels,</hi> and other <hi>bleſſed Spirits,</hi> I ſee no inconvenience why it may not be underſtood more ſtrictly and literally; that they conceive a new joy at the news of a ſinners repentance, and find a freſh pleaſure and delight ſpringing up in their minds whenever they hear the joyful tydings of a ſinner reſcued from the ſlavery of the Devil, and the danger of eternal damnation; of a new member added to the Kingdom of God, that ſhall be a companion and ſharer with them in that bleſſedneſs which they enjoy. There ſeems to me to be nothing in this repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the nature and happineſs of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirits in another world. For it is certain, that there are degrees of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among the bleſſed: From whence it neceſſarily follows, that ſome of them may be happier than they are. And it is very probable, ſince the happineſs of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37901:128"/>
and good men is but finite, that thoſe who are moſt happy do continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new additions to their bleſſedneſs; and that their felicity is never at a ſtand, but perpetually growing and improving to all eternity; and that as their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and love do encreaſe, ſo likewiſe the capacity and cauſes of their happineſs are ſtill more and more enlarged and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented: So that it is reaſonable enough to ſuppoſe, that there is really joy among the Angels and Spirits of juſt men made perfect, over every ſinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Who are here meant by the <hi>juſt perſons who need no repentance?</hi> That our Saviour in this expreſſion gives ſome glance and reflection upon the <hi>Phariſees</hi> (who prided themſelves in their own righteouſneſs; and inſtead of confeſſing their ſins to God, ſtood upon their own juſtification, as if they needed no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) is very probable; becauſe this <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> was deſigned to anſwer their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings againſt him, for converſing with publicans and ſinners; and by the by to give a check to thoſe who were ſo conceited of their own righteouſneſs, as if they had no need of repentance. And
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37901:128"/>
this is very ſuitable to what our Saviour elſewhere ſays to them upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that <hi>the whole have no need of the Phyſitian, but the ſick</hi>; that <hi>he came not to call the righteous, but the ſinners to repentance.</hi> But yet though our Saviour expreſſeth himſelf ſo as that the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees might with reaſon enough apply it to themſelves, that there was more joy in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine of <hi>them,</hi> who were ſo conceited of their own righteouſneſs, that they thought they had no need of repentance (for indeed our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers himſelf ſo, as to leave room for ſuch a ſevere application) yet I think there is little doubt to be made but that he intended ſomething further; and that ſuppoſing the Phariſees were as juſt as they pretended, and were really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, ſo as to ſtand in no need of ſuch a repentance as great ſinners do, yet our Saviour affirms, <hi>there was more joy in heaven over one penitent ſinner, than over ninety and nine ſuch juſt perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But are there any perſons in the world ſo juſt, as abſolutely to ſtand in need of no repentance? No, there was never any ſuch perſon in the world, him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted who ſaid this, our bleſſed
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:37901:129"/>
Saviour, <hi>who had no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> And therefore this phraſe of <hi>needing no repentance</hi> is to be underſtood in a qualified ſenſe, and with ſome allowance; otherwiſe our bleſſed Saviour had ſuppoſed a caſe which never was, of a great number of perfectly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous men. And our Saviours meaning in this is ſufficiently explained in the laſt Parable of this Chapter, concerning the <hi>prodigal Son</hi>: Where the prodigal ſon is the <hi>ſinner that repented</hi>; and his elder brother, who had always obſerved and obeyed his father, he is the <hi>juſt perſon who needed no repentance.</hi> So that by him our Saviour plainly deſigns thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religiouſly educated and brought up in the fear of God, had never broke out into any extravagant and vicious courſe of life, and ſo in ſome ſenſe had no need of repentance, that is, of changing the whole courſe of their lives, as the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal ſon had. Not but that the beſt of men are guilty of many faults and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which they have too much cauſe to repent of, as our Saviour ſufficiently intimates in that <hi>Parable:</hi> For certainly it was no ſmall infirmity in the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to be ſo envious and to take ſo hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly the joyful welcome and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:37901:129"/>
which his prodigal brother at his return found from his father: But yet this ſingle fault and ſudden ſurprize of paſſion conſidering the conſtant duty which he had paid to his father throughout the courſe of his life, did not make him ſuch a ſinner as to need ſuch a repentance as his brother did, which conſiſted in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect change of the whole courſe of his life. And of ſuch <hi>juſt perſons</hi> as theſe, and of ſuch a <hi>repentance</hi> as this, it ſeems very plain that our Saviour intended this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. But the main difficulty of all is, with what reaſon it is here ſaid that <hi>there is more joy in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine juſt perſons which need no repentance?</hi> Is it not better not to offend, than to ſin and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? Is not innocence better than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, and the wiſdom of preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be preferred before that of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? Is it worth the while to do amiſs to make way for repentance; and is not this almoſt like <hi>ſinning that grace may abound?</hi> And if repentance be not better than righteouſneſs, why is there more joy in heaven over the penitent than over the righteous; nay, over one penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than over ninety and nine juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons?
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37901:130"/>
Do not the bleſſed always rejoyce moſt in that which is really beſt? Here is the difficulty; and it requires ſome care and conſideration clearly to remove it. In order to which be pleaſed to conſider theſe <hi>three</hi> things; which I think to be very material to the clearing of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That the ſame thing, conſidered in ſeveral reſpects, may in ſome reſpects have the advantage of another thing, and for thoſe reaſons be preferred before it, and yet not have the advantage of it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and in all reſpects. Moral compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not to be exacted to a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſtrictneſs and rigour. To this purpoſe I have obſerv'd in a former diſcourſe, that it was long ſince judiciouſly noted by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
               <q>That moral and proverbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſpeeches are not to be taken too ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if they were univerſally true, and in all caſes:</q>
It is ſufficient if they be true for the moſt part, and in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which are very conſiderable. And of this nature are moſt of the <hi>Proverbs</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi>; and whoſoever ſhall go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to make out the truth of them in all caſes, does in my opinion take a very hard task upon himſelf. But which is nearer to my purpoſe, our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Chapter before my Text, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:37901:130"/>
in the moral application of a Parable too, (namely that of the <hi>unjuſt ſteward</hi>) uſeth a proverbial ſpeech juſt in the ſame manner; <hi>The children of this world are in their generation wiſer than the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of light:</hi> Which is only a wiſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that is generally true, and in many reſpects, but not abſolutely, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally. For ſome men have been as wiſe and diligent for the glory of God and intereſt of their ſouls, as ever any man was for this world, and for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his temporal intereſt. Of the like nature is this ſaying uſed by our Saviour, probably taken (as our Saviour did many other proverbial ſpeeches) from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and applied to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For there are ſeveral ſayings of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters much to this purpoſe: As, <hi>Great is the dignity of penitents; Great is the vertue of them that repent, ſo that no creature may ſtand in their rank and order.</hi> And again, <hi>The righteous may not ſtand in the ſame place with thoſe that have repented.</hi> Theſe I confeſs were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high ſayings, but yet very well deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the encouragement of repentance. And they are not without good reaſon, as will appear if we conſider theſe <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the greater the difficulty
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:37901:131"/>
of vertue is, ſo much the greater is the praiſe and commendation of it: And not only we our ſelves take the more joy and comfort in it, but it is more admirable and delightful to others. Now it cannot be denyed to be much more difficult to break off a vicious habit, than to go on in a good way, which we have been train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in and always accuſtomed to. Thoſe that have been well educated have great cauſe to thank God, and to acknowledg the care of their Parents and Teachers: For piety and goodneſs are almoſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely eaſier to ſuch perſons, than to thoſe who have wanted this advantage. It is happy for them they never taſted of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful pleaſures; if they had, they would poſſibly have drank as deep as others: It is well they were never entangled in a ſinful courſe, nor enſlaved to vicious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, nor <hi>hardened through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin</hi>; if they had, they might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly never have been recovered out of the ſnare of the Devil. By the happineſs of a good education, and the merciful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God, a great part of many mens vertue conſiſts in their ignorance of vice, and their being kept out of the way of great and dangerous temptations; rather in the good cuſtoms they have been
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:37901:131"/>
bred up to, than in the deliberate choice of their wills; and rather in the happy preventions of evil, than their reſolute conſtancy in that which is good. And God, who knows what is in man, and ſees to the bottom of every man's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and inclination, knows how far this man would have fallen, had he had the temptations of other men; and how ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably perhaps, he would have been plunged in an evil courſe, had he once entered upon it. So that repentance is a very great thing; and though it be the moſt juſt, and fit, and reaſonable thing in the world, yet for all that, it deſerves great commendation, becauſe it is for the moſt part ſo very hard and difficult. And therefore, though abſolutely ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, innocence is better than repentance, yet, as the circumſtances may be, the vertue of ſome penitents may be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than of many juſt and righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is this conſideration further to recommend repentance, that they who are reclaimed from a wicked courſe, are many times more thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealouſly good afterwards: Their trouble and remorſe for their ſins does quicken and ſpur them on in the ways
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37901:132"/>
of vertue and goodneſs; and a lively ſenſe of their paſt errours is apt to make them more careful and conſcientious of their duty, more tender and fearful of offending God, and deſirous, if it were poſſible, to redeem their former miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages by their good behaviour for the future. Their love to God is uſually more vehement, and burns with a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er flame; <hi>for to whomſoever much is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, they will love much:</hi> And they are commonly more zealous for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of others; as being more ſenſible of the danger ſinners are in, and more apt to commiſerate their caſe, remembring that it was once their own condition, and with what difficulty they were reſcued from ſo great a danger. And for the moſt part great penitents are more free from pride and contempt of others, the conſideration of what themſelves once were, being enough to keep them hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble all their days. So that penitents are many times more throughly and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, and after their recovery do in ſeveral reſpects outſtrip and excel thoſe who were never engaged in a vicious courſe of life: As a broken bone that is well ſet, is ſometimes ſtronger than it was before.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:37901:132"/>2. It will conduce alſo very much to the extenuating of this difficulty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that our Saviour does not here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare repentance with abſolute innocence and perfect righteouſneſs, but with the imperfect obedience of good men, who are guilty of many ſins and infirmities; but yet upon account of the general courſe and tenour of their lives are, by the mercy and favour of the Goſpel, eſteemed juſt and righteous perſons, and for the merits and perfect obedience of our bleſſed Saviour ſo accepted by God. Now this alters the caſe very much, and brings the penitent and this ſort of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons much nearer to one another: ſo that in comparing them together, the true penitent may in ſome caſes, and in ſome reſpects, have the advantage of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and deſerve upon ſome accounts to be prefer'd before him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Which is principally to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the full clearing of this difficulty; this paſſage of our Saviours is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as ſpoken very much after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men, and ſuitably to the nature of humane paſſions, and the uſual occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of moving them. We are apt to be exceedingly affected with the obtaining of what we did not hope for, and much
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37901:133"/>
more with the regaining of what we looked upon as loſt and deſperate. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the reaſon of it, ſuch is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, that we are not ſo ſenſibly moved at the continuance of a good which we have long poſſeſt, as at the recovery of it after it was loſt and gone from us. And the reaſons of a judicious value and eſteem of a ſettled pleaſure and contentment are one thing, and the cauſes of ſudden joy and tranſport an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. A continued courſe of goodneſs may in it ſelf be more valuable, and yet repentance after a great fall and long wandrings may be much more moving and ſurprizing. For where things are conſtant and keep in the ſame tenour, they are not apt in their nature to give any new and ſudden occaſion of joy. And this is the reaſon given in the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi>; where the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tells his eldeſt Son, who was ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the joyful reception and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of his prodigal Brother, That <hi>He had been always with him, and all that he had was his</hi>; That is, he was ſenſible of his conſtant duty and obedience, than which nothing could have been more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; and that it had not, nor ſhould not loſe its reward: But the return of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37901:133"/>
his other ſon, after he had given over all hopes of him, and looked upon his caſe as deſperate, this was a marvellous ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and a happineſs beyond expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is the proper and natural cauſe of joy and gladneſs: And therefore he tells him, that upon ſuch an occaſion <hi>it was meet that we ſhould make merry and be glad; for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; was loſt, and is found.</hi> His elder ſons continuance in his duty was the enjoyment of what he had always had; but the return of his prodigal ſon was the retrieving of what he had given up for loſt, and a kind of reſurrection from the dead. And thus our bleſſed Saviour to encourage the repentance of ſinners, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents God after the manner of men; as if our heavenly father did conceive ſuch a joy upon the repentance of a ſinner, as earthly parents are wont to do upon the return of a wild and extravagant ſon to himſelf and his duty.</p>
            <p>Having thus as briefly and clearly as I could explained the ſeveral difficulties in the Text, I ſhall now deduce ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences from it, and ſo conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the bleſſed Spirits above have ſome knowledg of the affairs of men
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:37901:134"/>
here below, becauſe they are ſaid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the converſion of a ſinner. This is ſpoken more particularly of the <hi>Angels,</hi> as appears by comparing what is more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſaid in the Text, that there is joy <hi>in heaven,</hi> with what is more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſs'd in the 10<hi>th verſe,</hi> that there is joy <hi>in the preſence of the Angels</hi> over one ſinner that repenteth. Now whether the Angels come to this knowledg by vertue of their miniſtry here below, for the good of the Elect; and ſo in their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual entercourſe between heaven and earth, bring to their fellow-ſervants in heaven the joyful news of the repentance of ſinners upon earth: or whether God be pleaſed from time to time to reveal it to them, as a thing extreamly welcom and delightful to good ſpirits, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the increaſe of their happineſs; as it is not very material to enquire, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps impoſſible for us to determine.</p>
            <p>However, it cannot from hence be concluded that the Angels or Saints in Heaven have ſuch an univerſal knowledg of our condition and affairs, as to be a reaſonable ground and warrant to us to pray to them, yea or to deſire them to pray for us; no, though this were done without any ſolemn circumſtances of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:37901:134"/>
For they may very well know ſome things concerning us, wherein their own comfort and happineſs is likewiſe concerned, and yet be ignorant of all the reſt of our affairs. This one thing we are ſure they know, becauſe our Saviour hath told us ſo; but we are ſure of no more. And there is neither equal reaſon for their knowledg of our other concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor is there any revelation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> If God and the bleſſed Spirits above rejoyce at the converſion of a ſinner, ſo ſhould we too: and not fret and murmur as the Phariſees here did. This is the temper of the Devil, and of very bad men, to regret and envy the good and happineſs of others. For it is reaſonable to believe, that proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the <hi>joy</hi> that is in heaven at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of a ſinner, is the <hi>grief</hi> and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Devil and his inſtruments, of evil Spirits and wicked men. And as the Devil delights in deſtroying ſouls, and <hi>goes about like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour</hi>; ſo no doubt he is in great rage, and gnaſheth out of very diſcontent, when at any time he is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of his hopes, and the prey, which he thought himſelf ſure of, is ſnatched
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:37901:135"/>
out of his jaws. And thus we ſee it is with bad men, they do perſecute thoſe that forſake them and their wicked ways, and refuſe any further to go along with them <hi>to the ſame exceſs of riot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is no where more viſible than among thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> How full of wrath and indignation are they againſt thoſe who out of pure convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the errours and corruptions of their Church come over to Ours? How do they perſecute them with ſlanders and reproaches, and with all the effects of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and malice? So that many times they can ſcarce refrain from doing them a real miſchief, even where it is dangerous to themſelves to attempt it: As if they envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the grace of God, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of being ſaved.</p>
            <p>I know it is too natural to thoſe of all Communions to be eager and fierce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that deſert them: And yet ſuppoſing they had the truth certainly on their ſide (which they cannot all have), I ſee no great reaſon for this temper and carriage; For why ſhould I caſt away my patience and my charity becauſe another man hath made ſhipwrack of his faith? But I do not remember any where among mankind to have obſerved a more impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:37901:135"/>
malice, a more ſincere and hearty ill-will, than they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do conſtantly expreſs towards thoſe that forſake them; nay, though they give ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo modeſt and reaſonable an account of their change, and behave themſelves towards their old friends with all the kindneſs and compaſſion in the world: yet their hatred and indignation againſt them runs ſo high, that one may plainly ſee they would ſooner forgive a man the greateſt ſins that humane nature can be guilty of, and the breach of all the ten Commandments, than this one Crime, of leaving their Church, that is in truth, of growing wiſer and better.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The conſideration of what hath been ſaid ſhould mightily inflame our zeal, and quicken our induſtry and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for the converſion of ſinners. For if the converſion of one ſoul be worth ſo much labour and pains, and matter of ſuch joy to the bleſſed God and good Spirits; what pains ſhould not we take in ſo corrupt and degenerate an Age as this of ours; where impenitent ſinners do ſo much abound, and the juſt are almoſt failed from among the children of men?</p>
            <p>Our bleſſed Saviour indeed (according to the extraordinary decency of all his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37901:136"/>
Parables) puts the caſe very charitably, and lays the ſuppoſition quite on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide: If there were but one ſinner in the world, or but one of an hundred, yet we ſhould very zealouſly intend, and with all our might, the reduction of this one loſt ſheep; and ſhould never be at reſt, till this ſingle wandring ſoul were found and ſaved. But God knows this is not our caſe, but quite otherwiſe: which ſhould quicken our endeavours ſo much the more, and make us beſtir our ſelves to the utmoſt; having always in our minds that admirable ſaying of St. <hi>James, he that converteth a ſinner from the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death.</hi> He that knows the value of an immortal ſoul, and how fearful a thing it is to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh everlaſtingly, can think no pains too much to take to <hi>ſave a ſoul from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> What an argument and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is here to repentance, even to the greateſt of ſinners? They, I am ſure, ſtand moſt in need of it: And though they of all others have the leaſt reaſon to look for mercy, yet they ſhall not be refuſed; though they be like the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were not only reputed, but many
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37901:136"/>
times really were the worſt of men; though like the <hi>prodigal ſon</hi> here in the Parable, they have run away from their father, and <hi>waſted their eſtate in</hi> lewd and <hi>riotous courſes</hi>; yet whenever <hi>they come to themſelves,</hi> and are willing to return to their father, to acknowledg their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and repent of it, he is ready to receive them; nay, much more ready to receive them than they can be to come to him: For when the Prodigal was but coming towards his father, and <hi>was yet afar off, the father runs to meet him,</hi> and embraceth him with as much kindneſs as if he had never offended him, and entertains him with more joy than if he had always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him.</p>
            <p>How does the great God condeſcend to encourage our repentance; repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf and all the bleſſed company of heaven as tranſported with joy at the converſion of a ſinner, and almoſt ſetting a greater value upon repentance than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon innocence it ſelf? And if our heavenly Father, who hath been ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely offended, and ſo highly provoked by us beyond all patience, be ſo ready, ſo forward, ſo glad to receive us, and there be no hindrance, no difficulty, no diſcouragement on his part; is it poſſible
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:37901:137"/>
after all this, that we can be ſuch fools, and ſuch enemies to our ſelves, as to be backward to our own happineſs! All of us, the beſt of us, have too much cauſe for repentance; and I fear too many of us ſtand in need of that repentance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our Saviour in the Text, which conſiſts in the change of our whole lives.</p>
            <p>But I will not upbraid you with your faults; having no deſign to provoke, but only to perſwade men. I leave it to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ones conſcience to tell him, how great a ſinner, how grievous an offender he hath been. God knows we take no pleaſure in mentioning the ſins of men, but only in their amendment; and we would if it were poſſible even without minding them how bad they have been perſwade and encourage them to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>It is but a ſmall conſideration to tell you, how much it would chear and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our hearts, and quicken our zeal and induſtry for the ſalvation of ſouls, to ſee ſome fruit of our labours; that all our pains are not loſt, and that all the good counſel that is from hence tendered to you is not like rain falling upon the rocks, and ſhowers upon the ſands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:37901:137"/>But I have much greater conſiderations to offer to you; that your Repentance will at once rejoyce the heart of God, and Angels, and men: that it is a returning to a right mind, and the reſtoring of you to your ſelves, to the eaſe and peace of your own conſciences, and to a capacity of being everlaſtingly happy: that it is to take pity upon your ſelves and your poor immortal ſouls; and to take due care to prevent, that which is to be dreaded above all things, the being miſerable for ever: and laſt of all, That if you will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent now, the time will certainly come, and that perhaps in this life, when you ſhall ſee the greateſt need of repentance, and yet perhaps with miſerable <hi>Eſau find no place for it, though you ſeek it carefully with tears</hi>; when you <hi>ſhall cry, Lord, Lord, and the door ſhall be ſhut againſt you; and ſhall ſeek to enter, but ſhall not be able</hi> To be ſure in the other World you ſhall eternally repent to no purpoſe; and be continually lamenting your wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched condition without hopes of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; For <hi>there ſhall be weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> without effect, without intermiſſion, and without end.</p>
            <p>And what cauſe have we to thank God that this is not yet our caſe; that we are
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:37901:138"/>
yet on this ſide the pit of deſtruction and the gulf of deſpair? O the infinite patience and boundleſs goodneſs of God to ſinners! With what clemency hath he ſpared us, and <hi>ſuffered our manners</hi> thus long? and with what kindneſs and concernment does he ſtill call upon us to leave our ſins and to return to him; as if in ſo doing we ſhould make him happy, and not our ſelves? With what earneſt longings and deſires does he wait and wiſh for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſaying, <hi>O that there were ſuch a heart in them! O that they would hearken unto my voice! When ſhall it once be?</hi> Thus God is repreſented in <hi>Scripture</hi> as patiently attending and liſtening what effect his admonitions and counſels, his reproofs and threatnings will have upon ſinners, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6, <hi>I hearkened and I heard, but they ſpake not aright: no man repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done? every one turned to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And is not this our caſe? God hath long waited for our repentance; and once a year we ſolemnly pretend to ſet about it: But many of us hitherto, I fear, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of returning to God, have but more blindly and furiouſly run on in our courſe, <hi>like the horſe that hath no underſtanding</hi>;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:37901:138"/>
yea, in this more brutiſh than the Beaſt, that he ruſheth into the battel without any conſideration of death or danger, and deſtroys himſelf without a ſyllogiſm: But we ſinners have Reaſon, and yet are mad; the greateſt part of evil-doers are ſufficiently ſenſible of the danger of their courſe, and convinced that eternal miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ruin will be the end of it; and yet, I know not how, they make a ſhift upon one pretence or other to diſcourſe and reaſon themſelves into it.</p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>the word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper than a two-edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-ſword,</hi> and comes with a greater weight and force upon the minds of men than any humane perſwaſion whatſoever; I will conclude all with thoſe ſhort and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious counſels and exhortations of God to ſinners by his holy Prophets.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſider and ſhew your ſelves men, O ye tranſgreſſors: Be inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoul depart from thee: ſeek the Lord while he may be found; call upon him while he is near: Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity ſhall not he your ruin.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE occaſion of theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour was the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees</hi> againſt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power by which he wrought his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and particularly did caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Which works of his, though they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:37901:141"/>
were wrought by the Spirit of God, yet they obſtinately and maliciouſly imputed them to the power of the Devil. Upon which our Saviour takes occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the danger of this ſin, which he calls <hi>blaſpheming of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and tells them, that this was ſo great a ſin above all others, that it is in a peculiar manner unpardonable. <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For the explaining of theſe words, and the nature and unpardonableneſs of this ſin, we will enquire into theſe four things:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> What is the difference between ſpeaking againſt the Son of Man, and ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Wherein the Nature of this ſin or blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In what ſenſe this ſin is here ſaid to be peculiarly unpardonable. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Upon what account it is ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is the difference between <hi>ſpeaking againſt the ſon of man and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The reaſon of this enquiry is, becauſe the Text plainly puts a great difference between them, though it be not obvious to diſcern where it lies. For our Saviour tells us,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:37901:141"/>
that <hi>whoſoever ſpeaks a word againſt the ſon of man, it ſhall be forgiven him, but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy Ghoſt it ſhall never be forgiven him:</hi> And yet this blaſphemy of the Phariſees againſt the Holy Ghoſt was a ſpeaking againſt the Son of man. For to ſay that he caſt out Devils by the power of the Devil, though it was a blaſpheming of the Holy Ghoſt by whoſe power he wrought theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, yet it was likewiſe a blaſpheming of Chriſt himſelf; and was in effect to ſay, that he was no true Prophet, nor did come from God, but was a Magician and Impoſtor.</p>
            <p>For the removing of this difficulty I ſhall not need to ſay, as ſome learned men have done, That by <hi>the ſon of man</hi> is here to be underſtood any man, and that our Saviour is not particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by it. That ſeems very hard, when our Saviour is ſo frequently in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel called <hi>the ſon of man.</hi> And eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when St. <hi>Luke</hi> reciting theſe words, does immediately before give him this very title, to put the matter out of all doubt, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.8, 9, 10, <hi>Alſo I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him ſhall the Son of man alſo confeſs before the Angels of God: But he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37901:142"/>
me before men, ſhall be denied before the Angels of God.</hi> Upon which it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>And whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſon of man it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> So that in all reaſon the Son of man is the very ſame perſon that had this Title given him in the foregoing words, <hi>viz.</hi> our bleſſed Saviour. So that I take it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that by ſpeaking againſt the ſon of man, is here meant ſpeaking againſt Chriſt: And by ſpeaking againſt him, as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is meant all thoſe reproaches and contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melies which they caſt upon our Saviours perſon, without reflecting upon that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power which he teſtified by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. As, their reproaching him with the meanneſs of his birth, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters ſon?</hi> with the place of it (as they ſuppoſed) <hi>out of Galilee ariſeth no Prophet:</hi> Their reflecting upon his life, ſaying that he was <hi>a wine-bibber and a glutton, a friend of publicans and ſinners</hi>; with many other calumnies which they maliciouſly caſt upon him.</p>
            <p>But by ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt is meant their blaſpheming and reproaching that divine power whereby he wrought his miracles: which though it did at laſt likewiſe reflect upon our Saviours per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37901:142"/>
yet it was an immediate reflection upon the Holy Ghoſt, and a blaſpheming of him; and therefore it is called ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt by way of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or oppoſition to the other calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which they uſed againſt our Saviour; which were proper blaſphemies and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of his Perſon, but not of the Holy Ghoſt alſo, as this was. This ſeems to me to be the true difference here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by our Saviour between <hi>ſpeaking againſt the Son of man, and ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Let us in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Second</hi> place, enquire wherein the <hi>Nature</hi> of this ſin or blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt doth conſiſt. And the true Nature of this ſin, though it be ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be gathered from our Saviours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, yet I know not how a great many learned men have made a hard ſhift to miſtake it. Some have made it to be <hi>final Impenitency,</hi> becauſe that is unpardonable. But why that rather than any thing elſe that is bad ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a blaſpheming of the Holy Ghoſt, it is hard to give a reaſon. Others have placed the nature of it in <hi>a wilful and malicious oppoſition of the truth:</hi> which though it be a great ſin, and included in the ſin here ſpoken of, or a concomitant
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37901:143"/>
of it; yet is there great reaſon to believe that this is not all that is here meant by it. Others would have it to conſiſt in a malicious oppoſition of the Truth, <hi>when men know and are convinced that it is the Truth,</hi> which is a great ſin indeed, if ever any man were guilty of it; but it is a great Queſtion whether humane nature be capable of it. And to mention no more, others think it to conſiſt in a renouncing of the truth <hi>for fear of ſuffering</hi>; which made <hi>Francis Spira</hi> to think that he had committed this ſin.</p>
            <p>But with all due reſpect to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, I cannot think that any of theſe is the ſin our Saviour here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes. As I ſhall endeavour plainly to ſhew, by conſidering the occaſion of our Saviours mentioning of it; the perſons upon whom our Saviour chargeth this ſin; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what account he chargeth them with it.</p>
            <p>At the 22 <hi>ver.</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> there was brought to our Saviour <hi>one poſſeſſed with a Devil blind and dumb, and he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</hi> Upon this <hi>the people were ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſaid, is not this the ſon of David?</hi> that is, the Meſſias. The Phariſees hearing this, with great bitterneſs and contempt ſaid, <hi>This fellow doth not caſt out Devils but by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37901:143"/>
on this our Saviour repreſents to them the unreaſonableneſs of this calumny: and that upon theſe two conſiderations: 1<hi>ſt.</hi> That it was very unlikely that the Devil ſhould lend him this power to uſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf. <hi>Every kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf is brought to deſolation: and every city or houſe divided againſt it ſelf ſhall not ſtand. And if Satan caſt out Satan, he is divided againſt himſelf, how ſhall then his kingdom ſtand?</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> Our Saviour tells them, they might with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon attribute all miracles to the Devil. There were thoſe among themſelves who caſt out Devils in the name of the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> (as <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tell us). Of theſe our Saviour ſpeaks, and asks the Phariſees, <hi>by what power they caſt them out.</hi> But they aknowledged that theſe did it by the power of God: and there was no cauſe but their malice, why they ſhould not have acknowledged that he did it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the ſame power, <hi>ver.</hi> 27, <hi>If I by Beelzebub caſt out Devils, by whom do your children caſt them out? therefore they ſhall be your judges.</hi> That is, this may be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convince you malice of to me: <hi>But if I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you</hi>; That
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37901:144"/>
is, the Meſſias is come: Becauſe he wrought theſe and other miracles to prove that he was the Meſſias. And then it follows, <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> are the perſons charged with this ſin or blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt. And their blaſphemy was plainly this, that when he caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God, they ſaid he did it by the power of the Devil: they maliciouſly aſcribed theſe works of the Holy Ghoſt to the Devil.</p>
            <p>And that this is the ground why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour chargeth them with this ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is yet more plain from St. <hi>Mark, Mark</hi> 3.28, 29, 30, <hi>Verily I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, all ſins ſhall be forgiven unto the ſons of men, and blaſphemies wherewith ſoever they ſhall blaſpheme: but he that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath never forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation: becauſe they ſaid he hath an unclean Spirit.</hi> That is, becauſe the Phariſees charged him to be a Magician, and to have a familiar Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by whoſe aſſiſtance he did thoſe works, when in truth he did them by the Spirit of God, therefore our Saviour declares them
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37901:144"/>
guilty of this ſin of blaſpheming the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, which ſhould never be forgiven.</p>
            <p>So that the nature of this ſin did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a moſt malicious oppoſition to the utmoſt evidence that could be given to the truth of any Religion. Our bleſſed Saviour to ſhew that he was ſent by God, and came from him, wrought miracles, ſuch as did plainly evidence a divine power and preſence accompanying of him. For in St. <hi>Luke</hi> he is ſaid to do them <hi>by the finger of God,</hi> Luke 11.20, <hi>By the finger of God,</hi> that is, to do ſuch things as were an undeniable evidence of the divine power and preſence. And this is the utmoſt teſtimony that God ever gave to any perſon that was ſent by him. And the Phariſees were eye-witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe miracles which our Saviour wrought, ſo that they could not deny them: Yet ſuch was their oppoſition to him and his doctrine, that, though they ſaw theſe things done by him, and could not deny the reality of them, yet rather than they would own him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and his Doctrine to come from God, they moſt maliciouſly and unreaſonably aſcribed them to the power of the Devil. And this was the blaſphemy which they were guilty of againſt the Holy Ghoſt. And herein lay the greatneſs of their ſin, in reſiſting the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37901:145"/>
of thoſe miracles which were ſo plainly wrought by the Holy Ghoſt; and which though themſelves ſaw, yet they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly imputed them to the Devil, rather than they would be convinced by them. And this is ſo very plain, that hardly any man that conſiders our Saviours diſcourſe upon this occaſion can otherwiſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the nature of this ſin; eſpecially if he do but attend to thoſe remarkable words which I cited before (<hi>Mark</hi> 3.29,) <hi>but he that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt hath never forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation; becauſe they ſaid he hath an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit.</hi> I come now to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Third</hi> thing I propounded, <hi>namely,</hi> in what ſenſe this ſin is here ſaid to be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly <hi>unpardonable?</hi> For this our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our poſitively affirms to be in this different from all other ſins, that it is capable of no pardon: <hi>I ſay unto you, all manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men; but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men:</hi> And to ſhew what he means by the not forgiving of it, he tells us, that eternal puniſhment ſhall follow it in the other World. <hi>Whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the ſon of man it ſhall be forgiven him: but whoſoever ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Holy Ghoſt it ſhall never be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37901:145"/>
forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> Which St. <hi>Mark</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more plainly; that it ſhall bring thoſe who are guilty of it to <hi>eternal damnation, Mark</hi> 3.29, <hi>He that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt hath never forgiveneſs, but is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to eternal damnation.</hi> So that when our Saviour ſays, <hi>it ſhall never be forgiven, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world nor in the world to come,</hi> he does not intend to inſinuate that ſome ſins which are not forgiven in this world, may be forgiven in the other: but in theſe words he either alludes to the opinion of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning the effect of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt excommunication, the ſentence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they held not to be reverſible, neither in this world nor the other; or elſe the reaſon of this expreſſion may probably be to meet with a common and falſe opinion amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was, that ſome ſins which are not pardoned to men in this life, may by ſacrifices be expiated in the other; and therefore he ſays it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven, neither in this world nor the other. And St. <hi>Mark</hi> more plainly, that thoſe who are guilty of it ſhall <hi>never have forgiveneſs,</hi> but <hi>be liable to eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So that our Saviour's meaning ſeems plainly to be this, that this ſin is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incapable of forgiveneſs. I know
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:37901:146"/>
ſome have endeavoured to mollifie this matter, but (I think) without ſufficient reaſon. <hi>Grotius</hi> underſtands the words <hi>comparatively,</hi> that any ſort of ſin ſhall ſooner be forgiven than this againſt the Holy Ghoſt; and that our Saviour only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to expreſs the greatneſs and heinouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſin above others; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the pardon of it would be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than of any other ſin; but yet that the caſe of ſuch a perſon is not abſolutely deſperate: But if our Saviour had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſay that this ſin was abſolutely unpardonable, I would fain know how could he have expreſſed the matter in higher fuller words? Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies the words another way; that this ſin ſhall never be pardoned but upon a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular repentance</hi> for it: As if our Saviour's meaning was, that a general repentance, which was ſufficient for ſins of Ignorance, would not be ſufficient in this caſe, but there muſt be a particular repentance for it, without which it would never be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned. But this is by no means agreeable to the ſcope of our Saviour's diſcourſe: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he plainly intends to difference this from all other ſorts of ſins, I ſay unto you, <hi>all manner of ſin and blaſphemy,</hi> ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto men. But according to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37901:146"/>
our Saviour muſt mean, that all other ſins would be forgiven upon a general repentance; which is not true, for there are many other ſins beſides ſins of Ignorance; there are wilful and heinous ſins, ſuch as wilful murder and adultery and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, (that only excepted which is againſt the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) and the like groſs ſins, which all Divines hold ſhall not be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but upon a <hi>particular repentance.</hi> So that this interpretation does not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difference this ſin from all other ſorts of ſins, which yet it is very plain our Saviour intended to do. It remains then that theſe words muſt in all reaſon be underſtood abſolutely; that the perſons that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this great ſin ſhall never have it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given to them. And it may be this will not ſeem ſo harſh, when we have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Fourth</hi> place, <hi>how</hi> it comes to paſs that this ſin is above all others incapable of pardon: And that, upon theſe two ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe by this ſin men reſiſt their laſt remedy, and oppoſe the beſt and utmoſt means of their conviction. What can God be imagined to do more to convince a man of a Divine Revelation, or of the truth of any Doctrine or meſſage that comes from
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37901:147"/>
him, than to work miracles to this purpoſe? And what greater aſſurance can men have that miracles are wrought, than to be eye-witneſſes of them themſelves? And if men will reſiſt ſuch evidence, what can God do more for their ſatisfaction? If when men ſee plain miracles wrought, they will ſay that it is not the power of God that does them, but the power of the Devil: And if when men ſee the Devils caſt out, they will ſay that the Devil conſpires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, this is to outface the Sun at Noon-day, and there is no way left to convince ſuch perverſe perſons of the truth of any Divine Revelation. So that there is no remedy, but ſuch perſons muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their oppoſition to the truth. For this is ſuch a ſin as does in its own nature ſhut out and prevent all remedy. And he that thus perverſely and maliciouſly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the truth, muſt upon the ſame grounds unavoidably continue in his oppoſition to it; becauſe there is nothing left to be done for his conviction, more than is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done. If God ſhould ſend a perſon immediately from heaven to him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his errour, he can give him no greater teſtimony that he comes from God than miracles: And if when God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables that perſon to work theſe by the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37901:147"/>
power of his Spirit, this man will obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately impute them to the power of the Devil, he defeats all the imaginable means of his own conviction. So that it is no wonder if that ſin be unpardonable, which reſiſts the laſt and utmoſt means which God hath ever yet thought fit to uſe to bring men to repentance and ſalvation. And if God were willing to reveal himſelf, and the way to pardon and ſalvation to ſuch a one, he doth by this very temper and diſpoſition render himſelf incapable of being ſatisfied and convinced concerning any divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe this ſin is of that high nature that God is therefore juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to withdraw his grace from ſuch perſons; and, it is probable, reſolved ſo to do: without which grace they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue impenitent. There is no doubt but God, if he will, can work ſo powerfully upon the minds of men by his Grace and Spirit, as to convince the moſt obſtinate: and ſuppoſing them to be convinced and repent, it cannot be denied but that they would be forgiven. And therefore, when our Saviour here ſays, they ſhall not be forgiven, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that he means, that when perſons are come to that degree of obſtinacy and malice, God
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37901:148"/>
will (as juſtly he may) withdraw his grace from them: <hi>His ſpirit will not ſtrive with them,</hi> to overcome their obſtinacy; but will leave them to the byaſs of their own perverſe and malicious minds; which will ſtill engage them in a further oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the truth, and finally ſink them in perdition. So that being deſerted by God, and for want of the neceſſary help and aid of his grace (juſtly withdrawn from them) continuing finally impenitent, they become incapable of forgiveneſs both in this world and that which is to come. And there is nothing that can ſeem harſh or unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this, to thoſe who grant (as I think all men do) that God may be ſo provoked by men as juſtly to withdraw his grace from them in this life; that grace which is neceſſary to their repentance. And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if any provocation be likely to do it, this cannot be denied to be of all others the greateſt, obſtinately and maliciouſly to oppoſe the utmoſt evidence that God ever gave to the truth of any Doctrine revealed by him. And of this the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees,</hi> who are here charged with this ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, were notoriouſly guilty, in reſiſting the clear evidence of our Saviours miracles.</p>
            <p>And thus I have done with the <hi>four</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:37901:148"/>
things I propounded to enquire into from theſe words. <hi>Namely,</hi> The difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween ſpeaking againſt the Son of man, and ſpeaking againſt the Holy Ghoſt; wherein the Nature of this ſin or blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt doth conſiſt; and in what ſenſe this ſin is ſaid to be unpardonable; and upon what account it is ſo, <hi>Namely,</hi> becauſe men by this ſin reſiſt their laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and oppoſe the beſt and utmoſt means of their conviction: And becauſe it may reaſonably be ſuppoſed, that upon a provocation of this high nature God may, and is reſolved to withdraw that grace from ſuch perſons which is neceſſary to their repentance, without which their ſin remains for ever unpardonable.</p>
            <p>All that now remains is to make this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe ſome way or other uſeful to our ſelves. And it may very well ſerve to theſe <hi>two</hi> purpoſes. <hi>Firſt,</hi> to comfort ſome ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and pious perſons who are liable to deſpair out of an apprehenſion that they have committed <hi>this ſin. Secondly,</hi> To caution others againſt the approaches to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To comfort ſome very good and pious perſons, who are liable to deſpair upon an apprehenſion that they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this great and unpardonable ſin;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37901:149"/>
and conſequently, are utterly incapable of ever being reſtored to the mercy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God. And nothing can be more for the comfort of ſuch perſons than to underſtand aright what the nature of this ſin was, and wherein the heinouſneſs of it doth conſiſt; which I have endeavoured to manifeſt. And if this be the Nature of it which I have declared, as it ſeems very plain that it is, then I cannot ſee how any perſon <hi>now</hi> is likely to be in thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as to be capable of committing it. And being a ſin of ſo heinous a nature, and declared by our Saviour to be abſolutely unpardonable, there is no reaſon to extend it beyond the caſe to which our Saviour applies it; which was the reſiſting of the evidence of the miracles which were wrought for the truth of Chriſtianity, by thoſe who were eye-witneſſes of them, <hi>that is,</hi> by thoſe who had the utmoſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of them that humane nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. And not only a bare reſiſtance of that evidence, but with a very malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circumſtance, ſo as to impute thoſe works which were wrought by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to the power of the <hi>Devil.</hi> This was the caſe of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> whom our Saviour chargeth with this ſin. And no body hath warrant to extend this ſin any
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37901:149"/>
further than this caſe: and without good warrant it would be the moſt uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing in the world to extend it any further.</p>
            <p>That which comes neareſt to it, both in the heinouſneſs of the crime, and the unpardonableneſs of it, is <hi>total Apoſtaſie from Chriſtianity</hi> after the embracing of it, and full conviction of the truth of it. And this the Scripture ſeems to place, if not in the ſame rank, yet, very near to it. And of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks very often in the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> under the name of <hi>unbelief,</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> by way of eminence, as being <hi>the</hi> great <hi>ſin</hi> that Chriſtians were in danger of falling into, call'd in that <hi>Epiſtle (Heb.</hi> 12.1.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the ſin</hi> which Chriſtians, by reaſon of the <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances</hi> they were then in, were eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſubject to: And he parallels it with the caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the wilderneſs, concerning whom <hi>God ſware that they ſhould not enter into his reſt, namely,</hi> the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> which was a type of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 18. And Chap. 6. ver. 4, 5, 6, more expreſly. <hi>For it is impoſſible that thoſe who were once enlightned, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37901:150"/>
of the world to come, if they ſhould fall away, to renew them again to repentance.</hi> Where by <hi>impoſſible,</hi> the leaſt that can be meant is, that it is extremely difficult for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to recover themſelves by repentance. And 'tis obſervable that thoſe perſons are ſaid to have been <hi>partakers of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; by which is meant, that they were either endued with a power of miracles by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or were under the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them as having ſeen them wrought by others. So that this Apoſtaſie may be ſaid in that reſpect to be <hi>a ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 26, <hi>If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledg of the truth</hi> (that is, if we apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatize from Chriſtianity after we have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the profeſſion of it, as appears plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe) <hi>there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin:</hi> which expreſſion declares this ſin either to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable, or ſomething very like it. And at the 29. <hi>verſ.</hi> Thoſe perſons are ſaid to <hi>tread under foot the Son of God, and to do deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</hi> Which ſignifies that the ſin there ſpoken of is more immediately committed againſt the Holy Spirit of God. St. <hi>Peter</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe declares the great danger of this ſin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, <hi>If after they have eſcaped the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37901:150"/>
pollutions of the world through the knowledg of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, they are again entangled therein and overcome, the latter end is worſe with them than the beginning.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> likewiſe ſeems to ſpeak of this ſin of <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> and to call it <hi>a ſin unto death:</hi> Diſcouraging Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians rather, from praying for thoſe who were fallen into it; which gives great ſuſpicion that he looked upon it as hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardonable, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.16, <hi>If any man ſee his brother ſin a ſin not unto death, he ſhall ask, and he ſhall give him life for thoſe that ſin not unto death. There is a ſin unto death; I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for it.</hi> Now that by <hi>the ſin unto death,</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here means <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> to the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> ſeems extremely probable from what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, <hi>We know that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of God ſinneth not, but keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf, and that wicked one toucheth him not</hi>; that is, he preſerveth himſelf from Idolatry, which the Devil had ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the world into, <hi>ver.</hi> 19, <hi>And we know that we are of God; and the whole world lieth in wickedneſs, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one</hi>; that is, is under the power of the Devil: <hi>And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know him that is true</hi>; that is, to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37901:151"/>
diſtinguiſh between the true God and Idols. And then it follows, <hi>this is the true God, and eternal life: Little children keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> Which laſt caution is a key to the underſtanding of all the reſt; and makes it very probable that the ſin unto death is Apoſtacy from Chriſtianity unto Idolatry: Otherwiſe it is hard to imagine how the laſt clauſe comes in; <hi>Little children keep your ſelves from Idols.</hi> And this is that ſin which of all other approacheth neareſt to this <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which our Saviour ſpeaks of; and concerning the pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of which the Scripture ſeems to ſpeak very doubtfully. But if it were of the ſame unpardonable nature, yet this can be no trouble to thoſe perſons I am ſpeaking of, who cannot but know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be far enough from the guilt of this ſin.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe other ſins which by ſome are taken to be the ſins againſt the Holy Ghoſt, they are either ſuch as no man is capable of committing, as <hi>a malicious oppoſition to the truth when I am convinced and know it to be the truth:</hi> For this is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Becauſe to know any thing to be the truth is to believe it to be ſo: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can disbelieve it while he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37901:151"/>
believes it to be truth. Or elſe, they are ſuch as no man can know he is guilty of in this life; as, <hi>final impenitency</hi>; which ſuppoſeth a man to live and die without repentance. Or elſe, ſuch as I think not good man is incident to; as, <hi>a malicious and perverſe oppoſing of the truth after ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient means of conviction.</hi> However, none of theſe are that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſcrihes to be the <hi>ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> as I have already ſhewn.</p>
            <p>But ſtill there are two things which uſually trouble honeſt and well-meaning perſons; but are rather the effects of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy than any reaſonable ground of trouble. Some think that every <hi>deliberate ſin</hi> againſt knowledg, and after convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is <hi>the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This is aknowledged to be a very great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin, and ſuch as calls for a great and particular repentance; but does by no means render a man incapable of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. Others are troubled with <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous thoughts,</hi> and thoſe they think to be the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But this is generally the meer effect of Melancholy. And the perſons that are troubled with theſe black thoughts are no ways conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them; but they riſe in their minds perfectly againſt their wills, and without
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37901:152"/>
any approbation of theirs: And in this caſe they are ſo far from being the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin, that I hope, yea and verily believe they are no ſins at all, but the meer effects of a bodily diſtemper; and no more imputed to us, than the wild and idle rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a man in a frenzy or a fever: And God forbid that the natural effects of a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily diſeaſe ſhould bring guilt upon our ſouls. So that theſe perſons have reaſon enough for comfort; but the miſery is, their preſent diſtemper renders them incapable of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other Uſe I would make of this diſcourſe is, to caution men againſt the <hi>degrees and approaches</hi> of this ſin. For if the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt be of ſuch a high nature and ſo unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, then all approaches to it are very dreadful. Such as are, <hi>profane ſcoffing at Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> of God which dwells in good men: <hi>Abuſe of the holy Scriptures,</hi> which were indited by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: <hi>Perverſe Infidelity,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the evidence which we have for the Truth of Chriſtianity, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſſurance of the Miracles wrought for the confirmation of it, brought down to us by credible Hiſtory, though we were not eye-witneſſes of them: <hi>Obſtinacy in a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37901:152"/>
ſinful and vicious courſe,</hi> notwithſtanding all the motives and arguments of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to perſwade men to repentance. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt the clear conviction of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and the motions and ſuggeſtions of God's Holy Spirit</hi> to the contrary: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious oppoſing of the Truth,</hi> when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for it are very plain and evident to any impartial and unprejudiced mind; and when he that oppoſeth the Truth, hath no clear ſatisfaction in his own mind to the contrary, but ſuffers himſelf to be furiouſly and headily carried on in his oppoſition to it. Theſe are all ſins of a very high nature, and of the neareſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity with this great and unpardonable ſin, of any that can eaſily be inſtanced in. And though God, to encourage the repentance of men, have not declared them unpardonable, yet they are great provocations; and if they be long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, we know not how ſoon God may withdraw his grace from us, and ſuffer us to be <hi>hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Be ready then to entertain the truth of God, whenever it is fairly propounded to thee; and with ſuch evidence, as thou art willing to accept in other matters, where thou haſt no prejudice nor intereſt to the contrary. Do nothing contrary to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37901:153"/>
thy known duty, but be careful in all things to obey the convictions of thine own conſcience, and to yield to the good motions and ſuggeſtions of God's <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who works ſecretly upon the minds of men, and inſpires us many times gently with good thoughts and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and is griev'd when we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them; and after many repulſes will at laſt withdraw himſelf from us, and leave us to be aſſaulted by the temptations of the Devil, and to be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by our own luſts into ruin and perdition.</p>

And as he was in nothing liker the Son of God than in being and doing good; ſo is he in nothing a fitter Pattern for our
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37901:155"/>
imitation, than in that excellent chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter given of him here in the Text, that <hi>He went about doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words two things offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our conſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Our Saviour's great Work and Buſineſs in the world, which was, to <hi>do good:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Who employed himſelf in being a benefactour to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This refers more eſpecially to his healing the bodily diſeaſes and infirmities of men. <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppreſſed of the Devil.</hi> Intimating to us by this inſtance of his doing good, that he who took ſo much pains to reſcue mens Bodies from the power and poſſeſſion of the Devil, would not let their Souls re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under his tyranny. But though the Text inſtanceth only in one particular, yet this general expreſſion of <hi>doing good</hi> comprehends all thoſe ſeveral ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was beneficial to mankind.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is his Diligence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry in this work, <hi>He went about doing good</hi>; he made it the great buſineſs and conſtant imployment of his life. I ſhall propound to you the Pattern of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in both theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:37901:156"/>I. His great Work and Buſineſs in the world was, to <hi>do good.</hi> The moſt pleaſant and delightful, the moſt happy and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous work in the world. It is a work of a large extent, and of an univerſal influence; and comprehends in it all thoſe ways whereby we may be uſeful and beneficial to one another. And indeed it were pity that ſo good a thing ſhould be confined within narrow bounds and limits. It reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Souls of men, and to their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and is converſant in all thoſe ways and kinds whereby we may ſerve the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or Spiritual good of our neighbour, and promote his preſent and his future happineſs. What our Bleſſed Saviour did in this kind, and we, in imitation of him, ought to do, I ſhall reduce to theſe two Heads. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Doing good to the Souls of men, and endeavouring to promote their ſpiritual and eternal happineſs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The procuring of their Temporal good, and contributing as much as may be to their happineſs in this preſent life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doing good to the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, and endeavouring to promote their <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> happineſs, by good Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by good Example.</p>
            <p>Firſt, By good <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> And under Inſtruction I comprehend all the means of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37901:156"/>
bringing men to the knowledg of their duty, and exciting them to the practice of it; by inſtructing their Ignorance, and removing their Prejudices, and rectifying their Miſtakes, by Perſuaſion, and by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; and by making laſting proviſion for the promoting of theſe Ends.</p>
            <p>By inſtructing mens Ignorance. And this is a duty which every man owes to another, as he hath opportunity; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thoſe who are under our care and charge, our Children and Servants, and near Relations; thoſe over whom we have a ſpecial authority, and a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate influence. This our Bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our made his great work in the world, to inſtruct all ſorts of perſons in the things which concerned the Kingdom of God, and to direct them in the way to eternal happineſs; by publick teaching, and by private converſation, and by taking occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the common occurrences of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, and every object that preſented it ſelf to him, to inſtil good counſel into men, and to raiſe their minds to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of divine and heavenly things. And though this was our Saviour's great Employment, and is theirs more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly whoſe office it is to teach others: yet every man hath private opportunities
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37901:157"/>
of inſtructing others, by admoniſhing them of their duty, and by directing them to the beſt means and helps of knowledg; ſuch as are Books of Piety and Religion, with which they that are rich may furniſh thoſe who are unable to provide them for themſelves.</p>
            <p>And then by removing mens Prejudices againſt the Truth, and rectifying their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes. This our Saviour found very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; the generality of thoſe with whom he had to do, being ſtrongly prejudiced againſt Him and his Doctrine by falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which they had taken in by edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and been trained up to by their Teachers. And therefore he uſed a great deal of meekneſs in inſtructing thoſe that oppoſed themſelves, and exerciſed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of patience in bearing with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of men, and their dulneſs and flowneſs of capacity to receive the Truth.</p>
            <p>And this is great Charity, to conſider the inveterate Prejudices of men; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thoſe which are rooted in education, and which men are confirmed in by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they bear to thoſe that have been their Teachers. And great allowance is to be given to men in this caſe, and time to bethink themſelves, and to conſider better. For no man that is in an Errour
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:37901:157"/>
think he is ſo: and therefore if we go violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rend their Opinions from them, they will but hold them ſo much the faſter; but if we have patience to unrip them by degrees, they will at laſt fall in pieces of themſelves.</p>
            <p>And when this is done, the way is open for Counſel and Perſwaſion. And this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour adminiſtred in a moſt powerful and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual manner, by encouraging men to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and by repreſenting to them the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite advantages of obeying his Laws, and the dreadful and dangerous conſequences of breaking of them. And theſe are arguments fit to work upon mankind, becauſe there is ſomething within us that conſents to the equity and reaſonableneſs of God's Laws. So that whenever we perſwade men to their duty, how backward ſoever they may be to the practice of it, being ſtrongly addicted to a contrary courſe; yet we have this certain advantage, that we have their Conſciences and the moſt inward ſenſe of their minds on our ſide, bearing witneſs, that what we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and perſwade them to, is for their good.</p>
            <p>And if need be, we muſt add Reproof to Counſel. This our Saviour did with great freedom, and ſometimes with ſharpneſs and ſeverity, according to the condition of the perſons he had to deal withal. But becauſe of his great Authority, being <hi>a Teacher</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>ſent from God,</hi> and of his intimate
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37901:158"/>
knowledg of the hearts of men, he is not a pattern to us in all the circumſtances of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this duty; which, if any other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great prudence and diſcretion, if we intend to do good, the only end to be aimed at in it. For many are fit to be reproved, whom yet every man is not fit to reprove; and in that caſe we muſt get it done by thoſe that are fit, and great regard muſt be had to the time, and other circumſtances of doing it, ſo as it may moſt probably have its effect.</p>
            <p>I will mention but one way of Inſtruction more, and that is, by making laſting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for that purpoſe: as, by founding Schools of learning, eſpecially to teach the poor to read, which is the Key of knowledg; by building of Churches and endowing them; by buying or giving in Impropriations, or the like. Theſe are large and laſting ways of teaching and inſtructing others, which will continue when we are dead and gone; as it is ſaid of <hi>Abel,</hi> that <hi>being dead, he yet ſpeaks.</hi> And this our Saviour virtually did, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing his Apoſtles after he had left the World to <hi>go and teach all Nations,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering a conſtant Succeſſion of Teachers in his Church, to inſtruct men in the Chriſtian Religion, together with an honourable Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for them. This we cannot do in the way that he did, who had <hi>all power in heaven and earth</hi>; but we may be ſubſervient to this
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37901:158"/>
Deſign in the ways that I have mentioned. Which I humbly commend to the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe whom God hath bleſſed with great Eſtates, and made capable of effecting ſuch great works of Charity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another way of doing good to the Souls of men is by good <hi>Example.</hi> And this our Bleſſed Saviour was in the utmoſt perfection. For he <hi>fulfilled all righteouſneſs, had no ſin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</hi> And this we ſhould endeavour to be, as far as the frailty of our nature and imperfection of our preſent ſtate will ſuffer. For good Example is an unſpeakable benefit to mankind, and hath a ſecret power and influence upon thoſe with whom we converſe, to form them into the ſame diſpoſition and manners. It is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Rule, that teacheth men without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and lets them ſee their faults without open reproof and upbraiding. Beſides that it adds great weight to a man's counſel and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when we ſee that he adviſeth nothing but what he does; nor exacts any thing from others from which he himſelf deſires to be excuſed. As, on the contrary, nothing is more cold and inſignificant, than good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel from a bad man, one that does not obey his own precepts, nor follow the advice which he is ſo forward to give to others.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the ſeveral ways of doing good to the <hi>Souls</hi> of men; wherein we, who are
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:37901:159"/>
the Diſciples of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ought, in imitation of his Example, to exerciſe our ſelves according to our ſeveral capacities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. And this is the nobleſt Charity, and the greateſt kindneſs that can be ſhewn to humane nature; it is in the moſt excellent ſenſe, to <hi>give eyes to the blind,</hi> to <hi>ſet the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners at liberty,</hi> to reſcue men out of the ſaddeſt ſlavery and captivity, and to <hi>ſave Souls from death.</hi> And it is the moſt laſting and durable benefit; becauſe it is to do men good to all eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other way of being beneficial to others is, by procuring their <hi>Temporal</hi> good, and contributing to their happineſs in this preſent life. And this, in ſubordination to our Saviour's great deſign of bringing men to eternal Happineſs, was a great part of his buſineſs and employment in this world. He went about <hi>healing all manner of ſickneſſes and diſeaſes,</hi> and reſcuing the Bodies of men from the power and poſſeſſion of the Devil.</p>
            <p>And though we cannot be beneficial to men in that miraculous manner that he was, yet we may be ſo in the uſe of ordinary means: We may comfort the afflicted, and vindicate the oppreſſed, and do a great many acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which our Saviour, by reaſon of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, could not do without a miracle: We may ſupply the neceſſities of thoſe that are in want, <hi>feed the hungry,</hi> and <hi>cloath the naked,</hi>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:37901:159"/>
and <hi>viſit the ſick,</hi> and miniſter to them ſuch comforts and remedies as they are not able to provide for themſelves: We may take a Child that is poor and deſtitute of all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of education, and bring him up in the knowledg and fear of God; and, without any great expence, put him into a way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by his diligence and induſtry, he may arrive to a conſiderable fortune in the world, and be able afterwards to relieve hundreds of others. Men glory in raiſing great and magnificent Structures, and find a ſecret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee Sets of their own planting to grow up and flouriſh: But ſurely it is a greater and more glorious work, to build up a Man, and to ſee a Youth of our own planting, from the ſmall beginnings and advantages we have given him, to grow up into a conſiderable fortune, to take root in the world, and to ſhoot up to ſuch a height, and ſpread his branches ſo wide, that we who firſt planted him may our ſelves find comfort and ſhelter under his ſhadow. We may many times with a ſmall liberality ſhore up a Family that is ready to fall, and ſtruggles under ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, that it is not able to ſupport it ſelf. And if our minds were as great as ſometimes our eſtates are, we might do great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick works of a general and laſting advantage, and for which many generations to come might call us bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:37901:160"/>And thoſe who are in the loweſt condition may do great good to others by their Prayers, if they themſelves be as good as they ought. For <hi>the fervent prayer of a righteous man avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much.</hi> The interceſſion of thoſe who are in favour with God (as all good men are) are not vain wiſhes, but many times effectual to procure that good for others, which their own endeavours could never have effected and brought about.</p>
            <p>I have done with the Firſt thing, The great Work and Buſineſs which our Bleſſed Saviour had to do in the world; and that was, to <hi>do good.</hi> I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Second thing contained in the Text, Our Saviour's Diligence and induſtry in this work, <hi>He went about doing good.</hi> He made it the great buſineſs and conſtant employment of his life; he travelled from one place to another to ſeek out opportunities of being uſeful and beneficial to mankind. And this will fully appear, if we briefly conſider theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, How unwearied our bleſſed Saviour was in doing good. He made it his only buſineſs, and ſpent his whole life in it. He was not only ready to do good to thoſe that came to him, and gave him opportunity for it, and beſought him to do it; but went himſelf from one place to another, to ſeek out objects to exerciſe his Charity upon. He
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:37901:160"/>
went to thoſe who could not, and to thoſe who would not come to him: for ſo it is written of him, <hi>He came to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi> He was contented to ſpend whole days in this work, to live in a crowd, and to be almoſt perpetually oppreſt with company: and when his Diſciples were moved at the rudeneſs of the people in preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon him, he rebuked their impatience; and, for the pleaſure he took in doing good, made nothing of the trouble and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that attended it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, If we conſider how much he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied himſelf in the chief comforts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of humane life, that he might do good to others. He neglected the ordinary refreſhments of nature, his meat and drink and ſleep, that he might attend this work. He was at every bodie's beck and diſpoſal, to do them good. When he was doing cures in one place, he was ſent for to another; and he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went, or ſent healing to them, and did by his word at a diſtance what he could not come in perſon to do. Nay, he was willing to deny himſelf in one of the deareſt things in the world, his reputation and good name. He was contented to do good, though he was ill thought of and ill ſpoken of for it. He would not refuſe to do good on the Sabbath-day, though he was accounted profane for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He knew how ſcandalous it was among
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37901:161"/>
the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep company with Publicans and Sinners; and yet he would not decline ſo good a work, for all the ill words they gave him for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If we conſider the malicious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and ſiniſter conſtruction that his good deeds met withal. Never did ſo much goodneſs meet with ſo much enmity, <hi>endure</hi> ſo many affronts, and ſo much <hi>contradiction of Sinners.</hi> This great Benefactour of mankind was hated and perſecuted, as if he had been a publick Enemy. While he was inſtructing them in the meekeſt manner, they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtone him for telling them the truth: and when the fame of his Miracles went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, though they were never ſo uſeful and beneficial to mankind, yet upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they conſpire againſt him, and ſeek to take away his life. Whatever he ſaid or did, though never ſo innocent, never ſo excellent, had ſome bad interpretation put upon it; and the great and ſhining Vertues of his life were turned into Crimes and matter of accuſation. For his caſting out of Devils, he was called a Magician; for his endeavour to reclaim men from their vices, <hi>a friend of Publicans and Sinners</hi>; for his free and obliging converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>a wine-bibber and a glutton.</hi> All the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which he did to men, and the bleſſings which he ſo liberally ſhed among the people, were conſtrued to be a deſign of Ambition
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37901:161"/>
and Popularity, and done with an intention to move the people to Sedition, and to make himſelf a King: Enough to have diſcouraged the greateſt goodneſs, and have put a damp upon the moſt generous mind, and to make it ſick and weary of well-doing. For what more grievous, than to have all the good one does ill interpreted, and the beſt actions in the world made matter of calumny and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach?</p>
            <p>And then, Laſtly, If we conſider how chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, notwithſtanding all this, he perſevered and continued in well-doing. It was not only his buſineſs, but his delight; <hi>I delight</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to do thy will, O my God.</hi> The pleaſure which others take in the moſt natural actions of life, in eating and drinking when they are hungry, he took in doing good; it was <hi>his meat and drink to do the will of his Father.</hi> He plyed this work with ſo much diligence, as if he had been afraid he ſhould have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time for it. <hi>I muſt work the work of him that ſent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</hi> And when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards the hardeſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant part of his Service, but of all others the moſt beneficial to us, I mean, his Death and Sufferings, he was not at eaſe in his mind till it was done; <hi>How am I ſtraitned,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>till it be accompliſhed?</hi> And juſt before his Suffering, with what Joy and Triumph
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37901:162"/>
does he reflect upon the good he had done in his life? <hi>Father, I have glorified thee upon earth, and have finiſhed the work which thou haſt given me to do.</hi> What a bleſſed Pattern is here of diligence and induſtry in doing good? how fair and lovely a copy for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to write after?</p>
            <p>And now that I have ſet it before you, it will be of excellent uſe to theſe two purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: To ſhew us our Defects; and to excite us to our Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhew us our Defects. How does this bleſſed Example upbraid thoſe who live in a direct contradiction to it; who, inſtead of <hi>going about doing good,</hi> are perpetually intent upon doing miſchief; who are wiſe and active to do evil, but to do good have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, no underſtanding? And thoſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, who, though they are far from being ſo bad, yet wholly neglect this bleſſed work of doing good? They think it very fair to do no evil, to hurt and injure no man: but if Preachers will be ſo unreaſonable as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more, and will never be ſatisfied till they have perſuaded them out of their eſtate, and to give to the poor till they have almoſt impoveriſh'd themſelves, they deſire to be excuſed from this importunity. But we are not ſo unreaſonable neither. We deſire to put them in mind, that to be charitable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our power is an indiſpenſable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:37901:162"/>
of Religion: that we are commanded not only to abſtain from evil, but to do good; and that our Bleſſed Saviour hath given us the example of both; he did not only <hi>do no ſin,</hi> but <hi>he went about doing good.</hi> And upon this nice point it was, that the young rich man in the Goſpel and his Saviour parted. He had <hi>kept the Commandments from his youth, Thou ſhalt not kill, Thou ſhalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Thou ſhalt not ſteal:</hi> he had been very careful of the negative part of Religion: But when it came to parting with his Eſtate, and <hi>giving to the poor,</hi> this he thought too hard a condition, and upon this he forſook our Saviour, and forfeited the Kingdom of heaven. And it is very conſiderable, and ought to be often and ſeriouſly thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our Saviour, deſcribing to us the Day of Judgment, repreſents the great Judg of the world acquitting and condemning men according to the good which they had done, or neglected to do, in ways of mercy and charity; for feeding the hungry, and cloathing the naked, and viſiting the ſick, or for neglecting to do theſe things: Than which nothing can more plainly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally declare to us the neceſſity of doing good, in order to the obtaining of eternal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>There are many, indeed, who do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together neglect the doing of this work, who
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:37901:163"/>
yet do in a great meaſure prevent and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves from doing it as they ought, under a pretence of being employed about other Duties and parts of Religion. They are ſo taken up with the exerciſes of Piety and Devotion in private and publick, with Prayer, and reading and hearing Sermons, and preparing themſelves for the Sacrament, that they have ſcarce any leiſure to mind the doing of good and charitable offices to others: or, if they have, they hope God will pardon his ſervants in this thing, and accept of their Piety and Devotion inſtead of all. But they ought to conſider, that when theſe two parts of Religion come in competition, Devotion is to give way to Charity, <hi>Mercy</hi> being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> that the great End of all the Duties of Religion, Prayer, and reading and hearing the Word of God, and receiving the holy Sacrament, is to diſpoſe and excite us to do good, to make us more ready and forward to every good work: and that it is the greateſt mockery in the world, upon pretence of uſing the means of Religion, to neglect the end of it; and becauſe we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preparing our ſelves to do good, to think that we are for ever excuſed from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any.</p>
            <p>Others are taken up in contending for the Faith, and ſpend all their zeal and heat about ſome Controverſies in Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:37901:163"/>
they think it but reaſonable that they ſhould be excuſed from thoſe meaner kind of Duties, becauſe they ſerve God, as they imagine, in a higher and more excellent way; as thoſe who ſerve the King in his Wars uſe to be exempted from Taxes and Offices. But do thoſe men conſider upon what kind of Duties more eſpecially, our Bleſſed Saviour and his Apoſtles lay the great weight and ſtreſs of Religion? that it is to the Meek and Merciful and Peaceable that our Saviour pronounceth Bleſſedneſs? that <hi>pure Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction?</hi> that <hi>the wiſdom which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove is full of mercy and good works?</hi> Theſe are the great and weighty things of Religion, which, whatever elſe we do, ought not to be left undone. Do they conſider, that a right Faith is wholly in order to a good Life, and is of no value any farther then it hath an influence upon it? ſo that whatever other Duties we may be obliged to, nothing can excuſe us from this. How much better is it to do good, to be really uſeful and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to others, and how much more clearly and certainly our duty, than to quarrel about doubtful and uncertain opinions? Were men Chriſtians indeed, they would be ſo much delighted and taken up with this better work, (more acceptable to God, and more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:37901:164"/>
to men) that they could not find leiſure, or, if they could, they could not find in their hearts to employ all their time and zeal about things which are at ſo great a diſtance from the life and heart of Religion, as moſt of thoſe Queſtions are which Chriſtians at this day contend and languiſh about. Were we poſſeſſed with the true ſpirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, theſe would be but dry and inſipid and taſtleſs things to us, in compariſon of the bleſſed employment of doing good in a more real and ſubſtantial way. If the ſincere love of God and our neighbour were but once throughly kindled in our hearts, theſe pure and heavenly flames would in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure extinguiſh the unchriſtian heats of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and contention; as Fires here below are ready to languiſh and go out, when the Sun in his full ſtrength ſhines upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But the hardeſt part of my task is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind (and it is ſtrange it ſhould be ſo): And that is, to perſwade us to the imitation of this Bleſſed Example. Let us <hi>go and do likewiſe; let the ſame mind be in us that was in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>; let us tread in the ſteps of the great God and the beſt man that ever was, our Bleſſed Saviour, who <hi>went about doing good.</hi> Methinks the work it ſelf is of that nature, that men ſhould not need to be courted to it by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, nor urged by importunity. The very propoſal of the thing, and the Pattern
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:37901:164"/>
which I have ſet before you, is temptation and allurement enough to a generous and well-diſpoſed mind. But yet to inflame you the more to ſo good a work, be pleaſed to dwell with me a little upon theſe following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is an argument of a great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous mind, to employ our ſelves in doing good, to extend our thoughts and care to the concernments of others, and to uſe our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and endeavours for their benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: Becauſe it ſhews an inclination and deſire in us, to have others happy as well as our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are of a narrow and envious ſpirit, of a mean and ſordid diſpoſition, love to contract themſelves within themſelves, and like the hedg-hog, to ſhoot out their quills at every one that comes near them. They take care of no body but themſelves; and fooliſhly think their own Happineſs the greater, becauſe they have it alone and to themſelves. But the nobleſt and moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſitions think themſelves happieſt when others ſhare with them in their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Of all Beings God is the fartheſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Envy; and the nearer any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture approacheth to him in bleſſedneſs, the farther is it off from this helliſh quality and diſpoſition. It is the temper of the Devil, to grudg happineſs to others; he envied that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37901:165"/>
Man ſhould be in Paradiſe, when He was caſt out of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Other Perfections are (as one ſays) of a more melancholick and ſolitary diſpoſition, and ſhine brighteſt when they are alone, or attained to but by a few; once make them common, and they loſe their luſtre. But it is the nature of Goodneſs, to communicate it ſelf; and the farther it ſpreads, the more glorious it is. God reckons it as one of his moſt glorious Titles, as the brighteſt Gem in his Diadem, <hi>The Lord mighty to ſave.</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights not to ſhew his Soveraignty in ruining the innocent, and deſtroying helpleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but in reſcuing them out of the jaws of Hell and deſtruction. To the Devil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs the Title of <hi>The Deſtroyer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Without this quality of Goodneſs, all other Perfections would change their nature, and loſe their excellency. Great Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would be terrible, and raiſe nothing but dread and ſuſpicion in us: For Power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Goodneſs would be Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and Wiſdom would become Craft and Treachery. A Being endued with Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Power, and yet wanting Goodneſs, would be nothing elſe but an irreſiſtible Evil, and an omnipotent Miſchief. We admire Knowledg, and are afraid of Power, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect Wiſdom; but we can heartily love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Goodneſs, or ſuch Perfections as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:37901:165"/>
are in conjunction with it. For Knowledg and Power may be in a nature moſt contrary to God's; the Devil hath theſe perfections in an excelling degree. When all is done, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing argues a great and generous mind but only Goodneſs; which is a propenſion and diſpoſition to make others happy, and a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to do them all the good offices we can.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To do good is the moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant employment in the World. It is natural; and whatever is ſo, is delightful. We do like our ſelves whenever we relieve the wants and diſtreſſes of others. And therefore this Vertue among all others hath peculiarly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled it ſelf to the name of <hi>Humanity.</hi> We anſwer our own Nature, and obey our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſhew our ſelves Men, in ſhewing Mercy to the miſerable. Whenever we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the evils and afflictions of others, we do with the greateſt reaſon collect our duty from our nature and inclination, and make our own wiſhes and deſires and expectations from others, a law and rule to our ſelves. And this is pleaſant, to follow our Nature, and to gratifie the importunate dictates of our own Reaſon. So that the benefits we do to others are not more welcom to them that receive them, than they are delightful to us that do them. We eaſe our own nature and bowels, whenever we help and relieve thoſe who are in want and neceſſity. As, on the contrary,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:37901:166"/>
no man, that hath not deveſted himſelf of humanity, can be cruel and hard-hearted to others, without feeling ſome pain in himſelf. There is no ſenſual pleaſure in the World comparable to the delight and ſatisfaction that a good man takes in doing good. This <hi>Cato</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> boaſts of, as the great comfort and joy of his old age; <hi>That nothing was more pleaſant to him, then the conſcience of a well-ſpent life, and the remembrance of many benefits and kindneſſes done to others.</hi> Senſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are not laſting, but preſently vaniſh and expire: but that is not the worſt of them, they leave a ſting behind them; as the pleaſure goes off:
<q>— Succedit frigida cura,</q>
Sadneſs and melancholly come in the place of it, guilt and trouble and repentance follow it. But the pleaſure of doing good remains after the thing is done; the thoughts of it lie eaſy in our minds, and the reflexion upon it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards does for ever miniſter joy and delight to us. In a word, that frame of mind which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to do good is the very temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Happineſs. <hi>Solomon,</hi> after all his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of worldly pleaſures, pitcheth at laſt upon this as the greateſt felicity of humane life, and the only good uſe that is to be made of a proſperous and plentiful fortune, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.12, <hi>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoyce and do good in his life.</hi> And
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:37901:166"/>
a greater and a wiſer than <hi>Solomon</hi> hath ſaid, that <hi>it is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, To employ our ſelves in doing good, is to imitate the higheſt Excellency and Perfection. It is to be like God, <hi>who is good, and doth good</hi>; and to be like him in that which he eſteems his greateſt glory, and that is, his Goodneſs. It is to be like the Son of God, who, when he took our nature upon him, and lived in the World, <hi>went about doing good.</hi> It is to be like the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, whoſe great employment it is to be <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring ſpirits for the good of others.</hi> To be charitable and helpful and beneficial to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is to be a good Angel, and a Saviour, and a God to men. And the Example of our bleſſed Saviour more eſpecially, is the great Pattern which our Religion propounds to us. And we have all the reaſon in the World to be in love with it; becauſe that very Goodneſs which it propounds to our imitation was ſo beneficial to our ſelves: when we our ſelves feel and enjoy the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects of that good which he did in the World, this ſhould mightily endear the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to us, and make us forward to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that love and kindneſs to which we are indebted for ſo many bleſſings, and upon which all our hopes of happineſs do depend.</p>
            <p>And there is this conſiderable difference between our Saviour's charity to us, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:37901:167"/>
ours to others: He did all purely for our ſakes, and for our benefit; whereas all the good we do to others is a greater good done to our ſelves. They indeed are beholden to us for the kindneſs we do them, and we to them for the opportunity of doing it. Every ignorant perſon that comes in our way to be inſtructed by us; every ſinner whom we reclaim, every poor and neceſſitous man whom we relieve, is a happy opportunity of doing good to our ſelves, and of <hi>laying up for our ſelves a good treaſure againſt the time which is to come, that we may lay hold on eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</hi> By this principle the beſt and the happieſt man that ever was, governed his life and actions, eſteeming it <hi>a more bleſſed thing to give than to receive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, This is one of the greateſt and moſt ſubſtantial Duties of Religion; and next to the love and honour which we pay to God himſelf, the moſt acceptable ſervice that we can perform to him. It is one half of the Law, and next to the firſt and great Commandment, and very like unto it: like to it in the excellency of its nature, and in the neceſſity of its obligation. For <hi>this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment we have from him, that he who loveth God, love his brother alſo.</hi> The firſt Commandment excels in the dignity of the object; but the Second hath the advantage in the reality of its effects. For <hi>our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:37901:167"/>
extendeth not to God,</hi> we can do him no real benefit; but our charity to men is really uſeful and beneficial to them. For which reaſon God is contented, in many caſes, that the external Honour and Worſhip which by his poſitive commands he requires of us, ſhould give way to that natural duty of Love and Mercy which we owe to one another. And to ſhew how great a value he puts upon Charity, he hath made it the great teſtimony of our Love to himſelf; and for want of it rejects all other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of love to him as falſe and inſincere. <hi>If any man ſay, I love God, and hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he is a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, This is that which will give us the greateſt comfort when we come to die. It will then be no pleaſure to men to reflect upon the great eſtates they have got, and the great places they have been advanced to, becauſe they are leaving theſe things, and they will ſtand them in no ſtead in the other world; <hi>Riches profit not in the day of wrath:</hi> But the conſcience of well-doing will refreſh our Souls even under the very pangs of death. With what contentment does a good man then look upon the good he hath done in his life? and with what confidence doth he look over into the other
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:37901:168"/>
world, where he hath provided for himſelf <hi>bags that wax not old, a treaſure in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens that faileth not</hi>? For though our eſtates will not follow us into the other world, our good works will; though we cannot carry our riches along with us, yet we may ſend them before us, to make way for our recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into everlaſting habitations. In ſhort, works of Mercy and Charity will comfort us at the hour of death, and plead for us at the day of Judgment, and procure for us at the hands of a merciful God a glorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence at the reſurrection of the juſt. Which leads me to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſt</hi> conſideration I ſhall offer to you; which is, the reward of doing good both in this world and the other. If we believe God himſelf, he hath made more particular and encouraging promiſes to this grace and virtue, than to any other.</p>
            <p>The advantages of it in This World are many and great. It is the way to derive a laſting bleſſing upon our eſtate. Acts of charity are the beſt Deeds of Settlement. We gain the prayers and bleſſings of thoſe to whom we extend our charity; and it is no ſmall thing to have <hi>the bleſſing of them that are ready to periſh to come upon us.</hi> For God <hi>hears the prayers of the deſtitute; and his ear is open to their cry.</hi> Charity is a great ſecurity to us in times of evil: and that not
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:37901:168"/>
only from the ſpecial promiſe and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, which are engaged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from want thoſe that relieve the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of others; but likewiſe from the nature of the thing, which makes way for its own reward in this world. He that is charitable to others, provides a ſupply and retreat for himſelf in the day of diſtreſs: For he provokes mankind by his example, to like tenderneſs towards him; and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beſpeaks the commiſeration of others, againſt it comes to be his turn to ſtand in need of it. Nothing in this World makes a man more and ſurer friends than charity and bounty, and ſuch as will ſtand by us in the greateſt troubles and dangers. <hi>For a good man</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>one would even dare to die.</hi> 'Tis excellent counſel of the Son of <hi>Sirach; Lay up thy treaſure according to the Commandment of the Moſt high, and it ſhall bring thee more profit than gold. Shut up thy alms in thy ſtore-houſe, and it ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee from all affliction: It ſhall fight for thee againſt thine enemies, better than a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhield and ſtrong ſpear.</hi> It hath ſometimes happened, that the obligation that men have laid upon others by their Charity, hath, in caſe of danger and extremity, done them more kindneſs than all the reſt of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate could do for them; and their Alms have literally delivered them from death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:37901:169"/>But what is all this to the endleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Happineſs of the Next life; where the returns of doing good will be vaſtly great beyond what we can now expect or imagine! For God takes all the good we do to others as a debt upon himſelf; and he hath eſtate and treaſure enough to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the greateſt obligations we can lay upon him. So that we have the Truth, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Sufficiency of God for our ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that what we ſcatter and ſow in this kind, will grow up to a plentiful harveſt in the other World: and that all our pains and expence in doing good for a few days, will be recompenſed and crowned with the Joys and Glories of Eternity.</p>
