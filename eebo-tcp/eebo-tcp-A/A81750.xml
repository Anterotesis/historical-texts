            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Droytwich CASE.</head>
            <p>KING <hi>John</hi> Granted to the Burgeſſes of <hi>Droytwich</hi> and their Heirs, the Salt Springs there, rendring the yearly Fee Farm Rent of 100 <hi>l. Sterling,</hi> and the Salt Water hath ever ſince been divided into Four Hundred and Four Shares called <hi>Bulleries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Grantees of King <hi>John</hi> and their Heirs have aliened and ſold their whole inheritance in the Salt Springs to ſeveral perſons, who at this day ſtand ſeized in Fee of the ſame, and pay the Fee Farm Rent according to their reſpective Shares, and from the time of King <hi>John's</hi> Grant, to the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Inheritors of the Salt Springs govern'd the ſame, and were deemed Burgeſſes of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> and whoever ſold his Inheritance, ceaſed to be a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> Incorporated the Burrough of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> by the Name of Bailiffs and Burgeſſes, but takes no notice of the Salt Works, nor is there any Order, or Direction given by King <hi>John</hi>'s Grant, or any ſubſequent Charter for the Governing, or Managing thereof.</p>
            <p>There are but Nine Perſons who inhabit within the Burrough of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> who with the Aſſiſtance of thirteen others, they have admitted into the Corporation, pretend to the Power of Governing, Managing, and taxing the Inheritance in the Salt Springs at pleaſure; exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the real Owners thereof from Voting, or Acting therein.</p>
            <p>And altho the Proprietors of the Salt Springs are undoubtedly Burgeſſes of <hi>Droytwich,</hi> and conſequently Members of the Corporation; yet by this Bill they do not ſeek any relief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but only that they may have a Vote in the Managing and Taxing of their own Eſtates.</p>
            <p>It is alledged the preſent Members of the Corporation of <hi>Drotwich</hi> have 150 Shares in the Salt Springs.</p>
            <p>Note, The Perſons following are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Corporation, and have a Hundred and Twenty of the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty, and are for paſſing the Bill.</p>
