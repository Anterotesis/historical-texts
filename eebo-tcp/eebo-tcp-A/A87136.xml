            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is obvious and apparent unto ſenſe, That <hi>Venice, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Switz,</hi> are not moleſted with civil War, Strife or Sedition, like <hi>Germany, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> yet will men have a Commonwealth to be a confuſion. What confuſions we have had in <hi>England;</hi> while the Norman Line ſtrove for abſolute power, while the Barons ſtrove for anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Liberty, while the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſtrove for Royal Dignity; and laſt of all, during theſe eighteen years, in the Wars that have been between the King and the People, in the difference of Judgment both concerning Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Government, and under the perfidious yoke of the late Tyranny, is known. At the apparition, or but name of a Commonwealth, and before any ſuch Orders are introduced, or perhaps truly underſtood, all men, or the moſt of them, are upon a ſuddain agreed that there be a good and perfect Fixation of the Army unto the Old Cauſe; and that the remnant of the Long Parliament be aſſembled: ſo we have this for a taſt or reliſh of a Commonwealth, that of the eighteen, the preſent year is already the moſt unanimous. Nor can this be attributed unto Chance; ſeeing the wit of man, our caſe conſidered, could not, I think, have invented a more natural and neceſſary way of launching into the Orders of a Commonwealth, then firſt by Fixation of the Army ſo, as no Council enſuing may have any ambitious party on which to ſet up: and then to aſſemble that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil which hath given teſtimony of it ſelf, to have been the moſt popularly addicted. By theſe it is no leſs then demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that the Army is faithful, and the people (for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:168557:2"/>
moſt active part of them, which in like caſes cometh to more then all the reſt) is wiſe. Be it granted, that the far greater part of them <q>
                  <hi>(Libertatis dulcedine nondum experta)</hi>
               </q> would force us unto the continuation of Monarchy, if they could; this is the old temper of a people in like caſes: thus the Romans, upon the death of <hi>Romulus,</hi> forced the Senate, who would have introduced a Commonwealth, to elect <hi>Numa</hi> with the ſucceeding Kings; and could not be brought unto the abolition of Monarchy, till it was impoſed upon them by <hi>Brutus</hi> to abjure it. Nevertheleſſe, this people having once taſted of liberty, were of all others the moſt conſtant Aſſertors of the ſame. It cauſeth with the beſt Politicians deſpair, and, as it were, a kinde of tearing themſelves, that the people, even where Monarchy is apparently unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and they have no way but a Commonwealth or confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hold their ancient Laws and Cuſtoms unalterable, and perſecute ſuch as adviſe the neceſſary change of them, how plainly ſoever demonſtrated, as Authors of Innovation, with hatred, if not in tumult and with violence, as when <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> in a like aſſault loſt one of his eyes. Here is <note rend="inter">See M. B. <hi>1</hi> c. <hi>9.</hi>
               </note>the diſcouragement; the Many through diverſity, of Opinions, want of reach into the principles of Government, and unacquaintance with the good thar may by this means be acquired, are never to be agreed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a new form: but then there is alſo this conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the Many upon introduction of a new form, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming once to feel the good, and taſte the ſweet of it, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver agree to abandon it. This is all the comfort that Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, in like caſes, have been able to give themſelves upon conſideration of the nature of the people in general. But if we conſider the nature of the people of <hi>England,</hi> I am much deceived, or the conſolation of knowing men, and good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, may yet be far greater. For though the people of <hi>England</hi> may be twenty to one for Monarchy, they are but deceived by the name, ſeeing they having of late years been more arbitrarily governed then formerly, deſire no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this name, in the truth of their meaning, then not to be at the will of men, but return unto the Government of Laws;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168557:2"/>
for the late Monarchy being rightly conſidered, was indeed no more then an unequal Commonwealth; onely here is the fault of all unequal Commonwealths: they pretend to be Governments of Laws, and at the ſame time defer unto ſome one, or few men, ſuch power, prerogative and prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, as may invade and opporeſs Laws; which fault was the cauſe of perpetual feud, or at leaſt jealouſie between our Kings and our Parliaments. But there is in relation unto the people of <hi>England,</hi> yet a greater encouragement unto Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths-men: for though if we look upon the true cauſe of Popular Government, the Balance hath been many years in turning, yet ſince it came to be ſo perceivable as to cauſe any mention of a Commonwealth, it is but a ſhort time. Should we go ſo far as to compute it from the beginning of the late War, it exceedeth not eighteen years, in which the eyes and affections of the people are ſo wonderfully opened and extended, that I do not think there are fewer then fifty thouſand of the more active and knowing, that drive vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly at a Commonwealth; while the reſt are not only calm and paſſive, but mature for any good impreſſion without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or indeed appearance of any War or Tumult that can enſue upon the introduction of a new form: nor is there the leaſt improbability that an equal Commonwealth may be received with embraces, ſeeing a Tyranny came not only in, but was ſupported without blood. But if people for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Territory, and for their bulk or number ſo great as this of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould fall (to take a larger compaſs then I hope we ſhall need) within the ſpace of thirty years, out of Monarchy, to which they have ever been accuſtomed, into a Commonwealth of which they have had no experience nor knowledge, and that (except in the ruine of Monarchy, which how infirm ſoever, uſeth not to expire otherwiſe) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rapine, War, or indeed without any great confuſion, I doubt whether the world can afford another example of the like natural, eaſie and ſuddain tranſition of one Government into another. Yet ere two parts in three of this time be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, men can be deſpairing. In what (ſay they) have you ſhewn us that we muſt neceſſarily be a Commonwealth? Why
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:168557:3"/>
in this, (ſay I) that you cannot ſhew me how we ſhould be any thing elſe. In what poſture (ſay they) do we ſee the people to give us this hope? VVhy in the very beſt (ſay I) that in this ſtate of Affairs a people (if you conſider their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or nature) could have caſt themſelves into. This po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to return is thus, or at leaſt thus I take it to be: The Armies of this Nation by reſtitution of their old Officers, are fixed, reſolved upon, and encouraged by the moſt active part of the people towards the proſecution of the Old Cauſe, or introduction of a popular form: the framing of this form is modeſtly and dutifully defer'd by them unto the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the reſtitution of the Long Parliament, in that rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the ſame which declared for, and obliged themſelves unto this end.</p>
            <p>Now putting this to be the caſe, I come to the ſcope of this Paper, which is to diſcourſe upon this poſture; in which to my underſtanding, there are but three things that can inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe between us and a Commonwealth, and but two more that can interpoſe between us and an equal Commonwealth, The things that may interpoſe between us and a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, are ſuch Monarchy, as can no otherwiſe get up then by ſorraign Invaſion; or Tyranny, which at the ſtrongeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us was not of any duration, and which changing hands muſt ſtill be weaker: of theſe two, they being onely poſſible, and no whit probable, I ſhall ſay no more. But the third thing which can interpoſe between us and a Commonwealth is Oligarchy, which in like caſes hath been more probable and incidental, then I conceive it to be at the preſent: ſuch a thing if it be introduced among us, is moſt likely to be of this form.</p>
            <p>It may conſiſt of a Council not elected by the people, but obtruded upon us, under the Notion of a Senate or a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, or of Religion; and it may be for life, or for ſome certain or pretended term, with a Duke or Princely Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at the head of it, or without one.</p>
            <p>The power at which ſuch a Council doth naturally drive, is to call Parliaments, and to govern in the intervals: but the ſucceſs of ſuch a Council, will be, that if in calling Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168557:3"/>
it do not pack them, it will be forthwith ruined; and if it do pack them, then the caſe of ſuch a Councel and a Parliament will be no otherwiſe different from the caſe of a ſingle perſon and a Parliament, then that more Maſters leſs able to ſupport their greatneſs, &amp; whoſe greatneſs we ſhall be leſs able to ſupport, will be a burden by ſo much more heavy, then one Maſter more able to ſupport his greatneſs, and whoſe greatneſs we were more able to ſupport. But this will either not be, or be of no continuance.</p>
            <p>The things that can interpoſe between us and an equal Commonwealth, are either a Senate for Life, or an Optimacy.</p>
            <p>The ſeventy elders in Iſrael, were a Senate for life; this though conſtitutively elected by the people, became after the captivity, or in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Commonwealth (how anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently is uncertain) meer Oligarchy, by the means of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; no man being capable of Magiſtracy except he were a Presbyter, no man being made a Presbyter but by laying on of Hands, and the Prince with the Senate engroſſing the whole power of laying on of Hands.</p>
            <p>Nor were the people thus excluded, and trampled upon by the Phariſees under other colour then that of Religion, or tradition derived in their Oral Law or Cabala from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> in whoſe Chair they ſat, and not only pretended their Government to be a government of Saints, but in ſome things bade fairer for that title then others, who aſſumed it afterwards: for that they did miracles, is plain in theſe words of our Saviour, unto them: <hi>If I by Beelzebub caſt out Devils, by whom do your children caſt them out? therefore they ſhall be your judges,</hi> Mat. 12. 27. By which I may believe that Miracles themſelves do not in any wiſe oblige us to hope that ſuch a ſtate of Government can be Religious or honeſt: much leſs, where there are no miracles, nor any ſuch certain diſtinction to be outwardly made between a Saint and an Hypocrite, as may ſecure us that we ſhall not have Hypocrites impoſed upon us for Saints. The ſureſt teſtimony of Saintſhip in Rulers, is, when they are willing to admit of ſuch orders in Government, as reſtrain the power
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168557:4"/>
to do wickedly, or of lording it over their brethren.</p>
            <p>Upon the pattern of the High-prieſt, and the ſeventy El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, aroſe the government of the Pope and his ſeventy Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, pretending alſo unto Saintſhip; which nevertheleſs is as little yeelded unto them, as they aſſume that a Councel of ſeventy for life, is a good guard of the liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>The next Senate for life, was that of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> conſiſting of two Kings hereditary, and twenty eight Senators elective. Theſe notwithſtanding they were not eligible but by the people, and at the ſixtieth year of their age, and by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance or equal Agrarian of their Commonwealth, could not any one of them excel the meaneſt Citizen in their lot, or ſhares in Land; ſo vigorouſly attempted to draw the whole reſult of the Commonwealth unto themſelves, that if the people had not ſtriven as vigorouſly for the preſervation of their right, they had been excluded from making their own Laws. The expedient found out by the people in this exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, was their election of five annual Magiſtrates out of their own number, called the <hi>Ephori,</hi> with power to try, condemn and execute any of their Kings or Senators which thenceforth ſhould go about to ſubvert the fundamental Laws of their Government, by which it belonged unto the Senate to debate and propoſe only, and unto the aſſembly of the people to reſolve. Without this expedient (which in another Commonwealth not planted upon a like Agrarian, would have availed little, as the <hi>Roman</hi> people found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by their Tribunes) had the people of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> through a Senate for life been deprived of their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Commonwealth was alſo founded upon a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for life; which though firſt inſtituted by election of the people, came afterwards to be ſuch into which their children found other admittance, in ſuch manner as from hence grew a <hi>Patrician</hi> order, ingroſſing not only the Senate, and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the people from bearing Magiſtracy in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, but oppreſſing them alſo by an heavy yoke of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168557:4"/>
which cauſed perpetual fewd between this Senate and the People, and in the end the ruine of the Commonwealth. Yet entitled this Nobility themſelves unto theſe preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, no otherwiſe then by ſuch religious rites, as among them were believed to confer Saintſhip, and thereby to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them unto Dominion over the people, in which they were alſo aided by the Optimacy.</p>
            <p>Now examples of a Senate for Life being of like nature and neceſſary conſequence, it is my hope and prayer, that never any ſuch be introduced in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in caſe of an Optimacy, a Commonwealth, though not admitting of a Senate for Life, may yet be unequal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athens</hi> conſiſted of a Senate upon annual Rotation; yet through the Optimacy which was inſtituted by <hi>Solon,</hi> came under ſuch a yoke of the Nobility, and upon victory obtained in the battel of <hi>Plataea,</hi> they took the opportunity to throw off, and reduce the Commonwealth unto more equality.</p>
            <p>An Optimacy is introduced, where a people is not onely divided by Tribes according to their habitation; but every Tribe into Claſſes, according unto their eſtates or different meaſures in riches; as if you ſhould caſt all that have above two thouſand pounds a year into one Claſſis; all that have above one thouſand pounds a year, into another; all that have above five hundred, into a third; and ſo forth, for as many Claſſes as you like to make.</p>
            <p>Now if in this caſe the firſt and ſecond Claſſes may give the ſuſſrage of the whole people, as in <hi>Rome;</hi> or that theſe only may enjoy the Senate, and all the Magiſtracies, though but upon Rotation, as in <hi>Athens;</hi> yet the people, as to theſe parts being excluded, the Commonwealth muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unequal: wherefore this alſo ought to be forewarned, to the end that it may be prevented.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if we in <hi>England</hi> can have any Monarchy, we ſhall have no Commonwealth; but if we can have no Monarchy, then bar but a Senate for Life, and an Optimacy, and we muſt have an equal Commonwealth. Succeſſive Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments, whether immediately, or with Councels in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168557:5"/>
and like fancies, will be as void of effect, as of example, or reaſon.</p>
            <p>But an abundance of things is tedious; we would have ſuch a Commonwealth as may be dictated in a breath. Thus then: Let a Senate be conſtituted of Three hundred, and a Popular Aſſembly of One thouſand and fifty, each for the term of three years, and to be annually changed in one third part. But in caſe a Commonwealth were thus briefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated, what would this abate of thoſe many things which muſt of neceſſity go unto a like ſtructure, that it may be equally and methodically brought up from a firm and proper foundation? there is no way of dictating a Commonwealth unto facile practice, but by the ſeeming difficulty of the whole circumſtances requiſite, even to a tittle. Nevertheleſs to try again: Let the Lands throughout <hi>England</hi> be all caſt into ſome Pariſh. Let every Pariſh elect annually a fifth Man; let every hundred of theſe fifth men, with the places of their habitation, conſtitute one hundred; then caſt twenty of theſe hundreds into one Tribe or Shire. Putting the caſe the Tribes or Shires thus ſtated amount unto fifty, let the fifth men or Deputies in every Tribe or Shire, elect annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two out of their own number, to be Senators for three years, and ſeven to be of the aſſembly of the people for a like term, each term obliging unto an equal interval: which the Senate being for the firſt year conſtituted of three hundred, and the Aſſembly of the people of one thouſand and fifty, gives you thoſe bodies upon a triennial Rotation, and in them the main Orders of an equal Commonwealth. If you muſt have a Commonwealth, and you will have an equal Commonwealth, then (pardon my boldneſs) after this or ſome like manner muſt you do, becauſe like work never was, nor can be done any otherwiſe.</p>
