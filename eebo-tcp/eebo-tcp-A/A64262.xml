            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Christ saith, <hi>Seek ye first the Kingdom of God;</hi> but your Care is how to get great Livings and fat Benefices; and as for the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55332:4"/>
Heavenly Kingdom, which Christ compared to a Grain of <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 31.</note> Mustardseed, you neither know it, nor are willing to learn; you will neither enter into it your selves, nor suffer others, <note place="margin">Mat 23. 13.</note> but by your Traditions you shut it up against Men. Christ saith to his, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> but you teach for Doctrine, <note place="margin">Mat 5. 34, 37.

Oh sad! may it not be said, <hi>The Land mourns because of Oathes?</hi> What, have you no Shame nor Care of your Credit, that can do such Things in the open Sun, and not blush? Will you never open your Eyes a little to see your Works? What do you mean <note place="margin">Hos. 4. 2, 3.</note> to do?

Or do you not rather do these Things to get Money by? Oh Cursed Covetousness, the Root of all Evil; Oh, how it hath drowned your Souls in Perdition; <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 15.</note> how it hath blinded your Hearts, that you can see nothing of the Kingdom of God: You bring in a Company of poor deluded Souls, who follow you blind Guides, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise for the little Infant, <hi>That it shall forsake the Devil and all his Works;</hi> then what shall these bold Promisers suffer, if the Child do not so? Will they, or you their Teachers for them, be content to suffer the Pains of Hell, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of such as break Covenant with God? And when

will you see that this Custom of undertaking for the little Infants, greatly derogates from the Honour of Christ, who is the only Undertaker for Man towards God: But what if a Child, through Grace, be so strengthned, when it grows up, as to see your Wretchness, and so to forsake and bear Testimony against all the Works of the Evil One that are done amongst you, will you not call him Heretick, and put him out of your Synagogues? Yea, yea; for you can have no Fellowship with any that have Health in them; for by your own Confession, you are miserable Offenders all the Dayes of your Life, and have no Health in you, and so cannot endure to hear of Perfection or perfect Soundness on this Side the Grave: Yea, though you read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">Ephes. 9. 11, 12, 13.</note>
