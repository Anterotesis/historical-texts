            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>How unmeet ſuch as we are above any, who have obtained like precious faith, to appear in this publike manner, is beſt knowne to the Lord and our own ſouls, being in ſome meaſure through his Free grace, made ſenſible of our inſufficiency to ſo weighty a Work, the conſideration whereof might wholly diſcourage our proceeding herein, did not the honor of God, the intereſt of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord groundedly provoke us thereunto; for now as all will behold, whether Saints or Sinners, ſo many being already prejudiced in their judgments thorough falſe reports received of us, (as they have been apt enough) will ſhoot their arrowes againſt us, but with how much unwarrantableneſs on their parts, let the Reader judge by this enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Narrative. Others being convinced of the truth and goodneſs of the cauſe we are ingaged in, as they do not ſpeak againſt us, ſo on the other hand, leſt they ſhould come under the like reproach with us, are ſilent in ſaying any thing on our behalf, yet ſome <hi>Elijahs</hi> there are, who have been and ſtill are willing to bear part of the burthen with us: Adding hereunto, that we are a ſtumbling block to many, thorough the many failings, infirmities and miſcarriages ſuch poor nothing-creatures as we are, have been compaſsed with, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of ſo honourable and weighty a cauſe as this is, for which
<pb facs="tcp:63520:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>each one of us have great reaſon to be truly humbled before the Lord (though hereby we may humbly ſay, Are we as <hi>Signs</hi>
               <note n="[e]" place="margin">Iſa. 8.18.</note> 
               <hi>and Wonders in Iſreal?</hi>) Howerver, notwithſtanding all the reproaches and hard ſpeeches that hitherto hath attended us from many of our Brethren, and Familiars, (whom we deſire dearly to love in the Lord) as wel as from the Apoſtates of this day; the latter of which as we have &amp; may expect it, ſo we do not much regard it. We have been ſtrengthned in our Head the Lord Jeſus, to bear up under all, though many halts &amp; ſtops have been made in this work thereby, which hath cauſed ſome ſearchings of heart amongſt us; and we truſt that the ſame power and goodneſs of our Father, which hath been ſo wonderfully manifeſted towards us to this very day, will ſtill carry us on therein, to the glory of his grace, by Jeſus Chriſt, which is to be acknowledged by us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and his people, with all humility and thankfulneſs; ſome paſſages whereof are inſerted in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, by fruſtrating the intentions of thoſe from whom we are ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, to have proceeded againſt us, even to a caſting out, though the chiefeſt of them were unanimous therein, and in making them confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and abortive in all their indeavors that way.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that when they had ſent (as they apprehended) to the ſobereſt and choiceſt of the Independent and Baptiſed Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the City to countenance them therein, (who accordingly ſent chief men from amongſt them) they hitherto have been ſo over-ruled by the Lord, as that they have not been capable of adviſing therein.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, In keeping us together as one intire body, from firſt to laſt, though full of weakneſses, inabling us from time to time &amp; that according to Goſpel-rule) to admoniſh thoſe from whom we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, end to watch over one another in love, though Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> gave out upon our firſt with-drawing, that <hi>he was confident we ſhould break aſunder within three moneths,</hi> (or thereabouts) <hi>as the juſt hand of the Lord againſt us.</hi> And therefore the Lord having ſo graciouſly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us, we do not deſire to be fore-caſting what will be the event or iſsue of this our publike teſtimony, but looking up to him, deſire to reſt ſatisfied in this, that herein we have done no more then our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That in regard the Lord hath been, and is ſo greatly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by a profeſſing <hi>generation,</hi> ſinning againſt ſo great light as never was known before, (amongſt whom the Souldiers and Mr. <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſon</hi> we are ſeperated from are apart) it may appear there is a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant among the Churches of Chriſt, who do not wink at, or comply with ſo great iniquity, but do deſire to bear a ſutable Teſtimony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
<pb facs="tcp:63520:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>and make a due ſeperation from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. There being many reproaches and calumnies caſt upon us, as to the matter and ground of our ſeperation and with-drawing to this day, ſo as that the name of the Lord is greatly reproached tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough theſe Miſreports concerning us; it might therefore hereby appear, that the cauſe why we do ſo, is for ſuch ſins as are publikely ſcandalous and ſinful, that ſo whatever becomes of our perſons the truth may be vindicated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. That all who fear the Lord in uprightneſs of heart, may conſider and ſee it's their duty to with-draw and ſeperate from all ſuch perſons; For what ſaith the Apoſtle?<note n="[f]" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.6.</note> 
               <hi>Know you not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? Purge out therefore the old lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, &amp;c.</hi> And may it not be ſpoken with grief of heart, that the lump, or generality of the Churches in this day, are much leavened with a luke-warm, ſenſual, ſelfiſh ſpirit, ſeeking the honor and favor of men for their own advantage, rather then ſetting the Lord before them, and approving their hearts to him, and indeavouring after the advancement of his glory in the world, which comes to paſs in a great meaſure for want of doing their duty to ſuch perſons in this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. That if it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to call any, or all of us, further to ſuffer herein, or upon ſuch like account, it may appear we ſuffer for his Name ſake and not as evil doers; the mouthes of many profeſſors having been already opened in this reſpect, though wee could wiſh it hath not rather been to palliate and cover over their own Apoſtacy.</p>

That ſo ſuch as are unknown to us, and have been already engaged in this work of ſeperation, may bee incouraged, and not diſcouraged, and may know that whatſoever their afflictions and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls are thereupon, the ſame are alſo accompliſhed in others of their Brethren upon the ſame account, that ſo from a ſpirit of love to truth we may be ſtrengthning one anothers hands in ſo bleſsed and honorable a work.</p>

But to come more home to our preſent caſe, ſee <hi>Numb.</hi> chap. 14. chap. 16. where the leſſer part of the congregation (to wit, <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> who were preſſing on from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> the work of God in that generation) were counted faithful, &amp; owned by him for that very cauſe; but the greater part of the conregation, who ſaid, <hi>Let us make a captain, and return into Aegypt,</hi> and would have <hi>ſtoned Moſes and Aaron, &amp;c.</hi> their ſin was ſo diſhono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God, and did ſo provoke the eyes of his glory, that their carkaſſes muſt fall, and not ſee the good Land they were going into, yea and their children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them wander in the Wilderneſs forty years. And in <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.

diſhonorable to God to ſtand by, &amp; uphold them therein, (or for Churches or others to own them that do ſo) as it was to have countenanced, upheld or touch't with <hi>Korah</hi> and his company in that day.</p>
                        <p>to God then the like in a private brother, or two or three Brethren? And how can we be ſaid to <hi>withdraw from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Brother that walks diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly,</hi> when we quietly ſit down with the Church that owns them in their ſin, (as we conceive) and do break bread with, and propheſie amongſt them? for we cannot ſee how this will hold before the Lord when we are to <hi>avoid every appearance of evil.</hi>

            <p>AFter ſome ſolemn waiting upon the Lord, this Paper was ſigned by threeſcore in number, or thereabouts, and was intended ſo to have been given in, but was otherwiſe determined upon for theſe two Reaſons; Firſt, Becauſe in ſuch an evil day as this, we ought not to <hi>truſt in a Friend,</hi> no, <hi>not in a Guide, but to keep the door of our mouths from thoſe that lye in our boſome;</hi> If ſo, then not to truſt our hands with thoſe who had ſo unworthily betrayed the Cauſe of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It was judged moſt for the glory of God to go in perſon all of us, being about twelve more then ſigned it, and own the ſaid Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which would be more authentick, and leſs advantage given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any particular perſon; and therefore an exact Copy was drawn out, and carryed unſigned, all of us accompanying the Brethren (to whom it was chiefly committed) unto <hi>London</hi>-Houſe, the next firſt day after the date thereof; when being come, a Brother of ours ſtood up, and ſpake a few Words to this effect, <hi>That we were here come to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto them in brotherly love, after ſolemn waiting upon the Lord, a Paper, containing the evil of thoſe perſons amongſt them, againſt whom we had been ſo long contending, together with the Grounds and Reaſons of our withdrawing to this day, which we had the more haſtened to give in, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we were ſeveral times urged thereunto by ſeveral Brethren ſent by their appointment unto us; and further, deſired that liberty might be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto one of the Brethren</hi> (by us intruſted) <hi>for the reading of it;</hi> Which was not onely denyed us, but much ſcruple raiſed by ſome, What Scripture-Warrant we had to give in our diſſatisfactions in Writing. To which anſwer was made, <hi>That we judged it our Goſpel-liberty to give it in by writing, or otherwiſe, as might be moſt for the glory of God; for by this writing we did give in our joynt Teſtimony againſt the preſent evil, with the reaſons of our withdrawing, which we apprehended could not be ſo well done by a private brother, or brethren in ſpeaking; but that we might have had juſt grounds of exceptions againſt ſome things that might be ſpoken againſt ſuch brethren.</hi> Hereupon our Brother <hi>Marſh</hi> who walks with them, ſaid, That he thought it was not onely our Goſpel-liberty, but the Scripture would warrant our practice, elſe <hi>Pauls</hi> writing to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the inceſtuous perſon, was not warrantable; but if it was, then our practice had ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore conceived there need be no further diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that. And by this means was that Scruple in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and ſome Way made for the reading of our Paper, but not by any one of us, which although we judged it a little unreaſonable, yet for peace ſake we condeſcended thereunto, and accordingly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63520:17"/>in our Paper, which was read by the Brother aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though it was ſo late before he began, that there was hardly time to read it thorough by day-light, much leſs to debate it, and open the Scriptures therein; however before we departed, they made us a promiſe that We ſhould have full liberty another time to read it our ſelves deliberately, and debate it, with the Scriptures laid down for proof of what was there aſſerted; &amp; We alſo promiſed them to come whenſoever they ſhould deſire it. And ſo We departed for that time, continuing with one accord together in prayer and ſupplication, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to hear from them according to promiſe; but contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in ſome Weeks after, they ſent for ſeveral Paſtors and Members out of other Congregations without our conſent, to receive their Advice how to deal with us: Their Names are as followeth.</p>

            <p>Having knowledge of this Meeting thorough the report of others, We did appoint a time to ſeek the Lord, to conſider what might be our duty, &amp; how far we ſhould appear therein, or whether we ſhould appear or not; and at laſt came to this iſſue, That we ſhould appoint ſeveral Brethren in the Name of the whole, to go unto thoſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren above mentioned, when they ſhould meet with the other part of the Congregation, and acquaint them with the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why we could not own them in the Work they were come about.

But that which we chiefly aim at, (as by the third, and the cloſe of the fifth Query will appear) was their ſending without our conſent in the Name of the church, when we our ſelves were a part; likewiſe there was ſeveral perſons there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom we had juſt exceptions, if it had then been meet to ſpeak of it. Moreover their caſe was ordinary, not difficult to them, for that moſt of the churches in the city, more or leſs, ſeem to us guilty of the ſame tranſgreſſion; and therefore we apprehend that ſuch a practice was more binding to them then to us, as our caſe at this time ſtands, otherwiſe we deſire to keepe ſtrictly to every primitive practice that hath any ſuch inſtructions for us.</p>

            <p>The ſaid Queries being laid before the Brethren aforementioned, did ſo prevail with them, as they not onely judged it unmeet, but did wholly refuſe to meddle with the matter in difference as the caſe then ſtood, declaring It was but reaſonable We ſhould have a free debate of our Paper in the Congregation, according to promiſe, before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other means be uſed, and ſo they departed for that time</p>
            <p>Within a ſhort time after this, a day and time was agreed upon between us and the other part of the Congregation, from whom we were withdrawn to ſeek the Lord together, and then to proceed to the debate of our Paper, though that vvhich provoked them hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, (as We conceive was from the refuſal of thoſe Brethren they ſent for to meddle therein, as the caſe ſtood, rather then their ovvn voluntary act: But the day appointed being come, the fore-part of it vvas ſpent in prayer, opening our hearts before the Lord, and each other, hereby hoping ſuch a ſpirit might be ſound both in them and us, as the debate would have been to the glory of God, and the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of truth on either ſide; but inſtead thereof, ſo many grating ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions both in prayer and ſpeaking vvere uttered by Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> againſt us, as vvas to the grief of moſt of us, and the indiſpoſing of ſome in a great meaſure unto the Work We were met about: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever about two in the Afternoon, we proceeded to the debate of our

In the cloſe of the day having got through our Paper, We deſired to have the reſult of the Congregation, Whether by what was laid before them, they did not judge the Souldiers to be guilty of thoſe ſins laid to their charge by us? Whereupon Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> ſtood up, and ſpake in Words to this effect, <hi>That he looked upon us as ſuch who had made a rent in the Church, and that there was a mark ſet upon us by the Holy Spirit, being ſuch as had made</hi>

                        <head>A briefe account of ſome Paſsages between our Brother <hi>Sympſon,</hi> and the Brethren appointed by us to meet with him about ſome Letters he wrote to the Congreation du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his impriſonment in <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended he is very much fallen from the truths therein laid down, to the great diſhonour of the Goſpel, and the grief of many of the faithful in this day.</head>
                        <p>THE ſix Brethren appointed to this Work, met at a Brothers Houſe in <hi>Coloman-street</hi> the day abovementioned, about two in the Afternoon, to commend their preſent Work unto the Lord, and deſire his bleſſing upon them therein, and then made their repair to our Brother <hi>Sympſon,</hi> where after a little waiting for the coming of our Brothers, <hi>Shrimpton</hi> and <hi>Marſh,</hi> who deſired (as the Brethren were informed) to hear what ſhould paſs in relation to the Letters: This motion was alſo made by Brother <hi>Powell,</hi> being alſo preſent, <hi>That before any progreſs be made, there might be a word put up to the Lord for a bleſſing.</hi> To which end another brother made anſwer, <q>That it would be neceſſary the naked ground of their coming ſhould be firſt laid down, that we might pray with underſtanding.</q> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the Brethren ſent by us declared their readineſs to joyne therein: Hereupon one of the Brethren proceeded to declare the ground of their coming to this effect; <q>That ſeveral of our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Sympſons</hi> Letters from <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle being preſented to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Brethren who met at our Brother <hi>Caryes</hi> houſe intentionally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another account; but thoſe Letters intervening, we ſpent our time in peruſing them, which in the reading did ſo work upon their hearts, that they throught meet to preſent unto the Brethren &amp; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (in whoſe Name they were then come) the ſaid Letters, and to offer, Whether ſome Brethren ſhould not be choſen in the Name of the reſt, humbly to lay the matter contained in them before him, that if it were the Will of the Lord he might be convinced wherein, and how far he had declined the Cauſe and Intereſt of our Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63520:19"/>and be provoked to that old Spirit of Life and Zeal in teſtifying to ſo glorious a Cauſe, and accordingly upon reading of them we were of one heart that the Brethren aforementioned, in the Name of the whole, be deſired to lay them before him with as much love &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs as could be; and that we were alſo reproved in our own ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as having miſſed of the Will of the Lord that we had it no more upon our hearts to beg mercy for him at the Throne of Grace, that the Lord would reſtore unto him that primitive ſpirit for the cauſe of Chriſt; &amp; that many of our hearts were broken on his behalf at the reading of his Letters.</q> After an account thus given, it was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a Word ſhould be ſpoken to the Lord in prayer before any diſcourſe ſhould be. Our Brother <hi>Sympſon</hi> then ſpake to this effect; <hi>That having had ſome knowledge of their coming from ſome of us, and the occaſion of their coming from ſome others before their meeting here, he had privately commended the buſineſs they were come about, unto the Lord, as he did ſuppoſe they alſo had done; likewiſe he judged that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſhould ſpeak unto the Lord in prayer he could not freely joyne with them; ſo neither if he ſhould ſpeak there might be that ſpoken where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they could not freely joyn with him, which being pre-conſidered, be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it moſt convenient to proceed to the work without prayer;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſpake further to this purpoſe; <hi>That ſince they profeſt they had in all plainneſs declared the ground of their coming, he would give them as plain an Anſwer, which that he might the better do, he ſhould lay down his Anſwer under three heads:</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63520:19"/>proceeded againſt us, he could not entertain any debate with them about thoſe Letters.</hi> Which brought in the third Head, to which he ſpake to this effect; <hi>That the Letters about which they came were directed to the Church,</hi> (meaning thoſe with whom he walked) <hi>and if he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any thing therein contrary to ſound dectrine, or otherwiſe, he muſt appeal unto the Church, as</hi> Paul <hi>did from</hi> Agrippa <hi>to</hi> Caeſar; <hi>and if the Church thought meet upon peruſal to call him to an account for any thing therein, he ſhould be ready to anſwer it before them; but he could not give way to the debating of them by our Brethren for the reaſons aforementioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he could not in this caſe bring himſelf under the judgement of his adverſaries,</hi> (or Words to that purpoſe) <hi>and thereby alſo give away the priviledges of the Church into the hands of ſuch whom according to the Rule of the Goſpel be muſt look upon as Heathens and Publicans; but if they or any other would come in their own</hi>

To which they anſwered, <hi>It was not theirs;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> alſo ſaid, <hi>They were his own words.</hi> After this our Brother <hi>Cary</hi> was ſilent, and then our Brothers,<note n="⋆" place="margin">Brethren of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> 
                           <hi>Marſh, Shrimpton,</hi> and <hi>Powell,</hi> being preſent as aforſaid, ſaid, They never remembred any ſuch Admonition. Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>It was ſo;</hi> which he endeavoured to make out thus: <hi>That the Brethren who were entruſted with the Government of the Church, did agree that we ſhould be admoniſhed, as having ſinned in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Congregation, and turning out backs upon the Ordinances of Chriſt, and that they had committed it to him to declare the ſame, which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63520:20"/>he did at that time when brought in our paper containing the grounds of our withdrawing, through at that time we were not admitted to read them;&amp; the Church not diſowning of it, he looked upon it as an admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church.</hi> After this other of our Brethren ſpake in few Words to this purpoſe; <q>That they were come as brethren, and they hoped in much love and ſingleneſs of heart to diſcourſe with him, and to have laid down wherein we judged he had miſſed of the Will of God, and declined the Cauſe of our Lord Chriſt, comparing the preſent frame of heart he is in, with what it was when he lay a priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in <hi>Windſor</hi> Caſtle, when they could not but look upon him as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an excellent ſpirit for Chriſt; but ſince he did refuſe, they would turn unto the Lord (who would hear) and mourn for him:</q>

Being thus unkindly, yea, may We not ſay unchriſtianly entertained by Mr. <hi>Sympſon,</hi> We ſtill continued vvaiting upon the Lord in our eſtate of vvithdrawing, our ſpirits being grieved by this carriage of his; And after ſome time ſeeking the Lord, and enquiring into his mind and Will, We came to this concluſion as a preſent duty lying before us, That in regard We did find no repentance in the Souldiers, but rather hardneſs of heart, as alſo Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> hardened in his evil, in excuſing and abetting of them, vvhich encouraged others to do the like; and the reſt vvho vvere ſome vvhat ſenſible of the evil amongſt them, much darkned in their underſtandings by reaſon thereof, We ſhould unanimouſly go unto them, and lay before the Souldiers their ovvn evil, and the evil of the reſt as abetting of them in their degree, and to admoniſh them in the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, vvith as much brotherly love as the Lord ſhould help us. And that We might have the greater avve of the Lord upon our ſouls, and be more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in this Work, vve did agree to ſend unto the Brethren hereafter mentioned, to intreat them in brotherly love, and for the glory of God, to accompany us as Witneſſes therein; vvhich was accordingly done, and perſons choſen from amongſt us to ſpeak unto them.

Secondly, We did deſire to order it as might make moſt for peace.</p>
                        <p>After this, upon further inquiry what our duty was yet to do, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſo much means uſed to provoke you to jeanlouſie, and no fruit of it but hardneſs of heart, and a further cloſing in with the preſent evil by your continued practiſe. There were ſeveral <hi>Letters</hi> of our brother <hi>Sympſons</hi> preſented to us, <hi>Dated from Windſor Caſtle.</hi> when he was a priſoner there, it being judged that the Lord was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently preſent with him, as by the ſaid Letters will appear; Which Letters being read among us, the Lord was pleaſed ſo generally to melt out hearts in the ſenſe of that ſpirit of truth We judged then to be breathing in him; but his preſent frame of heart compared with what it was then, ſeeming to us as contrary as light to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: It was thereupon concluded as a duty incumbent upon us to appoint ſeveral brethren in the Name of the Whole, to take thoſe Letters, and in love and meekneſs to read them to our ſaid brother, to the end, that if the Lord ſo pleaſe he might thereby conſider <hi>from whence he is fallen, and do his firſt works,</hi> hoping alſo that he might thereby be brought to conſider whether he had not miſſed of the Will of God in endeavouring not onely to excuſe, but (as We judge) to countenance our brethren the Souldiers in their evil Way. But oh! that which We deſire to mention with grief and ſorrow of heart, inſtead of receiving us in love, as We came unto him, and giving us leave to open our hearts before him, he abſolutely refuſed not onely to pray with thoſe brethren ſent by us, but alſo to entertain them in our Name as brethren, or to admit any conference with them upon that account, in regard <hi>that we were by him admoniſhed in the Name of the Church of our evil in making a rent and diviſion,</hi> as he ſaid. <hi>And ſince that</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>they had waited upon us to ſee if we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and repent; but we not returing, they looked upon us as Heathens and Publicant, and that he did ſo look upon us alſo. And for the letters they were directed to the Church,</hi> (meaning your ſelves without us) <hi>and that if they had any thing to queſtion him about'them, he would make anſwer
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63520:23"/>unto them.</hi> Vnto which this Anſwer in general was made, <q>That We humbly thought he ſpake an untruth, in that We could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber there was ever any ſuch Admonition given us as yet, much leſs had We any account that We vvere eſteemed no other then <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Publicans.</hi>
                           </q> After the Brethren (ſent by us to him) depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, being much grieved that our love ſhould be ſo returned upon us, (but ſo it was, the Lord lay it not to his charge if it be his Will) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on further ſeeking to the Lord what was our next Work, it was thought meet, That as We had been a long time waiting upon you by patience and much long-ſuffering, as We judge, (our Weakneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) having laid the ſin of our Brethren before you by our ſelves, and of your own evil in abetting them; (ſome more, and ſome leſs) but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of returning from your evil, you have fallen in with it more directly in</p>

                           <label>o</label> It ſeems they were not contented with their firſt vote in declaring communion with the Souldiers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their evil, though at our firſt coming off, they diſowned that by ſaying, <hi>That they did onely declare a continuance of communion with them as Souldiers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect to the evil laid no their charge.</hi> But by revote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communion with them, they have plainly declared the evil laid to their charge to be no evil; and ſo have directly juſtified them therein. And that their evil who approve of, and uphold the preſent Apoſtasy, may more plainly appear, ſee the following Scriptures, <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.3. to 7. <hi>The Daughter of Zelophead</hi> to cleare their title to a portion of Land they claimed in right of their deceaſed father in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That he <hi>dyed in the wilderneſſe in his own ſin, and was not in the company of Korah</hi> (and thoſe with him) <hi>who gathered themſelves together againſt the Lord;</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if he had been among them, and ſtanding on their ſide when they oppoſed <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron, &amp;c.</hi> who were going to poſſeſſe the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (a type of the work of our day) was greater then any other of his ſins, and that which, would have cut him and them off from ſuch a portion of Land as was allotted to thoſe who followed the Lord to his foot in the work of that day: And is not the Souldiers Sin the ſame?</p>
                        <p>revoting communion with them; ſo that your practice is no leſs to us then adding ſin to ſin: And particularly our brother <hi>Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zey,</hi> who confeſſed more, as having a hand in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at its firſt riſe, then We could prove, though at firſt he denyed it: Likewiſe, That he had ſummoned ſome perſons to ſhew cauſe why they would not pay tythes, from whence did follow further trouble to thoſe perſons by his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo far as they were taken into cuſtody, til they had made their compoſition.

Likewiſe to this further end, That none of our brethren and ſiſters may plead ignorance of the end of our coming at that time, having ground to fear that many are, whoſe conditions We deſire to tender as our own ſouls, were We in their eſtate. But it may be objected, <hi>That we might have had liberty to have ſpoken what was upon our hearts when we were laſt with you, had thoſe friends, which came with us departed according to your deſire.</hi> To which We anſwer, <q>That our coming there at that time was in obedience to a command of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to wit, That when a Brother or Brethren will not hear, ſo as to return from his, or their evil, being privately admoniſhed, We are then to take other Brethren with us as VVitneſſes to vvhat we ſhould ſay, ſo that had we given way to ſuch a motion, we muſt have made void that Ordinance of Chriſt; moreover we our ſelves had been with you ſeveral times by our ſelves, as is already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, beſides the ſins laid before you are publike, and not private ſins, and <hi>therefore needed not ſo much ſecreſie.</hi>
                           </q> Thus deſiring you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Admonition in love, being done (we hope) for Chriſts ſake, and in tender regard to your ſouls: VVe ſubſcribe our ſelves</p>

            <p>AFter the delivery of the ſaid Admonition in writing, we continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waiting upon the Lord to ſee what good would be wrought up on their hearts thereby, but inſtead thereof in ſome ſhort time after they ſend unto the ſeveral Churches in the City without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conſent (as they did when we ſent in our firſt Paper) to the end they might ſend choſen men from amongſt them to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63520:24"/>the matter in difference between us, which we did a little won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, hoping rather, the ſenſe of their evil laid before them might have provoked them to a godly jealouſie; but ſo it was, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> with <hi>chief men amongſt the Brethren in the Churches,</hi> were ſent according to their requeſt the 26 of the 11th. Month, 1656. But before we give an account of what paſſed that day, we ſhall crave leave to hint thus much, That after our knowledge of their intention to ſend to the Churches as aforeſaid, and before the day of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboveſaid, not knowing under what tryal we might come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, we ſet our ſelves to ſeek the Lord by faſting and prayer, to know what might be our duty therein; and as the reſult of our waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him came to this concluſion, That it would be moſt for the glory of God to chooſe out ſeveral brethren from amongſt us to give in our Reaſons unto the Paſtors and Elders of the Churches, (when they were met with the other part of the Congregation) why we could not admit they ſhould hear the matter in difference between us. And accordingly five Reaſons were draw up, and committed to fix brethren to deliver in writing, or by word of mouth, as they ſhould ſee cauſe. The Reaſons ſhould be here inſerted, but becauſe they will be moſt proper for peruſal when given in to the Paſtors and Elders at their meeting, we ſhall refer the Reader thereunto, pag 38. and ſo proceed to give an account of that dayes meeting. When the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Elders, &amp;c.</hi> of the Churches were met, the ſix brethren choſen by us, according to appointment were there preſent, &amp; when they came firſt into <hi>London-Houſe,</hi> (the place of their meeting) they found Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> in prayer, and after he had ended prayer, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to give a Narrative of what had paſſed between us and them to that day; but with how much partiallity in many things, and in ſome things direct</p>
            <p n="p" rend="small indent"><!-- ROLE="note" -->
               <label>p</label> 
               <hi>Mr. Sympſon</hi> aſſerted theſe three things in his Narrative; firſt, <hi>That he admoniſhed us in the Name of the Congregation.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That we had nothing againſt our Brethren the ſouldiers but meerly their places in the Army.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>That we went from Houſe to Houſe to get away numbers from them.</hi> How far the two firſt are untrue, we think the Reader by what hath been already laid down, may be able to judge. For the third we can clearly acquit our ſelves, having been ſo far from any ſuch practice, that thoſe of us whoſe wives are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Congregation, have not been provoked by us, but have wholly left them to be guided by the Lord therein.</p>
            <p>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths the brethren then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by our appointment can teſtifie. After he had ended his Narrative, Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> (chief ſpeaker of the Paſtors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſtood up, and ſpake to this purpoſe to Mr. <hi>Sympſon, That he had given in a large Narrative of the matter in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which containing many things, would require ſome time to be ſearching, into; but before
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63520:24"/>any entrance be made thereupon, he deſired to know whether any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part gone off from them, were there; if they were, he did deſire to hear ſomthing from them in this caſe, &amp; did hope that the Pastors &amp; Elders there preſent would be very careful how they did</hi>
               <note n="⋆" place="margin">It being as he ſaid, <hi>ſo great a caſe of,</hi> Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; And which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſo to us.</note> 
               <hi>intermiddle therewith, for if what he had heard herein were true, it was a marvellous good ſeparation, &amp; upon good grounds,</hi> or to this effect. After this a Brother of ours ſtood up, and ſpake to this purpoſe; <q>That after ſolemn waiting upon the Lord, ſeveral Brethren in the Name of the Whole withdrawn from that part of the Congregation, were there preſent, being choſen to preſent unto them in love and humility, the Reaſons why We could not admit of their hearing the matter in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; but before that, they deſired the liberty of three Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons if it might be granted; and then the Brother which ſpake kept ſilence to hear their Anſwer.</q> Upon which Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> ſtood up again, and ſaid, <hi>It was but reaſonable that we ſhould have our liberty.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Brother which began, ſtood up, and proceeded with the following queſtions, two to the Brethren and Siſters from whom We were withdrawn, and one to the Paſtors and Elders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 1. Whether they did look upon us as part of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. To which Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> made anſwer, <hi>That ſure we were; for he knew not when we were dealt with, to the beſt of his remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 2. We humbly propoſe to the Paſtors. Elders, and Brethren of the Churches now preſent, Whether they were all of them ſent and choſen by their reſpective Congregations.</p>
            <p>Here there was a great ſilence, but afterwards ſeveral of them ſpake, ſome ſaying, <hi>That they were choſen by their reſpective Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> others, <hi>That they were ſent unto as particular perſons;</hi> Whereby it was plain there was a diſorder in their choice, which was in love ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether the <hi>Paſtors, Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> of the reſpective Congregations then preſent, were invited and ſent unto in the name of the whole Church?</p>
            <p>Here ſeveral of them were at a ſtand, not knowning well what to ſay; but they generally gave in at the laſt, <hi>That they were ſent unto in the Name of the Church;</hi> Which was not ſo, for that themſelves in anſwer to our firſt queſtion acknowledge us to be a part, and what was done in ſending for them, was without our knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>After this one of our Brethren ſtood up, and deſired liberty to give their Reaſons in our Name, Why they could not condiſcend to the hearing the matter in difference by the Paſtors, Elders, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63520:25"/>of ſeveral Congregations then preſent; Which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. We conceive it to be contrary to the practice of the Churches of Chriſt in the New-Teſtament, that brethren of other Churches (though choſen by conſent of their reſpective Congregations, ſhould hear a Church-controverſie without the conſent of both parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom the difference is; ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3. the whole Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> as well thoſe that were againſt it, as thoſe that were for it.
<p>Upon this Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> ſtood up, and did acknowledge that <hi>there was a plain diſorder and miſcarriage in their choice every way; but deſired to know whether notwithſtanding ſuch miſcarriages, the Brethren in our Name had power to enter: upon the debate.</hi> To which one of the brethren ſpake to this purpoſe, <hi>'That they had ſeveral Reaſons more to urge, and then they ſhould make further anſwer.</hi> And liberty being granted, the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who began proceeded to the next reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
               </item>
               <item>2. That it ſeems contrary to Morality, much more of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for members of other Churches to enter into the debate of a Church-difference, when that part of the Congregation with whom the difference was, did not chooſe any of them; neither had they knowledge of the matter till the other part reſolved upon it, and had ſent their meſſengers to invite them thereunto.
<p>To this Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> ſtood up and ſaid, That <hi>it was indeed contrary to the principles of Morality,</hi> and then was ſilent, whereupon the brother proceeded to the third Reaſon.</p>
               </item>
               <item>3. That We ſhould betray the cauſe our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to give it up unto the Judgement of the Paſtors, Elders, and Brethren then preſent; Firſt, In regard they came not with our conſent. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, For that againſt ſome of whom We might have juſt grounds of exceptions if it were meet to ſpeak of it at this time.</item>
               <item>4. It ſeems to us prepoſterous to enter upon ſuch a Work till We had the reſult of the whole Congregation about the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or of that part at leaſt from whom We are withdrawn, which We have not had, though We often intreated, and ſent to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</item>
               <item>5. The foregoing Reaſons being true, we humbly conceive that if a debate of the matter in difference ſhould at this time be admitted, we ſhould walk out of Gods way, and ſo not obtain the promiſed<note n="[q]" place="margin">Iſa. 64.5.</note> bleſſing in matters of that nature.</item>

            <p>Theſe Reaſons were no ſooner given in, but the Paſtors, Elders, and Brethren of the ſeveral Churches there met together, roſe up ſuddenly, to goe away; which Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> obſerving, he asked them before they were gone, <hi>Whether they would give them no advice in the preſent buſineſs:</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> made anſwer, That they were not in a capacity, as things ſtood, to give any advice. To which Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>What? no advice!</hi> VVhereupon Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> replyed, That the leaſt they could do was to make a tender unto us whether we would joyn with them in ſending to the Churches; and this was all the advice they could give; and ſo they departed; and preſently after thoſe brethren ſent by us came away alſo; but as they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of the other part that ſate in the ſpeaking-place, asked the brethren ſent by us, <hi>whether they would embrace the advice given?</hi> To which anſwer was made, That they were no more then ſix brethren intruſted by us to give in our diſlike of what they had done, but were not impowred to meddle w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> any thing elſe; but if they had any thing to offer, they knew our time and place of meeting, when, and where the whole being preſent, they might if they pleaſed tender any thing they thought meet, &amp; ſo thoſe brethren came away. But the ſame day in the Afternoon being our time of meeting to edefie, and <hi>build up one another in our moſt holy faith,</hi> two brethren came to us from them with the ſame Meſſage, which was received in love, and this onely given in anſwer, That we ſhould conſider of it, and return an anſwer ſo ſoon as conveniently we could. And accordingly either the ſame day, on the next firſt day following we concluded upon a day to ſpread their Meſſage before the Lord, which when done, we ſent them a return within a fortnight after by meſſengers of our own; the anſwer to their meſſage ſhould be here inſerted; but being contain'd in our next Paper, we ſhall here omit it. Now the Reaſon why our Anſwer was given in writing was, for that thoſe our brethren who declared the ſame verbally, brought return unto us, That they deſired it ſhould be ſo, pretending that they did not underſtand it, or rather (as we may ſay) it not ſuting with their deſire, they would not underſtand it; but however upon this report unto us by thoſe brethren who were ſent in our Name, ſome from amongſt us were appointed to draw it up in VVriting, and preſent it to the whole for their approbation, which vvas accordingly done; but the ſame day it ſhould have been brought in to us, vve received another meſſage from the other part of the Congregation, vvhich ſhould be here inſerted; but it being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo contained in our next Paper, vvith our Anſvver thereunto, vve ſhall purpoſely omit it, and refer the READER to the ſame.</p>

                        <p>UNderſtanding by the brethren who were ſent in our Name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, to give a return unto your laſt Meſsage, that our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was very ill reſented; and becauſe it was not in full compliance with and according to your expectation, they were not ſuffered to ſpeak out what was upon their hearts, without much interruption by ſome amongſt you, as it hath been cuſtomary for the moſt part ſince our withdrawing from you, which We cannot but look upon as arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary amongſt men, much more unſavoury among Saints, though you ſeldom received ſuch unkindneſs from us, as we can remember; and not onely ſo, but We our ſelves are looked upon as ſuch who act in hypocriſie which We hope the Lord hath; &amp; will preſeve us from, for ſuch ſhall be ſure to finde the weight of his indignation at this day, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 33.14.</p>
                        <p>The conſideration whereof, together with that invitation We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from ſome amongſt you, not oppoſed by any, hath engaged us to ſend the ſame in Writing, that ſo there might be no miſtakes or ſtill interpretations of what was then ſpoken, or advantage taken through our weakneſs to blemiſh ſo bleſsed a Cauſe; and we truſt, that upon looking back into our own hearts, there is found a root of uprightneſs in the management thereof, and that it is not wilfully in our hearts to ſpeak or act hypocritically, whatever ſome amongſt you do ſays or apprehend. But before we come to the Anſwer it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chief drift and ſcope of theſe lines, we humbly apprehend it neceſsary to lay before you the ſeveral Reaſons laſt given in, when without our conſent deſired, you were pleaſed in the Name of the Church to ſend for ſeveral brethren to determine and udge of the matter in difference between us.</p>

                           <label>r</label> The Readen may remember that in pag. 22. ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Brethren of other Churches were ſent for by them to hear the matter in difference, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſed till our firſt Paper given in, was debated in the Church; likewiſe the other time mentioned in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which are the two diſappointments ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p>two diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments you had received, and in a due fence thereof, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into his mind and will; but inſtead thereof at the ſame time, without ſo much as the leaſtly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing low before his face the ſame, did forth with ſend your Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto us, to know <hi>whether we would join with you in ſending to the ſeveral Churches for hearing of the matter in difference,</hi> Who were ſome what preſſing upon us to have a preſent return one way or other which We durſt not adventure upon for two Reaſons; Firſt, in reſpect of our own weakneſs and inſufficiency, being poor fooliſh creatures. Secondly, In reſpect of the weight of ſuch a Work, not being to be done without ſolemn ſeeking to the Lord, that being the Way he hath appointed to lead, adviſe, and inſtruct his people about any bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs they are dark in; and accordingly We did ſend Anſwer by your Meſſengers to that effect. The next firſt day being a full meeting of the Congregation withdrawn from you, We did ſpread your deſire before the Lord, and ſought of him a right Way, how far We might comply with you therein; and in the cloſe of the day after much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe courſe about it, judging likewiſe that We had the Mind and Will of God, came to this reſult, That before We could give a direct anſwer to you deſire, that you would be pleaſed to give us your poſitive judgement, Whether thoſe Brethren of the Army were guilty of thoſe ſins laid to their charge by us, or no; which We have often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, intreated, and ſent to you about, but could not obtain it to this day, as is expreſſed in our fourth Reaſon before mentioned, to which We then received this return, <hi>That you were not in a capacity to anſwer us therein, becauſe you were divided into three parts, ſome judging they were under thoſe ſins; others, that they were not; and a third party could not tell whether they were, or not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Anſwer thus returned, with ſome other circumſtances not conſiderable here, to be inſerted, We did ſpread it before the Lord, together with your former deſire, and in the end came to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, That We were wholly diſ-ſatisfied with your Anſwer to our laſt requeſt, apprehending it ſomewhat ſtrange that you ſhould be unanimous in revoting communion with them after ſo plain proof of their ſin laid to their charge, eſpecially ſome of them, and yet
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63520:27"/>not be united in your judgments whether they were under thoſe ſins or not: And though We might hereupon wave any return to your deſire, till We had your plain anſwer thereunto, yet leaſt it ſhould be judged that We were unwilling, or fearful the <hi>Cauſe of Chriſt</hi> We are engaged in, ſhould have the hearing amongſt other brethren, We did thereupon for the Name and Honour of God, and clearing up our integrity herein, and for the further manifeſtation of truth, with a due ſaving to thoſe<note n="[s]" place="margin">Thoſe two Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our firſt &amp; ſecond paper delivered in unto them</note> two <hi>Admonitions,</hi> already given, conclude, That We were, and are very willing, and ſhall rejoice therein for Truths ſake, to comply with your deſire with this limitation, That We might according to our Chriſtian liberty in this extraordinary caſe, chooſe on our part faithful Brethren, many of which had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded their lives for the Name and Cauſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſo openly betrayed at this day, againſt whom We truſt there ſhall be no juſt grounds of exceptions as to their lives and converſations; and you may proceed to ſend unto the Churches on your part, as you ſhall think meet: Now leaſt the objection you made when the Brethren were laſt with you by our appointment, to wit, That <hi>by this Anſwer we do wave that our ſleves which we have preſſed upon you, about ſending to the neighbouring Congregations, when we were not willing to join therein;</hi> Which we do plainly deny; for we never moved it unto you, much leſs preſſed it upon you; but your proceeding herein hath been your ovvn voluntary act without us, though indeed we excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your practice as it was by yourſelves without our conſent, therewith alſo apprehending your preſent eſtate to be no leſs then the plain fruit of open backſliding from the <hi>Cauſe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> though we deſire to mention it with fear and trembling and due reſpect unto ſome amongſt you, as not ſo guilty herein as others are; likewiſe we have ground to fear, that moſt of the Churches of Chriſt in this <hi>City</hi> are more or leſs tainted with the ſore <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of this day; not that we delight in ſuch reflections, but deſire to ſpeak it with <hi>humility, grief,</hi> and <hi>ſorrow of heart,</hi> and ſhould be glad there vvere no juſt ground for ſuch a jealouſie. This pre-conſidered, it ſeems more obliging unto you to follow that practice, then unto us at this time, and may excuſe the formality of the practice on our pare, and the rather, when you proceeded in ſuch a VVork not onely without the conſent, but without ſo much as a tender thereof unto your brethren and ſiſters, joyntly concerned therein, until this laſt time, which was not ſo much of your ſelves, as ſeemingly neceſſitated thereunto by thoſe Brethren of other Churches, who refuſed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you in, or hear any thing of the matter in difference till at leaſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63520:27"/>you had asked our conſent and approbation thereof; and therein you may pleaſe to remember the ſtreſs of their, refuſal did lye to heare ought you had to ſay; and if ſo, we humbly apprehend it will take off that ſcandal of <hi>hypocriſie and changedneſs of mind,</hi> laid to our charge by ſome amongſt you. Thus having given you a brief account of our laſt Meſſage, together with what hath paſsed between us and you ſince our laſt Paper was given in, having therein unfeignedly, and in all plainneſs opened our hearts unto you, we ſhall not add more, onely deſiring, That in caſe you do not think meet to receive our tender herein, but proceed as formerly yon have done that then you will favour us ſo far (or rather the Truth) as to let this Paper be read unto the Brethren you ſhall ſend for before any proceeding be, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the other two in their order, as your intention was the laſt time the Meſſengers of other Churches were with you.</p>
                        <p>Intending here to conclude, not having ought conſiderable to add, ſome of our Brethren inform us of a Meſſage received from you the laſt ſixth day was a ſeven night, to be communicated to us in words to this purpoſe, <hi>That you did think meet to offer unto us, that there might be a day of ſolemn faſting and prayer unto the Lord, wherein you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire our conjunction, the chief end of the duty being upon theſe three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts; Firſt, That both you and we might be deepely humbled before the Lord, and be made ſenſible of all our evils and miſcaerriages, eſpecially as they do relate to the preſent difference between you and us. Secondly, To enquire of the Lord a right way, what you and we ought to do for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Thirdly, That if there were any other thing we: bought neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be put in, we had our freedom to add thereto.</hi> The conſideration whereof hath put us upon a further enlargement in writing by way of anſwer, and to which we deſire to give this humble Reply, That as to the VVork of humiliation it ſelf, and a day to be appointed in order thereunto, we do fully approve of, as being not onely a Goſpel Ordinance, but alſo incumbent on the Lords People in this day of ſore affliction, and time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Trouble, not onely as it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to our miſcarriages &amp; evils committed ſince our firſt withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein we deſire to acknowledge before the Lord and you, that herein we have ground ſufficient to lie low before him, and cover our Faces with ſhame in the ſence thereof, ſo far as it may not eclipſe the riches of Grace in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo in reſpect of the crying evils, through the backſliding of profeſſors under ſo great light, which we fear doth fore-run ſome ſore judgement upon this Nation in general, and upon profeſſors in particular; but how to join with you as the caſe now ſtands between us, we can ſee no Scripture-bottom,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63520:28"/>or rational ground for the ſame, it being pre-ſuppoſed, firſt; That you have amongſt you thoſe that are guilty of groſs and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſins, upon which account. We are withdrawn from you: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that you have not onely voted communion with ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, notwithſtanding their ſins, but by a ſecond Vote, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practice, juſtifie them in their evil; and ſo many of you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greatly partakers with them of their evil deeds, and the reſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, though leſs guilty. Thirdly, That you have ſo far own'd and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of them, as to forget their evil, and charge us your poor bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſiſters with making a rent and diviſion for doing our duty, when they indeed are the perſons from whom the offence firſt came, and ſome chief among you as greatly guilty as they, by pleading for, and excuſing of them, and ſo properly to be charged with making a rent and diviſion in the Church. Fourthly, You have endeavoured to carry it on againſt us, ſo as to take upon you the power of the Church without us, and thereby would have proceeded to admoniſh us ſon making air out (as you ſay) in the Church, had not the Lord wonderfully fruſtrated you in all your endeavours that Way, though We ſhould have rejoiced therein, being comfortably ſatisfied that it would have been for his Nameſake, becauſe We are contending for truth againſt the great iniquity among you, and ſo the perſons offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with their Abettors, (though the greater number) to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, and withdrawn from by the leſſer, which if true, then the power of the Church reſides in the Leſſer number; and this in effect is no more then according to the<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> practice of all the Congregational Churches in their withdrawing from the Parochial Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                        <p>Dear Brethren and Siſters, theſe things are plain and true, and therefore bear with us, for We have yet longings of heart after you, and deſire to mourn and grieve for you, that if it were the Will of our heavenly Father you might be recovered out of the Snare, and do truſt many of you will; but in caſe We ſhould join with you before the leaſt acknowledgement of your evil, <hi>ſhould not we return to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you return unto the Lord?</hi> and ſo come under the reproof of that. Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.17. and that alſo in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 17, 18. Yea, Would it not rather be a grieving of the Spirit, and making light of ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Ordinance as Prayer is? Have We not ſome ſad experience hereof already, in that dya of Prayer kept with you when our firſt Paper was to be debated? What contrariety of ſpirits did then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poar? Were We not in the duty deeply judged and cenſured by one of the chief amongſt you, when We came to lay the matter in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63520:28"/>before the Lord? If ſo little confort then, ſure leſs now; <hi>Can two pray together except they be agreed?</hi> We do therefore humbly apprehend before any ſuch conjuction be, that you will firſt inquire into the great evil amongſt you, and <hi>not to eat with ſuch perſons,</hi> but in brotherly love to <hi>admoniſh</hi> them, and then to waite and ſee whether the Lord will humble them in the ſence thereof; if this were done, We know that the conſequence on your part would be to lye low before the Lord for complying with them to this day; and when you ſhall minifeſt repentance by ſuch a Work, then We ſhould have joy and confort in joyning with you, to be further humbled before the Lord, and alſo to lie at the Lords and your feet, as to any other thing you ſhould deſire of us for his Name ſake; for We hope it is not in our hearts to be <hi>lifted up above our Brethren,</hi> but onely to be faithful unto the Lord in a day of ſo great Apoſtacy.</p>
                        <p>Now as to the ſecond thing, about <hi>ſeeking to the Lord for a right way what you and we ought to do for the healing of the breach between us;</hi> This ſeems to turn the goodneſs of the Lord upon himſelf, and to forget his loving kindneſs, yea, to deny that We have been in a right Way, after ſo much ſeeking unto, and waiting upon him for direction and counſel from time to time; yea, give us leave to ſay, That we humbly judge the Lord hath led us in a right path to this day, and hath made <hi>darkneſs light, &amp; crooked things straight</hi> before, as well as ſince our firſt withdrawing. Moreover, wholly to queſtion the ground of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to this day, would be alſo of great reproach and diſhonour to the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Cauſe</hi> of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and pre-declare to any diſcerning eye, that We are returned from whence We vvere withdrawn, upon no ſolid ſubſtantial grounds.</p>
                        <p>To the third, namely, <hi>That if there were any other thing neceſſary to be added, we might have our freedom.</hi> This we conceive needs little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, reſpect being had in our anſwer to the two former propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus deſiring a tender conſtruction (if it may be) of what is here laid down, as to your laſt Meſſage, and chiefly to eye the firſt part, as it relates to the choice of perſons for clearing of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between us, We remain.</p>

            <p>AFter the delivery of this Paper; We continued waiting upon the Lord as formerly, expecting a return, as to the contents of the firſt part thereof, relating to the choice of perſons by us and them to hear the matter in difference, which many of us did the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire, not onely for the further manifeſtation of truth, but alſo to take off that ſcandal laid by them upon us, <hi>That we were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges of our own cauſe, and would not admit of the hearing of it by others;</hi> but three months time expiring ſince the delivery of our ſaid Paper, or thereabouts, and no return given unto us one Way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſeemed to many of us that their ſilence was a flat denyal to our render to the firſt part of our ſaid Paper, which put us upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry into our duty; and to that end a day was ſet apart to ſeek the Lord for advice and counſl, and the greateſt part whereof being ſpend upon that account, we then came to enquire of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what the Lord had ſet upon our hearts as our further duty; and after ſome diſcourſe about it, came to this reſult, <hi>That having made ſo many tenders unto thoſe from whom we were withdrawn with ſo little effect, we had hopes to obtain our reaſonable deſire from them, and therefore judged it our duty to proceed to the work of ſeparation.</hi> And accordingly ſome Brethren were choſen out from amongſt us, to make a draught thereof as the Lord ſhould direct them, and yet hereby not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any Meſſage that might come in the mean time from the other part, neither to be too ſudden about it, ſo that it was about five or ſix Weeks before the draught of ſeparation was brought in; but after it was preſented and agreed upon, it was queſtioned by ſome whether it ſhould yet be given in for ſome reaſons urged by them, unto which it was anſwered by others, <hi>That they conceived the Lord would be much glorified in the delivering of it in as the unanimous conſent of the whole.</hi> But ſome again ſtood up and ſaid, <hi>That they conceived this would moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God at preſent, (to wit) that we ſhould revive the tender make in our foregoing Paper, notwithſtanding their by their practiso to this day.</hi> But this was oppoſed again by others, judging <hi>that it would be little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, conſidering how we had been dealt withall from the firſt day of our withdrawing, until now; however it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                           <item>1. As being directly contrary to the end of our meſſage more at large contained in our laſt paper, not having therein exceeded our Goſpel-liberty.</item>
                           <item>2. It is altogether needleſſe to make choice of perſons to hear a matter in controverſie, and deny them liberty to ſpeak unto it, if they have any thing upon their hearts to ſay.</item>
                           <item>3. To bind us up not onely to Church-members, but alſo in a great meaſure to the Churches for their choice, when it is very plain that the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of this day hath reached to the generallity of the Churches, whereby there are few Zealous in the cauſe of Chriſt, though many faithful ones in other things, is to exalt the <hi>form</hi> above the <hi>power of Godlineſs.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>4. That it ſeemes to us directly contrary to the Principle of the Congregation, you ſo much pretend unto, which is, <hi>To receive Saints, as Saints, and not as bound up to this, or that form.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>5. To condeſcend hereunto, is to undervalue the Spirit of the Lord breathing in ſeverall of his ſervants, who are not enemies but friends to Church Communion, though not formal Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63520:31"/>by reaſon of the foulneſſe of the waters, of the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary at this day, and whom we deſire to eſteem far better then our ſelves.</item>
                           <item>6. As there is no command in joyning us to Churches alone in this Caſe, neither is there any againſt it, therefore we humbly conceive our Goſpel Liberty cannot be denied us. Moreover there is but one example in all the New Teſtament as we can remember which was in the Church at <hi>Autioch</hi> ſending to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem, Asts</hi> 15. About the matter of Circumciſion, neither was there any viſible <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> among the Churches at that day, as now is, elſe we conceive that the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> would not have ſent unto them about it.</item>

                           <label>⋆</label> Having before proved that there is an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, we now come to ſhew the riſe of it; and is as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, When the War was ended at <hi>Worce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> the Lords people ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that the good things the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed ſhould be brought forth. Alſo, the man in Power, and the Army appear'd in words to do ſo to; And do blame, and pretend <hi>they diſſolved the old Parliament,</hi> for not doing thoſe good things, and likewiſe to call the Little Parliament, as men <hi>fearing God,</hi> and Principled to bring them forth, as alſo to Act for the Advancement of Chriſts Kingdom. And go on to ſay, that <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was at the door,</hi> and that we were <hi>at the edge and threſhold of the Promiſes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and therefore ſhould lift up our hears and rejoyce, however, if there were neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for this nor propheſie, we ſhould covet, and endeavour after the beſt things,</hi> and do ſpeak as to purity, in <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and <hi>Governments;</hi> as if none but who had the Spirit were fit to Act upon Chriſts account at this day. And likewiſe hint, as if themſelves were a part, or at leaſt had the Spirit of the <hi>Stone,</hi> which ſhall <hi>break and conſume all other Kingdomes, &amp;c.</hi> And as if the <hi>Call</hi> of the Little Parliament was a fruit of the Stones ſmiting, (<hi>quoting Dan.</hi> 2.44.) With many other excellent good words relating to the Calling of <hi>the Jews,</hi> and the glory that will be in that day; See his ſpeech, to them, either by it ſelf, or in <hi>pag.</hi> 56. <hi>to</hi> 63. of book called the <hi>Looking-glaſs.</hi> Now what did this hold forth, but that they would endeavour to bring things as near as might be, before Chriſt comes, to what they ſhall be when he is come, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. But all this as we have too juſt ground to fear, and by what hath ſince appear'd, was but to cover the deſigne of ſelf Advancement. For when thoſe who were faithful in the Little Parliament, came to do thoſe good things, and to take away all Antichriſtian, and Oppreſſive Lawes, and Cuſtomes that were, and are yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining among us; Several ſelf intreſted men among them, and others eaſily led by them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that if they went on, it would go ill with be Lawyers, Clergy, and other Corrupt Intreſts, took Counſel together how they might diſſolve that Parliament and in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, came to the Parliament. Houſe in a morning two hours ſooner then uſually, and moved tho, reſigning their Power, But ſome of the other party coming in, oppoſing it, they durſt not venture to put it to the vote, but with the Speaker roſe up and went away, leaving a conſiderable number behinde them, who were ſoon after turn'd out by Collonel <hi>Goff,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Collonel <hi>White,</hi> and Muſquetteers, thereby putting a ſtop to the Work of God; and the aforementioned Perſons going to <hi>White-hall,</hi> and ſigning a Paper, whereby they pretended to reſign their Power to the Man who is now in Power; Is the foundation of this preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſo of the Apoſtaſie.</p>
                        <p>and Cuſtoms any ways intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Conſciences of the Lords people in their publike Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Secondly, To prevent making any ſuch Lawes for the time to come. Thirdly, To pull down all lawes in any meaſure op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the bodies of the Lords people, or any others, that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence may be no more heard in our Land. Fourthly to deliver the Spiritual Church of Chriſt from the like oppreſſion of Body, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in any of the Dominions of Antichriſt. Fifthly, To execute the Judgements written upon the great Whore who is drunk with the blood of the Saints. Sixthly, That Chriſt might be King in theſe Nations, and his Lawes our Rule to walk by. Seventhly, that Monarchy, or the power in one ſingle Perſon might be extirpated, becauſe oppoſing Chriſts Dominion, and utterly inconſiſtent with Common Freedome. Eighthly, That men fearing God, and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covetouſneſſe might be in Authority, and no other. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Treaſon be not comitted in all theſe reſpects at this day, and our Brethren therby become Traytors in abetting thereto with their ſwords in their hands, we ſhall leave unto the Lord who judgeth Righteouſly, and one day will make it known, when the thoughts of all men ſhall be revealed.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Oppreſſion of the Bodies and Conſciences of the Lords People,</hi> and others well affected in this Nation, by Tythes, Taxes, and Illegal Impriſonments.

                        <p>Sixthly, Hereby they are the cauſe, of ſadning, and grieving the hearts of the Righteous, <hi>whom the Lord would, not have ſadned,</hi> though our Brother <hi>Kelzey</hi> was, and herein is more particularly guilty above any of the reſt, as hath been plainly proved, which at firſt he denied, yet afterwards confeſt, at Brother <hi>Sampſons</hi> houſe, much more then could be proved againſt him, not with any
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63520:35"/>ſenſe of his evill therein, but ſaid, <hi>It was his Judgement and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to do what he had done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And, Notwithſtanding that many of us, had been labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Convince them, (and inform the Brethren, to whom the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling part of the Congregation was committed) of their evils up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a year and half, before our withdrawing, who at firſt joyned with us, and were more ready to be active herein, then our ſelves, yet afterwards declined for no other reaſon (as we know) but becauſe their ſin being of a publique nature, was like to receive more then an ordinary countenance, and ſo the more difficult and hazardous, if they, with us ſhould be found doing our duty impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, &amp; not fearing the faces of men, but it being to our labor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fruitleſſe, and thoſe who before were forward in the work of the Lord, now became backward and not onely ſo, but many of them excuſers, and Abettors, in a very great meaſure, to the grief of many of our hearts: However that we might keep in the Lords way, it was, after ſolemn waiting; upon him, judged our duty to bring their evils before the Church, that ſo if poſſible they might thereby have been brought to the acknowledgement thereof. And here we hoped that iniquity ſhold have bad it's mouth ſtopped, and truth have had the preheminence, in ſuch a Congregation as this had been, for ſo many years, being like a Beacon on the top of a Mountain, but inſtead thereof, the greater part votes Communion with them, notwithſtanding their evil laid before them; which is to be mention'd, not with joy, but with grief, and ſorrow of heart, though we conceive that vote was chiefly occaſioned by our Brother <hi>Sympſon,</hi> thorow his conſtant pleading for; and excuſing of them; and by his ſuddain ſtarting ſuch a queſtion, of Non-communion, without ſerious conſideration, whereby many <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Sisters</hi> were enſnared, as they afterwards confeſſed; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that truth had ſuch hard uſage from the beginning, almoſt to that time, yet we have ſince our withdrawing, been wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, almoſt one whole year and half, thereby bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more particular Teſtimony againſt their evil, alſo by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them twice, according to the rule of the Goſpel, but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (as we can diſcern) apprearing, but rather hardneſs of heart, and their ſin every day more and more manifeſting it ſelf, to the great diſhonour of God, and reproach of his Name. We do therefore hereby declare, That we can have no more fellowſhip and Communion with them, then with <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Publicans,</hi> till the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63520:35"/>Lord ſhall give repentance unto life, by acknowledging, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their iniquity, and do hereby humbly Teſtifie our ſeparation from the accordingly.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That our Brother <hi>Sympſon,</hi> whoſe condition we deſire to mourn for, yet can but humbly teſtifie, that he hath been for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moneths, a ſecret oppoſer of thoſe Brethren that proſecuted the <hi>cauſe of Christ,</hi> againſt the evils of thoſe Brethren of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: and every day more and more, did, and doth ſtand by, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and plead for them. Nay more, he is not afraid, nor aſhamed, to plead for thoſe very evils, which he himſelf hath declared againſt openly, and for which, he for ſometime ſuffered very boldly, ſo that we can do no leſs then declare, before the Lord, Angels, and men, that he is now become guilty with the other Apoſtates, <hi>to build again the things, which he and they formerly deſtroyed,</hi> and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very skilful, to cover the iniquity of this day, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all unbyaſt perſons, But leaſt any ſhould think that we had neglected our duty in not admoniſhing him privately, before this publique teſtimony againſt him; we anſwer, That ſeveral Brethren had been with him privately upon that account. Moreover, we did at another time by ſeveral Brethren in the name of the whole, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves unto him, intending particularly in love, and due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, to have opened our hearts concerning his evil, but in ſtead thereof, he abſolutely refuſed to give the leaſt entertainment unto us, as <hi>Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Siſters,</hi> or to hear any thing we ſhould ſay unto him, upon that account, but looked upon us, as <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,</hi> and thereupon refuſed ſo much as to pray with the Brethren who were ſent by us. Adding hereunto, that thorow his pleading for, and excuſing of them, he hath been the Inſtrumental Cauſe of this breach, and ſeparation, and hardning the hearts of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when ſome of them, were in ſome meaſure convinced of their evil, (as we thought) ſaying, <hi>That if it were a ſin to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, let it be charged upon himſelf, and ſuch as were ſatisfied with them, as they ſhould anſwer it, at the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> For which, and much more, (if needful at this time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.) We can have no more fellowſhip with him, nor ſcarce ſo much, as with thoſe Brethren among you, that wear the ſword, whoſe wickedneſs we have been ſo long contending againſt, onely leaving him unto the Lord, who can when he pleaſeth, convince him of his evil, and give him grace to do his firſt works.</p>
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:63520:36"/>
                        <p>Thirdly, That ſeveral other Brethren whom we could Name if need require, have likewiſe much abetted, excuſed, and pleaded for this iniquity, and particularly one of them, who was formerly ſo convinced, of the Soldiers evil, as being the firſt perſon, that put pen to paper, to draw up Articles againſt them, who ſaid, <hi>It was true but he thought it would not come to this.</hi> And therefore we do judge it our duty, alſo humbly to Teſtifie againſt them, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from them, as ſuch, who are greatly partakers of the Souldiers evil, though it is poſſible, that they may be much overſway'd in ther judgements by our Brother <hi>Sympſon,</hi> and cannot have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them till ſuch time that the Lord doth convince them of their evil, and cauſe them to return from whence they are <hi>fallen, and do their firſt works.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, That many other Brethren, and Siſters, though they have little to plead for the Souldiers, as under thoſe ſins laid to their charge, yet care not for inquiring into truth, neither conſidering that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Know ye not that a little leaven, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth the whole lump, purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may become a new lump:</hi> But are willing to have their judgements byaſſed, thorow affection to our Brother <hi>Sympſon,</hi> and ſo are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to ſtand, or fall in his bottom, as we have juſt ground to fear, and thereby become partakers of their evill deeds; and if the Lord do not in time graciouſly awaken them out of this drowſie, ſleepy frame of Spirit, we fear they may in time feel the ſorrow of that Scripture, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.16. <hi>For the Leaders of this people cauſe them to erre, and they that are led of them, are deſtroyed.</hi> And therefore hereby teſtifie, and declare, that we cannot hold Communion with them, till the Lord ſhall diſcover unto them their evil therein.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, As for thoſe <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters</hi> amongſt you, that groan, and mourn under the ſenſe of thoſe crying abominations, that our Brethren the Souldiers with their Abettors, are guilty of, we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to open our hearts to them with all bowels of tenderneſs, and compaſſion, declaring that although we can ſee no Scripture ground, or bottom for their preſent practiſe, and the rather when the Lord hath enabled their poor unworthy Brethren and Siſters, though but a remnant, to withdraw, and ſeparate from the evil doers, whereby the deciſſion is made; And that Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.4, 5.6. Seems unto us a plain word of Inſtruction for them in theſe words: <hi>I have not ſate with vain perſons, neither will I go in with diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers.

And how they can call that part of the Body a Church, when thoſe they joyn with, are onely the diſorderly walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; for thoſe who bear the Teſtimony, are withdrawn, we do not well underſtand: which is the more conſiderable, when they are commanded to <hi>withdraw from every Brother that walks diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> However, we judge it our duty to continue our prayers for them, and to ſpread their condition before the Lord in ſecret, as if it were out own; that he would enlighten, and inform them in their duty, and give them obedient hearts thereunto, that the Lord would deliver their feet out of the ſnare, and do hereby <hi>intreat, exhort, and deſire</hi> them, as they tender the glory of God, and the comfort of their own Souls in the time of Tryal, and Temptation, to come out from amongſt them, and ſeparate from them, truſting that the promiſe of grace, mentioned 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, 18.

                        <hi>Many of us have had no ſmall Wreſtling in our own Spirits, whether theſe Letters of Mr.</hi> Sympſons <hi>ſhould be publiſhed or no, chuſing rather to have ſilently Mourned over him, in the ſenſe of the loſs of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he ſeemed to be anointed with, whiles he Continued in</hi> Windſor Caſtle, <hi>as by his following Letters dated from thence will appear; But conſidering what a Noble, and Honourable Teſtimony he hath born againſt the iniquity of this day, and that from the Spirit of God, (as he profeſt) and ſince that to be as highly profeſſing on the other hand, ſaying,</hi> That it was his errour, and evil, drying down all his former profeſſions, &amp; viſions, as deluſions, and of fleſh. <hi>Which hath ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerd ſome, as to the very Principles of Godlineſs; Likewiſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how he is fallen in with the preſent</hi> Abominations he hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo witneſſed againſt. <hi>Adding hereunto, that he hath been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental cauſe, of our Breach, and Separation, by falling in with, and pleading for the Souldiers, and preſent Power; Which had he not done, for ought as we know, they might have turned from their evil

Some of them of underſtanding ſhall fall, to try them, &amp;c. <hi>And we ſhould much rejoyce if the Lord ſhould make this way, in any meaſure Inſtrumental, to eat out that core of Apostacy, which more gentle meanes though applied would not do, or deliver the feet of any out of the ſnare, who by reaſon of him, are</hi> fallen from their own ſtedfaſtneſs; <hi>however this is our rejoycing,</hi> the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, <hi>we have been exerciſed herein, and not out of malice, ſtrife, or vain glory.</hi>

Looking-glaſs. p. 62.</note> door, I ſhall receive him more gloriouſly then yet I have received him; for the preſent the word of the Lord is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, there is no open viſſion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.4. God calleth to us, as he did unto <hi>Samuel</hi> but we know not infallibly, and in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Spirit, who it is that ſpeaketh, unleſs it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Salvations, but he will ſpeak, and we ſhall know that it is he that ſpeaketh in us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.6. <hi>He hath ſpoken unto us, in as it were parables, but he is ſhewing us plainly of the Father,</hi> John 16.25. <hi>The Spirit will ſhew us things to come,</hi> John 16.13. I am perſwaded particularly concerning my ſelf that I ſhall receive ſome gifts of the Spirit, which I have not yet received. If you ſhall deſire to know the grounds of this perſwaſion, I ſhall lay them down, I am not afraid that they ſhould be tried Firſt, I have a Spirit in this thing to teach me ſelf denial, I do plainly ſee that no ſtrength, or endeavors of my own, will do any thing, I muſt be dead unto them; a faith of my own working will not remove a molehill, power muſt be given in by Jeſus Chriſt, for the gloryfying of his Name, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.7. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I do expect Spiritual gifts, by the Goſpel, and not by the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. Though I have been a vile <hi>Creature,</hi> yet the <hi>Lord Jeſus Aſcended, that he might give gifts to the Rebellious.</hi> Thirdly, the grace of God will ſhine more gloriouſly in giving gifts unto me by ſo much as I have been vilder, then other Saints, before, and ſince my Converſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.20. Fourthly, I have faith according to the Scriptures, that the word of the Lord will come unto<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> ſome Saints, to inform them concerning the work of their Generation, as it did unto <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Agabus,</hi> and others, <hi>Becauſe God will do nothing, but he will reveal it unto his Servants the Prophets, Amos</hi> 3.6. Fifthly, Many Saints do pray that God would fill me with his Spirit, and do believe that God will hear their prayers, for me, and I do not doubt, but it ſhall be unto me according to my Faith. Sixthly, I am commanded to <hi>Covet earneſtly the best</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63520:42"/>gifts, which by grace I do, and ſhall do by the help of your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. Seventhly, I am humbled for anything of fleſh which might move me to deſire the Spirit, and I deſire gifts in the Spirit upon this Account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>That the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> Eightly, I look upon Chriſt as powerful, ſo that he is able, as gracious, ſo that he is willing, as true, ſo that he will be faithful in making good that promiſe, <hi>John</hi> 14.13, 14. Which I have by grace applied in this particular caſe; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my Name that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son, If ye ſhall ask any thing in my name I will do it, Chriſt cannot be unfaithful, John</hi> 14.15.16. Ninthly, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, I believe therefore have I ſpoken ſaith the Pſalmiſt, Pſal.</hi> 116.10. So ſay I, I do believe, therefore have I written theſe things unto you, And the God of bowels will never cover me with ſhame, for making this profeſſion of my faith, in the boſomes of the Saints. I have been ſenſibly preſent with you in the Spirit, though I am in body abſent from you; And I hope that when God ſhall bring me again unto you, that I ſhall come in the bleſſing of the fullneſs of the Goſpel; in the mean while I ſhall in the Spirit of grace make my ſupplications for you at the throne of grace, that you may flouriſh in faith, grow in love, abound in lively hope, and that the peace which Chriſt hath bequeathed his Diſciples, may be with you, and ſhall beg your prayers, for me night, and day, that the <hi>Father of lights from whom every good, and perfect gift comes, may give the gifts, and graces of the Spirit, which I expect, who by grace may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe my ſelf.</hi>

                     <salute>Dear Brethren,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHen I reſolved to write unto you, I was thinking with my ſelf unto what Churches of the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> I might compare you. If I had compared you to <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> which are not reproved, but commended by Ieſus Chriſt, you might have concluded that I did flatter you. If I had compared you to <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſome might have thought that I had wronged them; and therefore I think that I cannot more truly ſpeak of you as a Church of Chriſt, then by acknowledging that ſome of the good things, for which ſome of thoſe Churches are commended, may be found amongſt you, and that ſome of the bad things, for which ſome of thoſe churches are blamed, may be found among ſome of you: I am perſwaded that Chriſt hath ſomewhat againſt ſome of you, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4 Becauſe you have left, and in part <hi>loſt your firſt love,</hi> which you had to Chriſt, his Goſpel and people; The Lord awaken you, and help you to recover that unfeigned repentance, lively faith, flaming affections, and ſoul-raviſhing hopes, which once you had; what have you found in the wayes of ſin; and the world which can countervail the loſs of thoſe ſweet and heavenly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which once you had in God: Return unto your <hi>firſt husband, for then was it better with you then now, Hoſea</hi> 2.7. Secondly, I know that Chriſt knoweth the poverty of ſome of you, but you are rich, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.9. The Lord hath left <hi>in the midſt of you an afflicted and poor people, and they ſhall truſt in the name of the Lord, Zeph.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Woe be unto the full, for they are empty, bleſſed be the empty, for they are full. Woe be to the rich for they are poor. Bleſſed are the poor in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for theirs is the kingdom of God.</hi> Labour therefore to be poor, that you may be rich, <hi>And if any man ſeem to be wiſe among you, let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe.</hi> He that will be nothing, ſhall be ſomething, and he that will be ſomething, ſhall be nothing, <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear what Christ ſaith unto his Church.</hi> Thirdly, ſome of you live <hi>where Satans ſeat is, and yet hold faſt the Name of Chriſt, and do not deny the faith of your King, Rev.</hi> 2.13. Some are labouring in ſpirit to help Chriſt to the throne of <hi>England.</hi> Others, if you can but give them ſome comfortable hopes of a<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> place, or preferment, or ſome other worldly thing, they care not whether the intereſt of Chriſt ſink or ſwim; they are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Satan ſhall keep his ſeat and the throne, if he will but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their luſts. But the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> ſhall be the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, let Souldiers, and Devils, and carnal Policy do what they can to hinder it: <hi>For the Kingdoms of this world are become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63520:43"/>to out ſaith, <hi>Kingdoms of our Lord, and his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign for ever and ever, Rev.</hi> 11.15. Fourthly, There may be ſome among you, (though very few) of whom Chriſt may ſay, <hi>I know thy works, and love, and ſervice, and faith, and patience, and thy works, and the laſt to be more then the first, Rev.</hi> 2.19. Hold faſt this <hi>Crown,</hi> the Lord Jeſus doth <hi>lay none other burthen upon you,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not. <hi>That which you have already hold faſt til he come, Rev.</hi> 2.24, 25. But fifthly, I am afraid that Chriſt may ſay to ſome of you, as to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis, Thou haſt a name that thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, but thou art dead, Rev.</hi> 3. There may be dead ſinners in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Saints, Oh! What will it advantage you to be in Church Communion with Saints here, when you ſhall keep compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with <hi>Fiends,</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> and<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Judaſes</hi> in hell to all eternity. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternel priviledges, and common gifts in the kingdom of heaven here, will but agrivate our condemnation in hell hereafter, unleſſe. Chriſts findes burning oyl in our Lamps, internal and unfeigned graces in our ſouls. Lay a carkaſs in the midſt of a congregation of living men, and will the carkaſs be enlivened by it? ſo the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of living members in a Church; cannot quicken Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes; ſtrive therefore rather to be, then to be accounted living Chriſtians. Sixthly, There are ſome of you, concerning whom Chriſt in the ſpirit doth inwardly give this teſtimony, <hi>that they have a little ſtrength, Rev.</hi> 3.8. As Chriſt gave the ſame teſtimony concerning <hi>Philadelphia's</hi> Angel. To you that have grace in truth, more grace ſhall be given, <hi>the weak ſhall be made ſtrong,</hi> grow therefore in grace, and in the knowledge of the myſtery of the Father, Son, and Spirit. And while the luſty youths who are ſtrong in their own ſtrength, <hi>ſhall faint, and be weary,</hi> and utterly fall, <hi>They who have no might ſhall encreaſe their ſtrength.</hi> And they who <hi>wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, they ſhall mount up with wings, as Eagles, they ſhall run, and not be weary, they ſhall walk, and not faint, Iſa.</hi> 40.29.30. Seventhly, I would that I had no ground to fear that there are ſome <hi>lukewarm Laodiceans</hi> among you, whom the Lord <hi>will ſpue out of his mouth, Rev.</hi> 3.16. One end of our redemption by Chriſt, is <hi>zeal in good works, Titus</hi> 2.14. He who is a profeſſor in theſe dayes without zeal,<note place="margin">Note.</note> will not be a profeſſor long. The Lord will ſuddenly bring his furnace to <hi>Zyon</hi> to burn up the hypocrites, and refine the true Saints. I do beg this at the hand of my God, that you may all in this Looking-glaſs behold the graces and ſpots of your ſouls and behold your ſeveral conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I ſhall reminde you of that which I moved, when I laſt ſpake
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63520:43"/>among you, That our Brother <hi>Wiſe</hi> may be called forth from among you, to be a teaching Elder. I apprehend, that by the grace of God, it may be to Gods glory, your edification and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in faith, and love, and my great comfort, and refreſhment. And likewiſe deſire, that you will endeavour to walk in the order of the goſpel, as becomes the Churches of Chriſt. A City may as well be without Government, an Army without Military Diſcipline, as a Church of Chriſt without diſcipline and government; the Lord compleat you in graces, gifts, and officers in the knowledge, and practice of all the ordinances of Chriſt our Saviour, and in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit; which in the Spirit is, and ſhall be the prayer of him, who by grace am made,</p>

                     <hi>GRace Wiſdom, Diſcretion, Valour, Gentleneſſe, Meekneſſe, Zeal, and Peace be multiplied upon you, through the Knowledge of God, and our Father, who is God, Bleſſed for ever. Amen, Rom.</hi> 9.5. The word which I have from the Lord unto you at this preſent, is to direct you in the right manner of doing that which is good, unto the glory of the Father. When we ſeriouſly conſider how many in theſe times have held forth moſt glorious truths, and done many righteous things, and afterwards have<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> apoſtatized from the way of truth, and righteouſneſs; we cannot but conclude, that they never did any of them well: the heart of fooliſh man doth not deceive him more in any thing, then in holding forth truth, and in doing that which is good in it ſelf: if we are for truth, and do that which is good, our deceitful hearts are ready preſently to canonize us for Saints, when in the mean while we may be rotten hearted Hypocrites. It is not enough to do that which is right, and juſt, but that which is good muſt be well done; any defect, though never ſo ſmall in an action, may make it evil; but there muſt be a joynt concurrence of all Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63520:44"/>and Ingredients to make an action really good. There is a broad way to hell in doing that which is materially good, <hi>Praying, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Faſing, meeting with the Saints, breaking of Bread with them, and to them,</hi> may be a ſtage, upon which a man with the approbation of the Saints may act his luſts, and the truths of God in all ages have never ſuffered more ſadly, then by ſome zealous and religious Stage play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who for a time have acted their parts with applauſe upon this ſtage. How bravely did <hi>Judas</hi> act his part in praying, preaching, working of miracles by Chriſt, and afterward<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> betrayed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? How well did <hi>Demas</hi> manage his buſineſſe before <hi>he embraced this preſent world. Alexander the Copper-Smith, who did much wrong unto Paul,</hi> and againſt whom he prayed in the Spirit of the Goſpel, that God would <hi>reward him according unto his works,</hi> had almoſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death as a Martyr for Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.33. May we go ſo far in paths of light and righteouſneſs, and afterwards prove like the Renegado Turks, the greateſt Perſecutors of Chriſtians in the world. Oh! Then how ought we to examine our works, our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, our hearing, our ſpeaking of the things of God, leſt there ſhould be any root of bitterneſſe in them, which at length ſpringing up, ſhould diſcover us to be Liars, Impoſtures Mamoniſts, Hypocrites before <hi>God, Angels, Saints, and ſinners.</hi> My Letters unto you as yet have been as ſuits of clothes made up, but not fitted for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, if they fit any Men, and their guilty Conſcience, do apply particularly unto themſelves, the things ſpoken and propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of in them in general, I ſhall begin to be perſwaded that I do not drop Ink upon paper in vain; give me leave therefore to come home into your boſoms, hearts and conſciences, in a word of Trial of your <hi>works, gifts, duties, actions, profeſſions, performances,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, try the original of your Actions, if the ſpring of your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be poyſoned, the ſtreams cannot be healthy: if fleſh be the fountain, whatſoever proceeds from it is fleſhly, <hi>If the tree be evil, the fruit cannot be good.</hi> Ask thy ſoul this queſtion, doſt thou pray and ſpeak of ſpiritual things, by a gift, or by the Spirit of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the prayers of the Formaliſts, though never ſo well guilded, are <hi>abominable unto Jehovah,</hi> becauſe they are not from the ſpirit of the New Creation. Secondly, Try the rule of thy Actions, Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to walk exactly by rule, and by line, dareſt thou bring thy heart, and thy Actions to be tryed by the good light of the word of God. Thirdly, Try thy wayes by the good example of Saints, and prophets, <hi>Take my brethren the prophets for an example, Jam.</hi> 5.10.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63520:44"/>Not the court Chaplains,<note place="margin">Note.</note> and Temporizing <hi>Demaſes</hi> of this back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding generation. Fourthly, Try thy Actions by thy faith, two men may do the ſame thing, <hi>Abel;</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> the one doth the will of ſame thing, it is not the ſame thing which they do. One man Preaches <hi>Free-grace,</hi> and the <hi>Intereſt of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Saints, in the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> and then abhors his own Preaching, the other doth Preach the ſame things in faith and hath the ſmile of God, for the preſent, and his Crown of glory hereafter for a reward. Fifthly, Try thy wayes by the ſincerity, and uprightneſs of thy heart, upright walking is ſure walking; Let <hi>Jehu ſay, Come ſee my Zeal for the Lord of hoſts.</hi> But be thou able to ſay with <hi>Hezekiah, Lord thou knoweſt that I have walked uprightly before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Try thy Actions by thy affectionate willingneſs, to do, or ſuffer for God, Gods <hi>people are a willing People in the day of his power, Pſal.</hi> 110. Chriſt loveth chearfull, and obedient Servants. Seventhly, Try thy Actions, by the Teſtimony of a pure, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned Conſcience; <hi>Beloved if our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, and whatſoever we ask we receive of him becauſe we keep his Commandments, and do thoſe things, that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his ſight,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.21, 22. Laſtly, that my Letters may not be burthen ſome, try, and ſearch your wayes by your aims, and ends, do nothing as to man, or to your ſelves, but all as to God, and the <hi>glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. I put you not to a harder task, then by the help of Chriſt I have done many times ſince I came into this place; And after my moſt exact ſcrutiny, and ſearch into my own heart, the Spirit of truth bearing me witneſs. <hi>To me it is given not onely to believe, but to ſuffer</hi> as a Priſoner <hi>for Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By the light of the Spirit I do like my Cauſe in which I ſuffer every day better, and better; I do riſe higher in my faith for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining promiſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.33. That God will bring down Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and Perſecutors, new, and old.

Secondly, How evident doth that truth of Chriſt ſhine forth at this time? <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God, and Mammon.</hi> Your gilded Mamoniſts in <hi>London,</hi> will not be able to hold long their profeſſion without wavering, but will baſely, and unworthily, deſert the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Intereſt of Chriſt, and his People. for a morſel of Bread.</hi> You will finde that many who were very Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the intereſt of Chriſt when it was calm, will not be able to hold it out in a ſtorm.

The very noiſe, and rumout that Chriſt is going unto a Priſon, and that we ſhall not be able to keep Company with him, and minde his Intereſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, unleſs we are made willing to follow him into a Priſon will make ſome recant, and rather blaſphemouſly, Father the Iſſues,<note place="margin">VVho doth ſo now?</note> and births of the Spirit in them upon the fleſh, then run the hazard of ſuffering perſecution, for the Truths, concerning Chriſt, and his Intereſt, which they have declared; But you will ſay, <hi>Why do you ſend theſe lines unto us? are we not all for Chriſt, and his People? their Cauſe, and Intereſt?</hi> I anſwer, with <hi>Paul to Agrippa I wiſh that you were not almoſt, but altogether all of you ſuch as I am,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>except thoſe bonds. I wiſh that you were all as really for the Cauſe of Chriſt, and his people, againſt all Antichriſtian Spirits whatſoever, as you ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be when the Churches at the firſt met at</hi> All-hallows. But know, that men do eaſily deceive themſelves in generals: In ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, <hi>Papists,</hi> carnal <hi>Protestants,</hi> all <hi>Profeſſors of Chriſtianity,</hi> are againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſt; the man of ſin,</hi> who profeſſeth himſelf to be Chriſts Vicar, will ſay that he were not worthy, to live, if he were not againſt every Antichriſtian Spirit. And therefore come to particulars if you will not be deceived, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded, by your own hearts. Again, if you will not be deceived by the great <hi>Cheaters, Jugglers, Impoſtures</hi> your own hearts, do not onely try your ſelves, in particulars, in which all men, Saints, and ſinners agree, and which you may agree with them in, without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering perſecution, but come to particulars, in the profeſſion of which you may ſuffer perſecution;<note place="margin">Note.</note> The word of Chriſt in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration may be a word for a while, for which we may ſuffer. Chriſt had never had any Martyrs, if there had not been ſome rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Spirit, to hold forth ſomething in oppoſition to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the powers of the world under which they lived; It is an eaſie thing to Preach, and maintain a thouſand truths without ſuffering. And it may be that Chriſt would have one<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> truth preached, and witneſſed unto, which will certainly bring perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at the heels of it. You may Preach, and ſpeak againſt ten thouſand ſins, and not ſuffer the loſs of one hair by it; And yet there is one ſin which Chriſt will have his People ſpeak againſt, which may coſt them their lives, which I could eaſily demonſtrate; but the meſſengers departure doth inforce me to break off ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly.

                  <p>IF I am not miſtaken concerning the time, in which we live, the next eminent work of God, which will appear upon the ſtage, will be the <hi>filling of his Temple with ſmoke from the glory of God, and his power,</hi> Rev. 15.19. And therefore it will not be an unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble word to ſtir you up to pray for the Accompliſhing of it; there will not be any great thing done, beyond what you have ſeen with your eyes, until the Angell of the Covenant, come into his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to fill it with the glory of his Spirit, ſurely the Spirit is upon his return to the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt. During the raign <hi>of the man of ſin,</hi> the Learned Impoſtures of the world, with their Acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Anointings have ecclipſed the glory of the Saints, but when the promiſed Spirit of glory in <hi>Graces,</hi> and <hi>gifts,</hi> ſhall dwell among <hi>Sions</hi> Congregations, the learned wiſdom, and policy of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Church will be confounded. As yet, as I humbly conceive, one <hi>vial</hi> hath not been <hi>poured forth,</hi> But ſuddainly a great voice will be heard out of the Temple ſaying to the ſeven Angels, <hi>Go your wayes, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth,</hi> Rev. 16.1. As when the Temple of <hi>Solomon</hi> was Conſecrated fire came down from Heaven, and the <hi>glory of the Lord filled the houſe, and the Prieſts could not enter into the Temple,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.1, 2. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> was a Type, is about to Conſecrate his New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament Temple, which Antichriſt hath profaned, and polluted. And ſuddenly the glory of <hi>Jehovah</hi> will fill his Churches, fire will come down from heaven upon his beloved ones. <hi>The Angel will fly thorow the midſt of. Heaven preaching the everlaſting Goſpel, and the earth will be enlightned with his glory.</hi> Hitherto onely ſome of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts body hath been deſtroyed, but then his Spirit will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and deſtroyed.

                  <p>I Have thorow mercy a whole week together taſted the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in cloſe Impriſonment, it is nothing to be alone, if it be for many years together, where there is a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence of God: he that with <hi>Enoch walketh with God,</hi> can never be alone.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63520:47"/>ſay, who in truth can ſay. <hi>Truly my fellowſhip is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with his Son Jeſus.</hi> Unleſs the New Courtiers, did love me very well, they would not deal with me as they do. If they knew what an Advantage cloſe Impriſonment were unto me; That my <hi>Faith, Joyes, Hope, Sanctification,</hi> might ariſe higher, my Father gave forth his Orders that the under Gaolers, ſhould keep me cloſe Priſoner, <hi>Father if thou wilt be ſo ſweet in all thy diſpenſations to thy worthleſs and vile Creature</hi> (though by grace thy Son) <hi>it ſhall not be grievous unto me; If it ſhall pleaſe thee to ſuffer them to deal more roughly, and barbarouſly with me,</hi> God is ſo ſweet that I cannot but <hi>glory in Tribulations.</hi> I have my wife and children about me, while I am alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my Jeſus is with me: My perſonal Communion is ſo ſweet with God, that were it not that I would not live onely to my ſelf, and my own comforts in glorifying God, but do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be uſefull unto others in glorifying God, I ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deſire more external Liberty. God doth ſmile upon me, yea that you may wax confident by my Impriſonment, and not be aſhamed of my reproach: I muſt tell you <hi>the cauſe for which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer doth ſmile upon me.</hi> Who am I, that God hath ſo highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured me, in thinking me worthy <hi>to ſuffer for Righteouſneſſe ſake,</hi> in bearing witneſs againſt the<note n="⋆" place="margin">Note.</note> 
                     <hi>Covetouſneſſe, Lies, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, Hypocriſies</hi> and <hi>Tyranicall Practiſes</hi> of Men, I would not change my Impriſoned condition with the higheſt condition of my perſecutors and oppreſſors. How much is it better to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Saint, then a Perſecutor? The Lord will ſuccour, and <hi>relieve the oppreſſed,</hi> but <hi>will break in pieces the oppreſſor.</hi> I begin to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that there is ſome truth in the things which formerly I ſpake doubtfully of. About at twelve moneth ſince in <hi>Martins fields,</hi> I was tranſported into a Spirit beyond my own, and in it the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of great <hi>O.</hi> was revealed unto me. About the diſſolution of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> I ſaw great <hi>O.</hi> four ſeverall Mornings Intellectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In the firſt, he was haſtily running towards a <hi>Crown;</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he ſat in a <hi>Chair of State,</hi> In the third, he was preſented with a part of <hi>Horns</hi> upon his head; and in the fourth, he was ſhamefully tumbled from his <hi>Pomp,</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> I have ſeen the three firſt come to paſs, and for the third I do now more fully underſtand it then ever I did. His two <hi>Horns</hi> are his Tyrannical Power, by which he doth puſh at, and perſecute the poor Saints; and his Antichriſtian power, by which in things Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical, he doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Christ</hi> in his Royal Prerogatives, as he is <hi>King of Saints,</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63520:48"/>an appointer, and ordainer of Preachers according to his own Laws. I pitty the man in the place in which he is now ſeated; If he were an Angel in his preſent place, and feat, he could not but be a perſecutor of the Saints,<note place="margin">Note.</note> for he is one of the <hi>ten horns of the Beaſt</hi> which muſt make <hi>war with the Lamb;</hi> but he ſhall overcome him, <hi>for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings,</hi> and they that are with him, <hi>are called, choſen, and faithful; Rev.</hi> 17.14. I had an impulſe of Spirit, in which I was ſtrongly carried to believe, that that Baſtardly Government, in the ſetting up of which, the mouthes of Gods enemies were opened to blaſpheme, ſhould die, and not live, though in it ſelf it might be good enough, and too good for us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we did walk more worthy of our mercies; yet conſidering it, as ſet up by them, who declared ſo much for the <hi>Liberty of the free born people of</hi> England, <hi>and the Intereſt of Chriſt,</hi> it is a <hi>bastard</hi> begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, &amp; conceived in a night of Hypocriſie, and brought forth in a day of bold faced impiety, and the Lord will make a grave for it, for it is vild. I did apprehend that great <hi>O.</hi> was ſet up by <hi>God</hi> permiſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the <hi>Dragon</hi> voluntarily, by <hi>himſelf</hi> ambitiouſly, by the <hi>Army</hi> cowardly, by<note n="⋆" place="margin">Is not <hi>Kelzye, Strange, Harriſon, Ducker, Sumner,</hi> whom we have charged with this, And others the willing Traytors, according to his own words.</note> 
                     <hi>willing Saints Trayterouſly,</hi> and by unwilling Saints paſſively, &amp; mournfully. I do repeat theſe things that you may know I am confirmed &amp; not weakned in my perſwaſions, &amp; that you may know what comfortable ground I have to wait for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what is behind. It is ſweet to me now in this confinement to conſider, that I had a hint of theſe things, by Intellectual viſion, or dreams before they came to paſs. In a ſlumber, about <hi>Worceſter</hi> Buſineſſe, I ſaw great <hi>O,</hi> lying upon the ground, with moſt of his great Officers, and their mouthes ſtopped with clay, by which I was perſwaded, that they ſhould not be able to act any more for Chriſt, or fetch breath in his cauſe, which is come to paſſe. Before the diſſolution of the long ſitting Parliament. In a dream I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held ſome luſty fellowes binding an old man, who when he was bound, his cords did break, but he was ſo feeble that he could not riſe again, and preſently after they had left him; they caught hold of me, and apprehended me. It was given in, <hi>that the Parliament was the Old man, and that after they had diſſolved the Parliament, they ſhould perſecute me;</hi> which I charged upon the memories of ſome friends to remember. I ſcarce know how to ſpeak of theſe things, becauſe ſome may think that I ſpeak in wrath, when I ſpeak upon a more noble account, for the glory of God. But let truth be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken though I ſuffer in the opinions of ſome Saints. I ſhall conclude with deſiring your Prayers, for theſe things, firſt, that I may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63520:48"/>the enemies of Chriſt, as his, not mine, hating their wayes yet loving their perſons as my own. Secondly, That I may pray in faith with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.134. <hi>Deliver me from the oppreſſion of man, ſo will I keep thy precepts.</hi> Thirdly, That God might ſtrike my ſtrongeſt corruptions under the fifth rib by this impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Fourthly, That God would anoint me with freſh oyl, to <hi>Preach and Baptize,</hi> Fifthly, That God would teach me to ſee how far my ſuffering may be accounted a <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> in relation to Chriſts good cauſe, and a <hi>Judgement,</hi> in relation to my unprofitable walking before God and his people; for the ſame ſuffering may be a Martyrdom for Chriſt, and a judgement to our fleſh, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.16, 17. The Lord enable you to ask theſe things in faith, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly enable you to every good work, through Chriſt, <hi>to whom be glory everlaſtingly. Amen.</hi>

                  <label>Objection,</label> The aforeſaid Scripture although it ſpeakes full as to their being rebuked before all according to the nature of their offence, with the capacity wherein they ſtand which we muſt confeſs doth weigh in the ballane of truth, yet this doth not prove that we ought to publiſh their ſins by writing, and therefore we would gladly hear what Scripture you have for the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>Anſwer,</label> In caſe it appears, that according to the nature of their ſin, and the capacity they ſtand in, they cannot be <hi>rebuked before all,</hi> but by publiſhing them by writing, then we think it cannot be ſuppoſed, but that it is our Goſpel liberty ſo to do, or otherwiſe, as may moſt anſwer the end of the Scripture, that their folly being manifeſt to all, they may proceed no further; elſe how came <hi>Pauls epiſtle</hi> about the <hi>Incestuous Perſon</hi> to be publiſhed; ſurely none will Judge that the Apoſtle did write out of malice, or revenge; But further we deſire more particularly that that Scripture in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.1, 2. and 8. verſes,<note n="⋆" place="margin">Iſa, 31.1.

In the firſt and ſecond verſes, after he hath laid down their ſin, with the aggravations of it, he is commanded in the eigh verſe <hi>to write it in a table; and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever.</hi> And the ſin of the Souldiers in this day ſeemes to run
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63520:50"/>in a line with the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in that day; and without doubt the Propher by the Spirit of the Lord was directed to foreſee our very day, that what he then writ might be a word of Inſtruction for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages. <hi>For whatſoever things were written aforetime, were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for our learning, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5.4.</p>

                  <label>Anſw.</label> We do grant, as is laid down in the objection, that one end of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> was to give direction, how brethren, in Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, guilty of groſſe ſins, ought to be proceeded againſt; yet this doth no ways weaken the other end the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> might have, in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Epiſtle upon record, that, if God may be glorified by it, to publiſh by writing the ſins of ſuch perſons for generations to come, which being compared with that in the 30. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> aforementioned, ſeemes unto us ſtrongly to warrant ſuch a practice. And although it is urged in the <hi>Objection,</hi> that <hi>what</hi> Iſaiah <hi>writ, was by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Spirit, and unto the Jews, as a National Church:</hi> So was all the Scripture writ with an extraordinary Spirit, wherein are ſome things for our poſitive Rule, and the reſt, as words of Inſtruction, for the people of God in after ages; that they might with that ordinary portion of the Spirit given forth unto them, with the help of the Scripture, be <hi>throughly furniſhed to every good work.</hi> And for what is further urged, <hi>That it was a Church Act, they being a National Church;</hi> That we conceive is a miſtake, or at leaſt much ſhortning the ſcope of the Spirit thereby intended; for in the 9. verſe of that Chapter, the <hi>Prophet</hi> is directed to <hi>write down</hi> their tranſgreſſion, not onely as a <hi>Church,</hi> but as a<note n="⋆" place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> were written in a Roll, and publiſhed, in the Lords houſe, and abroad to the people.
