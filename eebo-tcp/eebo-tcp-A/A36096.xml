            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SOME Occaſions having call'd me to <hi>Ireland,</hi> a little before I left it, which is not long ſince, there happened the Death of a Biſhop, which occaſion'd a Remove in the Church, that gave no ſmall offence to all her Well-wiſhers; and among others, I was reſolv'd, as ſoon as I got home, to give the Party concern'd my thoughts of it: but fore I could do this, we had the account of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Tranſlation to <hi>W—r,</hi> tho 'twas not believed at this diſtance by any here that pretend to be of your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, till confirm'd by the laſt Poſt.</p>
            <p>Your Character, for the moſt part, has been ſuch, that I have been always one of your Admirers; and had I not happened into the Converſation of ſome diſcerning Men here, who ſee the ill conſequences of ſuch Removes, that Admiration might perhaps have ſtill continued, which now, I confeſs, is wonderfully leſſen'd; and as a reaſon for it, give me leave to lay before your Lordſhip their Sentiments, which I ſhall do truly and plainly, having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Will nor Skill to do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63148:3"/>
They ſay, my Lord, you have now a ſecond time gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Church her ſelf, as well as that ſacred Order to which they believe you unworthily intituled, a more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Blow than any of her pretended Friends, nay, her moſt cruel and profeſt Enemies were ever able to do. You have, they ſay, declared to the World, what thoſe of your Order (generally ſpeaking) propoſe to themſelves in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring and accepting that Office, which the Apoſtle calls <hi>A good Work.</hi> You have given incouragement to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Atheiſm which hath broke in upon us, and eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Cauſe, whoſe hope extends not beyond this preſent World, and look for no other reward for all their beſt Services than what this Life affords: and this at a time when you are juſt leaving it, have more than one foot in the Grave, and will not (without their being the Prophet of your Wo) live long to enjoy it.</p>
            <p>They wonder what remorſe of Conſcience muſt needs ſeize you, when you conſider what you have done, how you have open'd the mouths of Adverſaries who lie in wait for advantages of this kind, and are of themſelves, without any manner of occaſion, too ready to revile and aſperſe your Profeſſion; nay, have given your very Friends reaſon to conceive moſt deſperate Prejudices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your high and holy Calling. And ſome of theſe Gentlemen have an account from <hi>London,</hi> that ſeveral who have been formerly attackt, but never could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with to deſert the Church, have upon this Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of yours, turn'd their backs upon her, and choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to join themſelves to thoſe Societies, where ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Practices are not allow'd, and where their Teachers ſeem to have an eye for all their Services and Labours to a future Reward, than to abide in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63148:3"/>
of a Church, where their very Governours and Guides by their daily Practices declare, if they can, by hook or by crook, no matter how, add to their Wealth and Grandeur here, they value not what may be feared or hop'd for hereafter.</p>
            <p>You have, ſay theſe Gentlemen, very unhappily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a ſad inſtance of this; and the Ground thereof (pretend what you will) 'tis like proceeds from ſomething too near Atheiſm. It is not very likely, ſay they, you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a God, or that the Scriptures are his Word, which, beſides that inward Peace, Comfort and Satisfaction which naturally attend the performance of a man's Duty, propoſe no other Reward than what chiefly relates to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State; whereas you ſeem, ſay they, to deſpiſe this, and are altogether for the preſent: who for the lucre of not many 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year, have forſaken (they wiſh they could ſay your firſt) your ſecond, nay your third Love, and left a Dioceſs, where, by knowing and being known, you might be much more ſerviceable than where you are altogether a Stranger, and cannot expect to live to be otherwiſe, and in divers reſpects unfit to ſucceed him that is gone, who yet, beſides his learned Works, left no great Character behind him, nor found out the way of doing ſo much good as might have been expected from him, and which, they fear, may much leſs be hop'd for from your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Ambition and Avarice have been, as they conceive, the two great Rocks you have in your Chriſtian Courſe ſplit upon. The former carried you from the Vicaridg of St. <hi>M rt-ns</hi> to the Biſhoprick of St. <hi>A</hi>—; the latter from thence to <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> and now from thence to <hi>W.</hi> In your
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63148:4"/>
firſt remove, you declar'd your ſelf ſenſible of the temporal Loſs you ſuſtain'd; but the pretence was, the deſire of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good (a very warrantable inducement) to which you ſaid your being a Native of the Country, and skilful in the Language, would conduce much. But being either weary of doing good, or unable to do any to others, you began to think of doing good to your ſelf, and laid hold of the firſt opportunity to give your poor Countrymen the ſlip, and got into a Dioceſs of much greater profit, as well as of a far larger extent; and in which (as to a great part of it) you are, as I am inform'd, as much a Stranger as he that writes this, who was never within the Verge of any part thereof. Theſe Gentlemen would fain ask, what anſwer you will make when you ſhall be called to give an account of your Stewardſhip: Will it be ſufficient to ſay, a great part of your time was taken up at <hi>London</hi> in minding the Affairs of State, which yet notwithſtanding you could never comprehend, no leſs in managing the private concerns of your Family, and ſo much in indulging your aged and decayed Carcaſe, that you had little or none left for the buſineſs of your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
            <p>However, my Lord, all this is no ſtumbling Block to me, who have learnt to diſtinguiſh between the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal failings of Men, and their Office: but others, not ſo well ſatisfied, deſire to know, from which of the Apoſtles or Primitive Biſhops (from whom you boaſt of a Succeſſion) do you derive Authority for this unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable Remove? As the former were for the moſt part no where fixt, and therefore can afford us no precedent in this caſe; ſo it is well known how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63148:4"/>
the latter wav'd all opportunities of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking their firſt Charge, and could never be brought to it, but when the preſſing Neceſſities of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd it; and then 'twas often from a greater, to a place of leſs Profit.</p>
            <p>Nor is this all; you have hereby expoſed your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Order not only in your own Perſon, but caſt a Temptation in the way of another.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop of <hi>O</hi>—, in every reſpect a <hi>ſingle Man,</hi> being unable to live upon 700 <hi>l.</hi> a Year, tho he never ſpent 200, removes from <hi>O</hi>—the Seat of the Muſes, and the ſweeteſt preferment (eſpecially conſidering his other Circumſtances) the Church affords, and ſnatches at <hi>L</hi>—, not much more than 2 or 300 <hi>l.</hi> a Year better. But there is this to be ſaid for him, that nothing elſe (if he may be believ'd) could have tempted him to ſuch an unaccountable Practice; and there are Letters here from ſome who pretend to know him well, averring, he would not have accepted of <hi>W—rc—r,</hi> or any other except <hi>L</hi>—and <hi>C</hi>—in <hi>England;</hi> which being his Countrey, the place of his Birth, as <hi>O—d</hi> was of his Education, it was but almoſt natural for him to affect it. So that ſomething may be offer'd for him; but for your Lordſhip, nothing more than that you have given thoſe who are Friends to the Church occaſion to take of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and grieve, <hi>(and wo be to them by whom ſuch Offences come)</hi> and thoſe who are her Enemies to rejoice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; who, tho they are ſilent, make their own Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, laugh in their Sleeves, and whiſper to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Let them go on, by theſe irregularities they'l bring themſelves into Contempt, and all in good time do their own work.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63148:5"/>
One would think, ſince Dr. <hi>T</hi>—is thought worthy to be a Biſhop, and no Body, I ſuppoſe, doubts it; he might have been more ſerviceable at <hi>W—r,</hi> where he has liv'd ſo long <hi>D—n,</hi> and muſt needs be acquainted with the Conſtitution of the Dioceſs, and Temper of the People, than èlſewhere: or if there was a neceſſity to comply with your Lordſhip, by giving you this lift; why might not Dr. <hi>A—n</hi> the Dean of <hi>L</hi>—have been thought of to ſucceed? A Man by his uſeful and good Works better known to the World, than any of thoſe concern'd in theſe Removes.</p>
            <p>You know, my Lord, one of the great outcries in the two laſt Reigns, was, that Intereſt (eſpecially in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preferments) carried all, without any manner of regard to Merit: God forbid it ſhould prove a juſt Complaint in this, wherein it was particularly promiſed to be reform'd.</p>
            <p>Or yet farther; if theſe irregular Changes, unknown to the Primitive Church, in which we ſo much glory, muſt be continued; we know it has been uſual for the Biſhops of <hi>B—l</hi> (a See very mean and low in its Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue) to have the advantage of a Remove: and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it had been now, but that the preſent Biſhop ſtands adjudg'd guilty of two terrible faults in a Biſhop of our Times.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, he is moderate in his Principles, not fond of a high-flown Juriſdiction; and it may be thinks it needleſs in the Church, where the Magiſtrate is Chriſtian in the State. The other, and more intolerable, is, that he is a conſtant and painful Preacher, a Crime not to be forgiven by thoſe (except a very few) of his own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for that he thereby leſſens himſelf, and inſtead of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and governing (his ſole and proper Buſineſs) ſlaves
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63148:5"/>
and drudges in the Work of the Presbyters. Theſe, no doubt, may prove blocks in his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while your Lordſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and others of your Order, ride on ſucceſsfully, without troubling your ſelves either with Preaching or Praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the latter eſpecially (tho it be the more honourable of the two) being thought ſo much below your Dignity, that it were a prodigy to find a Biſhop in the Desk, reading Divine Service. Nay, I have been aſſur'd by a Gentleman come lately from <hi>London,</hi> that going to Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>prayer on a Week-day, in one of the Out-Churches there, the Congregation being gathered, and the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, on ſome occaſion or other, failing, the People were diſmiſt without Prayers, tho there were two Biſhops pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. O tell not this to the unconverted World: pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it not in <hi>Askelon,</hi> tell it not in <hi>Gath;</hi> declare it not in the Streets of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> leſt <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels</hi> abroad, as well as our Fellow Chriſtians at home, deride and laugh us to ſcorn.</p>
            <p>You your ſelves, who by a great and good Example, ſhould influence others to the contrary, contribute not a little to the contempt of our publick Service, while out of Sloth, or Pride, or both, you ſcorn (at leaſt omit) to miniſter in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas you ought to eſteem it your greateſt Glory.</p>
            <p>And it were well if you were only ſhort in this; but are you not ſo in all the other Duties of your Function? Do you know what it is to preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon? Do moſt of you know what it is to preach at all, unleſs now and then at Court you are pleas'd to harangue the Auditory? Can you tell when you viſited a ſick Bed? comforted an afflicted, inſtructed an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63148:6"/>
inform'd an erroneous, or reſolv'd a doubting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? What differences in your Neighbourhood have you compos'd? What care have you had that your Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies in their ſeveral places do duly and conſcionably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their reſpective Duties? What Incouragement and Rewards have you diſpens'd to thoſe that do? What Frowns, if not Puniſhments have you caſt upon thoſe that do not? What Hoſpitality have you kept? What Charity have you exercis'd? How many naked Backs have you at your own Expence cloth'd? How many hungry Bellies have you fed? What Sick and Needy have you viſited and reliev'd? No, theſe are matters, that for the moſt part, come not within the compaſs of your Care. To live in State and Splendor, to look ſcornfully upon your Brethren, to carry things with a high hand againſt thoſe that will not truckle, or upon any occaſion ſtand in your way, and to heap up Wealth for your Families, have been too much the Care and Buſineſs of your Lives: and that this laſt will be always yours, your late proceeding, in coveting what you ought by no means to have thought of, does ſufficiently manifeſt.</p>
            <p>You may indeed derive a Precedent for this, from what has lately been done in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where by the death of the Biſhop which I mention'd before, two Biſhopricks became void; and the Government there, who conſider, it ſeems, how deſtructive Pluralities of any kind are to the Church, recommended two ſeveral Perſons to them; (tho by the way, one of them was look'd upon by the Clergy there very unfit, and every way unqualified for that Office; but he is Chaplain to the Government, and that is enough.) However, theſe Recommendations were

laid aſide, and at the inſtance of ſome at Court, who it may be neither underſtand the Conſtitution, nor are capable of conſulting the good of that Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Gentleman well nigh as aged as your Lordſhip, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from a Dioceſs where he has been 20 years Biſhop, and had his Reſidence in the ſecond beſt City of the Kingdom, to almoſt a waſte Country, which, as I was inform'd, affords not a Houſe fit to live in, nor three Churches that are rooft, nor ſix <hi>Britiſh</hi> Families fit to be convers'd with; and yet the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage not above 100 or 150 <hi>l.</hi> a year. Theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, they ſay, may be avoided by the Biſhop's living at <hi>Dublin,</hi> as his Predeceſſor before him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did. For tho the Inferior Clergy be enjoin'd Reſidence, yet a Biſhop there is above all Rules, and may live where he will. And as for this Biſhop, I mean he that is remov'd, I had ſuch a Character of him, that if my Authors err'd not, he may be lookt upon as a Prodigy in nature. Some of them had been his Scholars, others his Pariſhioners at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſome his near Neighbours and intimate Acquaintance at <hi>C—k,</hi> where he was Biſhop; and yet they all aſſured me that the whole Country where he was concern'd, tho much troubled for the Slur caſt upon the Church by his Remove, will yet greatly rejoice that they are rid of him, who was always upon every little occaſion, jarring, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and brow-beating them. He was, they ſay, a great part of his time a Schoolmaſter, which ſo ſower'd his Temper, that he's ſcarce fit for civil Converſation; and as they deſcribe him, is defective

in every one of thoſe Qualifications which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture requires in one of his Order; ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blameleſs, that he is in all reſpects and relations whatſoever, faulty: but his Faults for his Order's ſake ought not to be expos'd. They own him (conſidering his Station) apt to teach, but ſo poſitive and ſingular in the very Pulpit, as renders his Doctrine harſh and nauſeous. He is allowed by all to be a man of Letters and Parts; but his Infirmities are ſo many, that they eclipſe any thing that's valuable in him. They added to all this, that he is (if not a downright Enemy) yet no Friend to the Government: He ſat all along in King <hi>James</hi>'s Parliament, wanted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Courage or Will to thwart or proteſt againſt their proceedings; and ſtill voted with them againſt the few Proteſtants and other diſcerning honeſt men amongſt them; was often in private with that King, and ſtill, they ſay, retains much of that Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, can you think ſuch a man as this a Pattern worthy your imitation? and will his Tranſlation any way juſtify yours? I know one thing cunningly urged for theſe Tranſlations is, That they are an advantage to the Crown, by reaſon of the firſt Fruits that ariſe from them: but is this Conſideration fit to come in the ballance with the great Scandal and Diſhonour they bring upon the Church? How little doth the King value theſe Mites, who yet ſuffers extreamly in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? And the Reproach extends not only to the Parties immediately concern'd, but (tho very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63148:7"/>
to his Majeſty himſelf.</p>
            <p>It is very well known there are not wanting too many reſtleſs and diſcontented Wretches, who would fain do ill Offices between the King and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and among other things ſuggeſt (tho falſly) that he hath no manner of regard for the Church, and therefore all Courſes are taken to bring her into contempt and diſgrace; and I find it a common obſervation among the very Clergy at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that except four or five, none ſince the Revolution, but the loweſt, in ſome ſenſe or other, of the People, (as in <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s time) men meriting as little from the Government as from God and the World, have been grac't with the chief Preferments in the Church; which hath given great offence to many, as if it were done purpoſely to expoſe her. All this may be true; but why ſhould it be imputed to the King? It being impoſſible for him to know men, but as they are repreſented; and no doubt of it, but unqualified Perſons have been recommended by ſome, purpoſely to bring an Odium both upon him and the Church; and it is to be feared they have had too much of their deſign this way. And it hath been the buſineſs of others, eſpecially in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to recommend Men for no other Qualification than their Super-conformity: they ſeem'd to be jealous of Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and ſought out Men, however otherwiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified, that would be ſure not to diſpenſe (tho to ſave a Soul) with a Syllable of the Rubrick.</p>

Clergy, of which, as I was inform'd, there have been more in that Kingdom ſince the Revolution, than in all the laſt four Reigns. The late Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> a great Lover of the Church, knew this well enough; and therefore would never endure it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from a Biſhoprick to an Archbiſhoprick, and that only in caſes extraordinary. The greateſt Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for Epiſcopacy, when the times required ſtriking for it, who would never conſent to part with any of the leaſt Priviledges annext to it, were ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aware how miſchievous and deſtructive this Courſe was to its very Conſtitution; and therefore always declared againſt it, and not only conſented, but in all Debates relating thereunto, earneſtly preſt, that no Biſhop ſhould remove, or be tranſlated from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick which he ſhould firſt undertake, unleſs when the neceſſary good of the Church, rather than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of the Perſon to be removed, requir'd it. But your Lordſhip has, it ſeems, been of another mind, and 'twere well if you could yet live to be otherwiſe. Have you not <hi>Win—r</hi> or any other better than <hi>Wor—r</hi> now in your eye? and are you not ready to make t'other ſtep when occaſion ſerves? when will you ſettle at this rate? when will you allow your ſelf a reſting time, that you may prepare for another Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney which you muſt ſoon go? I have often heard it ſaid that the Church could never be deſtroyed but by her ſelf; and I am perſwaded, were it not for the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Lives of many, and the cold, dead, lazy way of preaching of almoſt all our Clergy, together with ſuch irregular, covetous, and unwarrantable Courſes as are
