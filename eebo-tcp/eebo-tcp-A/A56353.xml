            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Articles being read; hee proceeded as followeth.</head>
            <p>My Lords,</p>
            <p>THERE is an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Scripture, which I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume either to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, or to interpret; yet to a vulgar eye it seemes to have an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect something suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Person and Cause before you: It is a description of the evill Spirits, wherein they are said to be <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickednesses in High Places.</hi> Crimes acted by the spirituall faculties of the Soule, the Will and the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exercised about spirituall matters, concerning Gods Worship, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Man, seconded with power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, learning, and many other advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29612:10"/>
doe make the party who commits them, very sutable to that description, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickednesses in high places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Crimes (my Lords) are various in their Nature, haynous in their qualitie, and universall in their Extent. If you exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them <hi>Theologically,</hi> as they stand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Trueth of God, they will be found to be against the rule of Faith, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power of godlinesse, against the meanes of Salvattion.</p>
            <p>If you examine them <hi>Morally,</hi> as they stand in opposition to the light of Nature, to right, reason, and the principles of humane saciety, you will then perceive pride with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any moderation; such a Pride as that is which <hi>exalts</hi> it selfe <hi>above all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God.</hi> Malice without any provocation; Malice against vertue, against innocency, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst pietie: Injustice without any meanes of restitution; even such injustice as doeth robbe the present times of their possessions; the future, of their possibilities.</p>
            <p>If they be examined (my Lords) by Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Rules in a <hi>Civill</hi> way, as they stand in opposition to the Publique good, and to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29612:10"/>
Lawes of the Land, He will be found to be a Traytour against his Majesties Crowne, an Incendiary against the Peace of the State; he will be found to be the highest, the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, the most impudent oppressour, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was an oppressour both of King and People.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Charge</hi> (my Lords) is distributed and conveyed into foureteene severall Articles, as you have heard; and those Articles are onely generall: It being the intention of the House of Commons (which they have commanded me to declare) to make them more certaine and particular by preparatory Examinations to be taken with the helpe of your Lordships house, as in the Case of my Lord of <hi>Strafford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall now runne through them with a light touch, onely marking in every of them some speciall points of venome, viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and malignity.</p>
            <p n="1">1 The first Article (my Lords) doth containe his endeavour to introduce into this Kingdome an Arbitrary power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without any limitations or Rules
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29612:11"/>
of Law. This (my Lords) is against the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Kings person, the honour of his Crowne, and most destructive to his people.</p>
            <p>Those Causes which are most perfect have not onely a power to produce effects, but to conserve and cherish them. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary vertue, and the Nutritive vertue in vegetables, doe produce from the same principles. It was the defect of Justice, the restrayning of oppression and violence that first brought government into the World, and set up Kings, the most excellent way of Government. And by the maintenance of Justice all kindes of government receive a sure foundation and establishment. It is this that hath in it an ability to preserve and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the royall power of Kings, yea, to adorn and increase it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the second Article, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships may observe absolute and unlimited power, defended by Preaching, by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and other discourses, printed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished upon that subject. And truely (my Lords) it seemes to be a prodigious crime, that the Trueth of God, and his holy Law should be perverted to defend the lawless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29612:11"/>
of men. That the holy and sacred function of the Ministery, which was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for instruction of mens soules in the wayes of God, should bee so abused, that the Ministers are become the trumpets of sedition, the promoters and defenders of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and oppression.</p>
            <p n="3">3 In the third Article (my Lords) you have the Judges, who under his Majestic are the dispersers and distributers of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, frequently corrupted by feare and solicitation; you have the course of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the execution of it, shamefully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed. And if a willfull Act of injustice in a Judge bee so high a crime in the esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Law, as to deserve death; under what burthen of guilt doth this man lye, who hath beene the cause of great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of such voluntary and wilfull Acts of unjustice.</p>
            <p>In the fourth Article, he will bee found in his owne Person to have sold Justice in Causes depending before him. And by his wicked counsell, endeavouring to make his Majesty a Merchant of the same commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, onely wi<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h this difference, that the King by taking money for places of Judicature,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29612:12"/>
should sell it in grosse; whereas the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop sold it by retalle.</p>
            <p n="5">5 In the fifth Article, there appeares a power ufurped of making Canons; of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obligations on the Subjects in the nature of Lawes: and this power abused to the making of such Canons as are in the matter of them very pernicious, being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Prerogative of the King, and the liberty of the People. In the manner of pressing of them, may be found fraud and shuffling: in the conclusion, violence and constraint; Men being forced by terrour and threatning to subscribe to all: which power thus wickedly gotten, they laboured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish by perjury, injoyning such an Oath for the maintenance of it, as can neither be taken nor kept with a good conscience.</p>
            <p n="6">6 In the sixt Article, you have the King robbed of his Supremacy: you have a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall power exercised over his Majesties Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in their consciences, and in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: You have Ecclesiasticall jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on claimed by an Incident right, which the Law declares to proceed from the Crowne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:29612:12"/>
And herein your Lordships may observe that those who labour in civill matters to set up the King above the Lawes of the Kingdome, do yet in Ecclesiasticall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters endevour to set up themselves above the King. This was first procured by the Archbishop to be extrajudicially: declared by the Judges, and then to be published in a Proclamation. In doing whereof he hath made the Kings Throne but a footstoole for his owne and their pride.</p>
            <p n="7">7 You have (my Lords) in the seventh Article, Religion undermined and subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: you have Popery cherished and defended: you have this seconded with power and violence, by severe punishment upon those which have opposed this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous intention: and by the subtile and eager prosecution of these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ecclesiasticall Commissioners, of the Starre. Chamber and Councell Table beene often made sub servient to his wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
            <p>My Lords,</p>
            <p n="8">8 You may observe in the eight Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle great care taken to get into his owne
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29612:13"/>
hand the power of nominating to Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Livings and promotions: you have as much mischievous, as much wicked care taken in the disposing of these preferments, to the hinderance and corruption of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. And by this meanes (my Lords) the Kings facred Majesty, instead of Sermons, fit for spirituall inftructours, hath often had invectives against his people, incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to injustice, or to the overthrow of the Lawes. Such Chaplaines have beene brought into his service, as have as much as may bee laboured to corrupt his owne Houshold, and beene eminent examples of corruption to others; which hath so farre prevailed, as that it hath exceedingly tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Universities, and beene generally disperst to all the chiefe Cities, the greatest Towner and Auditories of the Kingdome. The grievous effects whereof is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to the Commons House, there being divers hundred complaints there depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the House against scandalous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; and yet (I beleeve) the hundred part of them is not yet brought in.</p>
            <p n="9">9 The ninth Article sets out the like care to have Chaplaines of his owne, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29612:13"/>
might bee promoters of this wicked and trayterous designe: Men of corrupt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of corrupt practice, extreamely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to superstition: And to such mens cares hath beene committed the Lycensing of Bookes to the Presse; by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many have beene published that are full of falshood, of scandals; such as have beene more worthy to be burnt by the hand of the Hangman in Smithfield (as I thinke one of them was) then to be admitted to come into the hands of the Kings people.</p>
            <p n="10">10 In the tenth Article it will appeare, how he having made these approaches to Popery, comes now to close and joyne more neerely with it; hee confederates with Priests and Jesuites; Hee, by his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments negotiates with the Pope at Rome, and hath correspondence with them that be authorized from Rome here. He hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a Romane Hierarchie to be set up in this Kingdome. And though he hath beene so carefull that a poore man could not goe to the neighbour parish to heare a Sermon, when he had none at home; cou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not have a Sermon repeated, nor prayer used in his owne Family, but hee was a fit subject for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29612:14"/>
the High Commission Court, yet the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath beene done in all parts of the Realme, and no notice taken of it, by any Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Judges or Courts.</p>
            <p>My Lords,</p>
            <p n="11">11 You may perceive Preaching suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the eleventh, divers godly and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Ministers oppressedin their persons and Estates: you have the Kings loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects banished out of the Kingdome, not as <hi>Elimeleck,</hi> to seeke for bread in forraigne Countries, by reason of the great scarcity which was in Israel; but travelling abroad for the bread of life, because they could not have it at home, by reason of the spirituall Famine of Gods Word, caused by this man and his partakers. And by this meanes you have had the trade, the Manufactury, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of many thousands of his Majesties subjects carried out of the Land.</p>
            <p>It is a miserable abuse of the spirituall Keyes, to shut up the doores of heaven, and to open the gates of hell; to let in prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ignorance, superstition, and errour. I shall need say no more: These things are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and abundantly knowne to all.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:29612:14"/>
12 In the twelfth Article (my Lords) you have a division endeavored betweene this and the forraigne reformed Churches. The Church of Christ is one Body, and the Members of Christ have a mutuall relation, as members of the same body. Unity with Gods true Church every where is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beauty, but the strength of Religion: of which beauty and strength he hath sought to deprive this Church by his manifold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to breake this union. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he hath suppressed the priviledges granted to the Dutch and French Churches. Hee hath denyed them to be of the same Faith and Religion with us; and many other wayes hath he declared his malice to those Churches.</p>
            <p n="13">13 In the thirteenth Article, as he hath sought to make an Ecclesiasticall division, or religious difference between us and forraign Nations, so he hath sought to make a civill difference betweene us and his Majesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Kingdome of Scotland. And this hee hath promoted by many innovations, there prest by himselfe and his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when they were uncapable of such alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29612:15"/>
He advised his Majestie to use vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence. He hath made private and publike Collections towards the maintenance of the warre; which he might justly call his owne warre. And with an impudent boldnesse hath struck Tallies in the Exchequer for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers sums of money, procured by himselfe, <hi>pro defensione Regni;</hi> when by his counsels the King was drawne to undertake not a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, but an offensive warre.</p>
            <p n="14">14. He hath lastly, thought to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his party, by seeking to undermine Parliaments; and thereby hath laboured to bereave this Kingdome of the Legislative power, which can onely be used in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and that we should bee left a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome without that which indeed makes and constitutes a Kingdome; and is the onely Meane to preserve and restore it from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers and decayes. He hath hereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to bereave us of the highest Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory; such a Judicatory, as is necessary and essentiall to our government. Some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses cannot be tried in any inferiour Court; as divers Cases of Treason, and others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Prerogative of the Crowne, and liberty of the People. It is the supreame
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29612:15"/>
Iudicatory to which all difficult Cases resort from other Courts. He hath sought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the King of the Love and Councell of his People, of that assistance which hee, might have from them; and likewise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the People of that reliefe of grievances which they most humbly expect from his Majesty.</p>
            <p>My Lords,</p>
            <p>The Parliament is the Cabbinet wherein the chiefest lewels both of the Crowne and Kingdome are deposited. The great Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the King, and the liberty of the People are most effectually exercised and maintained by Parliaments. Here (my Lords) you cannot passe by this occasion of great thankes to God and his Majesty for passing the Bill whereby the frequent course of Parliaments is established; which I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my selfe, he will by experience finde to bee a strong foundation both of his honour, and of his Crowne.</p>
            <p>This is all (my Lords) I have to say to the particulars of the <hi>Charge.</hi> The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons desire your Lordships that they may have the same way of Examination that they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29612:16"/>
had in the Case of the Earle of <hi>Strafford:</hi> That is, to examine members of all kindes, of your Lordships House and their owne, and others, as they shall see cause. And those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations to be kept secret and private, that they may with more advantage be made use of, when the matter comes to tryall.</p>
            <p>They have declared that they reserve to themselves the power of making Additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Articles; by which they intend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his <hi>Charge</hi> to be more particular and certaine, in respect of the severall times, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and other circumstances of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences therein Charged. And that your Lordships would be pleased to put this Cause in such a quicke way of proceeding, that these great and dangerous Crimes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the offendors, may be brought to a just Judgement.</p>
