         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>In the 17. yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne, <hi>Anno</hi> 1574. there was one man and 10. women judged to be burned for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anabaptists, but after much suit made one woman recanted and all the rest were banished.

            <head>Brownists.</head>
            <p>This Sect sprung from one named <hi>Brown,</hi> who is of that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that many (yet alive) did know him when hee was a Schoole-master to the Free Schoole in Saint <hi>Olaves</hi> in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke:</hi> This man <hi>(Browne)</hi> in his browne study, did plod to preach, and did practise and exercise in Woods, thickets, fields and under hedges, to a great many of poore people, whom hee seduced to be as wise as himselfe: hee said that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not a Church (perhaps his meaning was it was not a true Church) but when he was preferred to the Benefice of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage in <hi>Northamptonshire,</hi> the parish being called <hi>A Church,</hi> then the Church of <hi>England</hi> was a Church with him, and his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Church of <hi>A Church,</hi> was a conformable and a true Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicell Church, and he lived till within these 7 yeares there, and dyed a conformable church man, but he hath left a most perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and seditious traine of his sect behind him, of all trades, ages, sexes, and conditions, and when all trades faile they can make a shift to be all preachers</p>
            <p>Amongst all these hereticks and heresies, sects and sectaries, and schismatickes, I have not medled or mentioned the Puritan. the reason is, that I doe not know any that either deserves or dares to take the name or title of Puritan upon them.</p>

It is an Epithite of reproach, which rash or malitious men do cast upon many persons who do strive to live in Gods fear, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to dye in his favour, and it is likewise a name which covers a great deal of craft and villany under the veil and vizard of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall sincerity, and my opniion is, that if there be any that are to be so called, they must be such <hi>Romane Catholicks</hi> that doe presume to be saved by their own good works, which pure, most impure, Doctrine is one of the grounds and Tenent of the popish Religion, and of no Church else in the world, so that my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is that none deserves the name of a Puritan, but such as dare presume by their purity to save themselves and others: Thus have I briefly shewed that the Church of Christ hath in all ages been opposed and oppressed by Heretiques and Schismaticks, I could name many more opinions of men, who were all great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lights in the Church, and most illustrious instruments for the advancement of Christian Relig<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But in these times the Church and Church-Government is not only shaken, but shattered in pieces, almost for nothing else but outward indifferent Ceremonies, such as in themselves see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med offencelesse Hand-maids for their order and decency, to wait and attend the Church as Ornaments, and not for supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Adoration These shaddows have not only bin with violence pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have read that the <hi>Grand Senior,</hi> or great <hi>Turk</hi> at <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> did demand due of an <hi>English Ambassadour,</hi> this question, Quoth he, if I would be a Christian, there are so many sorts and sects of them, which Christian should I be, to whom the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And it is to be wondered at the many unlicenced licentious Pamphlets that have been scattered about the Kingdome within these 23. months, wherein neither Religion, Church, King, Peeres, Priest, or people have escaped Railing, Libelling, and transcendent traducing, so that it may be supposed, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per that hath beene wasted by those pestiferous pamphleteeres, would goe neere (if it were laid sheet by sheet) to cover the whole Kingdome; and this is certaine, that they have drawne many thousands of poore idle people from all parts of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> where without serving any Apprentiship, they take a freedom to sell Bookes, so that the Book-sellers are encreased ten fold in number within these two yeares: And what stuffe doe they sell (for sooth) things New Lye come forth and things either of no worth, or else Speeches fathered upon men that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew of them, or Newes out of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver night in an Ale-house, and printed in the morning <hi>Cum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilegio,</hi> 1642. then are the streetes embroidered with lyes, lice, and Beggers, to the great abuse of true Writers, the scandall of this Honourable Citie of <hi>London,</hi> and the universall injury to the whole Kingdome, for that such numberlesse numbers of lyes and Fables are scattered and disperst (not ouely here in our owu Couutrey, but in all parts else they are transported over the Christian World.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Booke of Errours and Heresies, seeing there have beene, are, and will be such to the end of the world, and that amongst all these wayes there is but one Right way. It is a griefe to any Christian heart to consider how many thousands

            <p>So that some men are jeered out of true and sincere Religion, for feare of being called <hi>Puritans,</hi> and too many have laid by all Order, Manners, and Decencie in the Church, because they will not be accounted <hi>Papists.</hi>

            <p>Besides all these wayes of Heresie (which are all out of Gods way) let us consider the infinite numbers of Atheists, Heathens, Pagans, Jewes, Turkes, Infidels, and divellish Idolators, that are upon the Face of the Earth; If these things be but ponders in a mans heart that feares God, it will strike terrour and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement into him, to consider how little service the Almighty hath from Ingratefull mankinde, for that he by his power, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Mercie, made all, conserves all, and Redeemed all true Beleevers, yet for all these Alls, that good God hath not the tithe of halfe, either in meere thankfulnesse or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement.</p>
