            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Verſe and Text, (Right Honourable, Right Worſhipfull, Worſhipfull, and the reſt Beloved) without Preface or Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, are nothing elſe but Gods charge by his Prophet, to them who were to give a charge to others; and his holy direction to them, who under him were appointed to give both Correction and Direction unto others.</p>
            <p>In the words be pleaſed, I beſeech you to obſerve with me theſe three Generall Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you are given to conſider of the Perſons dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: Set downe by their Title, <hi>They are called Iudges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, you are to take notice of their appellative Reſtriction, or reſtrictive Appellation; which, you may be pleaſed to call their Circuit, or place for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Authority. In that they are called, <hi>Iudices terrae, Iudges of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, there is to be conſidered, the Direction, or Charge it ſelfe which is given; and that is, <hi>To be Inſtructed.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>Be Inſtructed, yee Iudges of the Earth.</q>
            <p>The Point then upon which we are firſt to enter, and by Gods aſſiſtance and your gentle patience to handle,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3557:5"/>
is touching the perſons directed, here in the Text, called <hi>Iudges.</hi> The Prophet <hi>David,</hi> having in ſome foregoing verſes, ſpoken of the power and Majeſty of the Son of God, &amp; declared how able he is to take vengeance on all thoſe who ſhould dare to oppoſe him in his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie; Now fearing that he ſhould chiefly meet with reluctance in Kings &amp; Iudges, as if becauſe they being Higher Powers, ſhould chiefly preſume to oppoſe the Higheſt of Powers: Or otherwiſe, well knowing of what force the ſilent Rhetorick of the Paternes of great Perſonages is, either in perſwading to good, or in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading from evill, he principally directs his ſpeech to them, willing them to learne, and learning to know, and knowing, to acknowledge the Supremacie of the Son of God, and <hi>To ſerve the Lord in feare,</hi> as it follows in the beginning of the next verſe, whereupon in the Concluſion wee muſt alſo touch.</p>
            <p>I hope and preſume, that I am not in the midſt of a Maſterleſſe and lawleſſe Anabaptiſticall Auditory; a Sect, that with might aad maine ſtrives to ſtrike off the head of Government, and would frame the body of Men, like the body of <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> without an eye, or make it like the confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of old, that it be, <hi>Rudis indigeſta<expan>

                  </expan> moles.</hi> So that I ſhould need to ſtand much to prove the lawfulnes of Kings and Iudges, and how that there ought to be a Superiority amongſt the Sons of Men. If I ſhould go no further than the words here of the Prophet, we find <hi>God</hi> no way condemning them for being Kings and Iudges, neither doth hee wiſh and will them to leave theſe the places of their Dignity, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeeks to put them in mind of their Duty: <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O yee Kings,</hi> &amp;c. How Lawfull and Laudable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3557:5"/>
it is that there ſhould be Kings and Iudges, Counſellors and Magiſtrates; yea, and how neceſſarily it ſtands with the good of the Common-wealth, Scripture confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and Experience confirmeth.</p>
            <p>Whilſt wee ſee God in the very firſt Creation of the World, obſerving order, and eſtabliſhing a Superiority amongſt his Creatures, willing <hi>The greater Light to rule</hi>

            <p>Kings and Iudges there then are, Kings and Iudges there ought to bee, the law of God proves it, and the good of the Common wealth approves of it; Iudges you are, and Iudges you are of God; you receive your warrant from God, as you receive your Commiſſion from the King. It well becomes you to be moſt faithful to both: as you are of God, ſo in ſome ſenſe, you are even called Gods. I am ſure that your judgement is called the Lords judgement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 17. And you are ſaid, as <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> ſpoke to his Judges, to <hi>judge, not for</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:3557:7"/>
               <hi>man, but for the Lord;</hi> and the Lord hath promiſed to be with you in the judgement.</p>
            <p>Behold then, and conſider what a neere relation God hath to you; and you to God; what ſhall I then in the firſt place ſay, but as Gods Judges, to put on Gods courage, not to feare the face of men, to learne of God, not to have reſpect of perſons in judgement. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Gods preſence was that which gave boldneſſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and to many other godly governors. Doe as they did, and you may in ſome meaſure expect to partake of that favour which they found. Chriſtian courage in the heart of a Judge or Magiſtrate, is that which helpes to put life into thoſe Lawes, which are ready to languiſh for want of due and diſcreet execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What are men in Authoritie more ſure to meet with, than diſtempered and refractory ſpirits, who hate to be reformed, and think that they may ſinne without controule; and if ever ſinne hath gotten head, and were countenanced both with might and multitude, ſurely now: and therefore, when more than now, doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Judges to bee men of courage? It was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miſterie, that the ſteps to <hi>Salomons.</hi> Throne were ſupported by Lyons; what better might the Embleme or morall thereof bee, but to intimate, that a Lyon-like courage becomes ſuch as ſit in the Seat of Judicature and Judgement? And let it ever be eſteemed an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of a Rulers honour, that he dare be juſt in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, whilſt others will be unjuſt in ſinning; and that hee dare to vſe his power, whileſt they will dare to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe theirs. <hi>Iob</hi> that holy man may very well ſerve <note place="margin">Iob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 29. 19.</note>as a patterne to all godly Magiſtrates, who was able to affirme this of himſelfe, that <hi>Hee did not ſtick to breake</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3557:7"/>
               <hi>the jawes of the wicked, and to pull the prey out of their teeth.</hi> And why ſhould not every Judge and Juſtice, having Gods aſſurance of aſſiſtance, arme himſelfe with an holy obſtinacy, and learne to preferre Iuſtice before the favour and frownes of the ſtouteſt evill doer, becomming friends to all, as they become friends to Juſtice? yea, what more procures credit to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the unpartiall execution of Authoritie, when great Offendors are forced to feele the ſmart of great offences? As God knowes no honour, no royaltie, no greatneſſe in the matter of ſinne: no more may his Deputies. Connivence at the rebellion of the Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is that which cutts the very ſinewes of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; neither doth any thing helpe to make Lawes more contemptible, than the making difference of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors, that ſmall treſpaſſes ſhould bee puniſhed, when great ones are permitted to ride in triumph: when that old Complaint comes againe to bee in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, that the Lawes are made like unto Cobwebbs, wherein the leſſer Flies are onely taken, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe uſually breake through, who will not dare at length to ſweepe them downe.</p>
            <p>The intention of the Law is an univerſall Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; now the Magiſtrate hee is tearmed <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a living Law; and how ſhall hee goe through in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different adminiſtration of Juſtice, unleſſe that whileſt hee puts on the place of a Magiſtrate, hee put off the perſon of a Friend, and goe right on, like the Sunne in the Zodiacke, with unreſiſted violence? Say not then when God, a good Conſcience, a good Cauſe, and the Law tells you, that heere is Juſtice to be executed againſt a great perſon offending, as <hi>Salomons</hi> ſluggard

            <p>Againe in the ſecond place, Iudges yee are; Gods owne mouth you ſee here honours you with this Title; now what doth more ſympathize, or as I may ſo ſay, ſynonamize with Judges, than Juſtice? So that the very Title of Judges ought to be a continuall remembrancer of that vertue which ſhould be a perpetuall companion of your places. What can be more peculiar to a Judge, than Juſtice?

            <p>Right Honourable you are called Iudges, Right Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipfull you are called and ſworne to be Iuſtices, give, I beſeech you, not me leave, but God, in whoſe place I ſtand here, as you your ſelves are ſhortly to ſit elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to put you in minds of what God tells me doth become you: Hath God conferred theſe places of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence upon you? <hi>Non datur beneficium niſi propter officium,</hi> Dignity calls for and commandes duty, and to whom much is given, of them much ſhall be required. Know therefore that next to the prayers of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous there is no more acceptable ſacrifice to God then the upright adminiſtration of Iuſtice, the blood of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours ſhed by lawfull authority, is no doubt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the moſt high God: Governours doe even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of thoſe ſinnes which they ſeeke not to reforme by Iuſtice: what better ſight in any ſtate then to ſee an impudent Malefactour ledd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the place of deſerved execution. There Death may perhapps ſeeme harſh to ſome, but we muſt learne of God to know, that there is as well a puniſhing mercy as a mercifull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and curſed be that mercy that provokes to anger the God of mercy; It comes to far ſhort God knowes of Iuſtice, when Magiſtrates ſhall dare to humour the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Sinnes, this is not with <hi>Moſes</hi> to make up

the gapp and breach betweene God and us, but to make it greater by connivence. Sinne we know is ready by every ſmall approbation to take heart, but if authority once ſeeme to countenance it, and will not puniſh it through fooliſh pitty, it will ſoone learne to grow impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. As therefore you tender Gods glory, your fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to your Soveraigne, the Countries peace, and your owne Comfort, ſuffer not, I beſeech you, the great and outragious ſinnes of theſe Northerne parts to paſſe with a bare giving of them in Charge, or to eſcape with a Slender reproofe. Thus to doe, is onely to ſhave that head, which deſerves by Iuſtice to be cut off; this is like to a weake doſis that moves, but removes not the corrupt humours in the ſtomacke, it is a breach of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice not to proportionate the puniſhment according to the Sinne.</p>
            <p>Againe give me leave yet once more to touch vpon your title: Such as are Iudges have there name from there office, <hi>nomen ab officio convenienter habent:</hi> Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they are ſo called, for that it is there office to judge; now, who knowes not that Iudging doth imply a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate action? So that it will be required that to right Iudging there goe along ſerious conſideration, and mature deliberation, that nothing be done raſhly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be effected<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unadviſedly. And as you are Gods Iudges, it may well become you to learne this manner and Method of proceeding even from God himſelfe, who in the Sentencing of ſinners went no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately to worke: when our firſt Parents had ſinned, GOD firſt enters into parley with them, ere that he give them their deſerved Doome; ſo likewiſe hee examines and queſtions <hi>Cain</hi> before hee doth
