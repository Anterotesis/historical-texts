            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OVR M. gaue intelligence vnto a gentleman of Middelburgh, of a prelates diſgracing of my poore ſelf: vvhich thing cauſed him ſome ſadnes; &amp; my ſelf more. He demaunded of your highnes no cenſure touching me: but thinking that he lerned more ſubſtance of divinity in a short conference, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in 64. yeres afore (as it pleaſed him to ſay,) procured me before I vvas vvare a great ſtipend to profeſſe yf I vvould: &amp; alſo vvrote to knovv vvhether you vvould employ me in England or like that elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhere others should: &amp; knevv that it vvas againſt all Chriſtianity &amp; the peace of life, to cenſure any that ſeeke no preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yf they requited like greefe, much diſgrace vvould be ſpred, vvhere amity should beare the ſvvay. In his grief he replyed vpon the prelate: as vpon one not knovving the ſeaſoning of his tongue in honeſty: &amp;, by hinderance of the beſt paynes for mans good, bent vnto the ruine of the Kingdome. Your M. beſt kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth his vvhole hart, by his Letters. The Letter of the prelates tongue vvhetted too sharp, he gaue me: to reply for my ſelf, as I thought meeteſt. The party I knevv by the ſpeach: &amp; shevved him the very ſyllabes: I think your M. looketh that I should avvnſvver: &amp; not ſuffer you to be led amyſſe by him.

il affected vnto the knovvledge of ſalvation: &amp; he &amp; his family alone are avvonder to the Lerned; noted the only that could not afford me good vvordes; vvhoſe penne &amp; tongue (as they ſay) hath cauſed the vvhole nation, to be better ſpoken of. Your M. may remember vvhat he ſayd of the litle book that drevv all the Scripture vnto Chriſt. &amp; shevved the vſe of every parcell, from the begining to the End: &amp; called thither all kindes of Faſtern &amp; vveſtern opening ſtil vvhere they erred, euen by them ſelves: carying half a skore of ſeuerall moſt hard &amp; needful ſtudies thither, &amp; examining all auctours not only in their ovvne tongues but by theyr ovvne veyne &amp; courſe of ſtudy. The praelat ſayd to your highnes that it conteyned but the curious quirkes of an yong head. vvhere as yf he had ſtudyed 31. y<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ever ſince he vvas Doctor, hovv in one ſpeach to shevv him ſelf extremely voyd of all grounds of Lerning, &amp; of all conſcience for the truth: and of all care vvhoſe eares to infect vvith Atheiſm, the Tempter could hardly cary him <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>This old ſpech might ſone tell, yf any prelate miſuſed your M. eares extremely, vvho the party should be. for hardly vvil one nation bring tvvo of his mind and hart: confident to condemne vvhat he knovveth by his bare Latin ſtudies no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a babe: &amp; extremely bent to hinder the good of his ovvne religion.

VVhether I be to lerne mild vvriting of him, his vvorkes peſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vvith diſgraces compared vvith my Epiſtle to the LL. vvil shevv ſufficienly. This Spirit, &amp; that, uttered to your M. vvill argue one &amp; the ſame ſoule: that I may vvel knovv vvhat prelate your M. meaned. Daniel cometh forth by the prelates better aduiſe, &amp; auctoriſing: &amp; my paynes is dedicated to the LL. of your M. moſt honorable privy couſel, to be regarded according to the ſage honour of your M. governement. They all ſaving he ſent me ſeueral vvord of ſpecial favour: &amp; ſome of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued that I had made the Bible as clear as any other book: &amp; ſayd that vvhat ſoeuer I vvould it should be done for me: vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I vvrote a requeſt by a M. of that faculty, that theyr Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippes vvold move your M. ether to recompenſe my longe paynes after great old promiſes, or, to giue me leaue to goe to the King of Scotland. Thence I had ſure promeſſe of greate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe vpon bare copies not dedications of my paynes: &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular helpe offred to put forth the Bible in ſuch playnneſſe, that a vvhol nation might ſoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> underſtand it: &amp; ſee the glory &amp; certe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. Thither I returned avvnſvver: that I vvold no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerſerve your M. if I vvere not recompenſed by fiue monethes end, by the begining of Lent. The LL. ſent me by D. Ceſar this anſvver: that they thought my ſtudies not inferiour for iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to any in England: &amp; they bade me tell D. Ceſar vvhat I vvould haue, that he might moue your M. &amp; they further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe your highnes. I returned my mind: that your M. should be my chooſer: &amp; that I vvold like beſt of that vvhich you appointed for me.

<pb facs="tcp:15216:4"/>
your M, to ſee the clear certenty of Divinity, bicauſe you vvould ſo litle regard his bare Latin ſtudies. This theyr mynd vvas she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vved me: And vvheras they meant to haue moved your M. to beſtovv on me the charge of London (vvich he meant for D. Ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft) &amp; this vvas noyſed by the clarks of the counſel; it vvas more talked that the Archb. vvould vvork him ſelf any diſgrace to hinder my being ſo nere occaſion to open the Bible to your ſelf: thus it pleaſed them to ſay, &amp; think: In ſo much that a Bacheler of Divinity of Ripon, vvho knevv the Lords purpoſe for me: &amp; his, againſt me; &amp; my reſolution vpon his next iniury to leave your governement, vvent to Lambeth for good vvil to aduiſe him better: But he could not haue fit talk vvith him; by reaſon that he vvas moved by ſome other, to ſome heate, and afore he could goe again to him, he brak out as it vvas expected. This shevveth moſt certenly vvho the prelate should be. For as this dealing is ſtranger then lightly should befala man of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though all honeſty vvere ſet aſyde: So the ſame man should be the likeſt to embreath into your M. the ſpeach ſo deadly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Gentleman vvhom you made Iudge of that vvhich you bad S. Iohn St. vvrite vnto him. That your M. may better mark the ſtrange contemt of trueth in the Archb. &amp; his boldenes in other matters, as that, vvhich the ſpech mentioned, vvas cenſured: I muſt briefly tell againſt vvhat dealings he brake out openly.</p>
            <p>As I vvayted, vpon the LL. leaſure, to move your M. for me, in ſad vvether of vvinter, I vvas vehemently requeſted by Lerned &amp; Zealous Chriſtians to aſſemble the People, by my preaching, to pray for better vvether. VVhich vve &amp; others prayed for, &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned: &amp; many marked the meanes, &amp; the event. In thoſe ſermons I choſe Scriptures to open, vvhich Latin oryet Greek ſtudies never opened; being ſo very familiar to all Hebrevves, that none of the Apoſtles age &amp; nation vvold ſtagger in them. S. Stephens oration Act. 7. is of this tenour: ſpeaking in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes

Him I expounded to the hearers confort: that they might better like of your governement, for that in your dayes Scripture vvas more cleared then 1500. yeres afore. And thoſe poinctes I had printed afore to your M. &amp; found great thankes then, from Zurick, the French, Dutch, Denmark, Scotland, &amp; others. And yf it pleaſe your highnes to try your Archb. lerning, I dare aſſure you that all his latin ſtudies vvill never expound S. Stephe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: to tell vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhat lavv of Moſes he vvas called into iudgement: by vvhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Scripture the miracle of his face vvas to be like an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: hovv he frameth calling of Abraham from VR. hovv Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs family can have 75. ſoules, &amp; but 70. in Moſes: hovv the Speach of the burial in Abrahams purchaſe can be true: by vvhat ground he affirmeth that the Patriarches bones vvere caryed out of Egypt, &amp; buryed in Sychem: &amp; hovv our enemies graunt this true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Likevviſe for Moſes age of 40. yeres in Pharoes court: vvhat vvarant he had: vvhat authours allovvable to all Ievves vve haue for that: Hovv Rempham can ſtand in Amos, a propre name: vvhere the text is Chiun: &amp; Babylon for Damaſcus, by the like vvarrant: &amp; to vvhat poinct of his accuſation his oration belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth: &amp; vvhy he endeth in Solomons temple: &amp; vvho but he ſayd that VR vvas in Meſopotamia: or vvho but Philo the Greek ſayd thad Abraham vvas called after his fathers death.

in meaning, ſure, by enemies graunt, deſerveth better acceptation for ground of ſtudy, far from phantaſies. Although my trauel in this kind might have moved the Archb. to favour my paynes ſo much as the temporal Lords did for clearing Daniel by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then for ſtory: for his chief Queſtion, by Nathan the Prophet 2. Sam. 7. Which none of his Latines or yet Greeks, I trovv, haue done: for his tvvo tongues, by plain reaſons, but neuer marked, as I iudge, by any, ſaving one levv: although my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence might haue ſtirred his Love, it ſtirred only his enuy: and dayly it vvas noyſed hovv he meant to defeate the LL. purpoſe: ſo that tvvo gentlemen conferred touching his courſe: &amp; the one ſayd: Shall I tell the Bishop that he taketh an vnhonorable courſe. The other avvnſvvered: No. The Bishop vvill but mock. This vvil not be ſtrange to the Archb. for I vvrot it vnto him ſelf: that he might conſyder vvhat a goodly thrid he had ſpun that hauing receaued 50000. poundes of the Church is counted but a skopher in the greateſt matters.

My opinion herein I printed to the Lerned nobility, &amp; inferior gentry: VVho, ſome of them vvrote to Baſil that no humane paynes vvold ouermatch a ful treatiſe in the ſame tenour. Againſt this the Archb. brake out to open rage: vvith his bare commentary Latin, the plague of Divinity: &amp; not vvorth one yeres ſtudy of tvventy, that the Bible vvil require.

For I knevv that God called our long difference for Diuinity into the open iudgement of the vvorld, &amp; in this matter he had ſayd to one M.

               </gap> that to deſcend to hel vvas, true of a ſoule gone vp to heauen, vvold catch the bare Latiniſt. But I ſlayed in the realme till he vvold break out into ſome open action: that he could not aftervvardes deny his proceding. He bare the high commiſſioners in hand, as D. Ceſar &amp; D.

<pb facs="tcp:15216:6"/>
the LL. haue read it, &amp; requeſted me to lay the blame vpon his man: but others ſayd that the high shirif muſt anſvver for the vndershirfs faultes.

And I ſent vnto him ſelf a copy: &amp; further matter hovv his vnlernednes brought your M. auctority vnto manifeſt Atheiſme &amp; moſt ſenſeles, againſt your ovvne good. Then he yelded: vvith great promiſes, yf I vvould but acknovvledge them that vvold be my frendes. Alſo he ſayd that he ſent for me but to anſvver D. Andrevves for the deſcent to Hell. He might haue requeſted me, &amp; I vvould haue ſatisfied him: But to betray your M. auctority to be a ſlave to Hereſy: that vvould not be good, nor ſemely for me. As he ſent me this vvord: I vvrote from Leyden in Holland that I vvould defende myne opinion in Cambridge: yf he vvould hazard his fame vpon any that should reply. At that he raged vvith termes that the meſſenger lothed to report: Leſt I should pay his vnlernednes vvith as good. Therupon I vvrote an Epiſtle to the Lerned nobility shevving hovv through all the Bible (vvherin one errour ſtayneth al) he ſuffred bad notes: to bring errours a thouſand at once: To make all the Credite of Moſes &amp; the Prophetes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vvorth: &amp; there in I anſvver his heat: VVherin he vvill burn in this opinion that Chriſt deſcended to Gehenna. Novv my L. treaſorer S. VVilliam Cecil asked him vvhat further matter he had to hinder theyr purpoſe. Then this he invented: that I vvrote vntruly that he determined betvvixt D.

Thus I reaſon. Edvv. the ſixt and his ſubiects held that Chriſt' his ſoule neuer vvent to Gehenna: The Q. &amp; her ſubiectes ſet vp religion in the ſame ſenſe: as all the firſt parlement vvil shevv: Therfore the Q &amp; all her good ſubiects mean to die in this fayth that Chriſt vvent preſently hence to Paradiſe.

Yf your G. vvold take leaſure to think but vpon this much: you vvould never more think of Gehennaes HEL: to burn in defenſe, that Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending his ſoule vnto the father, had preſently that lodging: but that his deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to Hell vvas in our later la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, (later then Iacob: at the firſt vſe 1600. yeres) going vp into heavens ioyes vnto the Kingdom of Heauen. Next Geneſis, Iob is the moſt ancient: VVho both lived before Moſes, &amp;, as may be geſſed, about tvventy yeare after him: Liuing 140. yeares after his affliction: afflicted vvhen Satan moſt bragged of General conqueſt. VVhich vvhen it vvas, God vvould moſt punish Iſrael. But Iſrael vvas moſt punished vvhen Moſes vvas born a redreſſer. VVherfore Satans triumph &amp; Iobs Patience then ſeem to haue shevved them ſelves. So Iob shalbe found to liue afore &amp; after Moſes. He for his father Abraham &amp; mother Ketura faſtened in the houſe of God: &amp; more then his coſyns Eliphas Iſakides, &amp; Bildad, though of Ketura: This Iob diſputing vvith four Prophets: &amp; being nere the Leaving of this vvorld vvherby the vvorld to come should fitly fall into ſpech, should be the fitteſt to shevv the ſignification of Sheol: ſpecially vvhen God him ſelf cometh moderator of the queſtion &amp; vſeth the like term. Iob ſpeaketh of all men thus: That vvhen vve deſcend to sheol, vve come not euer vp hither: &amp; our place knovveth vs no more. And he vvished that God vvould lay him vp in Sheol: till his change (in the reſurrection) should come: and he loked that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15216:12"/>
Sheol should be his houſe: &amp; that all his hopes should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend vvith the Beer, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> into Sheol. He that vvould ouerreach Iobs ſtyle should need vviſdome: as high as the heauens, deeper then Sheol, longer then the earth, broader then the ſea: &amp; should need his vviſdom: before vvhom Sheol is naked. And in ſpeach of the vvicked: that as heat maketh a riddance of ſnovv: So doth Sheol of ſynnets: He meaneth by his open ſpeach, but theyr riddance hence: as vvhen he commendeth theyr outvvard proſperity: for childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many, &amp; luſty; &amp; for deliting pleaſures, hovv they ſpend theyr dayes in proſperity: and go dovvn to Sheol in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And thus Iob ſpeaketh, to four Prophets of Terahes diverſe families in Arabia. And vvher God moderateth &amp; mentioneth the vvorld to come, he ſayth: Haue the gates of death ben revealed to thee? or canſt thou ſee the gates of the shadovv? That vvhich Iob vvould haue termed Sheol, the Lord termeth death. And thus by Iobs book the controverſy is decided: in Iobs tongue for Sheol a lodging to him ſelf and to all men. Novv ther vvas neuer any book vvritten, ſince the pen became the tongue of a vvriter, of a more curious ſtyle then Iob: in verſe of many ſorts: &amp; vſe of vvords more nyce then any Greek or Latin vvriteth: &amp; for Grammer hath more trickes &amp; difficulty then all the Bible beſide: arabizing much: but fuller of Ebrevve depth in language. God ſavv it needful to honour vvith a ſtyle of al ornaments the particular cauſe of Iob, leſt it should be deſpiſed or thought a fayned matter, And therfore gaue that book a more curious ſtyle then any other part of the Bible hath: &amp; ſuch depth of skill in the tongue as no Rabbin could be thought euer to haue ſuch in the holy tongue. In ſuch a ſtyle <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> &amp; nere conſequent, is often that vvhich vve novv call Heaven. After Iob let vs ſe vvher to deſcend to Hell is vſed, next in time. In Num. 15. the rebellious companies deſcended aliue to Sheol, or Hel: they &amp; all theyr Houſes &amp; ſubſtance deſcended to Sheol. Ther the matter telleth, that Gehenna cannot be meant, but a deſtruction from this vvorld: as in Deut. 32. vvher Moſes prophecyeth of the nations deſtruction &amp; Ieremy tvvice citeth his ſpech: Hovv an anger kindled burneth vnto Sheol. The next place of deſcending to Sheol is in Speach of Anna Samuels mother, hovv she greued long &amp; greatly vvas avveary of her life, &amp; at deaths dore: and ſayth of the Lord: that he cauſeth to deſcend vnto sheol, &amp; yet bringeth vp again. The next deſcending to sheol is in Davids tongue, in Pſal. 55. vvishing Gods enemies a deſtruction hence. Let them deſcend to sheol alive. The phraſe shevveth that he looked vnto Korah &amp; his company, of vvhom, that they all perished for euer, none vvill ſoon determin. And that theyr bodies then vvent to Gehenna: that none vvil ſay. In Davids tongue for tvvo more the cauſe is clear: in ſpeach to Salomon for Ioab: &amp; in the ſame terms for Semei. Thou shalt not ſuffre his old age to deſcend to Sheol in peace: And, thou shalt cauſe his old age to deſcend to Sheol or Hell vvith blood. But nether Ioab nor Semei died out of Gods covenant: nether could Salomon ſend to Eternal deſtruction: nether vvished David that to his ſiſters ſonns nor yet to Semei. And theſe be all the places for 3000. yeares: vvhere deſcending to Hell is vſed: none ſignifiyng Gehenna, directly: but oftener by conſequent that vvich novv
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15216:13"/>
vve call Heaven. And that is moſt evident in Holy Ezekias: in a ſpeach much like: I shall go into the gates of Hell: &amp; ſo forth as I haue printed in myne Epiſtle vvhich you haue. Ther Ezekias hath other Speaches vvhich make this phraſe voyd of all doubt. So in Ezekiel of a mighty kingdom, vvher all vvere given to death: vnto the lovveſt earth; vnto the ſonns of Adam vvhich deſcend vnto the pit often cometh the ſpeach of deſcending to Sheol, for open deſtruction by the K. of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon In Apryes dayes: vvher Eternal deſtruction vvas dayly on Prophane Egypt: &amp; Ezekiel telling of deſcent to Sheol once, tvvice, thrice four times could not Prophecy any nevves: but that vvhich they had ſince the nation vvas. And ſo again one Chapter of Ezekiel, vvold haue reſolued your G. yf you read it, ether in Ebrevv or in Greek, and made you clean of an other mynde. In the Babylonian, ſoone after the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian fall the like ſpeaches haue theyr euent. He vvas the day ſtar: &amp; exalted vnto Heauen: but he vvas cauſed to deſcend, &amp; his pride vvas cauſed to deſcend to Sheol, vvher, as heauen ſignified not the propre heauen, as novv vve ſpeak: nether doth Hel meane the propre HEL, as novv vve ſpeak. And theſe I trovv be all the places vvhere the Credes phraſe: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, cometh in the Scripture, ſaving for Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum Matt. 11. nothing to our Queſtion: vvhere Gehenna is neuer in the direct meaning. So that all Scripture refuſeth to vvarrant you. And yf you ſearch Scheol alone, thinking to defend a nevv made phraſe it vvil help you nothing. In theſe ſenſes it vvil come: for the lovveſt place or caſe in this life: in Amos: yf they dig Sheol, thence my hand shall take them: as yf they goe vp into Heauen, thence I vvill cauſe them to deſcend. In the ſame tenour of ſpeach David afore ſpake: Pſ. 139, But that Hyperbole cannot be applyed hither. Like vnto that is the vvhales belly: a Sheol to Ionas: or the graue. But in ful privation hence it vvil ſignify Death. &amp; in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15216:14"/>
the bodies caſe the graue, and corruption by the povver of death. In the ſoule the ſtate of ſeparation from the body: or the vvorld vnſeene hence. Dauid doth often take it for death: as in Pſ. 18. &amp; 2 Sa. 22. the ſnares of Sheol, death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about. There the matter telleth vvhat muſt be ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: euen ſorovves neare death. For full death, For all the good it cometh it in Pſal. 89. vvhat man liueth that shall not ſee death; vvho can deliuer his ſoule from the Hand of Sheol, or HEL; as generally cometh it in Oſee: Chap. 13. I vvill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme them from Sheol: I vvill deliuer them from death. That S. Paul expoundeth to be meant of the reſurrection of the faithfull bodies; deliuered from corruption. And more often by much doth Dauid vſe the term for the Godly then for the vvicked. So the term alone vvill help nothing. That in Pſ. 16. vvhence our contention began: thou vvilt not leaue my ſoule to Sheol; hath but this ſenſe playne and comon: the vvorld of Soules ſeparated from the body. So generally the Ievves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in that ſenſe: that they held in S. Peters time, and in the Talmud ſtill: that Dauid died not: thincking that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid ſpake of himſelf. S. Peter graunteth that ſpoken of one vvhoſe ſoule left not the body to ſee corruption; as Dauids did by all graunts; and shevveth hovv Dauid ſpake of Chriſt his reſurrection. So 3000 turned to him. Yf he had vvreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the text to Gehenna: he had differed from their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning touching the vvord. As death in the vvicked is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death: ſo euery term of their deſtruction, is Eternall deſtruction. So Sheol may be by a conſequent. But neuer in ſpeach of the Godly: nor in the vvordes force. The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenty tranſlaters conſidering vvhat term in Greek vvas fitteſt to expreſſe Sheol the Ebrevv, they conſidered deeply that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. Dealing moſt ſuerly in the term as all Heathen vvould ſoone conceave their meaning. So about 60 times your G. vvilbe found ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of theyr mind: &amp; oftener of the Ebrevv: of all thoſe textes: of all the matter depending theretvpon: and of all the Septuagintaes iudgment for Greek vvriters betvvixt Homer &amp; Menander, vvho ſeemed to learne of them principles of Gods vnity: and better manners then he himſelf practiſed.

So, as Eſay raiſeth vp an infinite company from Sheol to meet the Chaldean, in Like ſort the Septuagint vvill raiſe againſt you:</p>

               </gap> In plenty: But Hel of Eternal ſorovv vvas no nevves for the Romane emperours: therfore not it, but haſtened death in abundance is there ſignified, as comonly in the old Teſtament in ſpeach of the vvicked. Peter and Paul both citing the 16. Pſalm: &amp; to no further death then that vvhich all muſt feel, tvvo ſuch vvitneſſes should ſetle the matter againſt the beſt renovvmed D. vvho though he vvere exalted to Heauen: He should be brought to Hell, in ſtriving vvith ſuch tvvo champions. And thus all the nevv Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvith all that folovv the Lamb on mount Sion 144. thouſand vvil tel that theyr harpes be tuned as the Prophets: &amp; none of them vſe Hell for a Lodging, after our L: triumph againſt Satan here, &amp; telleth that having performed all that vvas of combat, he gaue vp his ſpirit vnto the father: vvher Satan should never greve it, nor giue it a lodging. And thus for the phraſe through the Scripture: your G. hath as many adverſaries as ever had any man: The ſonnes of Eber to every mothers ſonne: as by records vve may vvell iudge of the vnrecorded ſeing all recorded be vniform. Novv yf your G. think good Let vs examin the vvhole tenour of Moſes ſpeach for the vvorld to come: hovv he hath no term for heaven nor Hell: as you term Hell. Yet maketh the cauſe more plain, then terms vvould in mans ſpeach.

But ther ſilence is for that tenour: therfore it vvas to be, equally, at it is, in all the reſt of the Lavv. There, for keping the Lavv ſtore of fruicts: peace and victories, encreaſe of Children vvith all plenty is

the revvard. Laſtly cometh the ſound revvard: That Gods tabernacle shalbe amongſt his people: and his ſoule vvil not Loth them but he vvilbe theyr God: &amp; they shalbe his people, Here is life euerlaſting, in that they, being ſurely in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, are for euer in the favour of God. On the contrary ſide: for breach of the Lavv: open punishments vpon punishments: and Lothing from God is propounded: ſuch as they felt from Chuzans dayes vnto Bel-esh-zars death, ſtill as they fell to idolatry. And this is the tenour of Moſes. So for the Goſpel: He shevveth that Adam, &amp; all his, shall dy: &amp; that the redemer shalbe pereed in his footſtep, by the Serpent: &amp; shall bruſe to povvder the Serpents head. VVher vve ſee that he shovvs hovv matter opened here shall fully cary a victory, vvhen the percing of the foot is gone ſo far as it could greue. The term <gap reason="foreign">

By this doctrin the Ievves concluded ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that all vvho died holding the covenant, ſtill they dvvelt in Gods tabernacle: and vvho ſo dyed in contempt or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it (as all vvho deſpiſed to Go into the Arck) all they perished for euer: &amp; became Spirits in ptiſon. Novv the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets vvho shevv that the lavv is performed in Chriſt they turn all theſe phraſes vnto the Goſpell as Amos in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: &amp; as David Pſ. 67. vſing the high prieſts bleſſings vvordes: cited in Paules ſalutations, &amp; as Ieremy, often tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of God being our God, cited ſyllably in the Apocalyps.

Here I may record a vvofull matter of a Learned E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brevv: vvho coming vvithin a ſtep of Chriſtianity fell back to Gehenna through your opinion. And alſo I may vſe a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle digreſſion to call you to better attention: and regard of your cariage. Iſaak Ben Arama is that Ievv. One of their beſt Learned, of all that commented vpon Moſes: and vvho condemned all his ovvne ſide, that ſince Ieruſalem vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, they are void of all comfort in their meaning of the Prophets vvhile they look for a third temple: vvheras God preſently deſpiſed both tabernacle and temple to shevv that he vvould reſt onely in Chriſt: as S. Stephen vvitneſſed. This Learned Ebrevv ſeing in Leuiticus 26. the continuall curſes for breaking the Lavv: and the ſtories plaine through all their ages till they loſt their kingdom and found ſlavery in Babylon: and no comfort touching thoſe times but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance there, to come home, as Daniel shevved: and then a promiſe of Chriſt: Ben Arama ſeeing this, cannot tell vvhat to ſay for his ovvne ſide. Then he cometh to vs. And ſaith that Chriſtians from that text accept the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Ieſus. As both the Prophets afore the captiuitie Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Hoſee, Ioel, Amos and Ieremy, and after, Daniel plainly, ioyne Chriſt his ſaluation vnto Leuiticus in that place. This being layd dovvne of him; then, from your ſtore he bringeth a matter that ouerthrovveth all the good, thus: But, ſaith he, the Chriſtians ſay that their Ieſus vve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to Gehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na and fetched thence all the fathers: and that none vvent to Heaven before his death. But that cannot ſtand vvith trueth, that the Prophets Abraham Iſaak and Iacob and Moſes should not be vvith God. Thus Iſaak Ben A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rama,

VVheras in trueth the fathers vvere in Inferis, in Hades, in Sheol, and are yet, by the old Latin, Greek &amp; Ebrevv: and by nevv Ebrevv in paradiſe: vvhether at the firſt they vvent from this vvorld: as I touched, afore.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Here Adam might ſee that Chriſt his vnſpeakeable fear, had ſad heauines according: heavynes that Adams ſonnes ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpized the king of glory: heavines to ſee that they vvould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for ever: heauines that in this vvorld they vvould haue his blood for ever vpon them: heauynes in higheſt meaſure that, (as Eſ. 53. telleth) God caſted on him the ſin of vs all: that the ſoules caſe not the bodies, and thought, &amp; accompt, &amp; feeling for ſoules cauſed ſuch ſorovves as Pſ. 22. being moſt pathetical, could not vtter: vvith Pſ. 55. &amp; the 69. in the higheſt terms of ſorovves that euer could be vttered. Nor Eſay the moſt elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent oratour in Ch. 49. vvhere Chriſt ſadly lamenteth hovv, to many his labour vvas in vain, &amp; he should be the deſpiſed of all ſoules: &amp; the abhorred of nations: &amp; in Ch. 50. though he had the onely tongue to ſeaſon ſpeach &amp; ſilence, he muſt give his back to the vvhippers: his cheekes to the buffeters: his face to the ſpite of ſpitters: &amp; ſeing that in all this they vvould not conſider, but lye in Eternall ſorovv: He that loued man, and euery man more then all the vvomen in the vvorld loued their ovvne children, muſt needs haue infinit pangs for their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

that you neuer examined vpon vvhat ſpeaches Adam held a iudgement for bliſſ &amp; curſe, to the children of God the bliſſe, &amp; to the Serpents brood the curſe in the vvorld to come. Thus I trovv, your opinion tha Chriſt vvas to go to Gehenna, vvil be out of Adams Diuinity: and be found to flovv from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent the father of Lies &amp; the murtherer. Adam knevv the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal loue of God: bego<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n here: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued for euer: &amp; knevv ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings in this vvorld toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of bleſſings for the vvorld to come: but for ſuffrings to the ſoule alone out of this vvorld, to vvin iuſtice &amp; victory againſt Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that Iarreth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Diuinity: vvhich muſt fall vvith in vvords told in Gen. 3. vpon vvhich ground all further diuinity ſtory is built: as Adam knevv that particular ages should haue more ſeuerall remembrances but all to his ſum of faith: So all Sacrifices, Noahs, Abrahams, Moſehs, ſignified a iuſtice vvrought in this vvorld: and none could ſignifie a Gehennean Lodging. Nether Abel crying af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, nor Iſaak in a ſimilitude receaued from death: nor the Scapegoat or birds looſed, nor any thing in all Sacrifices euer could ſignifie a going to Gehenna: ſeing it ſtandeth vpon, not a phraſe or any one term: but a generall rule: That all are dead in Adam; and yf they hold not life by Chriſt, they abide ſtill dead in their ſinnes: ſlaues of the ſerpent: partakers vvith him of infinit vvo from God. Where Moſes ſaith; I kil and I make aliue: In that one place Abenczra vvould haue the reſurrection in open phraſe to be taught. Diuinity vvill ſuffer it: But a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducy vvould not ſo take it: for the vvords may be taken thus: I keep aliue ſome, vvhen I kil others their equals in vigour. The tabernacle of this vvorld, &amp; of the Angels vvorld: and the high Sacrificers bleſſing theſe conteyned a dvvelling vvith God vnli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited: &amp; therfore Eternal: and life in Gods redemtion vvas vvithout limitation: as, Death, in his anger. But for Hell, a place of Deuils: that Moſehs Grammer vvil neuer afford you. As neuer Heauen in propre term, for ſoules; though by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

the Godly naming themſelves pilgrims here, import they looked for a citie vvherof God vvas the Builder. So a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caſe is collected, by conſequent of matter, not by direct term of Heauen. It vvilbe thought ſtrange that your G. a D. &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> should be ignorant of theſe groundes for Diuinity. Novv let vs behold the Prophets, the Hiſtorique, &amp; the other, the commenters vpon Lavv &amp; ſtory. For Ioſua, Iudges, Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, &amp; the Kings, Abigaels ſpeach to Dauid, that his ſoule should be in the band of the Liuing, &amp; Eliahs taking vp: the one for phraſe, the other for action are holden the plaineſt for Heauen. Yet ſome turn Abigaels vvords to a ſafety in Life, through great Dangers: VVhere Saul &amp; his should shorten their dayes. And it is ſure that she ſpake in that ſenſe: that she looked for him to become king: &amp; vvould not be teaching a Prophet aſſurance of Eternal Life: as bringing ovvles to Athens. The Ievves of true religion appearing thrice a year afore the face of God, knevv that vvhen this tabernacle vvas diſſolued, they should haue a dvvelling in the heauens: But ſo ſpake that the vvrangling hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should not ſtumble at their paths. In 2. Sam. 7. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt altogether taught of Life Eternal: though the Speach to this day is taken of Ievves for pompe here. When the Ievves open Policy vvas diſſolued then Daniel in moſt plentiful ſort openeth the Spirituality of Chriſt his kingdom: hovv his Enemies vvere caſt into fire burning vvithout Limitation, that is for euer: And vvhen he shevveth that Antiochus Epiphanes shall beeeaue the Ievves of Earthly comfort, then moſt fitly he comforteth them in the better reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch as reſiſted him: &amp; ſo S.

Your Gehenna came neuer in his mind. The Angel ſent from Heauen ſpake vvhat he penned: &amp; the Angel knevv that God ordeined a more certain courſe, for eaſe and clearnes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, then to ty ſoules to beleeue a iourny of a ſoule, to vvork merit in Darknes among ſpirits, vvhich iourny no pen could c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer tell, nor hart conceaue vvhen it vvere told, vvhat he should do ther: or hovv he could ſuffer there: or hovv the body should vvin by the ſoules pain vvithout the body. And thus vve ſee hovv through the Prophets they vvere taught of redemtion. And in the nevv death &amp; reſurrection very often ſeen. But no going to Gehenna.
