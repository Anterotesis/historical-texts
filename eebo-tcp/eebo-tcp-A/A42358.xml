            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

not more refreshing to gracious hearts, than it was sorely repined at, and opposed by others (a sin that provoked the Lord to stop the current of so rich a mercy) therefore do many now make haste again to intrude themselves upon the Cangregations whence they were once justly cast out, and not a few amongst the People love to have it so, as though there were a conspiracy <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Egypt, and to build again the walls of Jericho, and repair the ruines of Edom.</hi> I do also acknowledge it with thank fulness unto the <hi>great Shepherd of Souls,</hi> that there is a great company of gracious men amongst the Officers of his Church, who walk in the ways of the Lord, and keep his charge, but there be also many that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do so, nor know how to do it; To say nothing of Ministers: It is more than ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that there is a generation of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, slothfull, earthly minded men, who bear the name of Elders and Deacons in many Congregations, and where such bear rule, what can be expected, but that the People should perish for want of knowledge, and holiness be despised, and ly in the dust,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32029:6"/>
and Congregations still abide in to swarthy a temper, If we might find grace in the Lords sight, to be throughly convinced of this great Church-evil, whence many Church evils flow, and be brought with some measure of sincerity to endeavour the remedy thereof, what a branch of hope might it be, that our reproach should be taken away, and we become a People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the way of the Lord, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Praise and Commendation of the Gospel, which is now evil spoken of, because of the ignorance, and loose conversation of many among us: Therefore am I bold as pressed in spirit (albeit one of the weakest and most unworthy) to offer this little Treatise, with an eye upon this end.

            <p>THe inducements that perswaded me first to write, and then to publish this little Treatise of <hi>Ruling Elders and Deacons,</hi> were chiefly these, 1. The sensible Impression that the Lord hath made upon my Spirit, as also (I know) upon the spirits of the godly of the Land, of the great prejudice that comes to this poor Church by a multitude of men in these offices, who neither know their duty, nor make conscience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. 2. The vindicating the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of our Church concerning these Church-Offi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers, that the mouths of such who speak evil may be stopped, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who stumble may be satisfied. 3.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32029:8"/>
The pressing desire of Brethren, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and Elders in the Presbytery and Congregation, where the Lord hath set me; all which did receive some spirit and life, when I found my Name among those to whom the Gen. Assembly of this Church did commit and recommend this work long ago.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to handle it with as much plainness and evidence of Truth, and as shortly, without wronging of the matter as I could: It is not unlike that some may think, that I have done no great business, because I have brought no new thing. I acknowledge that it is so; what I have said, is for the matter (I trust) and in many things for the words too, the Doctrine of the Scriptures, and of Protestant Divines, and of our Church, in the Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s and Policy thereof; I have but put together in one, and digest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into some Method what was lying
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32029:8"/>
scattered of before, that these who either could not, or would not be at the pains to search for such things, may now have them at their hand. Others may look upon this Treatise as not plain enough, or as not so exact, full, and perfect as it ought to be; with these I shall not contend; I have done what I could, at least what I conceived best in order to the ends I propounded to my self; If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shall find favour of the Lord to do better, I shall blesse his Name on their behalf, and receive and make use of their pains with thankfulness. And some may happily think, that there is here too much laid upon Ruling-Elders, more nor they shall be able or willing to undertake; yea, more than the Lord doth require of them, most of the things that are mentioned by us being incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent to Ministers rather than to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. It is true what is said of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:32029:9"/>
duty, is also the duty of Ministers, for what soever the Elder ought to do by vertue of his Calling, that also ought the Minister to do, and somewhat more, but so far as we know, nothing is spoken here of the Elder, that doth not belong to him; if through ignorance or want of abilitie, or neglect, or custome, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders have not done these things, it is that which ought to be helped, it is now high time for them to awake, and to know and owne, and follow their duty; and for the Church of God in <hi>Scotland,</hi> to know how much she hath smarted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hands of ignorant and slothful, yea and scandalous men; we would not alwayes satisfie our selves <hi>with disguised and histrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical</hi>

We have set down what a <hi>Ruling Elder</hi> ought to be, in regard of the whole extent of his Charge, sundry particulars whereof the most part of Ruling Elders are seldom called to exercise, and if they be in some measure fitted for these parts of the charge which God calls them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, and follow the same with single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, they may believe that

they shall be assisted, and accepted of God in Iesus Christ; the Imployment is not theirs, but the Lords, from whom they may expect both their furniture, and also their reward; let them arise and be doing, and the Lord shall be with them.</p>

belongs to the Doctor; but his Office is comprized within the compasse of Ruling and Governing the Church; and therefore he is called the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Ruling Elder; The Apostle in the Epistle to the Rom:<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 8</note> ch. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Thus then we have the proper or right name of these Church Officers, which serves to correct a twofold mistake.

them calls the Clergy, that is, the Lords Inheritance, in opposition to the Laity or People, whom they look upon, as base and much inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the other in worth and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, whereas all the Lords People are his portion, <hi>and the lot of his in he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, Deut.</hi> 32. 9. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. The second mistake is, of these who do call these only Ruling-Elders, who sit in Presbyteries, Synods, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Assemblies, allowing to others the name of Elders, but not of Rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Elders: But every Elder in the Lords House is a Ruling-Elder, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the power and exercise of rule and Government belongs to every Elder, though some of them upon speciall occasions be called to a more eminent Exercise of it than others.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32029:14"/>
the New Testament. The first place of Scripture is <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Having then gifts, differing according to the grace that is given us, whether prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, let us prophesie according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of faith, or Ministery, let us wait on our Ministring, or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on exhortation; he that gives, let him do it wih simplicity: he that ruleth, with diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulnesse.</hi> In which Text, the Apostle doth first comprehend all the severall kindes of ordinary stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers in the Church of God, under two general Heads, to wit, Prophecie, whereby is meaned the ordinary facultie of right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and expounding the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Ministery, under which is comprehended all other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Officers and Imployments: To each
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:32029:14"/>
of these the Apostle addeth their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall duties, to wit, that he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesieth, should do it according to the proportion of faith, <hi>h. e.</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the measure, of the measure of knowledge of the word of faith, that he hath received of God; And he that ministers, let him wait on his ministring, <hi>h. e.</hi> let him not do it neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently or slothfully, but faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diligently. Then he sub-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides these two Generalls, into the speciall Offices contained under them; He divides him that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieth, into him that teacheth, and him that exhorteth, or into the Doctor, to whom the word of teaching or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction belongs, and the Pastor, to whom the Word of Exhortation is competent. Under him that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stereth, he comprehends, first him that giveth, by whom is meant the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:32029:15"/>
Deacon, who is appointed for the supply of the poor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, him that ruleth, by whom can be meant no other then the Ruling Elder, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ordinary ruling Officer in the Church, who is different from the Pastor and Teacher is here spoken of by the Apostle.</p>
               <p>The second place of Scripture that proves the Office of Ruling Elders is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. <hi>And God hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues.</hi> Some of the Bibles of the late <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> Translation read <hi>helps in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> but cross to the Text in the first Language, that bears <hi>helps, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,</hi> as two distinct things, and therefore in other Editions of that Translation, this is helped. In
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32029:15"/>
this Text the Apostle reckons several Officers of the Church, some extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, which were to continue but for a season, such as Apostles, Prophets, Powers or Miracles, gifts of healing, kinds of tongues: Some Ordinary, which were to continue in the Church to the end of the World, and these are Teachers, or the ordinary Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Officers, who are exercised in the Word: <hi>Helps, h. e.</hi> the Deacons, who are appointed for the help and relief of the poor; and <hi>governments, h. e.</hi> the Governing and Ruling Elders; for it is clear from the words, that the Apostle by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, doth mean a Church-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, whom God hath set in his Church, for Ruling and Governing thereof, now this cannot be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Church-Officers, for these he hath named besides, and therefore
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32029:16"/>
it remains that it is the Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The third place of Scripture is, <hi>1Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they that labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> Which Text doth hold forth and distinguish two sorts of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church, to whom the Lord Jesus hath committed the power of Ruling; One sort who do also labour in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to wit, Pastors and Teachers: Another sort who do only Rule, and doing it well, are accounted worthy of double honour, and these are the Ruling Elders of whom we speak.</p>
               <p>From this that the Office of the<note place="margin">2. <hi>Book of Discipl.</hi> c. 3. sect. 13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>Assert: of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of</hi> Scotland, part 1. c. 2. pag. 11. and 17.</note> Ruling Elder is of Divine Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32029:16"/>
we gather these conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, First, that it is not a thing arbitrary and indifferent for such to wait upon their charge, yea or not, as they please, or as their attendance may contribute for their own or their friends parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is the custom of too too many Elders; but that they are bound in conscience diligently to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and follow the duties thereof, whether they be such as they ought, to the several Members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or the keeping of Session, or Presbytery, and other Assemblies of the Church, when they are called and desired thereto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that Elders ought to do their Office, not formally and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically, for the fashion only, but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:32029:17"/>
sincerely and honestly, as in the sight of God, by whom they are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this holy Calling, and to whom they must render an accompt of their discharge of this great trust.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they ought not to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over their fellow Brethren and Elders, but carry themselves hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and serviceably, as these who are appointed of the Lord Jesus for mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string unto, and edifying of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy the Church.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that they ought to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themselves with that authority, holiness, gravity and prudence, that becomes these who are called of God to bear Rule in his House.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that Elders once lawfully called to the Office, and having gifts from God meet to exexcise the same, (unless they be removed therefrom, because of miscarriages) are still El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32029:17"/>
thogh happily in Congregations where many qualified men may be found,<note place="margin">2. Book of Discip. ch. 6. sect. 3.</note> some may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a time to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease from the exercise of the charge, and others be put in their room, as was among the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites under the Law, in serving in the Temple by courses.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, that people ought to obey such as these who have the rule over them, and to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, because they wait for their souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief, Heb. 13. 17. Yea, they would know them as these who are over them in the Lord, and do admonish them, and esteem them very highly in love for their works sake, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 12, 13.</p>

               <p>The outward Calling is to be after the same manner with that of other Church-officers, and it stands in their Election, and in the tryal of their carriage, gifts, and admission to the Charge.

and that the names of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons nominated by them, be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly intimated to the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and they desired, in case of their not being satisfied, as having excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or knowing others better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, to represent the same to the Minister and Eldership.

what manner of persons he would have them to be in regard of their conversation and carriage: I shall speak of these things with Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Ruling Elder. That the Ruling Elder ought to be of a blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and Christian Conversation, is above question, but that it may be more distinctly known what the Holy Ghost requires of such in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their conversation: <hi>I</hi> shall from these Scriptures show, First, what the Apostle would have them not to be. Secondly, what he would have them to be. The things of the first sort are these: 1. A Ruling El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der must not be given to Wine, they must not be lovers nor followers of strong drink, nor debord in riot and excess, nor tipple away time in Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses and Taverns. 2. He must not be a striker nor a brawler, nor given
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:32029:22"/>
to quarrelling and contentions. 3. He must not be covetous, nor greedy of filthy lucre; for, <hi>the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some covet after, they erre from the faith, and pierce themselves through with many sorrows.</hi> 4. He must not be a novice; or one newly come to the faith, lest <hi>he bepuffed up with pride, and fall into the condemnation of the Devil,</hi> the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Novices are not yet well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasted, nor brought low enough by frequent exercises of the Cross, and so come to be more easily puffed up, therefore there is need that he be an exercised Souldier of Iesus Christ, and one who by Experience is taught to know the wiles of the Devil, and is able to endure hardness. 5. He must not be self-willed, adhering pertinaciously, and without reason to his own judgment, and refusing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32029:22"/>
to hearken to the judgment of his Brethren, though sound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. 6. He must not be soon angry, whether upon real or conceived causes of provocation.</p>
               <p>The things of the second sort be these, 1, He must be blameless. <hi>h. e.</hi> One who walks without offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and men. 2. If marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>he must be the husband of one Wife;</hi> such a one who shuns all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful lusts, satisfying himself with, and keeping himself within the bounds of the Remedy provided of God. 3. He must be vigilant, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full over his own soul, that no temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation prevail upon him, watchful unto every good duty, and to take hold of every opportunity of wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing. 4. He must be sober, &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat, of a sound and humble minde, moderating his own appetite and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32029:23"/>
and satisfying himself with a moderat use of the Creatures, and of the things of this world. 5. He must be of a good behaviour or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, of a grave and staid, yet of an effable and courteous carriage, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light and vain, to the loosing of his Authority, and rendring himself contemptible, nor sullen, and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing, to the discouraging and scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the flock, by his needless distance &amp; austerity. 6.

Powers of Ruling Elders in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies of the Church, its requisite that they be indued with such abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and qualifications as are needful for the exercising thereof; but because all Ruling Elders are not alwayes called to sit in all these Assemblies: But one from every Session sufficeth to the Presbytery and Provincial Synods, and a few from every Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and from greater Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, or Burghs therein to the General Assembly, as also a few from the whole Church throughout a Land, to a more universal Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; Therefore, though it is to be wished and endeavoured, that all Elders may have due qualifications for all these things; and though spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care is to be taken every where to choose the most qualified, yet in particular Congregations men may
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32029:31"/>
be chosen Elders, who have not such a measure of all these qualifications; they being otherwise men of a blameless and Christian Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and having such a measure of knowledge, and prudence, as is fit for Governing that Congregation, and judging of the things that are handled in the Session thereof, which for the most part are matters of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, and trying and admitting of Penitents; but if there be any who are not of a blameless and Christian conversation, and have not some measure of these qualifications requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Word of God in a Ruling Elder, no Congregation ought to choose any such, nor any Session or Presbytery to admit them to the charge, for it is not seemly that the servants of corruption should have authority to judge in the Kirk of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:32029:32"/>
God, and if any such have been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they are to endeavour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of them, as they would not partake of their sin, and be found guilty before the Lord of the blood of souls, which cannot but suffer prejudice through negligence or ill guiding of such men.</p>

even Excommunication it self, which is the most terrible and destroying-like censure, being ordained of God for this end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. The Apostle commands to <hi>deliver the incestuous person to Satan,</hi> not that he may satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie for his sin, but that the <hi>spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> The word Satisfaction may admit of a tolerable construction in Church-censures, in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the scandal before men; but this being so much abused in the Popish Church, and the hearts of men, being so prone to true Gospel repentance, to a meer legal penance, and to conceive, that by meer out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward submission and obedience to the censures of the Church, that the guilt of their sin is done away before God, Therefore Elders would care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully shun every thing that may give
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:32029:37"/>
occasion to the fostering this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opinion, and take pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct offenders in the true nature and ends of the censures of the Kirk.</p>
               <p n="9">9. A great part of Elders work, is, to<note place="margin">The form &amp; order of publick repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance perfixed to the old Ps.</note> travel and take pains with scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous persons who are now convict, to bring them to repentance, by season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and frequent conference, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing, exhorting and admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, untill they they perceive some measure of true and earnest hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation wrought in them for their sin, and them fitted to evidence and declare the same in publick before the Congregation, that so the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal may be removed.</p>
               <p n="10">10. They are not to desire or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any to professe repentance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32029:38"/>
the Congregation, untill the signes of repentance appear in them. The Incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> sorrowed exceedingly before the Apostle did any thing concerning the receiving of him; And the Discipline of our Church appoints Ministers and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders sharply to examine these who offer themselves to repentance, what fear and terrour they have of Gods judgements, what hatred of sin, and sorrow for the same, and what sense and feeling they have of Gods mercies? In which if they be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, they ought diligently to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed;<q> for it is (say they) but a mocking to put such to publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who neither understand what sin is, what repentance is, what grace is, nor by whom Gods mercies and favors are purchased?</q> And that after he is instructed in these things,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32029:38"/>
and brought to have some taste of Gods judgements, especially of his mercies in Jesus Christ, he may be presented before the publick Church; These things are set down in the form and order of Publick Repentance, appointed by the Assembly 1567.</p>
               <p>Lastly, when the signs and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of true and unfeigned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance do appear in these who have offended, Elders would shew themselves ready and willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them with all tendernesse and compassion, and to forgive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, and confirm their love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>The number of Elders in every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation<note place="margin">1 Book of discip. ch. 6. Sect. 4.</note> cannot be well limited or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, but it is to be more or less, according to the quantity of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32029:39"/>
the Congregation, and necessities and condition of the people, and as men qualified and fit for the Charge can be found. It hath been an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil custom in some Congregations, that rather than they would want any of their wonted number, they would choose unqualified men, and that in several Congregations, the office of Elder hath been given to those of the richer and higher sort, as due to such (though haply of no experience in the things of Jesus Christ, and in many things of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender and blame-worthy conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) because of their condition in the world, or conceiving that their secular power and credit was the best means to promote the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and men qualified with knowledge and experience in the things pertaining to souls, and of a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32029:39"/>
Christian and godly carriage have been passed by, because of a mean condition in the World. Better it is that the number be few, before we choose the ignorant and scandalous; and that they be of a low degree, if godly, than of a high degree, if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>

or any others to esteem light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, because they are called thereunto, and do exercise the same; but that they themselves, and all others ought to look upon it as one of these holy and honourable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, which the wisdom of God hath thought fit to appoint in his house, for supplying the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the Saints. The Lord Jesus himself did not disdain to wash his Disciples feet; Angels are all of them ministering Spirits, sent forth to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for their sakes who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be heirs of Salvation; why then should any think it below them to serve the Church of Christ, and to minister to the Saints in this Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13.</p>

and receive from the several Members of the Congregation, and strangers that come among them, what the Lord shall incline their hearts to give for a supply of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the poor; and in a season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Christian way, to stir up and exhort to Charity and Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the more may be given. 3. That what is received and collected by them, be faithfully delivered, that it may be put in the Treasury of the Congregation. 4. That they do ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously make known the several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and necessities of the several poor within the Congregation, to the Church Session, that provision may be appointed accordingly for each of them, that so the poor may not be put to begging, to the grief of their spirits, and reproach of the Gospel. 5. That they be careful,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32029:46"/>
honestly and in simplicity, without respect of persons, to distribute and deliver to the poor what is appointed for supply of their necessities; and if they be Orphans, and young ones, or such who have no knowledge or understanding, nor ability to dispose and order the things that concern their food and rayment: That the Deacons honestly imploy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow what is given for their use, that they may be supplyed in these things. 6. That they be careful that what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the poor be not dilapidated, nor applyed to any other use; and if that there be any stock in the Church Treasure, it be improven to the best advantage, for the benefit &amp; use of the poor; Yet so that the poor be rather always supplyed, than Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys treasured up for a vain shew. 7. That they be careful to take notice
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32029:46"/>
of these who are sick, that they may acquaint the Ministers and Elders therewith, for visiting of them; and if that they be poor, their necessities may be supplied.</p>
               <p>That Deacons may the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently discharge their Duty, Its fit that some part of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be assigned to every one of them for the better inspection of the poor thereof, and that the Diets of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting for the poor be divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
               <p>The number of Deacons in every Congregation is to be according to the proportion of the Congregation, and of the poor therein; and though there be no necessity of an equal number of Elders and Deacons, yet it is fit that each Elder have some Deacon to be assisting to him in the bounds of which he hath more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar

inspection, that so both the one and the other may discharge their duty, with the greater facility to themselves, and with the greater benefit and advantage of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
