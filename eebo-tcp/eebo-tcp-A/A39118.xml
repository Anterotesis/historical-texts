            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Having prov'd unſucceſsful in theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

(<hi>Eſquire Lester</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire</hi>) till the aforeſaid

uſe means to get his Brother <hi>Sandford</hi> out of
the Eſtate or elſe he would be undone, and
that he ſhould Arreſt the ſaid <hi>Sandford</hi> for
7000 l. which he was to account for in his
Fathers time, (he then having managed the
Eſtate for the Old Man) but the <hi>morning fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing</hi>

hearing of it, kindly poſted to <hi>Dublin</hi> to pay
the debt, but the aforeſaid <hi>Agents</hi> met him
as ſoon as he came, and told him, if he went to
his Brother he would Arreſt him for 7000 l.
at which <hi>Sandford</hi> much troubled, went back
and took councel of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his great friend, whom he did not ſuſpect
to have any deſign upon the Eſtate, and he
adviſed, inſtead of releaſing his Brother, to
clap another Arreſt up on him for 1000 l. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly
due to <hi>Sandford;</hi> which being done,
and <hi>Chambre</hi> and <hi>Sandford</hi> thus ſet at variance,
the Earl cauſed Sir <hi>Philip Perſeval</hi> and others
to make a propoſal that the ſaid Sir <hi>Philip</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:103510:4"/>
might have a <hi>Leaſe</hi> of 22 years of <hi>Chambre's</hi>
Eſtate for the uſe of the Counteſs of Carlile,
<hi>paying</hi> 4000 l. <hi>Fine, and</hi> 500 l <hi>per annum,
and the third penny profit of the Woods:</hi> and in
order to this, the ſaid Agents perſwaded
<hi>Chambre</hi> to <hi>Petition</hi> the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> that
the Leaſe from the Truſtees to <hi>Sandford</hi>
might not go on, but that the Leaſe profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Sir <hi>Philip</hi> might be perfected, that he
might receive the 4000 l to pay his Fathers
Debts and Legacies, and get out of Priſon.
As ſoon as the Earl received this Petition, he
tranſmitted it to <hi>England</hi> to His late <hi>Majesty</hi>
and Councel, ſeeming much to commiſerate
<hi>Chambre's</hi> condition, and deſiring their Order
to <hi>compel</hi> the Truſtees to conſent to this Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
they living in this Kindome of <hi>England.</hi>
Hereupon the Truſtees were ſent for before
the <hi>Councel</hi> Board, to yield to this Leaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
by <hi>Percival,</hi> who alledged they
were letting a Leaſe of the Premiſſes to <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
much more advantagious</hi> to the Petitioner;
upon which the King and Councel made an
Order that the buſineſs ſhould be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
               <note place="margin">January 17. 1637.</note> to perfect that
Leaſe for the Counteſs of <hi>Carlile</hi> (which was
in truth for himſelf) or make any <hi>other better
bargain</hi> for the good of the Petitioner, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that the Earl ſhould by a Decree in
<hi>Chancery,</hi> enforce the Truſtees to aſſent to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103510:4"/>
what bargain he ſhould make with the ſaid
Counteſs or others, ſo far as did concern their
Truſt, for 22 years, but further, that the
Earl ſhould provide by ſuch Decree, to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Inheritance,</hi> according to the intent
of Old <hi>Chambre,</hi> which was, that the Truſt
ſhould continue in them 200 years.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Chambre</hi> being informed what Order
the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> had received, Petitions
again to him and the Councel, that the
Leaſe propounded by <hi>Percival,</hi> might not
be made good, for he could have <hi>a much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Bargain;</hi> at the reading of which, his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law, the Lord <hi>Brabaſon,</hi> being one of
the Councel, deſired, ſince his Brother muſt
be forced to Lett his Eſtate to pay his Debts,
that the King and Councels Order might be
fulfilled, and the beſt bargain accepted of,
and for his own part, he was willing to take
the Leaſe <hi>of 22 years, and give his Brother</hi>
Chambre, 5000 <hi>l,</hi> and 600 <hi>l per annum, and
half the profit of the Woods:</hi> whereas <hi>Perceval</hi>
would give but 4000 l fine, and 500 l <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
and the third penny profit of the Woods,
ſo that here was a bargain of above 14000 l
<hi>profit better</hi> then that of <hi>Perſevals,</hi> for there
was above 2000 l <hi>per annum,</hi> made <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
annis</hi> of the Woods. Yet the Earl of
<hi>Strafford</hi> rufuſed this offer, and thereby cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103510:5"/>
a certain loſs to <hi>Chambre,</hi> to a <hi>greater
value,</hi> during that 22 years, than what he
himſelf afterwards <hi>pretended to give</hi> for the
whole <hi>Eſtate, Reverſion and all.</hi> The Earle
I ſay refuſed this offer, directly <hi>contrary</hi> to
the King's Oorder, and cauſed the Leaſe with
<hi>Perſeval</hi> to be perfected by a ſpecial Order,
on the terms <hi>firſt by him offered,</hi> forcing the
Truſtees to conſent by a Decree, but <hi>no</hi> care
was taken therein to preſerve the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſo that His Majeſties Order of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
was <hi>doubly defeated</hi> and eluded, nor was
this 4000 l Fine, or the 500 l <hi>per annum</hi> Rent,
or third penny of the profit of the Woods men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the ſaid Leaſe ever <hi>paid,</hi> or if any of
the 4000 l were paid, it was after <hi>Chambre's</hi>
death, and to whom the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> and
his Agents pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly <hi>Sandford</hi> being thus turned out,
and the Earls Agents got in poſſeſſion of the
Premiſſes, <hi>Chambre</hi> was <hi>ſtill</hi> detained a <hi>Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>

that the 4000 l Fine might be paid, that he
might be able to diſcharge his Debts, and
go out of Priſon, upon which, the Earl to

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103510:5"/>
for it. But <hi>Chambre</hi> refuſing was kept more
<hi>ſtraitly</hi> a Priſoner then before, and reduced to
great <hi>Want,</hi> yet often viſited by ſeveral of the
Earles inſtruments, and when they got him
merry, or at all inclinable to the Earles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
he was ſometimes ſent for to <hi>Dine</hi>
with him at the Caſtle, and ſometimes let
out of Priſon, and then by one pretended <hi>Debt</hi>
or other upon Paper Petitions, clapt up again,
though <hi>he offered ſecurity for any just Debt</hi>
could be charged upon him, whereby being
brought into ſuch <hi>miſery,</hi> by continual vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations

to yield to the Earls Propoſal for the Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Eſtate (but not the Leaſe) if his

            </p>
            <p>To make her willing, the Earl ſends a <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger</hi>

and cauſes her Husband to be kept ſo <hi>cloſe</hi> a
Priſoner, that neither <hi>ſhe nor any</hi> of his friends

till he often falling into <hi>Convulſion
Fitts,</hi> the Keeper thinking he would dye, went

were not ſpeedily, ſhe would never ſee him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live;
upon which the Earl ſent his Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to go along with her, who found him ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the floor on his belly, very near

death; but raiſing him with ſome ſpirits, and
other help, he began to look up, his wife
asking him how he did, he anſwered, <note place="margin">See the Depoſitions, this proved by three Witneſſes.</note>

<hi>Prethee Husband I ſee they are reſolved to have
it, and rather then I will be an inſtrument of thy

Gentleman haſted back to his Lord, and told
him he muſt ſtrike whilſt the Iron was hot,
for now ſhe was willing; ſo a <hi>Fine</hi> was next

Deed dated the ſecond oſ <hi>November</hi> 1638.
Sealed by <hi>Chambre</hi> for the <hi>Reverſion</hi> only, to
<hi>Joſhua Carpenter, Henry Wentworth</hi> and others,
(intended though not expreſſed, to and for the
uſe of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> and his Heirs)
for the ſumm of 13200 l. mentioned therein
as the conſideration, whereas the Eſtate was
then really worth above 120000 l. for the
Lands would be worth within 4 or 5 years time
(when the old Leaſes Expired) between 5 and
6000 l. <hi>per annum.</hi> Beſides Cuſtomes, which
were worth as much more, and at that time
the Woods were worth near 100000 l. The
Earl of <hi>Cork</hi> having proffered (but a year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Old <hi>Chambre's</hi> death) 60000 l. <hi>for the
Timber Trees only upon the Estate..</hi>

and Land, and all the Appurterances are <hi>wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted</hi>
from the ſaid <hi>Chambre</hi> and his wife, for the

<hi>none was ever yet paid,</hi> ſave only 500 l. ſaid to
be paid to one <hi>Chambre</hi> of <hi>Minmore</hi> for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
all his pretenſions to the Premiſſes, ſo
much being given by <hi>Chambre</hi> the Father, on
that condition. This Deed and Fine being
executed (which were not only obtained by
<hi>dureſs</hi> of Impriſonment, <hi>Fraud, Cruelty, &amp;c.</hi>
and directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the King and Councel's
Order before mentioned) the ſaid <hi>Chambre</hi> was
thereupon fully ſet at <hi>Liberty,</hi> but coming into

after, <hi>viz.</hi> the latter end of <hi>November</hi> 1638
<hi>Dyed,</hi> leaving two Children, a ſon that dyed

            <p>But before his death or making of the ſaid
Conveyance, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1638 the
ſaid <hi>Chambre</hi> made his laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Writing, bequeathing all his Lands to
<hi>Mary</hi> his wife for 12 years, and for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder,
one moyety to her during life, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to his Heirs Male, and for want of an
Heir Male to his Uncle <hi>Chambre</hi> of <hi>Minmore</hi>
and his Heirs Male for ever, and 2000 l. to his
Daughter, and made his ſaid wife ſole Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix,
and expreſly gave her all his Goods and
Chattels, by which ſhe became Intituled to
the Leaſe of 200 years, for the Remainder
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103510:7"/>
to come. And whatever was given to <hi>Chambre</hi>
of <hi>Minmore</hi> by Will, or otherwiſe, was ſold a
year after <hi>Chambre's</hi> death by <hi>Chambre</hi> of <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>
to the deceaſed young <hi>Chambre's</hi> wife, ſo
that the Family of <hi>Minmore</hi> have no pretence of
any right to it, as by Deed under his hand
doth appear. That <hi>Chambre</hi> the younger thus
dying, without ſigning any Deed, to lead the
uſe of the aforeſaid Fine, and his Will in

apprehending they had not yet made the Eſtate

only the <hi>Reverſion of his Estate</hi> for 13200 l. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the ſaid <hi>Leſter</hi> and <hi>Chambre</hi> of <hi>Minmore,</hi> who
knew nothing of theſe other Deeds, were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in them only to colour the intrigue.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Nuncupative</hi> Will, and ſeveral Deeds
being thus ſet on foot, and admitted, and the

that the ſaid Truſtees <hi>James Fines, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel

were prevailed upon to ſell the ſaid Leaſe

(but without the ſaid <hi>Job Ward</hi> or his wife ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſame) to two perſons, for the uſe of

upon condition that 13200 l. ſhould be paid,
or laid out for Purchaſing Land of Inheritance
according to the aforeſaid Articles before <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
1645. which was never performed; true
it is, in the time of the Suites with the ſaid Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees
of the Leaſe of 200 years, the late Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> in purſuance of ſome part of the
pretended Articles, pretended to purchaſe a
place called the <hi>Renalaghs</hi> (or <hi>Knockbrea</hi>) of
Sir <hi>Adam Loftu<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> which was Plantation-Lands
taken from the Iriſh, and given to ſeveral men
upon Commiſſions of Grace, and no real Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
for it was only a Leaſe for years, and
with ſeveral limitations; and though the Earls
Agents pretended they laid out 10000 l. for it,
yet if they did, it was in their own wrong,
and not with our conſent, and the Land was not
worth 5000 l. as appears by many Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>That in the year 1640. the real Will
in writing of the ſaid <hi>Chambre</hi> of <hi>Carnow</hi>
(intruſted by him with Mr. <hi>Gutteridge</hi> then
Miniſter of <hi>Carnow</hi>) was providentially diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
and produced, which being proved,
and Adminiſtred unto by the ſaid <hi>Mary</hi> his
Relict, the <hi>Nuncupative</hi> Will (though ſhe
was forced to Adminiſter a year before, and
the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> had ſpent above 500 l. in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103510:8"/>
Law to maintain it) was thrown out of Court,
upon which the ſaid Earl and his Agents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be at a ſtand, becauſe all the falſe
Deeds and Articles of Agreement, upon which
the Truſtees Aſſigned away their Truſt, being
done upon that <hi>Nuncupative</hi> Will, ſeemed to
ſignifie very little, and therefore to the intent
if one device would not ſerve another might.
The Earl having about <hi>Trinity Terme</hi> 1637. 13
<hi>Car.</hi> 1. cauſed a Caſe, called <hi>The Caſe of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures
upon defective Titles,</hi> (tending to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away and diſpoſing of Lands without <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Tryal, conſent of Parties,</hi> or <hi>Legal Proceſs,</hi>
to evidence or adjuge that the Titles were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective)
did amongſt at leaſt 400 other Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
compriſe the Premiſſes therein, though
there were no colour of reaſon for the ſame, and
in or about the year 1640.<note place="margin">1640</note> obtained an <hi>Act of

in His then Majeſty His Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
or any he ſhould grant them to, within
five years, as Plantation-Lands and Defective
Titles.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he obtained Letters Patents
under the Great Seal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby the
Premiſſes were granted to Five perſons in Truſt
for Sir <hi>William Wentworth</hi> his Son (now Earl of
<hi>Strafford</hi>) who ſince his Father's death, hath
renewed the laid Letters Patents; and thereby,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103510:9"/>
and by the ſaid Act, he holds Poſſeſſion;<note place="margin">☞</note>
whereas in truth the ſaid <hi>Half Barony</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes
were not Plantation-Lands, or ever ſo
reputed, nor was the Title of the ſaid Old Mr.
<hi>Chambre</hi> any way defective, but he bought
the ſame for a valuable conſideration, parting
with a very conſiderable Eſtate in <hi>Oxfordſhire,</hi>
to purchaſe this, and was lawfully ſeized of
the Premiſſes in Fee-ſimple at the time of his
death, as by the aforeſaid Inquiſition appears,
neither were the ſame ever Forfeited or Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Beſides the practiſe is apparent, for in the
10. Car. 1. <hi>An Act being made for ſecuring E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
of Plantation-Lands, &amp;c.</hi> which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
to ſpecify what Lands ſhould be counted
<hi>Plantation-Lands,</hi> and names ſeveral places,
as <hi>Renalaghs, &amp;c.</hi> in the ſame County of <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi>
yet never mentions one word of <hi>Shelelah,</hi>
now this Act 1640. ſeems only a Repetition of
of the ſame Act of the 10. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. and has no
more in effect in it, ſave only that this Eſtate
of <hi>Shelelah</hi> is here inſerted, and indeed no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Lands are added, but that, or a ſmall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
or two adjoyning, which the Earl about
the ſame time poſſeſſed himſelf of; ſo that it
ſeems, as if this Act were deſignedly carryed
on to colour his pretences to this Eſtate, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what was done before, otherwiſe to that
purpoſe, would not be ſufficient; From all which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103510:9"/>
it appears that as well the Parliament in that
<hi>Act,</hi> as His Majeſty in His <hi>Grant,</hi>

<hi>Parliament,</hi> who would undoubtedly do him
right in the thing, by their Soveraign Power,
which he being of an inferiour Court, had not
power to do.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> could not obtain his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
till after <hi>Richard Cromwel</hi> was turned
out, and <hi>Ludlow</hi> ſent over by the <hi>Long Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and within half a year after
was made a <hi>Priſoner</hi> again, upon the occaſion
following, (<hi>viz.</hi>) His Majeſty, our Soveraign
that now is, being to be Proclaimed in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
on the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> 1660. The ſayd <hi>Eyres</hi>
wife deſirous to rejoyce with her Tenants for
His Majeſtie's <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> had invited many
of them to a Feaſt on that day, and ordered
ſervants to carry them Loads of Wood to a
Hill to make a Boonefire; of this the ſubtilty
of his Adverſaries, who were in Poſſeſſion of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103510:12"/>
his Eſtate, that they might prevent him from
<hi>Appealing</hi> to the Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
the Leaſe and Eſtate aforeſaid, took
an advantage, and brought feigned Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
ſuggeſting to ſome Magiſtrates, that
if they did not ſecure the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> before
the ſaid day, he would be at the Head of a
great number of perſons to oppoſe the coming
in of the King, than which nothing could be
more farther or remote from the ſaid <hi>Eyre's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</p>
            <p>However upon this <hi>ſlander,</hi> the Councel of
State ſent five Troops of Horſe, haled the ſaid
<hi>Eyre</hi> out of his bed, and carryed him to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
Caſtle, where he was a <hi>Priſoner</hi> for ſome
time, and afterwards hurryed from <hi>Priſon</hi> to
<hi>Priſon</hi> above ten years ſpace, without any
known crime; ſometimes kept from all kind
of <hi>Food,</hi> for ſeveral weeks, but what was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by ſtealth at a hole made under the door,
for the Cat to go in and out: and his Keeper
being demanded by the Priſoners and others,
the reaſon of the extraordinary rigour towards
the ſaid <hi>Eyre,</hi> would uſually anſwer; <hi>That his
command was ſo ſtrickt, he durſt do no otherwiſe,</hi>
often declaring, <hi>he had an order to ſt<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet whilſt the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> was thus in <hi>durance,</hi>
all acquaintance prohibited to come at him,
and his wife not ſuffered to viſit him; at the
ſame time, ſome were admitted to ſerve him
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103510:12"/>
with <hi>Subpoena's</hi> in <hi>Chancery,</hi> through the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of the ſaid <hi>Alexander Temple,</hi> and the
now Earl of <hi>Strafford's</hi> Agents, and for preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
contempt of the Court, under that inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
neceſſity, Chancellour <hi>Euſtace</hi> grants an
Injunction, and turns the ſaid <hi>Eyre's</hi> wife and
Family out of doors, of the Eſtate of <hi>Renelaghs</hi>
too; and they had utterly periſhed, if good
people had not relieved them: Although <hi>Eyres</hi>
his Councel did proffer his <hi>Oath,</hi> that the ſaid
<hi>Eyre</hi> did not make any Contempt, neither
was he in any capacity ſo to do: Upon which
Injunction, the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> and his Family have
been ever ſince kept out of the Eſtate of the
<hi>Renalaghs,</hi> which was pretended to be <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>
to the uſe of Mr. <hi>Chambre</hi> aforeſaid, with
the money that was to be given for the <hi>Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
of <hi>Shelelah.</hi> And <hi>Steele</hi> did declare, that
if all the money had been really paid for the
<hi>Reverſion,</hi> it could not have hindred <hi>Eyre</hi> of
the Leaſe of 200 years; and if ſo, the <hi>Renalaghs</hi>
being but a Leaſe of 500 years, really belongs
to the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> in Right of his wife.</p>
            <p>But by reaſon of ſuch Combination, and
Cruelty againſt him, the ſaid <hi>Eyre,</hi> nor any one
for him, (as he knows of) hath not ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
one penny profit thereof to this day, and
his the ſaid <hi>Eyres</hi> wife, a perſon well deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and who had lived formerly in great
ſplendor, fainted in the Streets of <hi>Dublin</hi> (for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103510:13"/>
want) ſhe being taken into a Houſe, crying
out, <hi>her Daughter</hi> Temple <hi>had broke her heart,</hi>
and dyed about two hours after: For by the
Couſederacy aforeſaid, the ſaid <hi>Temple</hi> and
his Wife enjoy all that the Earl, or his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors
gave for <hi>Shelelah,</hi> (except the 500 l.
to <hi>Chambre</hi> of <hi>Minmore</hi>) although in truth the
whole 13200 l. (if the Purchaſe were honeſt)
did belong to <hi>William Eyre,</hi> in Right of his
Wife, as a Chattel, as it hath been often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by all the Judges in <hi>Ireland,</hi> no Land
being purchaſed in <hi>Chambre's</hi> life-time. And
the Judges did further declare, that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they pay of the Purchaſe money to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the ſaid <hi>Eyre,</hi> they pay it in their
own wrong: (which cauſed the now Earl of
<hi>Strafford</hi> to take a Bond of the ſaid <hi>Temple</hi> of
20000 l. (as he is informed) to ſave him harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
from the ſaid <hi>Eyre,</hi> which it will not nor
cannot do, when Truth and Juſtice ſhall take
place, for Mr. <hi>Chambre's</hi> daughter had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Portion of 2000 l. given her by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Will, though now they would make her
Heir of all that they have been pleaſed to leave
the Family.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> to vindicate his innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to the world, brought himſelf to a Tryal,
ſome time ſince in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi>
and was cleared by publique <hi>Proclamation</hi> in
the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> there, but immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103510:13"/>
he was clear of the Priſon, there came an
Order to another <hi>Marſhal</hi> more cruel then the
former, to take him into his Cuſtody on a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
charge of <hi>High Treaſon;</hi> and four years
and upward he was brought to the Bar twice
a Terme to know what his <hi>Treaſon</hi> was: But
the <hi>Attorney General</hi> put it off from time to

was graciouſly pleaſed to command by

               </hi> in the before mentioned Eſtate,
wrongfully (<hi>as he humbly conceives, and is by
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103510:14"/>
Counſel adviſed</hi>) with-holden from him.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter be pleaſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
firſt, that <hi>Calcott Chambre</hi> the younger,
being Intituled, not only to the <hi>Inheritance,</hi>
but alſo <hi>diſtinctly</hi> to the Leaſe of 200 years
(which would not be drowned by the deſcent,
becauſe it was to operate to other intents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
as <hi>Payments of Debts</hi> and <hi>Legacies,</hi> &amp;
was acknowledged to be in force long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
(as well by their attempts to <hi>Sell</hi> &amp; <hi>Convey</hi>
it as by the depoſitions of the Right Honourable
the Lord <hi>Crew,</hi> in whoſe hands it ſtill remains)
and he by his Will having expreſly given all his
<hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Chattels</hi> (wherein that Leaſe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed)
to his Wife, and Executrix; &amp; the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi>
executed afterwards in his life-time,
not pretending to affect ſuch Eſtate for years,
but only the <hi>Reverſion, Eyre</hi> by intermarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the ſaid Executrix, and being in Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Premiſſes, became lawfully Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled
thereunto, for the reſidual terme; and
for the Aſſignment or Sale thereof by the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees,
the ſame was without conſideration, and
they were ſurpriſed into that action by the
pretended Deeds, ſet on foot as aforeſaid, nor
could ſuch Aſſignment (as Councel adviſe) give
away the Executrix Right, unleſs ſhe or her
Husband had actually Sealed the ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that there appears only 500 l.
paid, by the late or preſent Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi>
or their Agents, for this vaſt Eſtate (their
Purchaſe of the <hi>Renalaghs</hi> being without the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103510:14"/>
conſent of <hi>Chambre</hi> or his wife, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And tis
proved by many Witneſſes, that the late Earl
of <hi>Strafford</hi> made above 30000 l. of the profits
of this Eſtate in 4 years time, before the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi>
broke out, And the preſent Earl though
Ordered to the contrary in the year 1661. (till
the <hi>Title</hi> ſhould be cleared) has made at leaſt
3000 l. <hi>per annum</hi> ever ſince, only of the
Wood growing thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly</hi> that the preſent Earl, his Truſtees
or Agents can pretend no Title, but by the
pretended Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and Letter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
thereupon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Againſt which there are theſe Arguments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Shelelah</hi> being no <hi>Plantation-Land</hi>
nor <hi>Defective Title,</hi> was inſerted into the ſaid
Act by <hi>Practiſe,</hi> as before is demonſtrated.
Beſides neither the Heir to the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> nor
the Truſtees to the Leaſe of 200. years had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any notice to defend their <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis conceived, that as the ſaid Act was
unduly obtained, ſo it was never duly Recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but kept privately in a Gentlemans Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
inſomuch that 17 years after the Date
thereof, at a <hi>Hearing</hi> of the Cauſe they moved
<hi>Chancellor Steel</hi> that it might be Recorded,
which was denied becauſe it had not the Royal
Aſſent nor other requeſite Formalities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had the Premiſſes been <hi>Plantation-Land,</hi>
or had the late Earl thought fit then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103510:15"/>
by ſuch his Title by the Act and Patent,
there need never have been a <hi>Nuncupative</hi>
Will ſet up for <hi>Chambre</hi> the younger, nor ſo
many feined Deeds purſuant thereunto, nor ſo
much money ſpent in juſtifying them, nor
would they have had occaſion to force the Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtees
to Sell the ſaid Leaſe of 200. years to
them for 13200 l. to be laid out in Land for
the uſe of the ſaid <hi>Chambre, which was never
done,</hi> nor would they have had any need to
Appeal (as they did) to the Court of Claims
in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſince His <hi>Majeſties Reſtauration,</hi> to
have it ſetled upon the preſent Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>
as <hi>Traytors Land;</hi> whence tis plain, this lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Title was intended to be kept as a reſerve,
and never inſiſted upon till all other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
failed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nor can it be pretended, that upon the
late Earls Attainder, the Premiſſes became
forfeited to the King, and ſo might lawfully
be granted afterwards by His Majeſty, to the
preſent Earl: for as in reaſon no man ought to
ſuffer for another, and much leſs loſe his right
abſolutely, meerly becauſe another had before
diſſeiſed him wrongfully; ſo in that very Bill
there is a ſalvo that expreſly preſerves the
right, Tytle and Intereſt of all and ſingular ſuch
of the <hi>Lands, Tenements</hi> and <hi>Hereditaments</hi> as
they or any of them, or any to their uſe, had
or might lawfully claim before.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103510:15"/>
5. That <hi>Chambre</hi> the Son, giving all his
Lands to his Heirs Male, and to <hi>Calcott Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
of <hi>Minmore</hi> and his Heirs, and the preſent
Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> having diſclaimed all his
Titles by Deed or Purchaſe, and the ſaid <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cott
Chambre</hi> of <hi>Minmore</hi> having after the Death
of the before mentioned <hi>Infant,</hi> (Heir Male)
ſold to the ſaid <hi>Eyre's</hi> late wife for a valuable
Conſideration by Deed executed under his
Hand and Seal ready to be produced, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was given him by that Will or any grant
whatſoever: it follows (as tis humbly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
that the <hi>Inheritance</hi> was inveſted in the
ſaid <hi>Eyre's</hi> wife as well as the Leaſe of 200
years.</p>
            <p n="6">6. How <hi>notorious,</hi> and by what <hi>Practices,</hi> all
pretences of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
been obtained on the part of the Earl's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
and how long the ſaid <hi>Eyre</hi> has been
kept out of the ſame, by <hi>unheard</hi> of <hi>Cruelties,</hi>
what ſevere <hi>Impriſonments,</hi> and unparalleld
<hi>Hardſhips</hi> (chiefly, as he has grounds to believe
on this occaſion) he has <hi>ſuffered;</hi> and to what
extremities he is reduced, with many other
ſad circumſtances, will appear throughout
the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of the Caſe.</p>
            <p>The truth whereof, the ſaid <hi>William Eyre</hi> is
ready to make appear in every particular; and
yet (had he not been inforced by the unanſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
impulſes of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> after all other O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertures
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103510:16"/>
were deſpiſed, though offered with
the greateſt moderation) he ſhould not thus
have expoſed the ſame, leaſt he might ſeem
to violate his due reſpects to the memory of
the Dead, or the Honour of the living, both
which are contrary to the Candour of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
whoſe deſign is only to ſet forth a
brief of the matter of Fact, in order to the
diſcovery, and obtaining of his Right.</p>
            <p>The rather for that amongſt other things it
appears by an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> ready to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and duly ſworn unto by a perſon of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
who was preſent upon the Scaffold, at
the time of the death of the ſaid late Earl of
