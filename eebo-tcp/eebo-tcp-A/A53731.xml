            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
SERIOUS READER.</head>
            <p>ONE of the great Gospel Enquiries
that a Christian ought to be most
<hi>critical</hi> and <hi>curious</hi> in resolving to
himself, upon the most <hi>impartial Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of his own Heart, concerning his
spiritual State, and standing in Grace, is,
<hi>Whether he be in the Faith or no?</hi> which
doubt can be resolved but Two ways,
either by <hi>Faith it self,</hi> closing with its
true Objects as offered in the Gospel in
its <hi>direct act;</hi> and so it evidenceth it self,
being the Evidence of things not seen, as
all the natural Senses Evidence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by their own Acts upon their proper
Objects: For he that sees the Sun, hath
Argument enough to himself, That he
is not blind, but hath a seeing Eye, and
Faith, therefore is frequently represented
to us by seeing as <hi>John</hi> vi. 40. and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
which Evidence is according to
the degrees of Faith, weaker or stronger,
<pb facs="tcp:49192:3"/>
and hence carries lesser or greater assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
with it; but such as are of the
highest and best nature, giving the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Glory to the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> of God,
and the firmest stay to the Soul in the
greatest Storms of Temptation, being as
an <hi>Anchor fastened within the Vail</hi> sure and
stedfast. Or else additionally, <hi>that our
joy may be full;</hi> and, for further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
especially in such Cases wherein our
Faith seems to fail us, and we are like
<hi>Thomas,</hi> God hath out of his abundant
Grace in the Gospel provided Arguments
for us to raise from <hi>spiritual sence,</hi> to
judge of our <hi>State and Standing</hi> by. But
this requires the teachings of the Spirit,
and thence a <hi>Spirit of discerning,</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of, and insight into our own Hearts
and ways, <hi>with senses exercised by reason
of use,</hi> that these Grounds and Arguments
may be matter of Comfort and Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto us.</p>
            <p>I call these latter Evidences, <hi>subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi>
ones, and <hi>additional</hi> to that of Faith,
of great use by way of Establishment and
Confirmation unto Believers, provided
they be not abused to sole resting and
reliance upon them, to the great prejudice
of our Life, of Faith, for <hi>we live by Faith</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49192:3"/>
(so must all repenting Sinners when they
have attained to the highest pitch of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in this Life) <hi>and not by Sense,</hi> no
not spiritual Sense; it's a good <hi>Hand-Maid</hi>
to Faith, but no good <hi>Mistress</hi> to
it.</p>
            <p>MOREOVER Trials of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are often of a marvellous awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and convincing nature unto poor
secure Sinners, formal and hypocritical
Professors, for many of them hold true
with great demonstration in the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iij. 14. <hi>He that loveth not his
Brother, abideth in Death.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 10.
<hi>In this the Children of God and the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Devil are manifest, whosoever
doth not Righteousness is not of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he that loveth not his Brother.</hi> Now
these <hi>Tests</hi> come upon an unregenerate
Man, as clear and strong Convictions of
his <hi>undone Estate,</hi> when by Gospel Light
shining into his dark Heart, it Evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears, that there is a <hi>Total Absence</hi>
of such eminent Graces, that are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
from a Child of God; but when a poor
broken-hearted, self-condemning Sinner
comes to try himself by these Tests, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
under great Temptation, he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all that he finds in himself for <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,
<pb facs="tcp:49192:4"/>
Formality</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> sits altogether in
darkness in respect of those <hi>sparks of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Light,</hi> and is fain at last when he
hath broken all his Flints, and worn out all
his Steel, in compassing himself about with
sparks of his own kindling, to turn unto
Christ by Faith, <hi>as a Prisoner of Hope,
believing in Hope against Hope;</hi> and from
him to fetch by a direct act of Faith, as
from the <hi>Sun</hi> of Righteousness, all his
<hi>Light</hi> of Life and Comfort, and then he
will be able to light all his small Tapers,
yea all inferiour Arguments of his good
Estate will, flow in with much enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and increase of Consolation. As
<hi>Streams of living Water</hi> flowing forth of
the <hi>Fountain, set open</hi> for <hi>Sin</hi> and for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,</hi>
into <hi>the Belly of the true Believing
Sinner,</hi> receiving by Faith of the fulness of
Christ through the Spirit, abundantly
supplying him with Rivers of true sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial
<hi>living Graces and Consolations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
filled with the Fruits of Righteousness,
to the Praise and Glory of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW among disquisitions of this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Nature and Use, this is none of the
least, <hi>Whether we are under the Dominion
of Sin or no?</hi> Either we are or are not;
if we are, our State is most certainly
<pb facs="tcp:49192:4"/>
dangerous; for such are under the Law,
and the Law <hi>hath concluded all under
Wrath.</hi> If we are not under Sin's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
we are in a blessed and happy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
being <hi>under Grace;</hi> for these two
Dominions divide the World, and every
Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> is under one
or the other, and none can be under both
at the same time. Now our being under
Grace can be no way better Evidenced
than by our <hi>being in Christ by Faith,</hi> for
he that is so is a <hi>new Creature,</hi> is <hi>passed
from Death to Life,</hi> will still be morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Sin, the <hi>strong Man</hi> in Sin's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
being cast out, and therefore Faith
is said to be our <hi>Victory,</hi> through the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of all Grace received from Jesus
Christ. Indeed it calls for no small spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Skill and Understanding to pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
judgment in these Matters: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
many are deceived in taking
wrong Measures to search out these deep
things of God, taking them to belong to
the mere <hi>Faculties</hi> and <hi>Endowments</hi> of a
natural Man, not considering that they
are of the <hi>Spirits Revelation</hi> only: And
hence it is that many poor Creatures in a
<hi>Bondage State</hi> under the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
under <hi>Sin's Dominion,</hi> do work like
<pb facs="tcp:49192:5"/>
Slaves in the Dunghil of their own Hearts,
to find out some natural Religion or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Goodness in themselves, to recommend
them unto God; but such recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must be under the Law, it cannot be
under Grace; and therefore such are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of Sin infallibly as the
<hi>Israelites</hi> were, <hi>which followed after the Law
of Righteousness but attained not unto the Law
of Righteousness. Wherefore, because they
sought it not by Faith, but as it were by
the works of the Law,</hi> for <hi>they stumbled at
that stumbling Stone,</hi> Rom. ix. 32. And
it is greatly to be bewailed, that many
Professors that sit under the means of
Grace, are so tender of their secure and
palliated Consciences, that they cannot
indure that the Rays of <hi>true Gospel Light</hi>
should shine directly into their Hearts,
being contented <hi>with a name only, that they
do live;</hi> they are loath to come to any
narrow search or trial, least they should
be found out and appear to themselves in
their ugly shapes, whilst they are willing
that all the World should have a good
Opinion of them, under which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
admit of any inward disturbances, but
desire to sleep in a whole Skin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49192:5"/>
OTHERS there are, sincere, broken-hearted
Believers, scared at the <hi>Rock of
Presumption,</hi> on which they see so many
Professors wracked daily, are apt to fall
upon the other Extream, and too wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to free Grace, condemn themselves,
<hi>as being under the Dominion of Sin,</hi> and
therefore censure themselves to be under <hi>the
Law and Wrath,</hi> notwithstanding all their
seeming Faith and Holiness, calling that
<hi>Presumption</hi> and this <hi>Hypocrisy:</hi> Hence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
to a kind of <hi>Spirit of Bondage again
to fear,</hi> their Faith is shaken by prevailing
Unbelief, their Peace is broken, and all
Gospel Ordinances rendred ineffectual, as
to their true Ends of profit, Edification and
Comfort. Hence, though they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under Grace, they do not know, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Temptation, will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, <hi>but go mourning all the day
long, because of the Oppressor, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:</hi>
But I beseech such a poor Soul to
consider a little, and not <hi>to receive the
Grace of God in vain,</hi> dost thou groan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpation and Oppression</hi> of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sin, and is this the Dominion of it?
Is there no difference between <hi>Sin's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
and Sin's Tyranny and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surpation?</hi>
Dominion is upon account of right of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
<pb facs="tcp:49192:6"/>
or subjection, there is upon both
that Sin reigns in, carnal and unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Men, <hi>who yield up their Members as
instruments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteousness unto Sin, but
you reckon your selves dead unto Sin,</hi> having
no joy in its prevalency but grief, being
<hi>planted</hi> in this respect, <hi>in the likeness of
Christ's Death, who died unto Sin once, but
dieth no more. Sin shall have no more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over him; likewise reckon ye also
your selves dead indeed unto Sin, but alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God through Jesus Christ our Lord,</hi> i. e.
To be under Grace, to put your self free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and joyfully under the Conduct and
Dominion of Jesus Christ, and to keep
up a continual fight and opposition against
the prevailing Power of Sin. Indeed
Sin will often, as an Out-lying watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Enemy, make its <hi>assaults</hi> and <hi>incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
on the best of God's Children, as
it did on <hi>David, Hezekiah, Peter,</hi> and
though it may make breaches upon them,
Sin shall not have <hi>a Dominion,</hi> and <hi>set up
a Throne of Inquity in their Hearts.</hi> Grace
will beat out <hi>Sin's Throne;</hi> for, indeed,
the words of this Text, that is, the subject
of the ensuing Treatise, carry the force of
a promise to the Saints, to animate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
them to fight against Sin under the
<pb facs="tcp:49192:6"/>
Banner of our Lord Jesus, the <hi>Captain
of our Salvation made perfect through
Sufferings;</hi> For <hi>Sin shall not have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN treating of which Text, this late
<hi>Learned and Reverend Author</hi> hath acted
the part of a <hi>good Work Man, that rightly
divided the Word of God</hi> (as in all his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Writings of the like nature) giving
every one their <hi>portion,</hi> as it belongs
to them, with so much perspicuity and
demonstration, that if (Christian Reader)
thou wilt afford a little time and pains
to read, meditate, dilate and digest well
the Truths here laid before thee, through
the blessing of the God of all Grace, thou
wilt find much satisfaction, and real spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
advantage unto thy Soul, either to
awaken and recover thee from under the
<hi>Dominion of Sin</hi> (the dangerous and pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
<hi>Symptoms</hi> thereof, being here plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made manifest) or else to discover thy
happy estate in being taken from <hi>under the
Law,</hi> and brought under the <hi>Dominion of
Grace,</hi> whereby thou maist assume great
Encouragement to thy self, to proceed
more chearfully in <hi>running the Race set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>What Sin is consistent with the State of Grace,
and what not. Sins great design in all, to
obtain Dominion: It hath it in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and contends for it in Believers. The
ways by which it acts.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Psalmist</hi> treating with God
in Prayer about Sin, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth,
that there are in all men
<hi>unsearchable Errors of Life,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49192:9"/>
all humane understanding or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension;
with such daily sins of Infirmity,
as stand in need of continual cleansing
and Pardon, <hi>Psal.</hi> xix. 12. <hi>Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his Errors? cleanse thou me from secret
faults.</hi> But yet he supposeth that these
things are consistent with a state of Grace,
and acceptation with God. He had no
thought of any <hi>absolute Perfection</hi> in this Life;
of any such condition as should not stand
in need of continual cleansing and pardon.
Wherefore there are or may be such sins in
Believers, yea many of them, which yet
under a due Application unto God, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying
and pardoning Grace, shall neither
deprive us of Peace here, nor endanger our
Salvation hereafter.</p>
               <p>BUT he speaks immediately of another
sort of sins, which partly from their Nature,
or what they are in themselves; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from their Operation and Power, will
certainly prove <hi>destructive unto the Souls of
men</hi> wherever they are. <hi>V. 13. Keep back
thy Servant also from presumptuous sins; let
them not have dominion over me, then shall I
be upright, and I shall be innocent from the
great Transgression.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS is the Hinge whereon the whole
Cause and State of my Soul doth turn. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49192:9"/>
I am subject to many sins of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sorts, yet under them all I can and do
maintain my Integrity and <hi>Covenant <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightness</hi>
in walking with God; and where
I fail am kept within the reach of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and pardoning mercy continually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
unto my Soul by Jesus Christ.
But there is a state of Life in this World
wherein <hi>Sin hath dominion over the Soul;</hi>
acting it self <hi>presumptuously,</hi> wherewith In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and Freedom from condemning
guilt are inconsistent.</p>
               <p>THIS state therefore, which is eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ruinous unto the souls of men, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates
with all earnestness, praying to be
kept and preserved from it.</p>
               <p>WHAT he there so earnestly prays for,
the <hi>Apostle in the Words of the Text</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth
unto all Believers, by virtue of the
Grace of Christ Jesus administred in the
Gospel. Both the <hi>Prayer</hi> of the Prophet for
himself, and the <hi>Promise</hi> of the Apostle in
the name of God unto us, do manifest
of how great importance this Matter is,
as we shall declare it to be immediately.</p>
               <p>THERE are some things supposed or
included in these words of the Apostle.
These we must first a little enquire into,
without which we cannot well understand
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49192:10"/>
the Truth it self proposed in them. As,</p>
               <p>IT is supposed, that <hi>Sin doth still abide
in and dwell with Believers.</hi> For so is the
meaning of the words. That sin which is <hi>in
you</hi> shall not have <hi>Dominion over you;</hi> that
is, none of them who are not sensible of it,
who groan not to be delivered from it, as
the Apostle doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> vij. 24. Those who
are otherwise minded, know neither them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
nor what is sin, nor wherein the
Grace of the Gospel doth consist. There
is the <hi>Flesh</hi> remaining in every one which
lusteth against the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 17. And
it adheres unto all the faculties of our souls;
whence it is called the <hi>old Man, Rom.</hi> 6. 6.
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 22. in opposition unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
of our minds, and all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of them called the <hi>New Man,</hi> or <hi>New
Creature</hi> in us. And there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>Rom.</hi> xiij. 14. a continual
working and <hi>Provision</hi> to fulfil its own
Lusts: So that it abides in us in the way
of a dying, decaying <hi>Habit,</hi> weakned and
impaired; but acting its self in <hi>Inclinations,
Motions</hi> and <hi>Desires,</hi> suitable unto its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>AS Scripture and Experience concurr
herein, so a supposition of it is the only
ground of the whole Doctrine of <hi>Evangelical
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49192:10"/>
Mortification.</hi> That this is a Duty, a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
incumbent on Believers all the days of
their lives, such a Duty as without which
they can never perform any other in a due
manner; will not be denied by any, but
either such as are wholly under the Power
of Atheistical Blindness, or such as, by the
fever of spiritual Pride, have lost the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of their own miserable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and so lie dreaming about absolute
Perfection. With neither sort are we at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
concerned. Now the first proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of this <hi>Mortification</hi> is this sin that
dwells in <hi>us.</hi> It is the <hi>Flesh</hi> which is to
be mortified, the <hi>old Man</hi> which is to be
crucified, the <hi>Lusts of the Flesh</hi> with all
their corrupt Inclinations, Actings, and
Motions that are to be destroyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi.
6. <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> iij. 1. Unless this be
well fixed in the mind, we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the greatness of the Grace and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
here expressed.</p>
               <p>2. IT is supposed that this <hi>Sin</hi> which in
the remainders of it, so abides in Believers,
in various degrees, may put forth its Power
in them, to <hi>obtain Victory and Dominion</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them. It is first supposed, that it hath
this Dominion in some, that it doth bear
Rule over all Unbelievers, all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49192:11"/>
the Law; and then that it will strive
to do the same in them that believe, and
are under Grace. For affirming that <hi>it
shall not have Dominion over us,</hi> he grants
that it may or doth contend for it, only it
shall not have <hi>success,</hi> it shall not prevail.
Hence it is said to <hi>fight</hi> and <hi>war</hi> in us, <hi>Rom.</hi>
vij. 23. and to <hi>fight against our Souls,</hi> 1 Pet.
ij. 12. Now it thus fights and wars and
contends in us for Dominion; for that is
the end of all War: Whatever <hi>fights,</hi> it
doth it for <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS therefore is the general design of
Sin in all its Actings. These Actings are
various, according to the variety of Lusts
in the minds of men; but its general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in them all, is <hi>Dominion.</hi> Where any
one is tempted and seduced of his own
Lusts, as the Apostle <hi>James</hi> speaks, be it
in a matter never so small or so unusual, or
the Temptations thereunto may never
occurr again; the design of sin lies not in
the particular Temptation, but to make it
a means to obtain <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Soul.
And the consideration hereof should keep
Believers always on their guard against all
the motions of Sin; though the matter of
them seem but small, and the occasions of
them such as are not like to return. For the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49192:11"/>
aim and tendancy of every one of them is
<hi>Dominion and Death,</hi> which they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
if not stopt in their Progress, as the
Apostle there decalres, <hi>James</hi> i. 14, 15.
Believe not its flatteries, <hi>is it not a little
one?</hi> this is the <hi>first</hi> or shall be the <hi>last</hi> time:
It requires only a little <hi>place</hi> in the Mind
and Affections, it shall go no farther: Give
not place to its urgency and solicitations;
admit of none of its excuses or promises;
it is power over your Souls unto their Ruine
that it aims at in all.</p>
               <p>3. THERE are two ways in general
whereby sin acts its Power, and aims at
the obtaining this <hi>Dominion,</hi> and they are
the two only ways whereby any may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
or attain an unjust Dominion; and
they are <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Force;</hi> both of which
I have fully described in another Discourse.
With respect whereunto it is promised,
that the Lord Christ shall deliver the Souls
of the Poor that cry unto him, from <hi>Deceit
and Violence,</hi> Psal. lxxii. 14.</p>
               <p>THESE are the two only ways of
obtaining an unjust Dominion; and where
they are in conjunction, they must have a
mighty prevalency, and such as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Contest hazardous. There are
few Believers but have found it so, at least
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49192:12"/>
in their own apprehensions; they have
been ready to say at one time or another,
we shall one day fall by the hand of this
Enemy; and have been forced to cry out
unto Jesus Christ for help and succour with
no less vehemency than the Disciples did
at Sea, when the Ship was covered with
Waves, <hi>Lord save us, we perish,</hi> Matth. viij.
24, 25. And so they <hi>would do,</hi> did he not
come in <hi>seasonably to their succour,</hi> Heb.
ij. 18. And herein the Soul hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
no less Experience of the Power
of Christ in his Grace, than the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
on their <hi>Out-cry</hi> had of his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Authority, when he <hi>rebuked the
Winds and the Seas, and there was a great
Calm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Dominion of Sin is that which
we have here security given us against:
Though it will <hi>abide</hi> in us, though it will
<hi>contend</hi> for Rule by Deceit and Force, yet
it shall not prevail, it shall not have the
Dominion.</p>
               <p>AND this is a Case of the highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
unto us. Our Souls are and must
be under the Rule of some Principle or
Law. And from this Rule, our State is
determined and denominated. We are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Servants of Sin unto Death, or of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49192:12"/>
Obedience unto Righteousness,</hi> Rom. vi. 16.
This is the Substance of the Discourse of
the Apostle in that whole Chapter; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the state of the Soul, as unto life
and death eternal, follows the <hi>Conduct and
Rule</hi> that we are under. If Sin have the
<hi>Dominion,</hi> we are lost for ever. If it be
dethrown'd, we are safe. It may tempt,
seduced and entice, it may fight, war, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
and disquiet, it may surprize into
actual Sin; yet if it <hi>have not the Dominion</hi>
in us, we are in a state of Grace and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
with God.</p>

                  <item>III. What is the <hi>Reason and Evidence</hi> of
the Assurance here given us, That Sin
shall not have Dominion over us;
namely, because we are not under the
Law, but under Grace.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. AS unto the first of these, I shall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
recount some such Properties of it, as
will discover its Nature in general; the
<hi>particulars</hi> wherein it doth consist, will be
considered afterwards.</p>
               <p>1. THE Dominion of Sin is <hi>perverse and
evil,</hi> and that on both the Accounts which
render any Rule or Dominion so to be.
For,</p>
               <p>1. IT is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>surped.</hi> Sin hath <hi>no Right</hi>
to rule in the Souls of Men. Men have no
power to give Sin a <hi>Right</hi> to rule over
them. They may voluntarily enslave
themselves unto it; but this gives Sin no
<hi>Right or Title.</hi> All men have originally
<hi>another Lord,</hi> unto whom they owe all O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
nor can any thing discharge them
from their Allegiance thereunto: And this
is the <hi>Law of God.</hi> The Apostle saith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that unto whom Men yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
servants to obey, his Servants they
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49192:13"/>
are to whom they obey, whether of Sin
unto Death, or of Obedience unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<hi>v.</hi> 19. And so it is, men are
thereby the proper Servants of Sin; they
become so by their own voluntary Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
unto it: But this gives Sin no <hi>Title</hi>
against the Law of God, whose Right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
it is to bear sway in the souls of men.
For all that give up themselves to the service
of Sin, do live in actual Rebellion against
their natural Leige Lord. Hence sundry
things do follow:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> THE great <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the
evil of a state of Sin. Men who live there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
do voluntarily wrest themselves, what
lieth in them, from under the Rule of the
Law of God, and give up themselves to
be slaves unto this Tyrant. Could it lay
any <hi>claim</hi> to this <hi>Dominion,</hi> had it any <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>
to plead, it were some Alleviation of
Guilt in them that give up themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it. But men <hi>yield up themselves</hi> to the
slavery of sin, as the Apostle speaks; they
reject the Rule of God's Law, and chuse
this foreign yoke, which cannot but be an
aggravation of their sin and misery. Yet
so it is, that the greatest part of men do
visibly and openly profess themselves the
servants and slaves of Sin. They wear its
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49192:14"/>
Livery, and do all its Drudgery; yea they
boast themselves in their Bondage, and
never think themselves so Brave and Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
as when by profane Swearing, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,
Uncleanness, Covetousness, and
Scoffing at Religion, they openly disavow
the Lord whom they serve, the Master to
whom they do belong. But their <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sleepeth not,</hi> whatever they may <hi>dream</hi>
in the mean time.</p>
               <p>2. HENCE it follows that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all Men have a <hi>Right</hi> in themselves, to
cast off the Rule of Sin, and to vindicate
themselves into liberty. They may when
they will, plead the Right and Title of
the Law of God unto the Rule of their
Souls, to the utter Exclusion of all Pleas
and Pretences of Sin, for its Power. They
have Right to say unto it, <hi>Get thee hence,
what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ALL Men, I say, have this <hi>Right</hi> in
themselves, because of the natural Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
they owe to the Law of God; but
they have not <hi>Power</hi> of themselves to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
this <hi>Right,</hi> and actually to cast off
the yoke of sin; but this is the work of
Grace. Sin's Dominion is broke only by
Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49192:14"/>
BUT you will say then, Unto what
end serves this <hi>Right,</hi> if they have not
Power in themselves to put it in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
And how can it be charged as an
Aggravation of their sin, that they do not
use the Right which they have, seeing they
have no <hi>Power</hi> so to do? Will you blame
a Man that hath a Right to an Estate if he
do not recover it, when he hath no means
so to do?</p>
               <p>I answer briefly Three Things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1st.</hi> NO Man living neglects the <hi>use
of this Right,</hi> to cast off the Yoke and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin, because he <hi>cannot</hi> of himself
make use of it; but meerly because he
will not. He doth <hi>voluntarily chuse</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
under the Power of Sin, and looks on
every thing as his Enemy, that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
him. <hi>The carnal Mind is Enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
God, it is not subject unto his Law,
nor can it be, Rom.</hi> viii. 7. When the Law
comes at any time to claim its Right and
Rule over the Soul, a Man under the Power
of Sin, looks on it as his Enemy that comes
to disturb his Peace, and fortifies his mind
against it. And when the Gospel comes
and tenders the way and means for the
Souls delivery, offering its aid and assistance
unto that end; this also is looked on as an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49192:15"/>
Enemy, and is rejected, and all its offers
unto that end. See <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25. and <hi>John</hi> iii. 19. This then is the
Condition of every one that abides under
the Dominion of Sin: He <hi>chuses so to do;</hi>
he continues in that state by an act of his
own Will; he avows an Enmity unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing which would give him delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
which will be a sore Aggravation
of his Condemnation at the last day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> GOD may justly require that
of any, which it is in the Power of the
<hi>Grace of the Gospel</hi> to enable them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
and comply withal. For this is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
unto them in the Preaching of it every
day. And although we know not the
ways and means of the effectual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of Grace unto the Souls of men;
yet this is certain, that Grace is so tendred
in the preaching of the Gospel, that none
go without it, none are destitute of its aids
and assistances, but those alone, who by a
<hi>free act of their own Wills,</hi> do refuse and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it. This is that which the whole
Cause depends on; <hi>You will not come unto
me, that you may have Life.</hi> And this all
Unbelievers have or may have Experience
of in themselves. They may know on
a due Examination of themselves, that they
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49192:15"/>
do <hi>voluntarily</hi> refuse the assistance of Grace,
which is offered for their deliverance.
Therefore is their destruction of themselves.
But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> THERE is a time, when Men
lose even the Right also. He who gave up
himself to have his Ear bored, lost all his
claim unto future Liberty; he was not to
go out at the year of <hi>Jubile.</hi> So there is a
Time when God <hi>judicially</hi> gives up Men to
the Rule of Sin, to abide under it for ever;
so as that they lose all <hi>Right</hi> unto Liberty.
So he dealt with many of the <hi>Idolatrous
Gentiles of old,</hi> Rom. i. 24, 26, 28. and so
continues to deal with the like profligate
Sinners. So he acts towards the <hi>generality</hi>
of the <hi>Anti-christian World,</hi> 2 Thess. ii. 11,
12. and with many despisers of the Gospel,
<hi>Isa.</hi> vi. 9, 10. When it is come to this,
Men are <hi>cast at Law;</hi> and have lost all
Right and Title unto <hi>Liberty</hi> from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin. They may repine sometimes
at the Service of Sin or the Consequence
of it, in Shame and Pain, in the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Distempers that will pursue many in
their Uncleanness; yet God having given
them up <hi>judicially</hi> unto Sin, they have not
so much as a Right to put up one Prayer or
Petition for deliverance; nor will they do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49192:16"/>
so, but are bound in the fetters of cursed
Presumption or Despair. See their Work
and Wages, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 5, 6. This is the most
woeful state and condition of Sinners in
this World; an unavoidable entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chambers of Death. You that
have lived long under the power of Sin,
beware least that come upon you which
is spoken of in these Scriptures. You have
as yet a <hi>Right</hi> unto deliverance from that
bondage and servitude wherein you are, if
you put in your Claim in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
You know not how soon you may
be deprived of <hi>this also,</hi> by God's giving
you up judicially unto Sin and Satan.
Then all Complaints will be too late, and
all springs of endeavours for Relief be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
dry'd up. All your Reserves for a
future Repentance shall be cut off, and all
your Cries shall be despised: <hi>Prov.</hi> i. 25,
26, 27, 28, 29. Whilst it is yet <hi>called to
day harden not your hearts,</hi> least God <hi>swear
in his wrath, that you shall never enter into
his Rest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT you may be warned, take
notice that the <hi>Signs</hi> or <hi>Symptoms</hi> of the
approach of such a season, of such an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
condition, are (1.) a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
in the practice of any known sin.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49192:16"/>
There are bounds of divine Patience. The
long suffering of God for a time <hi>waits for
Repentance, 1 Pet.</hi> iij. 20. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> iij. 9.
But there is a time, when it doth only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<hi>Vessels of Wrath,</hi> fitted for Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 22. which is commonly after
a long continuance in known sin. (2.)
When Convictions have been digested,
and Warnings despised. God doth not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
deal thus with Men, until they have
rejected the means of their Deliverance.
There is a Generation indeed, who from
their youth up do live in a contempt of
God; such are those proud sinners whom
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> describes, <hi>Psal.</hi> x. 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are seldom any tokens of
the going forth of the Decree against this
sort of Men. The appearing evidences of
it, are their <hi>adding drunkenness unto thirst;</hi>
one kind of sin unto another, making a
visible Progress in sinning, adding boasting
and a profane Contempt of all things Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
unto their Course in Sin. But ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
those that are in danger of this <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Hardness,</hi> have had warnings and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
which made some impression on
them; but are now left without any Calls
and Rebukes, or at least any sense of
them. (3). When Men contract the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49192:17"/>
guilt of such Sins, as seem to entrench on the
unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost.
Such as proud, contemptuous, malicious
Reproaches of the ways of God, of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
of the Spirit of Christ and his Gospel.
This sort of Persons are frequently marked
in the Scripture, as those who at least are
nigh unto a final and fatal Rejection. (4.)
A <hi>voluntary relinquishment of the means of
Grace,</hi> and Conversion unto God, which
men have enjoy'd. And this is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accompanied with an hatred of the word,
and those by whom it is dispensed. Such
Persons God frequently, and that visibly,
gives up in an irrecoverable way unto the
dominion of Sin. He declares that he will
have no more to do with them. (5.) The
resolved choise of wicked, profane, unclean
scoffing Society. It is very rare that any
are recovered from that snare. And many
other Signs there are of the near approach
of such an hardning Judgment, as shall
give up men everlastingly to the service of
Sin. Oh that poor Sinners would awake,
before it be too late.</p>
               <p>2. THIS <hi>Dominion</hi> of Sin is <hi>evil and
perverse,</hi> not only because it is <hi>unjust</hi> and
usurped, but because it is always used and
exercised unto <hi>ill Ends,</hi> unto the Hurt and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49192:17"/>
Ruine of them over whom it is. An Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
may make use of his Power and Rule for
good Ends, for the good of them over whom
he rules. But all the <hi>ends</hi> of the Dominion
of sin are evil unto sinners. Sin in its <hi>Rule</hi>
will pretend fair, offer sundry advantages
and satisfactions unto their Minds. They
shall have <hi>Wages</hi> for their Work: <hi>Pleasure
and Profit</hi> shall come in by it. Yea on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
pretences it will promise them eternal
Rest at the close of all; at least that they
shall not fail of it by any thing they do in
its service: And by such means it keeps
them in security. But the whole real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it, that which in all its Power it
operates towards, is the eternal Ruine of
their Souls; and this Sinners will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
when it is too late, <hi>Jerem.</hi> ij. 13, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> THIS Dominion of sin is not a
<hi>meer force</hi> against the Will and Endeavours
of them that are under it. Where all the
Power and Interest of Sin consists in <hi>putting
a force</hi> on the mind and soul by its Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
there it hath no Dominion. It may
perplex them, it doth not rule over them:
Where it hath Dominion, it hath the force
and power of a <hi>Law</hi> in the Wills and Minds
of them in whom it is. Hereby it requires
Obedience of them, and they yield up
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49192:18"/>
themselves <hi>Servants to obey it,</hi> Rom. vi. 16.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE unto this <hi>Dominion</hi>
of sin, there is required a <hi>Consent of the
Will</hi> in some measure and degree. The
<hi>constant Reluctancy</hi> and conquering Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the Will against it, defeats its Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
unto Rule and Dominion; as the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi>
declares at large in the next <hi>Chapter.</hi>
The Will is the sovereign Faculty and
Power of the Soul; whatever Principle
acts in it, and determines it, that hath the
Rule. Notwithstanding Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction,
the determination of the whole,
as unto Duty and Sin, is in the power of
the <hi>Will.</hi> If the will of sinning be taken
away, sin cannot have Dominion. Here
is Wisdom. He that can distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Impressions of Sin upon him,</hi> and
the <hi>Rule of Sin in him,</hi> is in the way of
Peace. But this oft-times (as we shall far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
see, with the Reason of it) is not
easily to be attained unto. Convictions on
the one hand, will make a great Pretence
and Appearance of an Opposition in the
Will unto Sin, by their unavoidable Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
on it, when it is not so. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
Affections under Temptations,
will plead, that the <hi>Will it self</hi> is given up
unto the choice and service of sin, when it
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49192:18"/>
is not so. The Will in this Matter is like
the <hi>Thebans Shield,</hi> whilst that was safe
they conceited themselves victorious, even
in death. However this Case is determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the light of Scripture and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and it is here proposed unto a Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> IT is required unto this <hi>domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of sin, that the soul be not under any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>supreme Conduct;</hi> that is, of the Spirit
of God, and of his Grace by the Law.
This is that which really hath the <hi>sovereign</hi>
Rule in all Believers: They are <hi>led by the
Spirit, guided by the Spirit,</hi> acted and ruled
by him, and are thereby under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of God and Christ, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
With this the <hi>Rule of Sin</hi> is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
inconsistent. No Man can at once
serve these two Masters. Grace and Sin
may be in the same Soul at the same time;
but they cannot bear Rule in the same Soul
at the same time. The <hi>Throne</hi> is singular,
and will admit but of one Ruler. Every
Evidence we have of being under the Rule
of Grace, is so, that we are not under the
Dominion of Sin.</p>
               <p>THIS therefore is the principal way
and means which we have to secure our
Peace and Comfort against the Pretences
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49192:19"/>
of Sin, unto the disquietment of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.
Let us endeavour to preserve an
Experience of the Rule of Grace in our
Hearts, <hi>Col.</hi> iij. 15. Under a Conduct and
Rule whence our state is <hi>denominated,</hi> we
are and must be. This is either of Sin or
Grace. There is no Composition nor Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partnership
between them, as to Rule:
As to <hi>Residence</hi> there is, but not as unto
<hi>Rule.</hi> If we can assure our selves of the
one, we secure our selves from the other.
It is therefore our Wisdom, and lies at the
foundation of all our Comforts, that we
get Evidences and Experience of our being
under the Rule of Grace; and it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it self, if we are not wanting unto a
due Observation of its acting, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in us. And it will do it, among others,
these Two ways.</p>
               <p>1. BY keeping up a <hi>Constancy of design</hi>
in living to God, and after Conformity
unto Christ, notwithstanding the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of surprizals by Temptations, and
the most urgent solicitations of Sin: This
is called, <hi>Cleaving unto God, with purpose of
Heart, Acts</hi> xi. 23. This will be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Grace hath the Rule. As a Man that
goeth to Sea, designs some certain Place
and Port, whither he guides his Course;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49192:19"/>
in his way he meets, it may be, with
Storms and cross Winds, that drive him
out of his Course, and sometimes directly
backward, towards the Place where he set
forth; but his design still holds, and in
the pursuit thereof, he applies his Skill and
Industry, to retrieve and recover all its
losses and back-drivings; by cross Winds
and Storms. So is it with a Soul under
the <hi>Conduct of Grace;</hi> its fixed design is to
live unto God; but in its Course it meets
with Storms and cross Winds of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and various Artifices of Sin. These
disturb him, disorder him, drive him back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
sometimes, as if it would take a
contrary Course, and return unto the Coast
of Sin from whence it set out. But where
Grace hath the Rule and Conduct, it will
weather all these Oppositions and Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
it will <hi>restore the Soul,</hi> bring it again
into order, recover it from the confusions
and evil Frames that it was drawn into.
It will give a fresh predominancy unto its
<hi>prevalent design</hi> of living unto God in all
things. It will do this constantly as often
as the soul meets with such ruffles from
the Power of Sin; when there is a radical
firmitude and strength in a Cause or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
it will work it self out, through all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49192:20"/>
changes and variations. But when the
strength of any Cause is but Occasion, the
first opposition and disorder will ruine us.
So, if Mens purposes of living unto God,
be only occasional from present Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the first vigorous Opposition or Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
will disorder it, and overthrow it.
But where this is the radical Design of the
Soul, from the Power of Grace, it will
break through all such Oppositions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
its Prevalency in the Mind and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Hereby doth it evidence its Rule,
and that the whole Interest of Sin in the
Soul is by Rebellion, and not by virtue of
Dominion.</p>
               <p>2. IT doth so, by keeping up a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Exercise of Grace</hi> in all religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
or, at least, a sincere endeavour, that
so it may be. Where Sin hath the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
it can allow the Soul to perform re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Duties, yea, in some cases, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in them. But it will take care that
divine Grace be not exercised in them.
Whatever there may be of delight in Duties
or other motions of Affection, which Light,
and Gifts, and Afflictions, and Superstition
will occasion, there is no exercise of divine
Faith and Love in them: This belongs <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi>
and inseparably unto the Rule of Grace.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49192:20"/>
Where-ever that bears sway, the Soul will
endeavour the constant Exercise of Grace
in all its Duties, and never be satisfied in
the <hi>Work done,</hi> without some sense of it.
Where it fails therein, it will judge it self,
and watch against the like surprizals; yea,
unless it be in case of some great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the present sense of the guilt of Sin,
which is the highest Obstruction against
that spiritual <hi>Boldness,</hi> which is required
unto the due exercise of Grace, that is of
Faith and Love in holy Duties, shall not
hinder the Soul from endeavouring after it,
or the use of it.</p>
               <p>IF by these means, and the like <hi>insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Operations of Grace,</hi> we can have an
assuring Experience, that we are under the
Rule and Conduct of it, we may be free
in our Minds from disturbing Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Dominion of Sin; for both can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bear sway in the same Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>4thly.</hi> IT is required hereunto, that
sin makes the Soul <hi>sensible</hi> of its Power and
Rule, at least doth that which may do so,
unless Conscience be utterly seared and
hardned, and so <hi>past feeling.</hi> There is no
Rule nor Dominion, but they are or may
be sensible of it, who are subject thereunto.
And there are <hi>two Ways</hi> whereby sin in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49192:21"/>
its Dominion, will make them sensible of
it in whom it rules.</p>
               <p>1. IN <hi>repressing</hi> and overcoming the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of the Convictions of the Mind.</hi> Those
who are under the Dominion of Sin (as
we shall see more immediately) may have
Light into, and Conviction of their Duty,
in many things. And this Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
they may follow <hi>ordinarily,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the Dominion of Sin. As a
Tyrant will permit his slaves and subjects
<hi>ordinarily</hi> to follow their own Occasions;
but if what they would do, comes either
in matter or manner to enterfere with or
oppose his Interest, he will make them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of his Power. So Sin, where it hath
the Dominion, if Men have Light and
Conviction, it will allow them <hi>ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and in many things to comply therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
It will allow them to pray, to hear
the Word, to abstain from sundry sins, to
perform many duties, as is expresly affirmed
in the Scripture, of many that were under
the power of Sin, and we see it in Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.
How much work do we see about
Religion and religious Duties? What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
observation of the Times and Seasons
of them? How many duties performed
morally good in themselves and useful, by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49192:21"/>
them, who on many other Accounts, do
proclaim themselves to be under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin? But if the Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of this sort of Persons do rise up in
opposition unto the principal Interest of
Sin, in those Lusts and ways wherein it
exerciseth its Rule, it will make them, in
whom they are, sensible of its Power. They
that stifle, or shut their Eyes against, or
cast out of mind, or go directly contrary
unto their Convictions; Light in such cases
will first repine, and them relieve it self
with Resolutions for other times and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
but Sin will carry the Cause by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of its Dominion.</p>
               <p>HENCE Two Things do follow.</p>
               <p>1. A <hi>Constant Repugnancy</hi> against Sin,
from Light in the Mind and Conviction in
the Conscience, doth not prove that those
in whom it is, are not under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin. For until blindness and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
do come on Men to the uttermost, there
will be in them a judging of what is <hi>Good
and Evil,</hi> with a <hi>self-judging</hi> with respect
thereunto, as the Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi>
ij. 15. And herein many do satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
When their Light condemns Sin,
they suppose they hate it; but they do not.
When Convictions call for Duties, they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49192:22"/>
suppose they love them; but they do not.
That which they look on as the <hi>Rule</hi> of
<hi>Light</hi> in them, in opposition unto Sin, is
but the Rebellion of a natural enlightned
Conscience, against the Dominion of it in the
Heart. In brief; Light may condemn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
known sin, keep from many, press for
every known Duty, lead to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of many; yet sin have a full domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in the soul. And this it will evidence
when it comes to the trial, in those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
where it exercises its <hi>ruling</hi> Power.</p>
               <p>2. THAT miserable is their Condition
whose Minds are ground continually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Conduct of their Light,</hi> with the
urgency of Conviction on the one hand,
and the <hi>Rule or Dominion of Sin</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Where-ever Light is, it is its due to
have the Rule and Conduct. It is that
Act whereby the Mind loads it self. For
Men to be forced by the Power of their
<hi>Lusts,</hi> to act for the most part against their
<hi>Light,</hi> as they do where Sin hath the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
it is a sad and deplorable condition.
Such Persons are said to <hi>rebel against the
Light, Job</hi> xxiv. 13. because of its right
to rule in them, where it is deposed by Sin.
This makes most Men but a <hi>troubled Sea
that cannot rest, whose Waves cast up mire and
dirt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49192:22"/>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> Sin will make those in whom it
hath dominion <hi>sensible</hi> of its Power, by
its continual solicitations of the Mind and
Affections, with respect unto that sin, or
those sins wherein it principally exerciseth
its Rule. Having possessed the Will and
Inclinations of the Mind with the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as it doth where-ever its Dominion is
absolute, it continually disposeth, enclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and stirreth up the Mind towards those
sins. It will level the Bent of the whole
Soul towards such sins or the circumstances
of them. Nor is there a more pregnant
discovery of the Rule of Sin in any than
this, that it <hi>habitually</hi> engageth the Mind
and Affections, unto a constant exercise of
themselves about this or that, some Sin,
and evil Way or other.</p>
               <p>BUT yet we must add, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these indications of the ruling
Power of Sin, they are but <hi>few</hi> in whom it
hath this Dominion, that are convinced of
their State and Condition. Many are so
under the Power of Darkness, of supine
sloath and negligence, and are so desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wicked, as that they have no sense of
this Rule of Sin. Such are those described
by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> iv. 18, 19. And
whereas they are the vilest Slaves that live
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49192:23"/>
on the Earth, they judge none to be free
but themselves: They look on others as in
Bondage to foolish and <hi>superstitious fears,</hi>
whilst they are at liberty to Drink, Swear,
Scoff at Religion, Whore, and Defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without controul. This is their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
and they may have that which is
as good in <hi>Hell;</hi> a Liberty to Curse and
Blaspheme God, and to fly with revengeful
Thoughts on themselves, and the whole
Creation. The <hi>Light</hi> in such Persons is
<hi>Darkness it self;</hi> so as that they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to rise up in opposition unto the rule
of Sin, whence alone a sense of its Power
doth arise. Others (as we observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
living in some compliance with their
Light and Convictions, abstaining from
many Sins, and performing many Duties,
though they live in some known sin or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and allow themselves in it, yet will
not allow that Sin hath the Dominion in
them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore there are Two Things hard
and difficult in this Case.</p>
               <p>1. TO convince those in whom Sin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently
hath the Dominion, that such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is their State and Condition; they
will with their utmost endeavour keep of
the Conviction hereof. Some <hi>justifie</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49192:23"/>
and some will make no Enquiry
into this matter. It is a rare thing, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of late, to have any brought under
this Conviction by the Preaching of the
Word; though it be the Case of multitudes
that attend unto it.</p>
               <p>2. TO <hi>satisfie</hi> some, that Sin hath not
the Dominion over them, notwithstanding
its restless acting it self in them, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against their Souls; yet, unless this
can be done, it is impossible they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
solid Peace and Comfort in this Life.
And the Concernment of the best of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
whilst they are in this World, doth
lie herein. For as they grow in Light, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituality,
Experience, freedom of Mind
and Humility, the more they love to know
of the Deceit, Activity and Power of the
Remainders of Sin. And although it works
not at all, at least not sensibly in them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
those Sins wherein it reigneth and
rageth in others; yet they are able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern
its more subtil, inward and spiritual
Actings in the Mind and Heart to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Grace, the obstructing of its effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Operations in holy Duties, with many
indispositions unto stability in the Life of
God, which fills them with trouble.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Second Enquiry spoken to; Whether Sin
hath Dominion in us or no? In answer to
which it's shewed, That some wear Sin's Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and they are the professed Servants
thereof. There are many in which the Case
is dubious, where Sin's service is not so
discernable. Several Exceptions are put
in against its Dominion, where it seems to
prevail. Some certain Signs of its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
Graces and Duties to be exercised for
its Mortification.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THESE things being thus premised
in general, concerning the Nature
of the Dominion of Sin, we shall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
unto our principal Enquiry; namely,
<hi>Whether Sin have Dominion in us or no?</hi>
whereby we may know, <hi>Whether we are
under the Law or under Grace,</hi> or what is
the state of our Souls towards God. An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
this is, which is very necessary for
some to make, and for all to have rightly
determined in their Minds, from Scripture
and Experience. For on that determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
depends all our solid Peace. Sin will
be in us; it will lust, fight, and entice us;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49192:24"/>
but the <hi>great Question,</hi> as unto our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
and Comfort is, whether it hath <hi>Dominion
over us or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. WE do not enquire concerning them
in whom the reign of Sin is absolute and
easily discernable, if not to themselves, yet
to others. Such there are, who <hi>visibly
yield up their Members instruments of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness
to Sin,</hi> Rom. vi. 13. Sin
reigns in their <hi>mortal Bodies, and they open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obey it in the Lusts thereof,</hi> v. 12. They
are avowedly <hi>Servants of Sin unto Death,</hi>
v. 16. and are not ashamed of it. <hi>The shew
of their Countenance doth witness against them;
they declare their Sin as Sodom; they hide
it not,</hi> Isa. iij. 9. Such are those described,
<hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 18, 19. and such the World is
filled withal. Such as being under the
Power of Darkness and Enmity against
God, do act them in opposition to all seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Godliness, and in the service of various
Lusts. There is no question concerning
their state: They cannot themselves deny
that it is so with them. I speak not for
the liberty of Censuring, but for the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Judging. Those who openly <hi>wear
Sin's Livery,</hi> may well be esteemed to be
Sin's Servants; and they shall not fail to
receive Sin's Wages. Let them at present
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49192:25"/>
bear it never so high, and despise all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Convictions, they will find it <hi>bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in the latter end,</hi> Isa. l. 11. Eccles. xi. 9.</p>
               <p>2. BUT there are many in whom the
<hi>case is dubious,</hi> and not easie to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined;
for on the one hand, they may
have sundry things in them, which seem
<hi>repugnant</hi> unto the reign of Sin, but indeed
are not <hi>inconsistent</hi> with it. All Arguments
and Pleas from them in their vindication
may fail them on a trial. And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hand, there may be some in whom
the <hi>effectual working of sin</hi> may be so great
and perplexing, as to argue that it hath the
dominion, when indeed it hath not, but
is only a stubborn Rebel.</p>
               <p>THE things of the <hi>first sort</hi> which seem
destructive of, and <hi>inconsistent with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin,</hi> but indeed are not, may be
referred to five Heads.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>ILL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MINATION</hi> in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and spiritual Gifts, with Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Good and Evil, of all known Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Sins. This is that which some
Men live in a perpetual Rebellion against,
in one instance or another.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>A Change in the Affections,</hi> giving a
temporary Delight in Religious Duties,
with some constancy in their Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49192:25"/>
This also is found in many who are
yet evidently under the Power of Sin, and
spiritual Darkness.</p>
               <p>3. A <hi>Performance of many Duties</hi> both
Moral and Evangelical, for the substance
of them; and an Abstinence, out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
from many Sins. So was it with
the <hi>Young Man in the Gospel,</hi> who yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what was necessary to free him from
the Dominion of Sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> xix. 20, 21,
22, 23.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>REPENTANCE for Sin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>
This is that which most secure
themselves by; and a blessed security it is,
when it is Gracious, Evangelical, a fruit
of Faith, comprizing the Return of the
whole Soul to God. But there is that
which is legal, partial, respecting particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Sins only; which is not pleadable in
this Case. <hi>Ahab</hi> was no less under the
Dominion of Sin, when he had Repented
him, that he was before. And <hi>Judas</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
him before he hanged himself.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>PROMISES and Resolutions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sin for the future.</hi> But the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of many in these things, is like <hi>the
morning Cloud, and as the early Dew</hi> it
passeth away, as it is in the Prophet, <hi>Hos.</hi>
vi. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49192:26"/>
WHERE there is a Concurrence of
these things in any, they have good hopes,
at least, that they are <hi>not under the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin;</hi> nor is it easie to convince
them, that they are: And they may so
behave themselves herein, as that it is not
consistent with Christian Charity to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
them so to be. Howbeit, the <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy</hi>
that is in these things, hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
by many; and much more is by all
required to evidence the sincerity of Faith
and Holiness. No Man therefore can be
acquitted by pleas taken from them, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their subjection to the Reign of Sin.</p>
               <p>THE things of the <hi>second sort,</hi> whence
Arguments may be taken to prove the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin in any Person, which yet
will not certainly do it, are those which
we shall now examine. And we must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.</p>
               <p>1. THAT where Sin hath the <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
it doth indeed rule in the <hi>whole Soul,</hi>
and all the faculties of it. It is a <hi>vitious
Habit</hi> in all of them, corrupting them in
their several Natures and Power; with
that Corruption whereof they are capable.
So in the Mind, of Darkness and Vanity;
the Will, of Spiritual Deceit and Pervers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
the Heart, of Stubbornness and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49192:26"/>
Sin in its Power reaches unto, and
affects them all. But,</p>
               <p>2. IT doth <hi>evidence its Dominion,</hi> and
is to be tryed by its acting in the distinct
Faculties of the Mind; in the frame of the
Heart, and in the course of the Life.</p>
               <p>THESE are those which we shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine;
<hi>First,</hi> those which render the case
<hi>dubious;</hi> and then those that clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
it on the part of Sin.</p>
               <p>I shall not therefore at present give po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Evidences of Mens Freedom from
the Dominion of Sin; but only consider
the Arguments that lie against them, and
examine how far they are conclusive, or
how they may be defeated. And,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>WHEN Sin hath in any instance
possessed the Imagination, and thereby enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the cogitative Faculty in its Service, it
is a dangerous symptom of its Rule or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi>
Sin may exercise its Rule in the
Mind, Fancy, and Imagination, where
bodily strength or opportunity give no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
for its outward Perpetration. In
them the desires of Sin may be enlarged as
Hell, and the satisfaction of Lust taken in
with greediness. Pride and Covetousness,
and Sensuality may reign and rage in the
Mind, by corrupt Imaginations, when
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49192:27"/>
their outward Exercise is shut up by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of Life.</p>
               <p>THE first way whereby Sin acts it self,
or coins its Motions and Inclinations into
Acts, is by the <hi>Imagination, Gen.</hi> vi. 5.
The continual evil <hi>Figments of the Heart,</hi>
are as the bubbling of corrupt Waters from
a corrupted Fountain.</p>
               <p>THE Imaginations intended are the
<hi>fixing of the Mind on the Objects of Sin,</hi>
or sinful Objects by continual Thoughts,
with delight and complacency. They are
the Minds purveying for the <hi>satisfaction of
the Flesh in the Lusts thereof,</hi> Rom. xiij. 14.
whereby <hi>Evil Thoughts come to lodge,</hi> to
abide, to dwell in the Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> iv. 14.</p>
               <p>THIS is the first and proper Effect of
that <hi>Vanity of Mind</hi> whereby the Soul is
alienated from the Life of God. The
Mind being turned off from its proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
with a dislike of it, applies its self by
its Thoughts and Imaginations unto the
Pleasures and Advantages of Sin, seeking in
vain to recover the Rest and Satisfaction
which they have forsaken in God himself.
They follow after lying Vanities, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
their own Mercies, <hi>Jonah</hi> ij. 8. And
when they give themselves up unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
internal converse with the desires of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49192:27"/>
the Flesh, the Pleasures and Advantages of
Sin, with delight and approbation; Sin
may reign triumphantly in them, though
no appearance be made of it in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Conversation. Such are they who
have a <hi>Form of Godliness, but deny the Power
thereof;</hi> their hearts being fill'd with a Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of ungodly Lusts, as the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iij. 5.</p>
               <p>AND there are Three Evils, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whereunto, Sin doth exercise its reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power in the Imagination, in an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
manner.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>PRIDE, Self-Elation, Desire of
Power and Greatness.</hi> It is affirmed of the
<hi>Prince of Tyrus,</hi> that he said, <hi>He was a God,
and sat in the Seat of God,</hi> Ezek. xxviij. 3.
And the like foolish Thoughts are ascribed
unto the King of <hi>Babylon, Isa.</hi> xiv. 13, 14.
None of the Children of Men can attain so
great Glory, Power and Dominion in this
World, but that in their Imaginations and
Desires they can infinitely exceed what they
do enjoy; like him who wept, that he had
not another World to Conquer. They
have no bounds but to be <hi>as God,</hi> yea, to
be <hi>God;</hi> which was the first design of Sin
in the World. And there is none so poor
and low, but by his Imaginations, he can
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49192:28"/>
lift up and exalt himself almost into the
Place of God. This Vanity and Madness
God reproves in his Discourse with <hi>Job,
Chap.</hi> xl. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. And there
is nothing more genuine and proper unto
the Original Depravation and Corruption
of our Natures, than this <hi>Self-Exaltation</hi>
in foolish Thoughts and Imaginations;
because it first came upon us through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of <hi>being as God.</hi> Herein therefore
may Sin exercise its Dominion in the Minds
of Men; yea, in the empty Mind and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of these Imaginations, with those that
follow, consists the principal Part of the
Deceitful Ways of Sin. The Ways of Men
cannot satisfie themselves with what Sins
they can actually commit; but in these
Imaginations they rove endlessly, finding
satisfaction in their Renovation and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
<hi>Isa.</hi> lvij. 1.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>SENS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ALITY and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanness of
Life.</hi> It is said of some, <hi>That they have
their Eyes full of Adulteries, and that
they cannot cease from Sin, 2 Pet.</hi> ij. 14.
That is, their Imaginations are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
working about the Objects of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Lusts. These they think of Night
and Day, immiring themselves in all Filth
continually. <hi>Jude</hi> calls them <hi>filthy Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49192:28"/>
defiling the Flesh, v.</hi> 8. They live as
in a constant pleasing Dream by their vile
Imaginations, even when they cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish
their lustful desires. For such I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
cannot be better expressed than
by <hi>Dreams;</hi> wherein Men satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
with a supposed acting of what they
do not. Hereby do many wallow in the
mire of Uncleanness all their Days; and
for the most part are never wanting unto
the Effects of it, when they have Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and Advantage. And by this means
the most cloystered <hi>Recluses</hi> may live in
constant Adulteries, whereby multitudes of
them become actually the Sinks of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
This is that, which in the Root of
it is severely condemned by our <hi>Saviour,
Matth.</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NBELIEF, Distrust and hard
Thoughts of God,</hi> are of the same kind.
These will sometimes so possess the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of Men, as to keep them off from
all delight in God, to put them on contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
of flying from him; which is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Case, not here to be spoken unto.</p>
               <p>IN these and the like ways may Sin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
its Dominion in the Soul, by the
Mind and its Imagination. It may do so,
when no demonstration is made of it in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49192:29"/>
the outward Conversation. For, by this
means, the minds of men are defiled; and
then nothing is clean, <hi>all things are impure
unto them, Tit.</hi> i. 15. Their minds being
thus defiled, do defile all things to them,
their Enjoyments, their Duties, all they
have, and all that they do.</p>
               <p>BUT yet all failing, and Sin in this
kind doth not prove absolutely, that sin
hath not the Dominion in the Mind that it
had before. Something of this Vice and
Evil, may be found in them that are freed
from the reign of Sin. And there will be
so, until the <hi>Vanity</hi> of our Minds is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured and taken away, which will
not be in this World. Wherefore I shall
name the <hi>Exceptions,</hi> that may be put in
against the Title of Sin, unto Dominion in
the Soul; notwithstanding the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in some measure of this work of the
Imagination, in coining <hi>Evil figments</hi> in
the Heart. And,</p>
               <p>1. THIS is no Evidence of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin, where it is <hi>occasional</hi> arising
from the Prevalency of some present Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation;
take an Instance in the Case of
<hi>David.</hi> I no way doubt, but that in his
Temptation with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> his Mind was
possess'd with defiling Imaginations.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49192:29"/>
Wherefore on his Repentance, he not only
prays for the Forgiveness of his Sin, but
crys out with all fervency, that God <hi>would
create a clean Heart in him, Psal.</hi> li. 10. He
was sensible not only of the defilement of
his Person by his <hi>actual Adultery;</hi> but of his
Heart, by <hi>impure Imaginations.</hi> So it may
be in case of other Temptations. Whilst
Men are entangled with any Temptation,
of what sort soever it be, it will multiply
Thoughts about it in the Mind: Yea its
<hi>whole Power</hi> consists in a multiplication of
Evil Imaginations. By them it blinds the
Mind, draws it off from the consideration
of its Duty, and enticeth it unto a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Sin, <hi>Jam.</hi> i. 14. Wherefore in
this Case of a <hi>prevalent Temptation,</hi> which
may befal a true Believer, the corrupt
working of the Imagination, doth not
prove the Dominion of sin.</p>
               <p>IF it be enquired, How the Mind may
be freed and cleared of these perplexing,
defiling Imaginations, which arise from
the urgency of some present Temptation,
suppose about <hi>earthly Affairs,</hi> or the like?
I say, It will never be done by the most
strict Watch and Resolution against them;
nor by the most resolute Rejection of them.
They will return with new Violence, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49192:30"/>
new Pretences, though the Soul hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
it self a Thousand times, that so they
should not do. There is but one way for
the cure of this Distemper, and this is a
<hi>thorough Mortification of the Lust</hi> that feeds
them, and is fed by them. It is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to shake of the Fruit in this case, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we dig up the Root. Every Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
designs the satisfaction of some Lusts
of the Flesh or of the Mind. These Evil
Thoughts and Imaginations are the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Temptation in the Mind. There
is no riddance of them, no conquest to be
obtained over them, but by <hi>subduing the
Temptation;</hi> and no subduing the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but by the <hi>Mortification of the Lust,</hi>
whose satisfaction it is design'd unto. This
Course the Apostle directs unto, <hi>Col.</hi> iij.
3, 5. That which he enjoins is, that we
<hi>would not set our Minds on the things of the
Earth,</hi> in opposition unto the things above;
that is, that we would not fill our Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
and thereby our Affections with
them. But what is the way whereby we
may be enabled so to do? that is, saith he,
the <hi>universal Mortification of Sin,</hi> v. 5.</p>
               <p>FOR want of the Wisdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
hereof; or for want of its Practice,
thorough a secret <hi>unwillingness,</hi> to come
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49192:30"/>
up unto a <hi>full Mortification</hi> of Sin, some are
galled and perplexed, yea, and defiled
with foolish and vain Imaginations all their
days. And although they prove not the
Dominion of Sin, yet they will deprive
the Soul of that peace and comfort which
otherwise it might Enjoy.</p>
               <p>BUT yet there is much spiritual Skill
and Diligence required to discover, what
is the true Root and Spring of the foolish
<hi>Imaginations</hi> that may at any time possess
the Mind. For they lie deep in the Heart;
that <hi>Heart which is deep and deceitful,</hi> and
so are not easily discoverable. There are
many other Pretences of them. They do
not directly bespeak that Pride or unclean
Lusts which they proceed from; but they
make many other Pretences, and feign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ends. But the Soul that is watchful
and diligent may trace them to their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.
And if such Thoughts are strictly
examined at any time, what is their design,
whose work they do, what makes them so
busie in the Mind, they will confess the
Truth, both whence they came, and what
it is they aim at. Then is the Mind guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto its Duty, which is the Extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Lust, which they would make
Provision for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49192:31"/>
2. SUCH Imaginations are no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the Dominion of Sin, in what
degree soever they are, where they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictive;
where they are a burthen unto the
Soul, which it groans under and would be
delivered from. There is a full account given
by the Apostle, of the conflict between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling
Sin and Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> vij. And the
things which he ascribes unto Sin, are not the
first rising or involuntary Motions of it, nor
merely its Inclinati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns and Disposition: For
the things ascribed unto it, as that it <hi>Fights,
Rebels, Wars, leads Captive,</hi> acts as a <hi>Law,</hi>
cannot belong unto them; nor doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the outward acting or perpetration
of Sin, the doing, or accomplishing, or
finishing of it: For that cannot befal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as the Apostle declares, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> iij.
9. But it is the working of Sin by these
Imaginations in the Mind, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
of the Affections thereon, that
he doth intend. Now this he declares to
be the great burden of the Souls of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
that which makes them think their
Condition wretched and miserable in some
sort, and which they earnestly cry out for
deliverance from, <hi>v.</hi> 24. This is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case. These Figments of the Heart,
these Imaginations will arise in the Minds
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49192:31"/>
of Men. They will do so sometimes to an
high degree. They will impose them on
us with Deceit and Violence, leading Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
unto the Law of them; where they
are rejected, condemned, defied; they
will return again while there is any Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
remaining in the Mind, or Corruption
in the Affections. But if the Soul be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of them, if it labour under them, if
it look on them as those that fight against
its Purity, Holiness and Peace, if it pray
for deliverance from them, they are no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of the Dominion of Sin. Yea, a
great Evidence unto the contrary may be
taken from that firm Opposition unto
them, which the Mind is constantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in.</p>
               <p>3. THEY are not a proof of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin, when there is a prevalent
Detestation of the Lust from whence they
proceed, and whose promotion they design,
maintained in the Heart and Mind. I
confess, sometimes this cannot be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;
and all such various Imaginations
are but mere Effects of the incurable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Instability of our Minds. For
these administer continual occasion unto
random Thoughts: But for the most part,
(as we observed before) they are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49192:32"/>
in the service of some Lust, and tend
unto the satisfaction of it. They are that
which is prohibited by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi>
xiij. 14. <hi>Make no provision,</hi> &amp;c. And this
may be discovered on strict Examination.
Now when the Mind is fixed in a constant
detestation of that Sin, whereunto they
lead, as it is Sin against God, with a firm
Resolution against it, in all circumstances
that may occur; no proof can be thence
taken for the Dominion of Sin.</p>
               <p>4. SOMETIMES evil Thoughts are
the immediate Injections of Sathan, they
are on many Accounts most terrible unto
the Soul. Usually for the Matter of them,
they are dreadful, and oft-times blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.
And as unto the manner of their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Mind, it is, for the most part,
surprizing, furious and invisible. From such
Thoughts many have concluded themselves
to be absolutely under the Power of Sin
and <hi>Sathan.</hi> But they are by certain Rules
and infallible Signs, discoverable from
whence they do proceed. And on that
discovery all pretences unto the Dominion
of Sin in them, must disappear. And this
is the first Case which renders the Question
dubious, <hi>Whether Sin have the Dominion
in us or no?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:49192:32"/>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> IT is a sign of the Dominion of
Sin, when in any Instance it hath a preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in our Affections: Yea, they are the
Throne of Sin, where it acts its Power.
But this Case of the Affections, I have
handled so at large in my Discourse of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Mindedness, as I shall here very
briefly speak unto it, so as to give one Rule
only to make a Judgment by, concerning
the Dominion of Sin in them.</p>
               <p>THIS is certain, that where Sin hath the
Prevalency and Predominancy in our Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
there it hath the Dominion in the
whole Soul. The Rule is given us unto this
purpose, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> ij. 15. We are obliged to <hi>love
the Lord our God with all our Hearts, and all
our Souls.</hi> And therefore if there be in us a
predominant Love to any thing else, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is preferred unto God, it must be
from the Prevalency of a Principle of Sin
in us. And so it is with respect unto all
other Affections. If we love any thing
more than God, as we do if we will not
part with it for his sake, be it as a <hi>Right
Eye,</hi> or as a <hi>Right Hand</hi> unto us, if we
take more satisfaction and complacency in
it, and cleave more unto it in our Thoughts
and Minds than unto God, as Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
do in their Lusts, Interests, Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49192:33"/>
and Relations; if we trust more to
it, as unto a supply of our wants, than unto
God, as most do to the World; if our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
are enlarged, and our Diligence height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
in seeking after and attaining other
things, more than towards the Love and
Favour of God; if we fear the Loss of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, or Danger from them more
than we fear God; we are not under the
Rule of God or his Grace; but we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Dominion of Sin, which reigns in
our Affections.</p>
               <p>IT were endless to give Instances of this
Power of Sin in and over the Affections
of Men. Self-Love, Love of the World,
Delight in things sensual, an over-valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Relations and Enjoyments; with
sundry other things of an alike nature, will
easily evidence it. And to resolve the
Case under Consideration, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
               <p>1. THAT the prevalency of Sin in
the Affections, so far as to be a Symptom
of its Dominion, is discernable unto the
least beam of spiritual Light, with a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
searching into, and Judgment of our
selves. If it be so with any, and they
know it not, nor will be convinced of it,
(as it is with many) I know not what can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49192:33"/>
free them from being under the Reign of
Sin. And we see it so every day. Men,
all whose Ways and Actions proclaim, that
they are acted in all things, by an inordinate
Love of the World and Self, yet find nothing
amiss in themselves; nothing that they
do not approve of, unless it be that their
Desires are not satisfied according to their
Expectations. All the Commands we have
in the Scripture for Self-Searching, Trial
and Examination; all the Rules that are
given us unto that End, all the warnings
we have of the Deceitfulness of Sin, and
of our own Hearts; they are given us to
prevent this Evil of shutting our Eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the prevalent Corruption and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of our Affairs. And the Issue of all
our Endeavours in this kind, is in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of <hi>David</hi> to God himself, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix.
23, 24.</p>
               <p>2. WHEN Men have Convictions of
the irregularity and disorder of their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
yet are resolved to continue in the
State wherein they are, without the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
and amendment of them; because
of some Advantages and Satisfaction,
which they receive in their present State;
they seem to be under the Dominion of
Sin. So is it with those mention'd, <hi>Isa.</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:49192:34"/>
vij. 10. upon the Account of the present
satisfaction, delight and pleasure, that their
corrupt Affections do take in cleaving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately
unto their Objects, they will not
endeavour their Change and Alteration.</p>
               <p>3. THIS then is the sole safe Rule in
this Case. Whatever hold Sin may have
got in our Affections; whatever prevalency
it may have in them, however it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
and desile them; if we endeavour
sincerely the discovery of this Evil, and
therein set our selves constantly unto the
Mortification of our corrupt Affections by
all due means, there is not in their disorder
any Argument to prove the Dominion of
Sin in us. Our Affections, as they are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt,
are the proper Objects of the great
Duty of Mortification; which the Apostle
therefore calls our <hi>Members that are on the
Earth, Col.</hi> iij. 5. This is a safe Anchor for
the Soul in this Storm. If it live in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavour after the Mortification of
every discoverable Corruption, and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in the Affections, it is secure from the
Dominion of Sin. But as for such, as are
negligent in searching after the State of
their Souls, as unto the Inclinations and
Engagement of their Affections, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of themselves in their greatest irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49192:34"/>
resolvedly indulge themselves
in every way of Sin to gratifie their sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Affections, they must provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of Pleas for their Vindication; I know
them not. But the meaning of our present
Rule, will be farther manifest in what en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> IT is a dangerous sign of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of Sin, when after a Conviction of
their necessity, it prevaileth unto a neglect
of those ways and duties, which are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly
suited, directed and ordained unto
its Mortification and Destruction. This
may be cleared in some particulars.</p>
               <p>1. MORTIFICATION of Sin, is the
constant Duty of all Believers, of all who
would not have Sin have Dominion over
them. Where Mortification is sincere,
there is no <hi>Dominion of Sin;</hi> and where
there is no Mortification, there Sin doth
reign.</p>
               <p>2. THERE are some Graces and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are peculiarly suited and ordained
unto this End, that by them and their
Agency, the work of Mortification may
be carried on constantly in our Souls. What
they are, or some of them, we shall see
immediately.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49192:35"/>
3. WHEN Sin puts forth its Power
in any especial Lust, or in a strong Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto any actual Sin, then it is the duty
of the Soul to make diligent application of
those Graces and Duties, which are speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
and proper unto its Mortification.</p>
               <p>4. WHEN men have had a Conviction
of these Duties, and have attended unto
them according unto that Conviction; if
Sin prevail in them to a neglect or relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment
of those Duties, as unto their
performance, or as unto their application
unto the Mortification of Sin, it is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
sign that Sin hath Dominion in
them. And I distinguish between these
things, namely, a neglect of such Duties,
as unto their performance and a neglect
of the Application of them unto the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
of Sin. For men may, on other
Accounts, continue the observance of them,
or some of them, and yet not apply them
unto this especial End. And so all exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Duties may be observed, when Sin
reigneth in Triumph, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iij. 5.</p>
               <p>THE meaning of the Assertion being
stated, I shall now name some of those
Graces and Duties, unto whose Omission
and Neglect Sin may prevail, as unto an
Application of them unto the Mortification
of any Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49192:35"/>
THE <hi>First</hi> is, The daily exercise of
Faith on Christ as Crucified. This is the
great Fundamental Means of the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Sin in general, and which we
ought to apply unto every particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it. This the Apostle Discourseth
at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
Our <hi>Old Man,</hi> saith he, <hi>is crucified with
Christ, that the Body of Sin might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
that henceforth we should not serve
Sin.</hi> Our <hi>Old Man,</hi> or the Body of Sin,
is the Power and Reign of Sin in us. These
are to be <hi>destroyed;</hi> that is, so mortified,
that henceforth we should not <hi>serve Sin;</hi>
that we should be delivered from the Power
and Rule of it. This, saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> is
done in Christ: Crucified with him. It
is so meritoriously in his actual dying or
being Crucified for us; it is so virtually,
because of the certain Provision that is made
therein, for the Mortification of all Sin.
But it is so actually by the Exercise of Faith
on him as crucified, dead and buried, which
is the means of the actual Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the virtue of his Death unto us
for that End. Herein are we said to be
dead and buried with him, whereof Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
is the Pledge. So by the Cross of
Christ, <hi>the World is crucified unto us,</hi> and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49192:36"/>
we are so to the World, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 14. which
is the substance of the Mortification of all
Sin. There are several Ways whereby
the Exercise of Faith on Christ crucified, is
effectual unto this End.</p>
               <p>1. LOOKING unto him as such, will
beget holy Mourning in us, <hi>Zech.</hi> xij. 10.
<hi>They shall look on him whom they have pierced,
and mourn.</hi> It is a Promise of Gospel Times
and Gospel Grace. A view of Christ, as
pierced, will cause mourning in them that
have received the Promise of the Spirit of
Grace and Supplication there mentioned.
And this mourning is the Foundation of
Mortification. It is that godly Sorrow
which works <hi>Repentance</hi> unto Salvation,
<hi>not to be repented of, 2 Cor.</hi> vij. 10. And
Mortification of Sin is of the Essence of
Repentance. The more Believers are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in this View of Christ, the more
humble they are; the more they are kept
in that mourning frame, which is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
opposite unto all the Interest of Sin,
and which keeps the Soul watchful against
all its Attempts. Sin never reigned in an
humble mourning Soul.</p>
               <p>2. IT is effectual unto the same end,
by the way of a powerful Motive, as that
which calls and leads unto Conformity to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49192:36"/>
him. This is pressed by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi>
vi. 8, 9, 10, 11. Our Conformity unto
Christ, as crucified and dead, consists in
our being dead unto Sin, and thereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the reign of it in our mortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
This Conformity, saith he, we
ought to reckon on as our Duty; reckon
your selves dead unto Sin, that is, that
you ought so to be, in that Conformity,
which you ought to aim at unto Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
Can any spiritual Eye behold Christ
dying for Sin, and continue to live in Sin?
Shall we keep that alive in us, which he
dy'd for, that it might not eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
us? Can we behold him bleeding for
our Sins, and not endeavour to give them
their deaths Wound? The efficacy of the
Exercise of Faith herein unto the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sin, is known unto all Believers in
Experience.</p>
               <p>3. FAITH herein gives us Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him in his Death, and unites the
Soul unto it, in its Efficacy. Hence we
are said to be buried with him into Death,
and to be planted together in the likeness
of his Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 4, 5. Our <hi>Old Man
is crucified with him, v.</hi> 6. We have by Faith
Communion with him in his Death, unto
the death of Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49192:37"/>
THIS therefore is the first Grace and
Duty which we ought to attend unto for
the Mortification of Sin. But where Sin
hath that Interest and Power in the Mind,
as to take it off from this Exercise of Faith,
to prevent or obstruct it, as it will do, so as
that it will not, so as that it shall not dare to
think or meditate on Christ crucified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the inconsistency of such Thoughts,
with an Indulgence unto any Lust; it is
to be feared, that Sin is in the Throne.</p>
               <p>IF it be thus with any; if they have
not yet made use of this way and means for
the Mortification of Sin; or if being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it, they have been for any season
driven or withheld from the Exercise of
Faith herein, I have nothing to offer to
free them from this Evidence of the reign
of Sin, but only that they would speedily
and carefully address themselves unto their
Duty herein. And if they prevail on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto it, it will bring in its own Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their freedom.</p>
               <p>SOME, it may be, will say, That in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are unskilful in this Word of
Righteousness, as some are, <hi>Heb.</hi> v. 13.
They know not how to make use of Christ
crucified unto this End; nor, how to set
themselves about it. Other ways of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49192:37"/>
they can understand. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
and Penances assigned by the Papists
unto this End, are sensible. So are our
own Vows and Resolutions, with other
Duties that are prescribed; but as for this
way of deriving Vertue from the Death of
Christ unto the Death of Sin, they can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
nothing of it.</p>
               <p>I easily believe that some may say so,
yea ought to say so, if they would speak
their Minds. For the spiritual Wisdom of
Faith is required hereunto; but all Men
have not Faith. On the loss of this Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the <hi>Papists</hi> have invented another
way to supply the whole Exercise of Faith
herein. They will make Crucifixes, Images
of Christ crucified, then they will adore,
embrace, mourn over, and expect great
Verue from them. Without these Images
they know no way of addressing unto
Christ, for the Communication of any Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
from his Death or Life. Others may
be at the same loss. But they may do
well to consider the cause of it. For,</p>
               <p>1. IS it not from Ignorance of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Gospel, and of the Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of supplies of spiritual things from Christ
thereby, of the Efficacy of his Life and
Death unto our Sanctification and Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Sin? Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:49192:38"/>
2. IS it not because indeed they have
never been throughly distressed in their
Minds and Consciences by the Power of
Sin; and so have never in good earnest
looked for relief? Light general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
either of the Guilt or Power of Sin
will drive none to Christ. When their
Consciences are reduced unto real Streights,
and they know not what to do, they will
learn better how to <hi>look unto him whom they
have pierced.</hi> Their Condition, whoever
they are, is dangerous, who find not a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
every day of applying themselves by
Faith unto Christ, for help and succour.
Or,</p>
               <p>3. IS it not because they have other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs
to betake themselves unto? Such are
there own Promises and Resolutions, which,
for the most part, serve only to cheat and
quiet Conscience for an hour or a day, and
then vanish into nothing. But whatever
be the Case of this Neglect, those in whom
it is, will pine away in their Sins. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Death of Christ for us, will
be the death of Sin in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Duty necessary unto
this end, is continual Prayer, and this to
be considered as unto its Application, to
the prevalency of any particular Lust,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:49192:38"/>
wherein Sin doth in a peculiar manner exert
its Power. This is the great Ordinance of
God for its Mortification. For,</p>
               <p>1. HEREBY we obtain spiritual Aids
and Supplies of strength against it. We
are not more necessarily and fervently to
pray that Sin may be pardoned, as to its
guilt, than we are that it may be subdued,
as to its power. He who is negligent in
the latter, is never in good earnest in the
former. The Pressures and Troubles which
we receive from the Power of Sin, are as
pungent on the Mind, as those from
its Guilt are on the Conscience. Meer
pardon of Sin will never give Peace unto a
Soul, though it can have none without it.
It must be mortified also, or we can have
no spiritual Rest. Now this is the work
of Prayer, namely, to seek and obtain
such supplies of mortifying, sanctifying
Grace, as whereby the Power of Sin may
be broken, its Strength abated, its Root
withered, its Life destroyed, and so the
whole Old Man crucified. That which
was the <hi>Apostles</hi> request for the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
is the daily Prayer of all Believers
for themselves, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> v. 23.</p>
               <p>2. A constant Attendance unto this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in a due manner, will preserve the Soul
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49192:39"/>
in such a frame, as wherein Sin cannot ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually
prevail in it. He that can live in
sin, and abide in the ordinary duties of
Prayer, doth never once Pray as he ought.
Formality, or some secret Reserve or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vitiates the whole. A truly gracious
praying Frame (wherein we pray always)
is utterly inconsistent with the love of, or
reserve for any sin. To pray well, is to
pray always; that is, to keep the Heart
always in that frame which is required in
Prayer: And where this is, sin can have
no Rule, no, nor quiet Harbour in the
Soul.</p>
               <p>3. IT is the Soul's immediate Conflict
against the Power of sin. Sin, in it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
considered as the Soul's Enemy,
which fights against it. In Prayer the
Soul sets it self to graple with it, to wound,
kill and destroy. It is that whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
all its spiritual Engines unto its utter
Ruine; herein it exerciseth a gracious ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency
of it, a clear self-condemnation
on the account of it, and engageth Faith on
all the Promises of God, for its Conquest
and Destruction.</p>
               <p>IT is hence evident, that if Sin hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the Mind, unto a negligence of
this Duty, either in general, or, as unto
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49192:39"/>
the effectual Application of it, unto any
especial Case, where it exerts its Power, it
is an ill Symptom of the Dominion of Sin in
the soul.</p>
               <p>IT is certain, that unmortified sin, sin
indulged unto, will gradually work out all
due regard unto this duty of Prayer, and
alienate the mind from it, either as unto
the matter or manner of its performance.
We see this exemplified every day in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Professors. They have had a Gift of
Prayer, and were constant in the Exercise
of it; but the love of sin, and living in it
hath devoured their Gifts, and wholly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off their minds from the Duty it self,
which is the proper Character of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
will he delight himself in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty?
Will he <hi>always call upon God?
Job</hi> xxvij. 10. He may do so for a Season;
but falling under the power of sin, he will
not continue so to do.</p>
               <p>NOW because sin useth great Deceit
herein, in a gradual Progress for attaining
its End, and thereby securing its Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
we may in a way of warning or cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
take notice of some of its steps, that
the Entrances of it may be opposed. For
as the Entrance of God's Word <hi>giveth
Light, Psal.</hi> cxix. 130. the first puttings
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49192:40"/>
forth of its Power on the Soul, gives spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Light unto the Mind, which is to be
improved; so the Entrance of sin, the
first actings of it on the Mind, towards the
neglect of this Duty, brings a deceiving
darkness with them, which is to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
               <p>1. It will produce in the mind an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readiness
unto this duty in its proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
The heart should always rejoice in
the approach of such seasons, because of
the delight in God, which it hath in them.
To rejoice and be glad in all our approaches
unto God, is every way required of us,
and therefore with the Thoughts of and
in the approach of such seasons, we ought
to groan in our selves for such a prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind, as may render us meet for
that Converse with God, which we are
called unto. But where Sin begins to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
all things will be unready and out of
order. Strange Tergiversations will rise
in the mind, either as unto the duty it self,
or as unto the manner of its performance.
Customariness and Formality are the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
which act themselves in this Case.
The Body seems to carry the Mind to the
Duty whether it will or no, rather than
the Mind to lead the Body in its part of it:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49192:40"/>
And it will employ it self in any thing, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than in the Work and Duty that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it.</p>
               <p>HEREIN then lies a great part of
our Wisdom, in obviating the power of
sin in us. Let us keep our hearts continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in a gracious Disposition and readiness
for this Duty, in all its proper seasons.
If you lose this ground, you will yet go
more backwards continually. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that there is no more effectual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servative
of the soul from the power of sin,
than a gracious readiness for, and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto this duty in private and publick,
according to its proper seasons.</p>
               <p>2. IN its Progress, unto unreadiness it
will add unwillingness; for the Mind pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
by sin, finds it directly contrary
unto its present Interest, Disposition and
Inclination. There is nothing in it but
what troubles and disquiets them; as he
said of the Prophet, who was not willing
to hear him any more, it speaks not good
but evil of them continually. Hence a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
unwillingness prevails in the mind,
and an aversation from a serious Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in it. And the Attendance of such
Persons to it, is as if they were under a force,
in a compliance with Custom and Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49192:41"/>
3. SIN will at length prevail unto a
total neglect of this Duty: This is an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
confirmed by long Experience.
If Prayer do not constantly endeavour the
ruine of Sin, sin will ruine Prayer; and
utterly alienate the Soul from it. This is
the way of Backsliders in heart; as they
grow in sin, they decay in prayer, until
they are weary of it, and utterly relinquish
it. So they speak, <hi>Mal.</hi> i. 13. Behold
<hi>what a weariness it is,</hi> and ye <hi>have snuffed
at it.</hi> They look on it as a Task, as a
Burthen, and are weary in attending unto
it.</p>
               <p>NOW when I place this as an Effect of
the prevalency of sin; namely, a relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishment
of the Duty of Prayer; I do
not intend that Persons do wholly and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely,
or as to all ways of it, publick
and private, and all seasons or occasions
of it, give it over utterly. Few arise to
that profligacy in sin, unto such desperate
resolutions against God. It may be they
will still attend unto the stated seasons of
Prayer, in Families or publick Assemblies,
at least drawing near to God with their
Lips; and they will on surprizals and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
personally cry unto God, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
every where testifieth of them. But
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49192:41"/>
this only I intend; namely, that they will
no more sincerely, immediately, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
apply Prayer to the mortification
and ruine of that Lust or Corruption,
wherein Sin puts forth its Power and Rule
in them: And where it is so, it seems to
have the Dominion. Of such an one, saith
the <hi>Psalmist, He hath left off to be wise and
to do good; he setteth himself in a way that
is not good, he aborreth not Evil,</hi> Psal.
xxxvi. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>BUT such a Relinquishment of this
Duty, as unto the End mentioned, as is
habitual, and renders the Soul secure under
it, is intended. For there may, through
the power of Temptation, be a prevalency
of this Evil in Believers for a season. So
God complains of his People, <hi>Isa.</hi> xliij. 22.
<hi>Thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob, but
hast been weary of me, O Israel;</hi> that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively,
as unto the fervency and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the duty required of them. Now,
when it is thus with Believers for a season,
through the Power of Sin and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
(1.) They do not approve of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
therein. They will ever and anon
call things to consideration, and say, It is
not with us as it should be, or as it was in
former days; this thing is not good that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49192:42"/>
we do; nor will it be Peace in the latter
End. (2.) They will have secret Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of shaking themselves out of the
dust of this Evil State; they say in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
we will go and <hi>return unto our first
Husband; for, then it was better with us
than now;</hi> as the Church did, <hi>Hos.</hi> ij. 7.
(3.) Every thing that peculiarly befals
them in a way of Mercy or Affliction, they
look on as Calls from God, to deliver and
recover them from their Backsliding frame.
(4.) They will receive in the Warnings
which are given them by the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
especially, if their particular Case be
touched on, or laid open. (5.) They will
have no Quiet, Rest, nor Self-approbation,
until they come thoroughly off unto an
healing and Recovery; such as that describ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Hos.</hi> xiv. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>THUS it may be with some over
whom Sin hath not the Dominion; yet
ought the first Entrance of it to be diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
watched against, as that which tends
unto the danger and ruine of the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> CONSTANT self-abasement,
condemnation and abhorrency, is another
duty that is directly opposed unto the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Rule of sin in the Soul. No
frame of Mind is a better Antidote against
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49192:42"/>
the Poison of sin; <hi>He that walketh humbly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
walketh surely.</hi> God hath a continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
unto Mourners, those that are of a
broken Heart and a contrite Spirit. It is
the Soil where all Grace will thrive and
flourish. A constant due sense of sin as sin,
of our Interest therein by Nature, and in
the Course of our Lives, with a continual
afflictive Remembrance of some such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of it, as have had peculiar Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
issuing in a gracious Self-Abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is the Soul's best posture in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against all the Deceits and Incursions
of Sin. And this is a duty which we ought
with all diligence to attend unto. To
keep our Souls in a constant frame of
Mourning and Self-Abasement, is the most
necessary part of our Wisdom, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
unto all the Ends of the Life of God:
And it is so far from having any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
with those Consolations and Joys,
which the Gospel tenders unto us in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as that it is the only way to let them
into the Soul in a due manner. It is such
Mourners, and those alone, unto whom
Evangelical Comforts are administred, <hi>Isa.</hi>
lvij. 18.</p>
               <p>ONE of the first things that sin doth
when it aims at Dominion, is the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49192:43"/>
of this frame of Mind; and when it
actually hath the Rule, it will not suffer it
to enter: It makes men careless and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of this matter, yea, bold, presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and fearless: It will obstruct all the
entrances into the mind of such Self-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
and Considerations, as lead unto
this Frame: It will represent them either
as needless or unseasonable; or make the
mind afraid of them, as things which tend
unto its disquietment and disturbance,
without any advantage. If it prevail
herein, it makes way for the security of
its own Dominion. Nothing is more
watched against than a proud, regardless,
senseless, secure frame of Heart, by them
who are under the Rule of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Reserve for any one known
sin, against the Light and Efficacy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
is an Argument of the Dominion
of sin. So was it in the Case of <hi>Naaman;</hi>
he would do all other things, but put in an
Exception for that, wherein his Honour
and Profit did depend. Where there is
sincerity in Convictions, it extends it self
unto all sins: For it is of sin as sin, and so of
every known sin equally, that hath the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of sin in it. And to be true to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
is the Life of sincerity. If men
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:49192:43"/>
can make a choice of what they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
and reserve, notwithstanding, their
being convinced of its Evil, it is from the
ruling Power of sin. Pleas in the Mind,
in the behalf of any sin; that is, for a
continuance in it, prevalent thereunto,
ruines all sincerity. It may be, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is, That it is but a little one, of no
great moment, and that which shall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensated
with other duties of Obedience;
or, it shall be retained only until a fitter
season for its Relinquishment; or, men
may be blinded after Conviction to dispute
again, whether what they would abide in
be sinful or no, as is the Case frequently
with respect unto Covetousness, Pride and
Conformity to the World; it is a dreadful
effect of the ruling Power of Sin. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
impeacheth the Universality of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in one thing, overthrows its since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in all things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> HARDNESS of Heart, so
frequently mentioned and complained of in
the Scripture, is another Evidence of the
Dominion of Sin. But because there are
various degrees also hereof, they must be
considered, that we may judge aright what
of it is an Evidence of that Dominion, and
what may be consistent with the Rule of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49192:44"/>
Grace: For it is that mysterious Evil
whereof the best men do most complain;
and whereof the worst have no sense at
all.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Hardness of Heart spoken to, as an eminent
sign of Sin's Dominion, and is shewed,
that it ought to be considered as total or
partial.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HARDNESS of Heart, is either
Total and Absolute; or, Partial and
Comparative only.</p>
               <p>TOTAL Hardness, is either Natural
and Universal; or, Judiciary in some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Individuals.</p>
               <p>NATURAL Hardness, is the Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Obstinacy of the Heart in Sin, by
Nature, which is not to be cured by the
use or application of any outward Means.
<hi>Hardness and impenitent Heart,</hi> Rom. ij. 5.
This is that Heart of Stone, which God
promises in the Covenant to take away, by
the Efficacy of his Almighty Grace, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
xxxvi. 26. Where this Hardness abides
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49192:44"/>
uncured, unremoved, there Sin is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in the Throne; this therefore we do
not enquire about.</p>
               <p>JUDICIARY Hardness, is either
immediately from God; or, it is by the
Devil, through his Permission.</p>
               <p>IN the first way, God is said frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to harden the Hearts of Men in their
Sins, and unto their Ruine, as he did with
<hi>Pharaoh;</hi> and he doth it in general Two
ways, (1.) By with-holding from them
those supplies of Light, Wisdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
without which they cannot
understand their Condition, see their Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nor avoid their Ruine. (2.) By
with-holding the Efficacy of the means
which they enjoy for their Conviction and
Repentance; yea, and giving them an
Efficacy unto their Obduration, <hi>Isa.</hi> vi.
9, 10. And concerning this divine Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
we may observe,</p>
               <p>(1.) THAT it is the severest of divine
Punishments in this World; (2.) That
therefore it is not executed, but towards
those that are habitually wicked, and so
do, of choice, harden themselves in their
Sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 26, 28. (3.) For the most
part it respects some especial Times and
Seasons, wherein are the turning points
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:49192:45"/>
for Eternity. (4.) That the Condition
of those so hardned is remediless, and their
Wounds uncurable.</p>
               <p>WHERE any are thus hardned, there
is no Question about the Dominion of Sin.
Such an Heart is its Throne, its proper Seat
next to Hell.</p>
               <p>THERE is a Judiciary Hardness, which
<hi>Sathan,</hi> through God's Permission, brings
on men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 4. And there are many
ways whereby he doth effect it, not here to
be insisted on.</p>
               <p>BUT there is an Hardness of Heart,
that is indeed but <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>comparative,</hi>
whatever appearance it may make of that
which is <hi>total and absolute,</hi> where the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
ariseth, whether it be an Evidence of
the Dominion of Sin or no.</p>
               <p>THERE is an Hardness of Heart,
which is known and lamented in them in
whom it is. Hereof the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains,
<hi>Isa.</hi> lxiij. 17. <hi>O Lord, why hast thou
hardened our Heart from thy Fear?</hi> or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it so to be; not healing, not recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Hardness. And there are sundry
things which concurr in this kind of Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart. As,</p>
               <p>1. WANT of readiness to receive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Impressions from the Word of God.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49192:45"/>
When the Heart is soft and tender, it is
also humble and contrite, and ready to
tremble at the word of God. So it is said of
<hi>Josia,</hi> that his <hi>Heart was tender, and he
humbled himself before the Lord,</hi> when he
heard his Word, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> xxij. 18, 19. This
may be wanting in some in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and they may be sensible of it. They
may find in themselves a great unreadiness
to comply with divine Warnings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs,
Calls. They are not affected with
the Word preached, but sometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
that they sit under it like Stocks
and Stones. They have not an experience
of its Power, and are cast into the mould
of it. Hereon they apprehend that their
Hearts are hardned from the fear of God,
as the Church complains. There is indeed
no better frame of Heart to be attained in
this Life, then that, whereby it is to the
Word, as the Wax to the Seal, fit and
ready to receive Impressions from it. A
Frame that is tender to receive the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of the Word in all their Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
whether for Reproof, Instruction or
Consolation; and the want hereof, is a
culpable Hardness of Heart.</p>
               <p>2. THERE belongs unto it an Affected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
with the guilt of Sin, as unto the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49192:46"/>
sorrow and Repentance that it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
There is none in whom there is any
spark of saving Grace, but hath a gracious
sorrow for Sin, in some degree or other;
but there is a Proportion required between
Sin and Sorrow. Great Sins require great
Sorrows; as <hi>Peter</hi> on his great sin, wept
bitterly. And all, especial Aggravations
of Sin, require an especial sense of them.
This the Soul finds not in it self. It bears
the Thoughts of Sin, and the Rebukes of
Conscience, without any great concussion
or remorse. It can pass over the charge of
sin, without relenting, mourning, dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in Sighs and Tears; and it cannot
but say sometimes thereon, that its heart
is like the Adamant or the Flint in the
Rock; this makes many fear, that they are
under the Dominion of Sin; and they
fear it the more, because that fear doth not
affect and humble them as it ought. And
it must be granted, that all unaffectedness
with sin, all want of Humiliation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sorrow upon it, is from an undue hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart. And they, who are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with it, have great reason to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
over themselves, as even unto their
spiritual State and Condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49192:46"/>
3. OF the same kind in its measure, is
unaffectedness with the Sins of others, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom we live, or in whom we are
concerned. To mourn for the sins of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is a duty highly approved of God;
<hi>Ezek.</hi> ix. It argues the effectual working
of many Graces, as Zeal for the Glory of
God, Compassion for the Souls of Men,
Love to the Glory and Interest of Christ in
the World. The want hereof is from
hardness of Heart, and it is that which
abounds among us. Some find not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at all concerned herein, some make
pretences why they need not so be, or,
that it is not their Duty; what is it unto
them how wicked the World is, it shall
answer for its own Sins. Nor are they
moved when it comes nearer them. If
their Children come to Losses, Ruine,
Poverty, then they are affected indeed.
But so long as they flourish in the World,
be they Apostates from Profession, be they
Enemies to Christ, do they avowedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto the World, and walk in the ways
of it; they are not much concerned, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
if they are not scandalously Profligate.
But this also is from Hardness of Heart,
which will be bewail'd, where Grace is
vigilant and active.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:49192:47"/>
4. WANT of a due sense of Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of divine displeasure, is another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this Hardness of Heart. God doth
oft-times give signs and tokens hereof;
whether as unto the publick State of the
Church in the World, or, as unto our own
Persons, in Afflictions and Chastisements.
In the seasons hereof, he expects that our
Hearts should be soft and tender, ready
to receive Impressions of his Anger, and
pliable therein unto his Mind and Will.
There are none whom at such a time he
doth more abhorr, than those who are stout-hearted,
little regarding him or the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his Hands. This in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
may be in Believers; and they may
be sensible of it, to their Sorrow and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milition.</p>
               <p>THESE things, and many more of
the like nature, proceed from Hardness of
Heart, or the remainder of our hardness
by nature, and are great promoters of the
Interest of Sin in us. But where any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are sensible of this Frame, where they
are humbled for it, where they mourn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and cry out for its removal, it is so
far from being an Evidence of the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of Sin over them, in whom it is,
that it is an eminent sign of the contrary;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49192:47"/>
namely, that the ruling Power of Sin is
certainly broken and destroyed in the Soul.</p>
               <p>BUT there are other Instances of
Hardness of Heart, which have much
more difficulty in them, and which are
hardly reconcilable unto the Rule of Grace.
I shall mention some of them.</p>
               <p>1. SECURITY and senseless under the
guilt of great actual Sins. I do not say
this is or can at any time be absolute in any
Believer. But such it may be, as whereon
men may go on at their old Pace of Duties
and Profession, though without any pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Humiliation, albeit they are under the
provoking guilt of some known sin, with
its Aggravations. It will recurr upon their
Minds and Conscience, (unless it be sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
will treat with them about it. But
they pass it over, as that which they had
rather forget, and wear out of their minds,
then bring things unto their proper Issue
by particular Repentance. So it seems to
have been with <hi>David</hi> after his Sin with
<hi>Bathsheba.</hi> I doubt not but that before the
message of God to him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> he had
unpleasing Thoughts of what he had done.
But there is not the least Footsteps in the
Story, or any of his Prayers, that he laid
it seriously to heart, and was humbled for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49192:48"/>
it before. This was a great Hardness of
Heart, and we know how difficult his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
from it was. <hi>He was saved but as
through Fire.</hi> And where it is so with any
one, that hath been overtaken with any
great Sin, as Drunkenness or other Folly,
that he strives to wear it out, to pass it
over, to forget it, or give himself Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from any reasoning or consideration
against the especial sense of it, and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for it; he can, during that State and
Frame, have no solid Evidence, that Sin
hath not the Dominion in him. And let
such Sinners be warned, who have so passed
over former Sins, until they have utterly
lost all sense of them, or are under such
a Frame at present; that they recal things
to another Account, and suffer no such Sin
to pass without a peculiar Humiliation, or
whatever be the final Issue of things with
them, they can have no solid ground of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Peace in this World.</p>
               <p>2. THERE is such a dangerous Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart, where the guilt of one Sin
makes not the Soul watchful against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of another sort. Where-ever the Heart
is tender, upon a surprizal into Sin, it will
not only watch against the returns thereof,
or relapses into it, but will be made dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49192:48"/>
heedful and careful against all other
Sins whatever. So is it with all that walk
humbly under a sense of sin. But when
Men in such a state are careless, bold and
negligent, so as that if they repeat not
the same sin, they are easily hurried into
others. Thus was it with <hi>Asa;</hi> he was
wroth with the <hi>Prophet</hi> that came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him with a divine Message, and smote
him, and cast him in Prison, for he was
in a Rage, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xvi. 10. A Man
would think that when he was recovered
out of this Distemper, it might have made
him humble and watchful against other
Sins: But it was not so; for, it is added,
that he oppressed some of the People at
the same time; and he rested not there,
but <hi>in his Disease he sought not to the Lord,
but unto Physicians;</hi> unto Persecution he
added Oppression, and unto that Unbelief.
<hi>v.</hi> 12. yet notwithstanding all this, the
Heart of <hi>Asa</hi> was <hi>perfect with the Lord
all his days, 1 Kings</hi> xv. 14. that is, he had
a prevalent Sincerity in him notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these Miscarriages. But he was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
under the Power of great Hardness
of Heart. So is it with others in the like
Cases, when one sin makes them not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and watchful against another. As
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49192:49"/>
when men have stained themselves with
Intemperance of Life, they may fall into
Excess of Passion in their Families and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations;
or into a neglect of Duty, or take
any other crooked steps in their walk.
This argues a great Prevalency of Sin in
the Soul, although as we see in the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Asa,</hi> it is not an infallible Evidence
of its Dominion; yet of that nature it is,
wherewith divine Peace and Consolation
are inconsistent.</p>
               <p>3. WHEN men fall into such unspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Frames, such deadness and decays,
as from which they are not recoverable by
the ordinary means of Grace; it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Evidence of Hardness of Heart, and
the Prevalency of Sin therein. It is so, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be the fault of Churches or of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Persons? The Preaching of the Word,
is the especial divine Ordinance for the
healing and recovery of Backsliders in Heart
or Life. Where this will not effect it in
any, but they will <hi>go on frowardly in the
ways of their own hearts,</hi> unless God take
some extraordinary course with them, they
are on the brink of <hi>Ruine,</hi> and live on sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Grace alone.</p>
               <p>THUS was it with <hi>David.</hi> After his
great Sin, there is no doubt but he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49192:49"/>
unto all Ordinances of divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which are the ordinary means of the
preservation and recovery of Sinners from
their Backslidings. Howbeit they had not
this effect upon him; he lived impenitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his Sin, until God was pleased to use
extraordinary means in the especial Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of <hi>Nathan,</hi> and the Death of his
Child, for his awakening and recovery.</p>
               <p>AND thus God will deal sometimes
with Churches and Persons. Where ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means for their recovery will not
effect it, he will by sovereign Grace, and
it may be by a concurrence of Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Providence, heal, revive and save
them. So he promiseth to do, <hi>Isa.</hi> lvij.
16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>BUT where this is trusted unto, in
the neglect of the ordinary means of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
seeing there is no direct Promise of
it, but it is a Case reserved unto absolute
soveraignty, the End may be bitterness and
sorrow.</p>
               <p>AND let them take heed who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this Frame: For although God may
deliver them, yet it will be by <hi>terrible
things;</hi> as <hi>Psal.</hi> lxv. 5. Such terrible things
as wherein he will take Vengeance of their
Inventions, <hi>Psal.</hi> xcix. 8. though he do for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49192:50"/>
them: So <hi>David</hi> affirms of himself,
that God in his dealing with him, had
broken all his Bones, <hi>Psal.</hi> li. 8.</p>
               <p>I fear this is the present Case of many
Churches and Professors at this day. It
is evident that they are fallen under many
spiritual decays. Neither have the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means of Grace, Repentance and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
though backed with various
providential Warnings, been efficacious
to their recovery. It is greatly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that God will use some severe Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in terrible things towards them for
their awakning; or, which is more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
withdraw his Presence from them.</p>
               <p>4. OF the same Nature it is, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
no small Power of this Evil, when
men satisfie and please themselves in an
unmortified, unfruitful Profession; a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
Symptom of the Dominion of Sin.
And there are Three things that manifest
the consistency of such a Profession, with
Hardness of Heart; or, are fruits of it
therein.</p>
               <p>1. A neglect of the principal duties of
it. Such are mortification in themselves,
and usefulness or fruitfulness towards
others. A Deficiency and Neglect in these
things, are evident amongst many that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49192:50"/>
Religion. It doth not appear that in
any thing they seriously endeavour the
Mortification of their Lusts, their Pride,
their Passion, their Love of the World,
their inordinate Desires and sensual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.
They either indulge unto them all,
or, at least, they maintain not a constant
Conflict against them. And, as unto use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in the Fruits of Righteousness,
which are to the Praise of God by Jesus
Christ, or those good Works, which are
the Evidence of a living Faith, they are
openly barren in them. Now, whereas
these are the principal Dictates of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which they do profess, their neglect
of them, their deficiency in them proceeds
from an Hardness of Heart, over-powering
their Light and Convictions. And what
shall long, in such a Case, stop Sins out of
the Throne? Self-pleasing and satisfaction
in such a Profession, argues a very dangerous
State and Habit of Mind. Sin may have a
full Dominion under such a Profession.</p>
               <p>2. THE admission of an habitual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
into the performance of religious
Duties, is of the same nature. In some the
Power of Sin (as we observed before) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
unto the Neglect and Omission of such
Duties. Others continue the Observation,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49192:51"/>
but are so formal and lifeless in them, so
careless, as unto the exerting or exercise
of Grace in them, as gives an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Evidence of the Power of Sin, and a
spiritual senselesness of Heart. There is
nothing that the Scripture doth more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and severely condemn, nor give
as a Character of Hypocrites, than a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Attendance unto a multiplication of
Duties, whilst the Heart is not spiritually
engaged in them. For this cause the Lord
<hi>Christ</hi> threatned the utter Rejection of the
Luke-warm Church of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> And God
pronounceth a most severe Sentence against
all that are guilty of it, <hi>Isa.</hi> xxix. 13, 14. Yet
thus it may be with many, and that thus
it hath been with them, many do manifest
by their open Apostacy, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Event of this Frame and Course long
continued in; for some in the daily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of religious Duties for a season,
do exercise and preserve their Gifts, but
there being no exercise of Grace in them,
after a while those Gifts also do wither and
decay. They are under the Power of
the Evil whereof we treat, namely, an
hard and senseless Heart, that can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of themselves in such a lifeless,
heartless Profession of Religion and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the Duties thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49192:51"/>
3. WHEN Men grow senseless under
the Dispensation of the Word, and do not
at all profit by it. The general Ends for
preaching the Word unto Believers are
(1.) The encrease of spiritual Light, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and Understanding in them. (2.)
The growth of Grace enabling to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
(3.) Holy Excitation of Grace by
Impressions of its Power in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of the Mind, Will, Love and
Grace of God unto our Souls, which is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with (4.) An Impression on the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
renewing and making them more
holy and heavenly continually; with (5.)
Direction and Administration of spiritual
strength against Temptations and Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions;
and (6.) Fruitfulness in the Works
and Duties of Obedience.</p>
               <p>WHERE Men can abide under the
Dispensation of the Word, without any of
these effects on their Minds, Consciences
or Lives; they are greatly hardened by
the deceitfulness of Sin; as <hi>Heb.</hi> iij. 12,
13. this Case is stated. Now whether
this be,</p>
               <p>1. FROM that carelesness and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
which is grown on all sorts of Persons,
against which God doth justly express his
Indignation, by with-holding the Power
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49192:52"/>
and Efficacy of his Word, in its Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
from them: Or,</p>
               <p>2. FROM an encrease of an unsancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Light and Gifts, which fill men with
high thoughts of themselves, and keep
them off from that humble Frame which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
is teachable: Or,</p>
               <p>3. FROM a loss of all due Reverence
unto the Ministry, as God's Ordinance for
all the ends of the Word, with a secret
Fortification of Conscience by Prejudices
against its Power, from the Suggestions of
Sathan: Or,</p>
               <p>4. FROM the love of Sin, which the
Heart would shelter and secure from the
Efficacy of the Word; or from what other
cause soever it be, it proceeds from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
hardness of Heart, from the Power
of Sin.</p>
               <p>WHERE this is the state of the Minds
of Men, where this hardness is thus preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in them, I do not, no Man can give
them assurance that Sin hath not the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
in them. But because all these
things are capable of various degrees, it
may not be concluded absolutely from any
or all of them in any degree, that so it is.
But this we may safely conclude, (1.) That
it is impossible for any Man in whom this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49192:52"/>
evil Frame is found in any degree, and
not sincerely endeavoured against, to keep
any true solid Peace with God, or in his
own Soul; What seems to be so in him is
but a ruinous Security. (2.) That this is
the high road unto final Obduration and
Impenitency; and therefore, (3.) it is the
present Duty of those who have any care
of their Souls, to shake themselves out of
this Dust, and not to give themselves any
rest, until they are entered into the Paths
of Recovery. The Calls of God for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto such Backsliders in Heart are
multiplied, the Reasons for it and Motives
unto it are innumerable; this ought never
to depart from their minds, that without
it they shall eternally Perish, and know not
how soon they may be overtaken with that
Destruction.</p>
               <p>THUS far have we proceeded in the
enquiry, Whether Sin hath the Dominion
in us or no? There are on the other side
many Evidences of the Rule of Grace,
sufficient to discard the Pleas and Pretences
of Sin unto the Throne: But the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of them is not my present De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
I have only examined the Pleas of
Sin, which render the Enquiry difficult
and the Case dubious. And they arise
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49192:53"/>
all from the actings of Sin in us, as it fights
against the Soul, which is its proper
and constant work, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ij. 11, 12. It
doth so against the design of the Law,
which is to live to God; against the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Peace of it, which it disturbs;
and against its eternal Blessedness, which
it would deprive it of. The Examination
of the Pretences insisted on, may be of
some use to them that are sincere.</p>
               <p>BUT on the other hand, there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable
Evidences of the Dominion
of Sin in Men, some whereof I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and only mention, because they need
neither Proof nor Illustration.</p>
               <p>(1.) IT is so where Sin hath possessed
the Will. And it hath possessed the Will,
when there are no restraints from sinning
taken from its Nature but its Consequents
only. (2.) When Men proclaim their Sins,
and hide them not; when they boast in
in them, and of them, as it is with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes;
or, (3.) approve of themselves in
any known Sin, without renewed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
as Drunkenness, Uncleanness,
Swearing and the like: Or, (4.) Live in
the Neglect of religious Duties in their
Clossets and Families; whence all their
publick Attendance unto them is but Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49192:53"/>
Or, (5.) Have an Enmity to true
Holiness, and the Power of Godliness:
Or, (6.) Are visible Apostates from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
especially if they add, as is usual,
Persecution to their Apostacy: Or, (7.)
Are ignorant of the sanctifying Principles
of the Gospel and Christian Religion: Or,
(8.) Are Dispisers of the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version:
Or, (9.) Live in security under
open providential Warnings and Calls to
Repentance: Or, (10.) Are Enemies in
their Minds unto the true Interest of Christ
in the World. Where these things and the
like are found, there is no Question what it
is that hath Dominion, and bears Rule in
the Minds of Men. This all Men may
easily know, as the Apostle declares, <hi>Rom.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Third Enquiry handled, viz. What is
the assurance given us, and what are the
Grounds thereof, that Sin shall not have
Dominion over us?</p>
                  <p>The Ground of this assurance is, That we
are not under the Law but Grace. The
Force of this Reason shewed, viz. How
the Law doth not destroy the Dominion of
Sin, and how Grace dethrowns Sin and
gives Dominion over it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AND thus much hath been spoken
unto the <hi>Second</hi> thing proposed at
the Entrance of this Discourse; namely,
an Enquiry, Whether Sin have the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in any of us or no? I proceed unto that
which offers it self from the words in the
<hi>Third</hi> Place; What is the assurance given
us, and what are the Grounds of it, that
Sin shall not have Dominion over us; which
lies in this, That we are <hi>not under the Law,
but under Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHERE Men are engaged in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Conflict against Sin, where they look
upon it, and judge it their chiefest Enemy,
which contends with them for their Souls,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49192:54"/>
and their eternal Ruine; where they have
Experience of its Power and Deceit, and,
through the Efficacy of them, have been
often shaken in their Peace and Comfort;
where they have been ready to despond,
and say, They shall One Day perish un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Powers: It is a Gospel Word, a
Word of good Tidings that gives them As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance,
that it shall never have <hi>Dominion</hi>
over them.</p>
               <p>THE Ground of this Assurance is, That
Believers are <hi>not under the Law, but under
Grace.</hi> And the force of this Reason we
may manifest in some few Instances.</p>
               <p>1. THE <hi>Law</hi> giveth no strength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Sin unto them that are under it; but
<hi>Grace</hi> doth. Sin will neither be cast nor
kept out of its Throne, but by a spiritual
Power, and strength in the Soul, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
conquer and dethrown it. Where
it is not conquered it will reign; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
it will not be, without a mighty
prevailing Power: This the <hi>Law</hi> will not,
cannot give.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Law</hi> is taken Two ways. (1.)
For the whole Revelation of the Mind and
Will of God in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> In this
Sence it had <hi>Grace</hi> in it, and so did give
both Life, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and strength against
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49192:55"/>
Sin, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> declares, <hi>Psal.</hi> xix. 7,
8, 9. In that sence it contained not only
the Law of Precepts, but the Promise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
and the Covenant which was the
means of conveying spiritual Life and
Strength unto the Church, in this sence
it is not here spoken of; nor is any where
opposed unto <hi>Grace.</hi> (2.) For the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Rule of perfect Obedience, do this
and live. In this sence men are said to
be under it in opposition unto being under
Grace. They are under its Power, Rule,
Conditions and Authority as a Covenant.
And in this sence all men are under it, who
are not enstated in the New Covenant
through Faith in Christ Jesus, who sets
up in them and over them the Rule of
Grace. For all Men must be one way or
other under the Rule of God; and he
rules only by the <hi>Law,</hi> or by <hi>Grace:</hi> And
none can be under both at the same time.</p>
               <p>IN this sence the Law was never or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
of God, to convey Grace or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Strength unto the Souls of Men:
Had it been so, the Promise and the Gospel
had been needless. If there had been a
Law given <hi>which could have given Life, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
Righteousness should have been by the
Law, Gal.</hi> iij. 21. If it could have given
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49192:55"/>
Life or Strength, it would have produced
Righteousness, we should have been justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by it. It discovers Sin and condemns
it, but gives no Strength to oppose it. It
is not God's Ordinance for the dethrown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Sin, nor for the Destruction of its
Dominion.</p>
               <p>THIS Law falls under a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration;
but in neither of them was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to give Power or Strength against
Sin.</p>
               <p>1. AS it was given unto Mankind in
the state of Innocency. And it did then ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and exactly declare the whole Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Man, whatever God in his Wisdom
and Holiness did require of us. It was
God's Ruling of men according to the
Principle of the Righteousness wherein he
was created. But it gave no new aids
against Sin; nor was there any need that
so it should do. It was not the Ordinance
of God to administer new or more Grace
unto Man, but to rule and govern him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what he had perceived. And
this it continueth to do for ever. It claims
and continues a Rule over all Men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to what they had, and what they
have. But it never had power to barr the
Entrance of Sin, or to cast it out when it
is once Enthroned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:49192:56"/>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> AS it was renewed and enjoined
unto the Church of <hi>Israel</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
and with them unto all that would join
themselves unto the Lord out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World. Yet neither was it
then, nor as such, designed unto any such
End, as to destroy or dethrone Sin, by
an Administration of spiritual Strength and
Grace. It had some new Ends given then
unto it, which it had not in its original
Constitution. The principal whereof
was to drive men to the Promise and Christ
therein. And this it doth by all the Acts
and Powers of it on the Souls of Men. As
it discovers Sin, as it irritates and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes
it by its severity, as it judgeth and
condemneth it, as it denounceth a Curse
on Sinners, it drives unto this End. For
this was added of Grace in the Renovation
of it; this new End was given unto it;
in it self it hath nothing to do with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but to Judge, Curse, and Condemn
them.</p>
               <p>THERE is therefore no help to be
expected against the Dominion of Sin from
the Law. It was never ordained of God
unto that End; nor doth it contain, nor is
it communicative of the Grace necessary
unto that End, <hi>Rom.</hi> viij. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49192:56"/>
WHEREFORE those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, are under the Dominion of
Sin. The Law is holy, but it cannot
make them holy, who have made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unholy: It is just, but it cannot
make them so; it cannot justify them
whom it doth condemn: It is good, but
can do them no good, as unto their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from the Power of Sin; God
hath not appointed it unto that End. Sin
will never be dethroned by it; it will
not give place unto the Law; neither in
its Title, nor its Power.</p>
               <p>THOSE who are under the Law;
will at some seasons endeavour to shake off
the Yoke of Sin, and resolve to be no longer
under its Power. As,</p>
               <p>1. WHEN the Law presseth on their
Consciences, perplexing and disquieting
of them. The Commandment comes
home unto them, Sin <hi>reviveth</hi> and they
<hi>die, Rom,</hi> vij. 9, 10. That is, it gives
power to Sin to slay the hopes of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to distress him with the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of Guilt and Death. For the
strength of Sin is the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 56.
The Power it hath to disquiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
Sinners, is in and by the Law.
When it is thus with Sinners, when the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49192:57"/>
Law presseth them with a sense of the
Guilt of Sin, and deprives them of all
Rest and Peace in their minds; they will
resolve to cast off the Yoke of Sin, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish
its service, that they may be freed
from the Urgency of the Law on their
Consciences. And they will endeavour it
in some Instances of Duty, and Abstinence
from Sin.</p>
               <p>2. THEY will do the same under sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizals
with Sickness, Pain, Dangers, or
Death it self. Then they will cry, and
pray, and promise to reform, and set about
it, as they suppose, in good earnest. This
Case is fully exemplified, <hi>Psal.</hi> lxxviij.
33, 34, 35, 36, 37. And it is manifest in
daily Experience amongst multitudes.
There are few who are so seared and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate,
but at such Seasons they will think
of returning to God, of relinquishing the
service of Sin, and vindicating themselves
from under its Dominion. And in some it
worketh a lasting Change, though no real
Conversion doth ensue. But with the most,
this <hi>Goodness is as the morning Cloud, and
as the early Dew, so passeth it away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. THE same Effect is produced in
many by the preaching of the Word.
Some Arrow of Conviction is fastened in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49192:57"/>
their Minds, whereon their former ways dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
them; and they judge it is better for
them to change the Course of their Lives,
and to relinquish the service of Sin: These
Resolutions for the most part abide with
them, according to the Society which they
have or fall into. Good Society may much
help them in their Resolves for a time;
when by that which is evil and corrupt
they are presently extinguished.</p>
               <p>4. SOMETIMES merciful, endearing
Providences will have the same effect on the
Minds of Men, not obdurate in Sin. Such
are deliverances from imminent dangers,
sparing the lives of near Relations and the
like.</p>
               <p>IN such seasons Men under the Law
will attend unto their Convictions, and
endeavour for a while to shake off the
Yoke of Sin. They will attend unto
what the Law saith, under whose Power
they are, and endeavour a compliance
therewith; many duties shall be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and many Evils abstained from, in
order to the quitting themselves of Sin's
Dominion. But alas the Law cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
them hereunto: It cannot give them
life and strength to go through with what
their Convictions press them unto; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49192:58"/>
after a while, they begin to faint
and wax weary in their Progress, and at
length give quite over. It may be they
may break off from some great Sins in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;
but shake off the Whole Dominion
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Sin they cannot.</p>
               <p>IT is otherwise with them that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>Grace.</hi> Sin shall not have Dominion
over them; strength shall be administred
unto them to dethrone it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GRACE</hi> is a word of various Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
in the Scripture. As we are here
said to be under it, and as it is opposed unto
the Law, it is used or taken for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
as it is the Instrument of God for the
Communication of himself, and his Grace
by Jesus Christ unto those that do believe,
with that state of Acceptation with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which they are brought into thereby,
<hi>Rom.</hi> v. 1, 2. Wherefore to be <hi>under Grace,</hi>
is to have an Interest in the Gospel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and State, with a Right unto all
the Privileges and Benefits thereof, to be
brought under the Administration of Grace
by Jesus Christ, to be a true Believer.</p>
               <p>BUT the Enquiry hereon is, how it
follows from hence, that Sin shall not
have Dominion over us; that Sin cannot
extend its Territories and Rule into that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49192:58"/>
state; and in what sence this is affirmed?</p>
               <p>1. IS it that there shall be no Sin in them
any more? Even this is true in some
sence. Sin, as unto its condemning
Power, hath no place in this State, <hi>Rom.</hi>
viij. 1. All the sins of them that believe
are expiated or done away, as to the
guilt of them in the Blood of Christ,
<hi>Heb.</hi> i. 2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 7. This branch of the
Dominion of Sin, which consists in its
condemning Power, is utterly cast out of
this state. But Sin, as unto its Being and
Operation doth still continue in Believers,
whilst they are in this World: They are
all sensible of it. Those who deceive
themselves with a contrary apprehension,
are most of all under the Power of it,
1 <hi>Joh.</hi> i. 8. Wherefore to be freed from
the Dominion of Sin, is not to be freed
absolutely from all Sin; so as that it should
in no sence abide in us any more. This
is not to be <hi>under Grace,</hi> but to be in
Glory.</p>
               <p>2. IS it that sin, though it abides, yet
it shall not fight nor contend for Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
in us? That this is otherwise, we
have before declared; Scripture and the
universal Experience of all that believe,
do testifie the contrary: So doth the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49192:59"/>
here given us, that it shall not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that Dominion. For if it did not
contend for it, there could be no Grace in
this Promise. There is none in Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from that whereof we are in no
danger.</p>
               <p>BUT the Assurance here given is built
on other Considerations; whereof the <hi>First</hi>
is, That the Gospel is the means ordained,
and Instrument used by God for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of spiritual strength unto them
that believe, for the dethroning of Sin.
It is the <hi>Power of God unto Salvation,
Rom.</hi> i. 16. that whereby and wherein he
puts forth his Power unto that end. And
Sin must be really dethroned by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acting of Grace in us, and that in a
way of duty in our selves. We are absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
quitted, freed from the Rule of Sin,
as unto its pretended Right and Title, by
the Promise of the Gospel. For thereby
are we freed and discharged from the Rule
of the Law, wherein all the Title of Sin
unto Dominion is founded. For the
strength of Sin is the Law. But we are
freed from it, as unto its internal Power,
and exercise of its Dominion, by internal
spiritual Grace and strength in its due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.
Now this is communicated by the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49192:59"/>
Gospel; it gives Life and Power, with
such continual supplies of Grace, as are able
to dethrone Sin, and for ever to prohibit its
return.</p>
               <p>THIS then is the present Case sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and determined by the Apostle.
You that are Believers, are all of you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
with Sin. You find it always rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
and disquieting, sometimes strong and
powerful. When it is in conjunction
with any urgent Temptation, you are
affraid it will utterly prevail over you to
the ruine of your Souls. Hence you are
wearied with it, groan under it, and cry
out for deliverance from it. All these
things the <hi>Apostle</hi> at large insists on in this
and the <hi>next Chapter.</hi> But now, saith he,
be of good comfort. Notwithstanding all
these things, and all your Fears upon them,
Sin shall not prevail, it shall not have the
Dominion, it shall never ruine your Souls.
But what Ground have we for this Hope?
What Assurance of this Success? This you
have, saith the <hi>Apostle,</hi> You are <hi>not under
the Law, but under Grace;</hi> or, the Rule of
the Grace of God in Christ Jesus, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in the Gospel. But how doth this
give relief? Why it is the Ordinance, the
Instrument of God which he will use unto
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49192:60"/>
this End, namely the Communication of
such supplies of Grace and spiritual strength,
as shall eternally defeat the Dominion of
Sin.</p>
               <p>THIS is one principal Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Law and the Gospel, and was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verso
esteemed in the Church of God, until
all Communication of Efficacious Grace
began to be called in Question. The Law
guides, directs, commands all things that
are against the Interest and Rule of Sin.
It judgeth and condemneth both the things
that promote it, and the Persons that do
them: It frightens and terrifies the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of those who are under its Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But if you shall say unto it, what
then shall we do? this Tyrant, this Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
is too hard for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what aid and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
against it will it afford unto us?
What power will it communicate unto its
destruction? Here the Law is utterly si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
or says, that nothing of this nature
is committed unto it of God. Nay, the
strength it hath it gives unto sin for the
Condemnation of the Sinner; the <hi>strength
of Sin is the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT the Gospel, or the grace of it,
is the means and Instrument of God, for
the Communication of internal spiritual
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49192:60"/>
Strength unto Believers. By it do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
supplies of the Spirit, or aids of Grace
for the subduing of Sin, and the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its Dominion. By it they may say,
they can do all things through him that
enables them. Hereon then depends in
the first place the Assurance of the <hi>Apostles</hi>
Assertion, That <hi>Sin shall not have the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over us,</hi> because we are <hi>under Grace.</hi>
We are in such a State, as wherein we
have supplies in readiness to defeat all the
Attempts of Sin, for Rule and Dominion
in us.</p>
               <p>BUT some may say hereon, They
greatly fear they are not in this state; for
they do not find such supplies of spiritual
Strength and Grace, as to give them a
conquest over sin. They are still perplexed
with it, and it is ready to invade the
Throne in their Minds, if it be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
possessed of it. Wherefore they fear
least they are strangers from the Grace of
the Gospel.</p>
               <p>IN Answer hereunto, the Things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
are proposed.</p>
               <p>1. REMEMBER what hath been
declared concerning the Dominion of Sin.
If it be not known what it is, and wherein
it doth consist, as some may please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49192:61"/>
whilst their condition is deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as it is with the most; so others may
be perplexed in their Minds without just
Cause. A clear destinction between the
Rebellion of Sin and the Dominion of Sin,
is a great Advantage unto spiritual Peace.</p>
               <p>2. CONSIDER the Ends for which
aids of Grace are granted and communicated
by the Gospel. Now this is not, That Sin
may at once be utterly destroyed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
in us, that it should have no Being,
Motion, or Power in us any more. This
work is reserved for glory in the full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Body and Soul, which we
here do but groan after. But it is given
unto us for this End, that sin may be so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
and mortified in us, that is, so gradually
weakened and destroyed, as that it shall
not ruine spiritual Life in us, obstruct its
necessary acting in duties, and Prevalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
against such Sins as would disannul the
Covenant-Relation between God and our
Souls. Whilst we have supplies of it which
are sufficient unto this End, although our
Conflict with Sin doth continue, although
we are perplexed by it, yet we are <hi>under
Grace,</hi> and Sin shall have no more Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over us. This is enough for us, that
Sin shall be gradually destroyed, and we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49192:61"/>
shall have a sufficiency of Grace in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
to prevent its ruling Prevalency.</p>
               <p>3. LIVE in the Faith of this sacred
Truth, and ever keep alive in your Souls
Expectation of supplies of Grace suitable
thereunto. It is of the nature of true and
saving Faith, inseparable from it, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that the Gospel is the way of God's
Administration of Grace for the ruine of
Sin. He that believes it not, believes not
the Gospel it self, which is the Power of
God unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 16. If we
live, and walk, and act as if we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to trust unto but our selves, our own
Endeavours, our own Resolutions, and
that in our perplexities and surprizals, it is
no wonder if we are not sensible of supplies
of divine Grace; most probably we are
<hi>under the Law,</hi> and not <hi>under Grace.</hi> This
is the Fundamental Principle of the Gospel
State, that we live in Expectation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Communications of Life, Grace and
Strength from Jesus Christ, who is our
Life, and from whose fulness we receive,
and Grace for Grace. We may therefore
in this Case continually expostulate with
our Souls, as <hi>David</hi> doth; Why go you
mourning because of the Oppression of the
Enemy? Why are you cast down, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49192:62"/>
why are you disquieted within us? Still
hope in God, he is the health of my
Countenance; we may be sensible of great
Oppression from the Power of this Enemy;
this may cause us to go mourning all the day
long, and in some sence it ought so to do.
Howbeit we ought not hence to despond,
or to be cast down from our Duty or our
Comfort. Still me may trust in God
through Christ, and live in continual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of such spiritual Reliefs, as shall
assuredly preserve us from the Dominion of
Sin. This Faith, Hope, and Expectation
we are called unto by the Gospel. And
when they are not cherished, when they
are not kept up unto a due Exercise, all
things will go backward in our spiritual
Condition.</p>
               <p>4. MAKE especial Application unto
the Lord Christ, unto whom the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of all spiritual supplies is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for the Communication of them unto
you, according unto all especial Occasions.
Hath sin got the advantage of a powerful
Temptation, so as that it seems to put
hard for Dominion in the Soul, as it was
with <hi>Paul</hi> under the buffetings of Sathan,
when he had that answer from God upon
his reiterated Prayer, <hi>My Grace is sufficient
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49192:62"/>
for thee,</hi> Sin shall not have Dominion over
thee? Hath it by its deceitfulness brought
the Soul into a lifeless, senseless frame,
makes it forgetful of Duties, negligent in
them, or without spiritual delight in their
performance? Hath it almost habituated
the Soul unto careless and corrupt Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
unto the love, of or conformity to the
World? Doth it take advantage from our
darkness and confusion under Troubles,
Distresses or Temptations? On these and
the like Occasions it is required, that we
make especial, fervent Application unto
the Lord Christ, for such supplies of Grace
as may be sufficient and efficacious to
controul the Power of sin in them all.
This under the consideration of his Office
and Authority unto this End, his Grace
and readiness from especial Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
we are directed unto, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 14,
15, 16.</p>
               <p>5. REMEMBER always the Way and
Method of the Operations of divine Grace,
and spiritual Aids. It is true in our first
Conversion to God, we are as it were sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
by a mighty Act of sovereign Grace,
changing our hearts, renewing our minds,
and quickening us with a principle of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Life. Ordinarily many things are
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49192:63"/>
required of us in a way of Duty in order
thereunto. And many previous Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Grace in our Minds in illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the sense of sin do materially
and passively dispose us thereunto, as
Wood when it is dried, is disposed to Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
But the work it self is performed
by an immediate act of divine power,
without any active co-operation on our
parts. But this is not the Law or Rule
of the Communication or Operation of
actual Grace, for the subduing of Sin.
It is given in a way of concurrence with
us in the discharge of our Duties, and
when we are sedulous in them, we may
be sure we shall not fail of divine assistance
according to the established Rule of the
administration of Gospel Grace. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we complain that we find not the Aids
mentioned, if at the same time we are not
diligent in attendance unto all the Duties,
whereby Sin may be mortified in us, we
are exceedingly injurious to the Grace of
God.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE notwithstanding this
Objection, the Truth stands firm, <hi>that Sin
shall not have Dominion over us, because we
are not under the Law, but under Grace;</hi>
because of the spiritual Aids that are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49192:63"/>
by Grace, for its mortification and
destruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE Law gives no Liberty
of any kind; it gendreth unto Bondage,
and so cannot free us from any Dominion,
not that of Sin. For this must be by Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
But this we have also by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
There is a two-fold Liberty; (1.)
<hi>Of State</hi> and Condition; (2.) Of <hi>intern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
Operation.</hi> And we have both by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
The first consists in our deliverance
from the Law and its Curse, with all
things which claim a Right against us by
Virtue thereof; that is, Sathan, Death
and Hell. Out of this state from whence
we can never be delivered by the Law,
we are translated by Grace into a state of
glorious Liberty. For, by it the Son makes
us free, and we receive the Spirit of Christ.
Now <hi>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there
is Liberty,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iij. 17. This Liberty
Christ proclaims in the Gospel unto all that
do believe, <hi>Isa.</hi> lxi. 1. Hereon they who
hear and receive the joyful sound, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from all Debts, Bonds, Accounts,
Rights and Titles, and are brought into a
state of perfect Freedom. In this state sin can
lay no Claim to Dominion over any one Soul.
They are gone over into the Kingdom of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49192:64"/>
Christ, and out from the Power of Sin,
Sathan and Darkness. Herein indeed lies
the Foundation of our assured Freedom
from the Rule of Sin. It cannot make an
Incursion on the Kingdom of Christ, so as
to carry away any of its Subjects into a
state of Sin and Darkness again. And an
Interest in this state ought to be pleaded
against all the Attempts of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 1,
2. There is nothing more to be detested,
than that any One who is Christ's Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and dead to the Power of Sin, should
give place again unto any of its Pretences
to, or endeavours for Rule.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, there is an <hi>internal Liberty,</hi>
which is the Freedom of the mind, from
the inward powerful Chains of Sin, with
an ability to act all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul in a gracious manner. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is the power of Sin in the Soul destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And this also is given us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
There is power administred in it
to live unto God, and to walk in all his
Commandments. And this also gives Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
unto the Truth of the Apostles Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THE Law doth not supply
us with effectual Motives and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to endeavour the Ruine of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49192:64"/>
Dominion of Sin in a way of Duty, which
must be done, or in the End it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.
It works only by fear and dread,
with threatnings and terrors of Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For although it says also, Do this and
live, yet withal it discovers such an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
in our Nature, to comply with its
Commands in the way and manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it enjoins them, that the very promise
of it becomes a matter of Terror, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the contrary Sentence of Death
upon our Failure in its commands. Now
these things enervate, weaken and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
the Soul in its Conflict against Sin:
They give it no Life, Activity, Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
or Courage in what they undertake.
Hence those who engage themselves into
an Opposition unto Sin, or a Relinquish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of its Service, meerly on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of the Law, do quickly faint and
give over. We see it so with many every
Day. One Day they will forsake all sin,
their beloved sin, with the Company and
Occasions enducing them thereunto. The
Law hath frighted them with divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.
And sometimes they proceed so
far in this Resolution, they seem escaped the
Pollution of the World; yet soon again
they return to their former Ways and Follies,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49192:65"/>
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> ij. 20, 21, 22. Their goodness is as
the morning Cloud, and as the early Dew
so passeth it away. Or if they do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to wallow in the same Mire of their
former Pollutions, they betake themselves
to the shades of some superstitious Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances;
as it is in the <hi>Papacy.</hi> For they
openly succeed into the Room of the <hi>Jews,</hi>
who being ignorant of the Righteousness
of God, and not submitting thereunto,
went about variously to establish their own
Righteousness, as the Apostle speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi>
x. 3, 4. For in that Apostate Church where
men are wrought on by the Terrors of the
Law to relinquish Sin, and set themselves
in opposition unto its Power, finding
themselves altogether unable to do it by the
works of the Law it self, which must be
perfectly holy; they betake themselves to
a number of superstitious Observances
which they trust unto in the room of the
Law, with its Commands and Duties.
But the Law makes nothing perfect, nor
are the Motives it gives for the ruine of the
Interest of Sin in us, able to bear us out,
and carry us through that undertaking.</p>
               <p>BUT the Motives and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
given by Grace to endeavour the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine of sin in a way of Duty, are such
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49192:65"/>
as give Life, Chearfulness, Courage and
Perseverance, they continually animate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and revive the Soul in all its Work
and Duty, keeping it from fainting and
despondency. For they are all taken from
the Love of God and of Christ, from the
whole Work and End of his Mediation,
from the ready Assistances of the Holy
Ghost, from all the Promises of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
from their own with other Believers
Experiences, all giving them the highest
Assurance of final Success and Victory.
When the Soul is under the Influences of
these Motives, whatever difficulty and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
it meets withal from solliciting
Temptations or Surprizals, it will renew
its strength, it will run and not be weary,
it will walk and not faint, according to
the Promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> xl. 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> CHRIST is not in the Law,
he is not proposed in it, not communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by it, we are not made partakers of him
thereby. This is the work of Grace, of
the Gospel. In it is Christ revealed, by
it he is proposed and exhibited unto us;
thereby are we made partakers of him, and
all the Benefits of his Mediation. And he
it is alone who came to, and can destroy
this Work of the Devil. The Dominion
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49192:66"/>
of Sin is the complement of the Works of
the Devil, where all his designs center.
This <hi>the Son of God was manifest to destroy.</hi>
He alone ruines the Kingdom of Sathan,
whose power is acted in the Rule of Sin.
Wherefore, hereunto our Assurance of this
comfortable Truth, is principally resolved;
and what Christ hath done, and doth for
this End, is a great part of the subject of
Gospel Revelation.</p>
               <p>THE like may be spoken of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of the Holy Spirit, which is the
only principal efficient Cause of the ruine
of the Dominion of Sin. For where the
Spirit of Christ is, there is liberty, and no
where else. But we receive this Spirit not
by the works of the Law, but by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> iij. 2.</p>

I. IT is an unspeakable Mercy and
Privilege to be delivered from the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Sin. As such it is here proposed by
the Apostle, as such it is esteemed by them
that believe. Nothing is more sweet, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and valuable unto a Soul conflicting
with Sin and Temptation, than to hear
that Sin shall not have the Dominion over
them. Ah what would some give that it
might be spoken unto them with Power,
so as that they might stedfastly believe it,
and have the Comfort of it. Fools make
a mock of Sin, and some glory in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of it, which is their shame. But
those who understand any thing aright,
either of what is present, or what is to
come, do know that this freedom from
its Dominion, is an unvaluable Mercy. And
we may consider the Grounds which Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it so to be.</p>
               <p>1. IT appears so to be from the causes of
it. It is that which no man can by his own
Power, and the utmost of his Endeavours at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
unto. Men by them may grow rich,
or Wise, or Learned; but no Man by them
can shake off the Yoke of Sin. If a Man
had all the Wealth of the World, he could
not by it purchase this Liberty; it would
be despised. And when Sinners go hence
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49192:67"/>
to the place where the Rich Man was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
and have nothing more to do
with this World, they would give it all
if they had it, for an Interest in this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p>IT is that which the Law and all the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it cannot procure. The Law and its
Duties, as we have declared, can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the Dominion of Sin. All Men will
find the Truth hereof, that ever come to
fall under the Power of real Conviction.
When Sin presseth on them, and they are
affraid of its Consequents, they will find,
that the Law is weak, and the Flesh is
weak, and their Duties are weak, their
Resolutions and Vows are weak; all insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to relieve them. And if they think
themselves freed one day, they shall find
the next that they are under Bondage; Sin
for all this will rule over them with force
and rigour. And in this condition do some
spend all their Days in this World. They
kindle sparks of their own, and walk in
the Light of them, until they lie down in
darkness and sorrow. They Sin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
amendment, and endeavour Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
by some Duties, yet can never extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
themselves from the Yoke of Sin. We
may therefore learn the Excellency of this
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49192:67"/>
Privilege, first from its Causes, whereof I
shall mention some only.</p>
               <p>1. THE meritorious procuring Cause
of this Liberty, is the Death and Blood of
Jesus Christ. So is it declared, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.
18, 19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 20. <hi>Chap.</hi> vij. 23. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else could purchase this Freedom.
Under the Power and Dominion of Sin
we were, and could not be delivered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Ransom. Christ died and rose,
and lives again, that he might be our
Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 9. and so deliver us from
the Power of all other Lords whatever. It
is true there was no Ransom due to Sin or
Sathan, who was the Author of it. They
were to be dethroned or destroyed by an Act
of Power. Both the Devil, and Sin, which is
his work, are to be destroyed not appeased,
<hi>Heb.</hi> ij. 14. 1 <hi>John</hi> iij. 8. But the strength
of Sin is the Law, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 56. that is,
through the righteous Sentence of God,
we were held by the Law obnoxious unto
the condemning Power of Sin. From that
Law we could not be delivered but by this
Price and Ransom. Two Things hence
follow:</p>
               <p>1. THOSE who live in Sin, who
willingly abide in the service of it, and
endure its Dominion, do cast the utmost
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49192:68"/>
contempt on the Wisdom, Love, and
Grace of Christ. They despise that which
cost him so dear. They judge that he
made a very foolish purchace of this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for us, with his dearest Blood. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, they preferr the present satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Lusts before it. This is the
Poison of Unbelief. There is in it an high
Contempt of the Wisdom and Love of
Christ. The Language of Mens Hearts
that live in Sin, is, that the Liberty which
he purchased with his Blood, is not to be
valued or esteemed. They flatter him
with their Lips in the outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of some duties; but in their Hearts
they despise him, and the whole work of
his Mediation. But the time is approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wherein they will learn the difference
between the slavery of Sin, and the Liberty
wherewith Christ makes Believers free.
And this is that which is now tendred unto
Sinners in the Dispensation of the Gospel;
Life and Death are here set before you,
chuse Life that ye may live for ever.</p>
               <p>2. LET those that are Believers in all
their Conflicts with Sin, live in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Faith, on this purchace of Liberty
made by the Blood of Christ. For two
Things will hence ensue, (1.) That they
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49192:68"/>
will have a mighty Argument always in
readiness to oppose unto the Deceit and
Violence of Sin. The Soul will hereon
say to its self, shall I forego and part with
that which Christ purchased for me at so
dear a rate, by giving place to the solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Lust or Sin? Shall I despise his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace?
God forbid. See <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 2. By
such Arguings is the mind frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
from closing with the Enticements
and Seductions of Sin. (2.) It is an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Argument for Faith to use in its pleading
for deliverance from the Power of Sin.
We ask for nothing but what Christ hath
purchased for us. And if this Plea be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
it will be prevalent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> THE internal efficient cause of
this Liberty, or that whereby the Power
and Rule of Sin is destroyed in us, is the
Holy Spirit himself, which farther e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth
the greatness of this Mercy. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
act for the Mortification of Sin, is no
less immediately from him, than those po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Graces are, whereby we are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
It is through the Spirit that we mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
the deeds of the Flesh, <hi>Rom.</hi> viij. 13.
Where he is, there and there alone is Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
All attempts for the Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sin without his especial aids and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49192:69"/>
Operations, are frustrate. And this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifests
the Extent of the Dominion of Sin
in the World. He alone by whom it can
be destroyed, and all those efficacious O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations
of his whereby it is so, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
despised. And they must live and
die slaves unto Sin, by whom they are
so. Wherefore a great part of our Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for the attaining and preserving this
Liberty, consists in the acting of Faith
on that promise of our Saviour, that our
heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit
to them that ask him of him. When Sin
in any Instance, by any Temptation, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for Power and Rule in us, we are
ready to turn into our selves and our own
Resolutions, which in their place are not
to be neglected. But immediate crys unto
God for such supplies of his Spirit, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which Sin will not be subdued, we
shall find our best Relief. Bear it in mind,
try it on the next Occasion, and God will
bless it with success.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> THE instrumental cause of this
Freedom is the Duty of Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
in and for the destruction of Sin.
And this also manifests the importance of
this Privilege. This is one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Ends of all our religious Duties; of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49192:69"/>
Prayer, of Fasting, of Meditation, of
Watchfulness unto all other Duties of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
they are all designed to prevent
and ruine the Interest of Sin in us. We
are called into a Theater to fight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
into a Field to be tried in a Warfare.
Our Enemy is this Sin, which strives and
contends for the Rule over us. This we
are to resist even unto blood, that is, our
utmost in doing and suffering. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that is in it self and unto us of the
highest Importance, which on divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
and Command, is the great
End of the constant Endeavours of our
whole lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> IT appears so to be from the
consideration of the Bondage which we
are delivered from thereby. Bondage is
that which humane nature is most averse
from, until it be debased and debauched
by sensual Lusts. Men of ingenuous
Spirits have in all Ages chosen rather
to die than to be made slaves. But there
is no such Bondage as that which is
under the Dominion of Sin. To be
under the Power of base Lusts, as Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,
Uncleanness, Drunkenness,
Ambition, Pride and the like, to make
Provision to fulfil their Desires in the Wills
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49192:70"/>
of the Mind and the Flesh, is the worst of
slavery.</p>
               <p>BUT we may say what we please on
this subject; none think themselves so
free, none make such an Appearance of
generous Freedom unto others, as those
who are avowed servants of Sin. If those
are not Freemen, who do what they
please, and are for the most part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
in what they do, who puff at
all their Enemies, and scorn such as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimous
Slaves, who go not forth unto
the same compass of excess with them,
who shall be esteemed free? They plead
with the Pharisees that they are the only
Freemen, and were never in Bondage to
any. The servile restraints of Fear from
divine Judgment and future Accounts they
wholly despise. See the Description, <hi>Psal.</hi>
lxxiij. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Who so free,
so joyous as such Persons; as for others,
<hi>they are plagued all the day long, and are
chastened every morning, v.</hi> 14. Yea, they
go heavily and mournfully under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of this Enemy, crying out conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
for deliverance.</p>
               <p>BUT the Truth insisted on is not at
all impeached by this Observation. It is
a great part of the slavery of such Persons,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49192:70"/>
that they know not themselves to be Slaves,
and boast that they are free. They are
born in a state of Enmity against God,
and Bondage under Sin, and they like
well of it, as all abject Slaves do, under
the worst of Tyrants; they know no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But true Liberty consists in inward
Peace, Tranquillity of Mind, Designs for
and Inclinations unto the best things, the
most noble Objects of our natural, rational
Souls. All these they are utter Strangers
unto, who spend their lives in the service
of vile and base Lusts. Envy not their
Gallantry, their glistering appearances,
their heaps of Wealth and Treasures, they
are in the whole vile and contemptible
Slaves. The Apostle determines their
Case, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 17. It is a matter of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
thankfulness unto God, that we are
delivered from being the Servants of Sin.</p>
               <p>YEA, it is an Evidence of Grace, of a
good frame of Spirit, when a soul is made
really sensible of the excellency of this
Freedom; when it so finds the Power
and Interest of Sin to be weakned, as that
it can rejoice in it, and be thankful to God
for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> vij. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> IT is so, with respect unto the
End of this Bondage, or what it brings
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49192:71"/>
Men unto. If after all the base drudgery
which sinful Men are put unto in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of their Lusts, if after all the Conflicts
which their Consciences put them on with
Fears and Terrors in the World, they could
expect any thing of a future reward here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
something might be spoke to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
their present Misery. But <hi>the Wages
of Sin is Death,</hi> eternal Death under the
wrath of the great God, is all they are to
look for. The End of the Dominion of
Sin, is to give them up unto the Curse
of the Law, and Power of the Devil for
evermore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> IT keeps Men off from the
Participation of all real Good here and
hereafter. What Men under the Power of
Sin do enjoy, will quickly appear to be
as a thing of nought. In the mean time,
they have not the least taste of the
Love of God, which alone takes out
the Poison of their Enjoyments. They
have not the least view of the Glory of
Christ, without which they live in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
darkness, like those who never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the light nor Sun. They have no
Experience of the sweetness and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the gracious Influences of Life, and
Strength, and Comfort from the Holy Ghost;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49192:71"/>
nor of that satisfaction and reward which
is in holy Obedience; nor shall ever come
to the Enjoyment of God. All these things
and sundry others of the like sort might be
insisted on and inlarged, to manifest the
greatness of the Mercy and Privilege which
is in a Freedom from the Dominion of Sin,
as it is here proposed by the <hi>Apostle.</hi> But
the principal design I intended is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
and I do but touch on these things.</p>
               <p>I shall add One Observation more, and
with it put a Close to this Discourse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. IT is the great Interest of a Soul
conflicting with the Power of Sin, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it self against its Dominion; that it is
not under its Dominion; not to have the
Cause hang dubious in the Mind. To
clear the truth hereof, we may observe the
things that follow.</p>
               <p>1. THE Conflict with Sin, making
continual Repentance and Mortification
absolutely necessary will continue in us
whilst we are in this World. Pretences of
Perfection here, are contrary to the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
contrary to the universal Experience
of all Believers, and contrary to the Sense
and Conscience of them by whom they
are pleaded, as they make it evident every
day. We pray against it, strive against it,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49192:72"/>
groan for deliverance from it, and that,
by the Grace of Christ healing our Nature,
not without success. Howbeit this success
extends not unto its absolute Abolition
whilst we are in this World. It will abide
in us until the union of the Soul and Body
wherein it hath incorporated it self, be
dissolved. This is our Lot and Portion;
this is the consequent of our Apostasie from
God, and the Depravation of our nature
thereby.</p>
               <p>YOU will say then, Whereto serves
the Gospel, and the Grace of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ in this Case, if it be not able to
give us deliverance herein? I answer, it
doth give us a Fourfold Relief, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
virtually to a constant deliverance,
though Sin will abide in us whilst we are in
this World.</p>
               <p>1. IT is so ordered, that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Sin in us shall be the Ground, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Occasion of the exercise of all Grace,
and putting a lustre on our Obedience.
Some excellent Graces, as Repentance and
Mortification could have no exercise if it
were otherwise. And whilst we are in
this World, there is a beauty in them, that
is an over-balance for the Evil of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
of Sin: And the difficulty which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49192:72"/>
is hereby put on our Obedience, calling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
for the exercise and improvement of
all Grace, renders it the more valuable.
Herein lies the Spring of Humility, and self-Resignation
to the Will of God. This
makes us love and long for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ, putting an excellency on his
Mediation; whence the Apostle on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of it, falls into that Ejaculation;
<hi>I thank God through Jesus Christ my Lord,
Rom.</hi> vij. 25. This sweetens unto us our
future Rest and Reward. Wherefore the
continuance of us in this state and condition
in this World, a state of spiritual Warfare,
is best for us, and highly suited unto divine
Wisdom, considering the Office and Care
of our Lord Jesus Christ for our Relief.
Let us not complain, or repine, or faint, but
go on with Christian Fortitude unto the
End, and we shall have success. For,</p>
               <p>2. THERE are by the Grace of Christ,
such supplies and aids of spiritual Strength
granted unto Believers, that Sin shall never
proceed further in them than is useful and
needful for the exercise of their Graces. It
shall never have its Will upon them, nor
Dominion over them, as we have before
declared.</p>
               <p>3. THERE is Mercy administred in and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49192:73"/>
by the Gospel, for the Pardon of all that is
Evil in it self, or in any of its effects. <hi>There
is no Condemnation unto them that are in
Christ Jesus.</hi> Pardoning Mercy, according
to the Tenor of the Covenant, doth always
disarm this Sin in Believers of its condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Power. So that notwithstanding the
utmost endeavours of it, <hi>being justified by
Faith, they have Peace with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. THERE is a season, when by the
Grace of Christ it shall be utterly abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
namely, at Death, when the course of
our Obedience is finished. Wherefore to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that this Sin, and consequently a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with it, doth abide in Believers whilst
they are in this World, is no disparagement
unto the Grace of Christ, which gives such
a blessed deliverance from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> THERE is a double Conflict
with and against Sin. The One is in those
that are unregenerate, consisting in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
of Light and Conscience against the
Rule of Sin, in many particular Instances.
For although Sin be enthroned in the Will
and Affections, yet the knowledge of good
and evil in the Mind, excited by the hopes
and fears of things eternal, will make head
against it, as unto the performance of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
duties, and abstinence from Sin. This
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49192:73"/>
conflict may be where Sin is in the Throne,
and may deceive themselves, supposing it
may be from the Rule of Grace, when it
is only from the Rebellion of Light, and
the charge of a Conscience yet unseared.
But there is a conflict with Sin where Grace
hath the Rule and is Enthroned. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Grace have the Sovereignty in the
Mind and Heart, yet the remainders of Sin,
especially in the corrupt Affections, will
be continually rebelling against it. Now
this we say is the Interest of all, namely,
to enquire of what sort and kind that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with Sin is, which is in them; if it
be of the <hi>first</hi> sort, they may yet be under
the Dominion of Sin; if of the <hi>latter,</hi> they
are freed from it. Wherefore whilst the
mind is dubious in this Case and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
many evil consequences it will be
perplexed withal. I shall name some of
them.</p>
               <p>1. SUCH a soul can have no solid Peace,
because it hath not satisfaction what state it
doth belong unto.</p>
               <p>2. IT cannot receive refreshment by
Gospel Consolations in any condition; for
its just fears of the Dominion of Sin, will
defeat them all.</p>
               <p>3. IT will be dead and formal in all its
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49192:74"/>
Duties, without spiritual Courage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light;
which will at length make it weary
of them. So,</p>
               <p>4. ALL Grace, especially Faith, will
be weakened and impaired under this Frame
continually.</p>
               <p>5. FEAR of Death will hold the Soul
in Bondage; wherefore it is highly necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to have this Case well stated and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in our Minds; whereto if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Discourses may contribute any thing,
it is what was designed in them.</p>
               <p>THERE remains only to give some few
Directions, how the prevalency of Sin unto
such a Degree, as to render the Case about
its Rule dubious in the Mind, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated
and prevented. Some few of the
many that might be given, I shall propose.</p>
               <p>1. THE great Rule of preventing the
encrease and power of vitious Habits; is,
Watch against Beginnings. Sin doth not
attempt Dominion but in particular Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by one especial Lust or another. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if any Sin or corrupt Lust begin as it
were to set up for a peculiar Predominancy,
or Interest in the Mind and Affections; if
it be not entertained with severe Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it will ruine the Peace, if not endanger
the safety of the Soul. And when this is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49192:74"/>
so, it may easily be discovered by any one
who keepeth a diligent watch over his
Heart and Ways. For no Sin doth so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
advance it self in the Mind and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
but it is promoted therein either by
Mens natural Inclinations, or by their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in occasions of Life, or by some
Temptation which they have exposed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto, or by some such neglect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the frequency of Acts have strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vitious Inclinations. But these things
may be easily discerned by those who are
in any measure awake unto their Soul's
Concernments.</p>
               <p>THE strict charge given us by our Lord
Jesus Christ to watch, and that of the Wise
Man, above all keepings to keep our hearts,
have especial regard unto those beginnings
of Sin's obtaining Power in us. So soon as
a Discovery is made of its coincidence or
conjunction, with any of those ways of the
promotion of its Power, if it be not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with severe and diligent Mortification,
it will proceed in the method declared,
<hi>James</hi> i. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>THOSE who would be wise, must
familiarize Wisdom unto their minds, by
a continual free Converse with it. They
must say unto Wisdom, Thou art my Sister,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49192:75"/>
and call Understanding, thy Kinswoman,
<hi>Prov.</hi> vij. 4. So will Wisdom have Power
in and over their Minds. And if we suffer
Sin by any of the Advantages mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to familiarize it self into our minds; if
we say not unto it, Get thee hence upon
the first appearance of its activity for Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in us, it will put hard for the Thron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>2. CAREFULLY enquire and try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such things which you may do or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of in your selves, do not promote the
Power of Sin, and help on its Rule in you.
This Method <hi>David</hi> prescribes, <hi>Psal.</hi> xix.
12. Secret Sins, such as are not known to
be Sins, it may be to our selves, make way
for those that are presumptuous. Thus
Pride may seem to be nothing but a Frame
of Mind belonging unto our Wealth and
Dignity, or our Parts and Abilities; sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
may seem to be but a lawful Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of the good things of this Life; Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
and Peevishness, but a due sence of the
want of that respect which we suppose due
unto us; Covetousness a necessary care of
our selves and our Families. If the Seeds
of Sin are covered with such Pretences, they
will in time spring up and bear bitter Fruit
in the Minds and lives of Men. And the
beginnings of all Apostasie both in Religion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49192:75"/>
and Morality, lie in such Pretences. Men
plead they can do so and so lawfully, until
they can do things openly unlawful.</p>
               <p>3. KEEP your Hearts always tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the World. This is the true and only
state of inconsistency with, and repugnancy
to the Rule of Sin. The loss hereof, or a
decay herein, is that which hath opened
the Flood-Gates of Sin amongst us. Where
this Frame is, a consciencious Fear of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
will always prevail in the Soul;
where it is lost, Men will be bold in all sorts
of Follies. And that this Frame may be
preserved, it is required, (1.) That we cast
out all vicious Habits of Mind that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto it, <hi>James</hi> i. 21. (2.) That we
preserve an Experience of its Power and
Efficacy on our Souls, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> ij. 1, 2, 3. (3.)
That we lay aside all Prejudices against those
that dispence it, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 16. (4.) To keep
the Heart always humble, in which Frame
alone it is teachable, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxv. Every thing
in the preaching of the Word comes cross
and unpleasing to the Minds of Proud Men.
(5.) Pray for a Blessing on the Ministry,
which is the best preparation for receiving
benefit by it.</p>
               <p>4. ABHORR that Peace of Mind
which is consistent with any known Sin.
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49192:76"/>
Men may have frequent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> surprizals into
known Sins; but if, whilst it is so with
them, they refuse all inward Peace, but
what comes in by most fervent and sincere
desires of deliverance from them, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
for them, they may be safe from
the Dominion of Sin. But if Men can on
any Hopes, or Presumptions, or Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
preserve a kind of Peace in their Minds,
whilst they live in any known Sin; they
are nigh the Borders of that security, which
is the Territory wherein Sin doth reign.</p>
               <p>5. MAKE continual Applications unto
the Lord Christ in all the Acts of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for the Ruine of Sin, especially when
it attempts a Dominion in us, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 16.
This is the Life and Soul of all Directions in
this Case, which needs not here to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
on; it is frequently spoken unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> REMEMBER, that a due sence
of Deliverance from the Dominion of Sin,
is the most effectual Motive unto universal
Obedience and Holiness; as such it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and managed by the <hi>Apostle, Rom.</hi> vi.</p>
