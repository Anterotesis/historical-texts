            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>all Goodness out of them; but that will be an impossible thing, so long as we (the most essentially good) do subsist: for 'tis observed in all Religions, that Women are the truest Devotionists, and the most pious, and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly than those who pretend to be the most perfect and rational Creatures; for many Men with the Conceit of their own Perfections, neglect that which should make them so; as some mistaken persons, who think if they are of the right Church they shall be infallibly saved, when they never follow the Rules which lead to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and when Persons with this Inscription pass cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in Heaven, then it will be according to my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist's Fancy, that all Men are good, and fitting for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven because they are Men; and Women irreversibly damn'd, because they are Women: But that Heaven should make a Male and Female, both of the same Species, and both indued with the like Rational Souls, for two such differing Ends, is the most notorious Principle, and the most unlikely of any that ever was maintained by any Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Man, and I shall never take it for an Article of my Faith, being assured that Heaven is for all those whose Purity and Obedience to its Law, qualifies them for it, whether Male or Female; to which Place the latter seem to have the Claim, is the Opinion of one of its Votaries,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>BLasphemous Wretch, who canst think or say</l>
               <l>Some Curst or Banisht Fiend usurp't the way</l>
               <l>When <hi>Eve</hi> was form'd; for then's deny'd by you</l>
               <l>Gods Omniscience and Omnipresence too:</l>
               <l>Without which Attributes he could not be,</l>
               <l>The greatest and supreamest Deity:</l>
               <l>Nor can Heaven sleep, tho' it may mourn to see</l>
               <l>Degenerate Man utter Blasphemy.</l>
               <l>When from dark <hi>Chaos</hi> Heav'n the World did make,</l>
               <l>Made all things glorious it did undertake;</l>
               <l>Then it in <hi>Eden</hi>'s Garden freely plac'd</l>
               <l>All things pleasant to the Sight or Taste,</l>
               <l>Fill'd it with Beasts &amp; Birds, Trees hung with Fruit,</l>
               <l>That might with Man's Celestial Nature suit:</l>
               <l>The World being made thus spacious and compleat,</l>
               <l>Then Man was form'd, who seemed nobly great.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52386:3"/>When Heaven survey'd the Works that it had done,</l>
               <l>Saw Male and Female, but found Man alone,</l>
               <l>A barren Sex, and insignificant;</l>
               <l>So Heaven made Woman to supply the want,</l>
               <l>And to make perfect what before was scant:</l>
               <l>Then surely she a Noble Creature is,</l>
               <l>Whom Heaven thus made to consummate all Bliss.</l>
               <l>Though Man had Being first, yet methinks She</l>
               <l>In Nature should have the Supremacy;</l>
               <l>For Man was form'd out of dull senceless Earth;</l>
               <l>But Woman she had a far nobler Birth:</l>
               <l>For when the Dust was purify'd by Heaven,</l>
               <l>Made into Man, and Life unto it given,</l>
               <l>Then the Almighty and All-wise God said,</l>
               <l>That Woman of that Species should be made:</l>
               <l>Which was no sooner said, but it was done,</l>
               <l>'Cause 'twas not fit for Man to be alone.</l>
               <l>Thus have I prov'd Womans Creation good,</l>
               <l>And not inferior, when right understood:</l>
               <l>To that of Man's; for both one Maker had,</l>
               <l>Which made all good; then how could <hi>Eve</hi> be bad?</l>
               <l>But then you'l say, though she at first was pure,</l>
               <l>Yet in that State she did not long endure.</l>
               <l>'Tis true; but if her Fall's examin'd right,</l>
               <l>We find most Men have banish'd Truth for spight:</l>
               <l>Nor is she quite so guilty as some make;</l>
               <l>For <hi>Adam</hi> did most of the Guilt partake:</l>
               <l>For he from God's own Mouth had the Command;</l>
               <l>But Woman she had it at second hand:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52386:3"/>The Devil's Strength weak Woman might deceive,</l>
               <l>But <hi>Adam</hi> tempted only was by <hi>Eve.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Eve</hi> had the strongest Tempter, and least Charge;</l>
               <l>Man's knowing most, doth his Sin make most large.</l>
               <l>But though Woman Man to Sin did lead?</l>
               <l>Yet since her Seed hath bruis'd the Serpent's Head:</l>
               <l>Why should she be made a publick scorn,</l>
               <l>Of whom the great Almighty God was born?</l>
               <l>Surely to speak one slighting Word, must be</l>
               <l>A kind of murmuring Impiety:</l>
               <l>But still their greatest haters do prove such</l>
               <l>Who formerly have loved them too much:</l>
               <l>And from the Proverb they are not exempt;</l>
               <l>Too much Familiarity has bred Contempt;</l>
               <l>For they associate themselves with none,</l>
               <l>But such whose Virtues like their own, are gone;</l>
               <l>And with all those, and only those who be</l>
               <l>Most boldly vers'd in their Debauchery:</l>
               <l>And as in <hi>Adam</hi> all Mankind did die,</l>
               <l>They make all base for ones Immodesty;</l>
               <l>Nay, make the Name a kind of Magick Spell,</l>
               <l>As if 'twould censure married Men to Hell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Woman, ye Powers! the very Name's a Charm,</l>

                  <hi>Pluto</hi> from Hell did send by <hi>Incubus,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Because we make their Hell less populous;</l>
               <l>Or else you ne'er had damn'd the Females thus:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52386:4"/>But if so universally they are</l>
               <l>Dispos'd to Mischief, what need you declare</l>
               <l>Peculiar Faults, when all the World might see</l>
               <l>With each approaching Morn a Prodigy:</l>
               <l>Man curse dead woman; I could hear as well</l>
               <l>The black infernal Devils curse their Hell:</l>
               <l>VVhen there had been no such place we know,</l>
               <l>If they themselves had not first made it so.</l>
               <l>In Lust perhaps you others have excell'd,</l>
               <l>And made all VVhores that possibly would yield;</l>
               <l>And courted all the Females in your way,</l>
               <l>Then did design at last to make a Prey</l>
               <l>Of some pure Virgins; or what's almost worse,</l>
               <l>Make some chaste VVives to merit a Divorce.</l>
               <l>But 'cause they hated your insatiate Mind,</l>
               <l>Therefore you call what's Virtuous, Unkind:</l>
               <l>And Disappointments did your Soul perplex;</l>
               <l>So in meer spight you curse the Female Sex.</l>
               <l>I would not judge you thus, only I find</l>
               <l>You would adulterate all Womankind,</l>
               <l>Not only with your Pen; you higher soar;</l>
               <l>You'd exclude Marriage, make the VVorld a VVhore.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But if all Men should of your Humor be</l>
               <l>And should rob <hi>Hymen</hi> of his Deity,</l>
               <l>They soon would find the Inconveniency.</l>
               <l>Then hostile Spirits would be forc'd to Peace,</l>
               <l>Because the VVorld so slowly would increase.</l>
               <l>They would be glad to keep their Men at home,</l>
               <l>And each vvant more to attend his Throne:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:52386:4"/>Nay, should an <hi>English</hi> Prince resolve that he</l>
               <l>would keep the number of of's Nobility:</l>
               <l>And this dull custom some few years maintain'd,</l>
               <l>There would be none less than a Peer oth' land.</l>

               <l>So saved him from intended death, and she</l>

               <l>Them for a part of your Eternal Fate,</l>
               <l>Because they're things which you so much do hate.</l>

               <l>For virtue and they are so near ally'd</l>
               <l>That none can their mutual tyes divide.</l>
               <l>Like Light and Heat, incorporate they are,</l>
               <l>And interwove with providential care,</l>

               <l>The task befits a Laureat Crown'd with Bays:</l>
               <l>And yet all he can say, will be but small,</l>
               <l>A Copy differs from the original.</l>

               <l>At best but undervalluing disesteem.</l>
               <l>For he would come so short of what they are</l>
               <l>His lines won't with one single Act compare.</l>
               <l>But to say truest, is to say that she</l>

               <l>As you pretend she's Bad, and that's beyond</l>
               <l>Imagination, 'cause you set no bound,</l>
               <l>And then one certain definition is</l>
               <l>To say that she doth comprehend all Bliss.</l>

               <l>But 'tis 'cause you nere sought to find it out.</l>
               <l>You question where there's such a thing or no,</l>
               <l>'Tis only 'cause you hope you've lost a foe,</l>
               <l>A hated object, yet a stranger too.</l>

               <l>You do describe a woman so that one</l>

               <l>As if at her strange birth did shine no star,</l>

               <l>'Tis false in her, yet 'tis sum'd up in you.</l>
               <l>You almost would perswade one that you thought</l>

               <l>And that to <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Iezabell</hi> was given</l>
               <l>Souls of so great extent that heaven was driven</l>
               <l>Into a Straight, and liberality</l>
               <l>Had made her void of wanting, to supply</l>
               <l>These later bodies, she was forc'd to take</l>
               <l>Their souls asunder, and so numbers make,</l>

               <l>One Soul could serve for <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iude.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Or think that heaven so bankrupt or so poor,</l>
               <l>But that each body has one soul or more.</l>
               <l>I do not find our Sex so near ally'd,</l>
               <l>Either in disobedience or in pride,</l>
               <l>Unto the 'bovenamed Females (for I'm sure</l>

               <l>Tho' I confess there's some that merit blame:</l>
               <l>But yet their faults only thus much infer,</l>
               <l>That we're not made so perfect but may err;</l>
               <l>Which adds much lustre to a virtuous mind,</l>
               <l>And 'tis her prudence makes her soul confin'd</l>
               <l>Within the bounds of Goodness, for if she</l>
               <l>Was all perfection, unto that degree</l>
               <l>That 'twas impossible to do amiss,</l>
               <l>Why heaven not she must have the praise of this.</l>
               <l>But she's in such a state as she may fall,</l>
               <l>And without care her freedom may enthrall.</l>

               <l>There's not an History which doth not shew</l>
               <l>Man's pride, ambition and his falshood too.</l>
               <l>For if at any time th'ambitious have</l>

               <l>Being grave Counsellers or Aldermen,</l>
               <l>Or else the Wives Relations are alive,</l>
               <l>And then, if known, some other way they'l drive</l>
               <l>Their golden wheels, that way doth seem uneven,</l>
               <l>Then the Estate most certainly is given</l>
               <l>Some other way, or else 'tis setled so</l>
               <l>As he may never have it to bestow,</l>

               <l>For to have a very great esteem</l>
               <l>For his pretended Joy; but when her friends</l>
               <l>Are dead, then he his cursed life defends,</l>
               <l>With what they leave; then the unhappy wife,</l>
               <l>With her dear children, lead an horrid life,</l>
               <l>And the Estate's put to another use,</l>
               <l>And their great kindness turn'd an abuse;</l>
               <l>And should I strive their falshood to relate,</l>
               <l>Then I should have but <hi>Sisiphus</hi> his fate,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:52386:13"/>For Man is so inconstant and untrue,</l>

               <l>Still flies from's word, nay and perfidious too.</l>
               <l>An Instance too of Infidelity</l>
               <l>We have in <hi>Egypt</hi>'s false King <hi>Ptolomy,</hi>

               <l>Who fled to him for succour, yet base he</l>
               <l>Did command his death most treacherously;</l>
               <l>He was inconstant too, or else design'd</l>
               <l>The same at first, so alter'd words not mind,</l>
               <l>Which is much worse, for when that one doth speak</l>
               <l>With a full resolution, for to break</l>
               <l>One's word and oath, surely it must be</l>
               <l>A greater crime than an inconstancy,</l>
               <l>Which is as great failing in the soul</l>
               <l>As any sin that reason doth controul,</l>

               <l>By being declared his Heir, yet it was he</l>
               <l>Was the first actor in his tragedy:</l>
               <l>Perfidious and ungrateful and untrue</l>
               <l>He was at once, nay and disloyal too:</l>

               <l>And that's more false than any one can say.</l>
               <l>All Pride and Lust too to our charge they lay,</l>
               <l>As if in sin we all were so sublime</l>

               <l>Nay, Woman now is made the Scape-goat, and</l>
               <l>'Tis she must bear sins of all the land:</l>

               <l>Nay, it is well if he himself can bring</l>

               <l>Yet it is sometimes wanting, and they be</l>

               <l>Nought but confusion and degeneracy,</l>
               <l>Each Man's so eager of each fatal sin,</l>
               <l>As if he fear'd he should not do't again;</l>
               <l>Yet still his soul is black, he is the same</l>
               <l>At all times, tho' he doth not act all flame,</l>
               <l>Because he opportunity doth want,</l>
               <l>And to him always there's not a grant</l>
