            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen <hi>Alexander,</hi> surnamed <hi>the Great,</hi> had subjugated to his Will and Power the most flourishing Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of <hi>Greece,</hi> together with the famous City of <hi>Athens,</hi> that had the highest Repute for Literature, and Civil Government, being forc'd to submit to that mighty Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: When not a few of Her Citizens de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing of their former Freedom, and those Encouragements to Erudition and polite Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which She had with so much Renown formerly enjoy'd, left her Dominion. Amongst which a Senator, a Philosopher, and a person of Sacerdotal Function, took shipping, with intent to land in <hi>Persia</hi> where <hi>Darius</hi> then Reign'd, and was afterwards overcome by the abovemention'd <hi>Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Winds not favouring their Voyage, they were forc'd by a Storm on a certain Island that had been anciently call'd <hi>Astreada:</hi> which denomination, as some affim, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the Goddess <hi>Astrea,</hi> celebrated by Poets as the Tutelar Deity of Piety and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; which Deity, as they relate, had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently a Being on Earth, till the depravation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53027:3"/>
of Mankind both in respect of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and their Integrity to Laws and Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, caus'd this Goddess, as affronted by all sorts of Impieties, to <hi>abdicate</hi> her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the Beings of Men; whether for the Reason that the Precepts of this Celestial Guide had been longer retain'd in this Island, than in any other Region, might give occasion to its Inhabitants to call it <hi>Astreada,</hi> I will not positively affirm: But this I dare aver, That never any Country deserv'd more Esteem for preserving the Soundness of Her primitive Faith and Manners.</p>
            <p>The Three Persons before express'd, being the Chief of those that the tempestuous Rage of the Ocean had cast on this lsland, our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course shall be here limited to them, and a few such of the Inhabitants of <hi>Astreada</hi> as courteously gave them Reception.</p>
            <p>This lsland was of large Extent, if not great and powerful, both in the Number, Grandeur, and Valor of Inhabitants, and Opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Soil, and Conveniency of Scituation, prefe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>able in most Respects, if compar'd with other Neighbouring Dominions; and had not visibly deviated, in any known Age, from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Greatness or Virtue.</p>
            <p>As soon as these <hi>Athenians</hi> landed, the next Inhabitants to the Shore, receiv'd them very courteously, and took care for their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in all things as was requisite to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53027:3"/>
their Distress: And discerning that of these shipwrack'd Persons, Three of them, by their Habits, had an important distinction from the rest, they gave notice of their Quality and Function to one of the chiefest of their <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendons,</hi> whose Office was to examine Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and take care that no Religion differing from theirs should be diffus'd within the Island of <hi>Astreada.</hi> This <hi>Fidefendon</hi> being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with one of their Civil Superiors, who from the Duties of his Place was call'd a <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> or principal Magistrates of that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality; which was so happy, as neither the Imputation of Tyranny in their Monarchs, or detestable Sedition and Rebellion of their People, had any sanguine Records amongst them.</p>
            <p>As soon as they had kindly saluted the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Strangers, and given them such Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as was suitable to their Condition, the <hi>Fidefendon</hi> took occasion to let them know, That as they pitied their Sufferance in their past Voyage, so he could not but dissuade, for the benefit of their Souls, their manner of Worship, if dissenting from his in worshiping of the Divine Powers. And since he'perceiv'd that one of them was habited in the Vestments of a Priest and Sacrificer, according to the Custom of their Nation, he was willing to take cognizance of his Persuasion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, if he found it erroneous, to inform him better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53027:4"/>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Priest gravely return'd his thanks to the <hi>Fidefendon</hi> for his offer'd Favor; but told him withal, That their Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, for the most part, of Ceremonies and Sacrificial Duties to the Gods, which long continu'd Usage had been traditionally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd, and of which they had no greater Proof than Writings and Records, the Wisdom and Discipline of their Country had thought fit to allow, it would not be thought convenient for him to venture their Persuasion so receiv'd, and which he could not otherwise demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, on the force of Argument. Adding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, That he was obliged by his Function and Interest cautiously to discuss, at least not to allow of any Motives or Arguments, if prejudicial to the Tenents he was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess.</p>
            <p>The Philosopher that was of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was inwardly asham'd, as he observ'd the Evasion made by the Priest, telling the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defendon,</hi> That if he would oblige them so far as to undertake to inform them better than they hitherto unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stood, on the Divine Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he assur'd that it should be gratefully receiv'd by him, notwithstanding the present aversion of his Countryman the <hi>Athenian</hi> Priest, which he hoped did not proceed from obdurancy of Mind, in case his Reasons were appositely prevalent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jussinedos</hi> likewise readily declar'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53027:4"/>
That after the <hi>Fidefendon</hi> had deliver'd what was fit to be understood in reference to the Religion of <hi>Astreada,</hi> that he would acquaint them with such Laws and Politiques of State as had been the long approv'd Support of their Monarchical Dominion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator, that had not yet spoke, acknowledg'd the Obligation great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no less desirous than the Philosopher, to hear the Maxims of that Island's Government explain'd, unto which other Countries were estrang'd both as to their Constitution and Practice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fidefendon,</hi> by the Prerogative of his Office being first to speak, in respect that the Concern of Religion ought to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Discussion, he began to deliver himself after this manner:</p>
            <p>He told them, That he was very inclinable to treat favourably their Persuasion, both as they were Strangers, and because the Civility of their Island, and Complaisance of their Morals, oblig'd them not to reflect with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness on the Persuasions of others that had been introduc'd by Custom, and as it were suck'd into their Understandings with the Milk of their Mothers: hoping that of themselves they would discern their Errors, if perspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously unvail'd to their Judgments, by which they would soon apprehend what sort of Men ought to be charg'd with such Enormities and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53027:5"/>
Absurdities in Belief, as were too frequent with Mankind.</p>
            <p>After which, the <hi>Fidefendon,</hi> with a steady Countenance, deliver'd himself in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
            <p>Know, said he, that the Worship we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and to the observance of which we devoutly erect the eyes of our Souls, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially consists on these following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as the World had a manifest Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation from Providence, so likewise was it founded on its Power, though not to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise search'd or explain'd: And consequently that all definitions of the Deity, that it was totally spiritual; or as some held who had celebrated Demy-gods, after the manner of others, who attributed half Divinity to some Instructers of Worship, as well as to their reputed Heroiques, were no less ridiculous, than absurd. It being impossible that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion should be so near ally'd to Mortality, or be oblig'd to a Founder of human Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And if the World was govern'd by a visible and constant Providence, there was no Reason to doubt that Religion was dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible from thence, and no less manifest and perpetually extant to Sense, as palpably as we behold the Sky and Stars above our Heads. Wherefore that this supreme Tenent ought to be allow'd and reverenc'd as the most clear
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53027:5"/>
foundation of Belief, concluding that it had been as generally conceded, had not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and Frauds of Men oppos'd so clear and known a Truth. Adding, That he desir'd to hear what could be oppos'd to this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before he proceeded to other Principles of their Worship.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Philosopher, judg'd that the Method propos'd was highly rational, and of divine and natural Simplicity: And turning to the <hi>Athenian</hi> Priest told him, That it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on him to justifie the reasonable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Worship he profess'd, if in the compass of his understanding, lest his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were held unrighteously apply'd to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Altars polluted by the cruel Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Creatures, whereby the Divine Power might be rather incens'd, than propitiously implor'd to the advantage of Humane Frailty.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Priest , was not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd that he should be thus woo'd to a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this Nature, which he was very prone to avoid: But judging that it was for the Credit and Interest of his Persuasion and Function, to act polemically in their Defence, he reply'd to this purpose:</p>
            <p>That he would not undertake to prove any other Evidence of the Belief he profess'd, than what redounded from Usage and allow'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as it had been written, or traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53027:6"/>
convey'd by such that were not manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liable to the Imputation of Fraud in what they deliver'd; who, as they were Founders of Worship, were likewise esteem'd inspir'd, if not oraculously instructed from above. That Men from Men, in respect of outward Rules and Certainty, had been propense to acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esce in sueh Notions, though not otherwise demonstrative. Neither did he deny that general Providence, as the <hi>Fidefendon</hi> alledg'd, was more apparent and visible than any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Tenent of Religion, however it came to pass that Maxims of Worship were so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely various in divers Nations, though within the compass of one entire World, and Divine Conduct. That it were to be wish'd that every Article of Faith had been as discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable as the Orb of Light, nay, written with a Sun-beam on every Object we behold: But this general Conviction being not to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, Men ought to follow such Doctrines as have gain'd most Credit on their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fidefendon</hi> told him, That he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for wishing that the Essentials of Divine Worship had greater Evidence than human Relations or Tenents prescrib'd by the Pen of Man, by reason that it was not apparent how far they ought to be credibly allow'd, or accompany'd with any sensible Demonstration that Invention or Deceit did
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53027:6"/>
not manage the Contrivance: For though a Book may with sufficient assurance deliver a Math<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>matical Certainty with a <hi>quod erat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrandum:</hi> It is much otherwise as to any Fundamental of Faith as it should respect Heaven, which teacheth the Soul visibly to apprehend the Illuminations without Book from above; to which undeniable Conviction all the Faculties of the Mind, and what can be attributed to every Sense that operates in Mankind, fully assent.</p>
            <p>Suppose, he added, that I should inspect such Writings of yours as are no less esteem'd by you than sacred Records, and should find there such Acts of your deified <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as you grant Miraculous: Were it therefore as clear, in the judgment of any indifferent Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that your Deity either did such Wonders, or delegated by Inspiration any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to convey them to others; when you neither produce or relie on any visible Fact, or universal Manifestation of his Omnipotent Power, together with the Reverence incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, from thence, on the Soul of Man. Our Intellects are sensibly assur'd, That we ought to pay Adoration on our Knees to what we see not, from what we ocularly behold in the admirable Frame and Structure of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, in whose Circumference should not the fixed Stars stand at one constant distance one from another, and the diurnal motion of the

            <p>In like manner it seems no less naturally repugnant to Reason, in such as do maintain that spiritual Worship is due from the human Soul; which as it has its Being, and actuates in the Body of Man, can have no proper <hi>Idea</hi> of any spiritual Existence. Let any one that would be thought to believe otherwise, prostrate himself as devoutly as he can, and he will find, in opposition to this Maxim, That his Contemplation will furnish him with something or other that resembles Body and Parts, and most likely such as are of human Similitude, suitable to the Deities that for the most part are worshipt, for which the Fictions of the Priesthood ought to be accountable. This Example, in stead of other Argument, I hold fully sufficient to convince Opposers, that the Notion of spiritual Worship is neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, or naturally allowable: In stead of which I will clearly propose, when I touch that Particular, such a sensible and proper Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, though annexed to no denomination of Deity, in any kind, as shall manifest the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we <hi>Astreadans</hi> profess, to be more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal than what can be urg'd to the contrary by any opposite Persuasion.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53027:8"/>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Senator, very gravely observ'd the preceding Discourse; and though he was inclin'd to esteem the Laws and Usage of his Country both on the Divine and Civil Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he readily acknowledg'd that neither of those were valuable, if not of sound and unbiass'd Construction; wherefore he was very desirous to attend the Period of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Debate.</p>
            <p>When the Philosopher, his Associate, who had been positively educated in the <hi>Athenian</hi> School, acknowledg'd by the World for the most exquisit Seminary of Letters, where he had gradually arriv'd to the height of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical Science, was somewhat earnester than the Senator, to understand if reverential Worship could be apparently deducible from the exterior and sensible Acts of Providence; assuring the Priest, his Companion, That un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he could make out his particular method of Adoration, the Altars and Sacrifices, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever beneficial they had been to Men of his Function, would sink in Repute, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Esteem they had formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. At which words the Priest being not a little concern'd, and rubbing of his Forehead hard, with not a little Priestly Confidence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in this manner:</p>
            <p>I well know, that Universal Providence, however it may seem disguis'd or perplex'd, by the various Opinions and Religions of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53027:8"/>
World, ought to have a Divine Attribute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c'd by Mankind; and that the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is no less apparent, than that there is Day and Night, Heat and Moisture, and other elementary qualities, by which the Universe do's subsist: That not a few, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Erudition, have affirm'd, That the whole Bulk and Fabrick of the Universe is animated, preserv'd, and govern'd by one Soul or Providence; on which Account they acknowledge, that there is an actual Supreme Conduct as clearly manifest, as we know by Sense that Earth, Water, or Air, have their proper Qualities and Beings. But this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Soul of the World being impossible to be view'd or resembled by Shape or Figure, no more than the Soul or Life, that actuates the Body of Man, is to be seen or describ'd, they allow it a supreme and essential Conduct on which the conservation of all above and below depe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds. For which Reason they hold it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to give a definitive Name to any thing that is not perceptible to Sense, how excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent soever they grant its Being and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>And though I am of the Priesthood, my Ingenuity do's oblige to grant, that it is not easie to give a Denomination to an invisible Power, or a supreme Cause, whose Essence is absconded, and can no otherwise be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, than by the Effects it produceth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53027:9"/>On which ground they argue. That an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Name or Notion of Divine Power, as it may be signified by the Word Providence, is less temerarious, and of more practicable Intelligence, than Definitions of Men that pretend to explain a deified Essence.</p>
            <p>And thus, continu'd the Priest, we are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely censur'd, and pretendedly recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for proposing to the World such Tenents as undertake to furnish the Understanding with a more superlative Intimacy with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, than by any Fact or Conduct of Heaven, is manifestly explain'd. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise reflect on our usual Worship, as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of superstitious Frauds and Devices, notwithstanding it be clear both to us and them, that unless it be granted that Devotion be explain'd, after our manner of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reference to Divinity, Religion can have no Certainty, or practical Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fidefendon</hi> reply'd, that the <hi>Athenian</hi> Priest, had conceded enough in that he grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Omnipotent or Supreme Being might have an implicite Demonstration, though not the essence known by the word, as in the example you mention'd of the Soul in the Body of Man: the word Soul does not explain the Being of the human Soul, though by its conceiv'd Operation we give it a name, by which we rather would know than cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53027:9"/>
able from thence to express its nature. In like manner, We <hi>Astreadans,</hi> after the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional form of Worship profess'd by us, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the Denomination of Providence, an Omnipotency or Divine Conservator and Disposer of the total World, as it is either compos'd of whatsoever we behold, or of what we do neither discern or apprehend: And yet we do not definitively infer from any of these Expressions, the Essential Nature or Modality of Existence in reference to the Supreme Power which we devoutly celebrate: In your City of <hi>Athens,</hi> where Literature has been so anciently Famous, you deify an Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Being; but instead of defining his Essence, you dedicate your Worship to the unknown God, as the publick Inscriptions on your Temples and Altars declare. By which it is evident, That you renounce all Tenents that pretend to Definitions of the Nature of the Deity you adore, by which the Prudence of your Republick judiciously avoided the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable Absurdities that otherwise would have been propagated amongst you.</p>
            <p>And had your Citizens been allow'd the freedom of Discussing, or suffer'd any Tenents that had undertook to explain the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, your City had been infectd with more contagious Errors relating to Belief, than you do at this day profess. For if you had allow'd any Corporeal Figure or Being, to what you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53027:10"/>
Divinely celebrate; you must have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it in the likeness of Humanity, or other Animal. On the contrary, if you had given it a spiritual Attribute, you had then determin'd more Exorbitantly, and less In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible. Because the understanding can have no comprehension of any spiritual Existency that is in no kind the Object of Sense. Nor can any, however confident they seem to be, with the least shadow of Reason affirm, That a bodily Eye can discern that which hath no Body; which were a Contradiction to the undoubted Principle of Opticks, and no less wide from the Understanding, or impossible to fall within the compass of its knowledge; according to that clear Philosophical Maxim, <hi>That nothing is in the Intellect of Man, but was first the Senses</hi>; whereas it is evident from what is here alledg'd, That a spiritual Being cannot be in any kind the Object of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding or Senses.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Whatsoever is not to be seen or felt, is impossible to be apprehended or notional to human Conception. And I think no Man will undertake to demonstrate, that a Spirit is either to be touch'd or seen. And these Reasons I conceive enough to invalidate all spiritual Definitions and Notions, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever asserted.</p>
            <p>And yet I grant, said the <hi>Fidefendon,</hi> That from the sublime Effects and Proprieties of a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53027:10"/>
Cause sensibly apparent, I may concede that it is supreme and ineffable; by Reason of the actual dignity of its Operation, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be far impossible for me to apprehend the manner of its Existence or Being; as is manifest from the Example of Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd; the excellency of whose actual and continual Benignity in the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Order and Conservation of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and all things it contains, is apparent to our Understandings, by the undeniable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of all our Senses; as Seeing, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Tasting, Smelling, Touching; these as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us of a Providential Being. How remote soever, or absconded the Modality of its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, is from our Apprehensions: Like to some admirable Structure, from whose Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure, Furniture, Parts, and Proportions, I admire the perfect Abilities of the Architect and Founder, though unknown to me the superlative Skill and Materials that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the Fabrick. And I cannot but reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, That there is nothing more fallible or absurd, than positively to affirm, That in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of a Supreme Cause, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily grant a spiritual Existence; it being very possible, that such an Efficient, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever superlative allow'd in its Essence, may be no Spirit, as some undertake to define, nor of bodily substance in any corporeal Sense or Attribute that can be apprehended by us.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53027:11"/>
And in Speculation we may acknowledge, that an extraordinary Cause may be notional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understood to be of a refin'd Nature, yet not therefore term'd Spiritual, no more than the Notion of a distinct fifth Essence, which Philosophers attribute to the Aetherial Bodies of the Sun and Stars, does imply a spiritual Being, or contrarily any Similitude of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence, if likened to Elementary Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</p>
            <p>If the World did explain by any Work, or Thing, the Cause of its own Original, or any Creature that subsists in it, we could not be destitute of knowing, nay, seeing of it as perfectly as we do our selves: Though we must not conclude from thence, that the total Compass of the World doth not diffuse the Cause of its Being; And it were a very groundless and improper Notion, to imagine that any such Original Cause should have an Existence beyond the vast Extent of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; which were no less absurd, than to imagine that something may subsist where there is nothing: For I take it as granted by all of us, that the capacity of the World above and below, must be large enough to include its supreme Cause; We ought therefore to conclude, that the Reason why it cannot be discern'd, is because it is absconded by its effectual conduct and manner of Operation, in order to the conservation of the Universe.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53027:11"/>
For if it animate all things, or be diffus'd, as a Soul, of which every individual Being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates, as was precedently mention'd, it cannot be perceptible in whole, or in part, no more than the human Soul is to be discern'd, in its Figure or Proportion that gives Life and Motion to the Body. All which does sufficiently manifest, that a Supreme Cause may be visibly existent in the Effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth; yet so, as not to be otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd or apprehended.</p>
            <p>On which grounds we of this Island of <hi>Astreada</hi> adore Providence, without giving to it the name of Deity, or obliging our selves to give a denomination to a Being or Essence that we cannot intelligibly express, and so be necessitated to devise an equivalent Term or Notion of Divinity at a Venture. Whereas we conceive that we are pertinently devout, if sensible of its Effects, however obscure its Being, if we pay our Adoration in that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod for the Benefits we receive: And that as an undiscernible Foreseer, Provider, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poser of all things, for the Glory of it self, and humane preservation and subsistence, we celebrate Providence; not with less reverence than such as would be thought strictly to worship and implore what they think fit to deifie.</p>

            <p>The Philosopher observing that his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman Priest was somewhat troubled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or ruminating of what Argument wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fittest to be insinuated in defence of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion, spoke to the <hi>Fidefendon</hi> in these words.</p>
            <p>I am apt to grant both as a Philosopher, and as far as Reason ought to convince me, that there is an implicit Reverence, as you have judiciously maintain'd, due to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible

operations of Providence; all which I do as clearly perceive, as that the Sun has warmness in his Beams, and that Day and Night have a reciprocal management, as they beneficially vary and commode the several Climates of the Universe: or that Mankind, and every Animal and Vegetive is nourish'd and supported by operations of a Cause pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominately absconded.</p>
            <p>To which, I likewise condescend, That you aptly give the denomination of Providence, without undertaking to define its Essence; as he that sees Light, feels the effects of the Suns heat, is capable of understanding what he intends by either of the words, but not therefore apprehensive of the composition or essential nature of the substance from whence they proceed.</p>
            <p>Neither can I dissent from you, as you ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate under the Notion of Providence the Devotion you apply; in respect that what I am rationally oblig'd to admire as an ineffable Supporter and Disposer of all things, I may undoubtedly worship in a general Sense with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other definition: to explain which, the Reasons you have precedently alledg'd are so many and perspicuous, as they need no Illustration: So that as a rational Man and a Philosopher, I readily concede, that the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief you <hi>Astreadans</hi> profess, is both Natural

and Philosophical; neither can any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Proposal, however reputed divine or inspir'd, deter me from allowing my highest Admiration and Reverence to the methods of that Persuasion that is evidently familiar to my Soul and Senses, in the same manner as you deduce your Creed from the conduct of Providence; and why the Devotion of the World should not be universally united in that primitive one entire and obvious mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in humane shape, and sometimes Men that ought to be half-way deified, as Heroes of old were fictitiously celebrated; that is to say, worship as God and Man united.</p>
            <p>All which, not to particularize the Ends and Interest of Impostors, have been suitably convey'd in order to captivate the Intellects of vulgar persons, as the greatest part of Mankind, and therefore more usefully impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on, who being taught to pin their Faith on the Relations of such as had greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Piety and Learning, though in truth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And since the Tenents of us <hi>Grecians</hi> are deriv'd, as we alledge them from spiritual Inspiration, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53027:15"/>
have both defin'd the Deity, and the manner of Worship celebrated by us, undoubtedly, as we conceive, deliver'd by our known Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and long Usage; we canone lessen its sublime Authority by departing from what we receiv'd, because we cannot prove, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than as it is testified by writing, that it was heretofore inspir'd: And should we grant the contrary, we must deny the spiritual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination we pretend to, though I grant it is not intelligible in what manner a spiritual Act or Thought can have to do with our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and consequently invalidate every Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Priesthood, and the Reverence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to them in numerous and glorious Nations. How many of our Robe have been allow'd of sanctified Repute, nay such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s have prophetically foretold Kings and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates what should succeed, and how far their Affairs are favoured by Heaven. If our Presages have sometimes err'd, none can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that we have not been now and then in the right.</p>
            <p>True it is, that Men of plain apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions have occasionally tax'd our Doctrines for shifting of Sides and Parties, or seeming inspir'd in behalf of the most: prevalent Faction or Dominion: But we thank Heaven we are not abash'd, or put out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance by such low Recriminations, whil'st by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53027:16"/>
the strength of spiritual Reputation we pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per under such variety of Times and Change of Rulers, that amaze the Brain of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Persons, as they too frequently judge that they are taught, by us, to suffer most, and apprehend least.</p>
            <p>That there is an excellency that ought to be dispens'd to some Orders and Callings of Men, merely from what they represent, is evident to all that apprehend the Nature and Time of Ecclesiastical and Temporal Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. Do's it not appear from thence, that such as were esteem'd the most profound and excellent Institutors of Governments, have been reputed Divinely taught and gifted; not that there was really any such Attributes due to them, but as they were admir'd and reverenc'd for the superlative Prudence that was allow'd to their Laws and publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions: And I doubt not, said the Priest, looking earnestly on the rest, that our sacred Office may claim as sublime Reputation, if not more, considering the dignity of our Function.</p>
            <p>To conclude, We do not undertake to prove, with the same evidence of Sense as you do the operations of Providence, that by whomsoever. our Precepts were originally
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53027:16"/>
convey'd, on which were first founded our Priestly Qualifications and Capaci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ies, that he was either inspir'd or convers'd with a Deity: But rather affirm, that he ought, in one kind or other, to be so reputed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the credit and value allow'd to the Principles of Worship convey'd by him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner the titular Grandeur of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roical and excellent Persons, receiv'd divine Names and Epithites; not that they in nature were so near of Kin to Heaven as to be half way deified, as of old some were entitled, but from the admiration paid to their actions and endowments that highly tended to the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>And since the World will not be easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded, that there ought to be such a sensible Worship as you propose, which I confess was to be wish'd: Particular Nations will stand upon the Credit of their Priests, and what they receive from their Instructions; nay hold themselves oblig'd to support and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, as much as in them lies, the esteem of one sort of Priesthood above another.</p>
            <p>Moreover, when we assert a Proposition in Religion that is not demonstrative, as by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in what manner the Deity is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented or personated, or how operative on

Men by way of Inspiration: It ought to be receiv'd as our way of speaking, whereby we teach Men more superlatively to reverence the Doctrines we deliver; which could not be receiv'd with plausible respect and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if not suppos'd to have proceeded from a Divine Founder.

            <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator, observing that the Priest his Associate was more perplex'd and obscure in vindicating of his Tenents than he expected from his Undertaking, gravely told him, that he thought it would be no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to his Creed to debate it farther: And turning to the <hi>Fidefendon,</hi> gave him thanks for the Explanation he had given them of his <hi>Astreadan</hi> Persuasion; adding withal, That it would be no less grateful to him and the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher his Countryman, if he pleas'd to deliver what wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Providence has given us a sensible assurance, as has been already prov'd, of its Operations in the Universe we inhabit, we have no such Conviction of any other.

               </gap> and t'other mundane Place and Situation. For if the Order and Operations of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power be perciptible only in such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are familiarly apparent to our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings and Senses, as has been already
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53027:18"/>
the Being of another World must be totally different from this, as also the nature and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Omnipotent Cause by which it is actuated and preserv'd, in no kind of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Rule and Disposition of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse we inhabit; or that there is a spiritual World and Being ordain'd for the Reception of the humane Soul, as they conceive it an immortal Spirit.</p>
            <p>Neither can any sufficiently alledge Divine Inspiration, as has been observ'd by me, to corroborate a Doctrine so opposite to humane discernment, because no one Man can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to another by what means he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd, or how he was illuminated by a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Conversion: It being widely impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to Reason, that he who sensibly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands not the existency of a Spirit, should apprehend the possibility of a spiritual Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue betwixt God and Man. The most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Recorders of the delusory and various Beliefs of the World were either Poets, or Priests, or both; none of your <hi>Grecians</hi> can deny, as is manifest from the esteem you give to their Traditions and Writings. Yet the most anciently celebrated of these, as were <hi>Orpheus, Hesiod,</hi> and the like, taught Men to believe, that Gods did beget one another as their Deities of both Sexes were suppos'd to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53027:19"/>
engender: A Notion as absurd as monstrous; because it implies that one Infinite thing can beget another Infinite, or one spiritual Being procreate its like in Essence; which Doctrine, however extravagant, must be conceded by all that attribute the denomination and nature of Spirit to the Deity, and grant that it may communicate its substance in any respect. And I very much fear that in the Worship, by which many would be thought most devoted to an Omnipotent Power, that they render i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> impossible to be reverenc'd in the method they propose; unless they can prove, as instanc'd before, how an undeterminate or infinite Being can be a sensible Object, and comprehensively ador'd by the limited quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of humane Understanding.</p>
            <p>Others have so lower'd the Divinities they celebrate, as by their Commixtures with Mankind they either give 'em the Title o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for pardon from their Deities, whom they judg'd no less than Men notoriously sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>These Particulars, I thought previously ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to inculcate here, because they have affinity to the various Extravagancies that some Persons by their Doctrines undertake to defend in reference to the Immortalising of the Soul after this Life.</p>
            <p>The first is, That the humane Soul consists of a Spiritual Essence, and that it is by the excellency of its substance likewise Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal: But how can these Dogmatizers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, according to this Notion of theirs, not vent an Absurdity of the highest Nature: For if the Soul of Man be essentially a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that they hold, as they would be thought to do, the God they adore a Spirit also: Do they not, in effect, d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ifie the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating part of Mankind after death, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible to distinguish, by any rational Discussion, how much one Spirit is essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purer than another. On which ground it follows, that wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t is spiritually Immortal, may be allow'd to be Infinite. So little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction is there, by this Doctrine, betwixt the Soul of Man, and the Deity they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and yet 'tis well known to all of us,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:53027:20"/>
how numerous a part of the World as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert this Tenent as the first Maxim of their Creed.</p>
            <p>Others affirm, That the purest Substance or ghostly Form of Life, when separated by Death, is represented by a shadow of the Body, which some pretend to have beheld in that Figure, as ocular Witnesses that the Soul of Man do's in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hority is I need not debate, who, in being Poe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> must be granted Divulgers of fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Contrivances. And what can be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Solecism to Reason, than a Position so vainly extravagant; nay, how is it possible to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nceive, that a Shadow do's not imply the presence of the Body, if it appears as its Shadow, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d consequently that the Soul has no such separative existence after bodily death.</p>
            <p>Besides all which, the Absurdities are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable that redound from this Tenent; for if every Body of Mankind were by its Soul to be shadow'd or liken'd, it must follow, that every Man and Womans Soul are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurable,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53027:20"/>
and therefore differenc'd in breadth and length; and lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>wise in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as one Shadow may be proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably finer than another, or have more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to the Body it: appertain'd to.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding I confess, that whosoever was the first Author of this dark conceit, that the Soul did survive as an umbrage of the Body after life, comes nearer the confines of Sense than the precedent Opinion; in respect that as the animating Faculty of Mankind do's furnish in due proportion every Member that it actuates and informs, whilst it resides within the Body, so it should remain after Corporeal Life in some kind of similitude to its operation, within the composition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, when the Life of the Body was determin'd by Death.</p>
            <p>The third Tenent of the Soul's Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty appears more terrene, and therefore not less familiar to the apprehension, and this depends upon believing that the Soul of all things is essentially the same, and differenc'd only in its being in variety of Bodies; as Men, Beasts, Plants, and whatsoever has life and motion.</p>
            <p>This Opinion has had no less Vogue in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:53027:21"/>
World, than long acceptation with persons held of profound disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rnment in the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <hi>Series</hi> of Nature: to which purpose they infer, that the continuation of the Universe, or at least of all corporal Beings within the compass of the sublunary World, depends upon a perpetual course of Generation and Corruption, from one individual Being to another, and consequently that whatsoever dies by corruption, do's tend to the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some other corporeal Being. And this Position is so far apparently certain, insomuch as Life, in one kind or other, is incident to Matter, as it convertibly depends on whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is generated, and consequently alter'd into a corporeal Being differently animated to what it was before.</p>
            <p>On which Philosophical Evidence, added the <hi>Fidefendon,</hi> do's consist the ancient opinion of not a few learnedly Famous, who maintain'd the Transmigration of Souls, when separated from their precedent Mansions by death, and that they pass'd into other Bodies. The Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, however naturally passable, do's, in a high degree, lessen the dignity of the humane Soul, by reason that in such a method of progression from Body to Body, it must at one time or other animate an ignobler Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than Man, which gives cause of Reproof to the Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53027:21"/>Another Doctrine there is, and much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on by some, which I shall but touch, because it seems more extravagant or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to the ordinary progress and course of Nature, than any I have precedently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; and this undertakes to assert, That the humane Soul is immortally generated: which, in plain words, is to affirm, That one immortal Thing begets another; or, that the Soul of the Father do's animate an Eternity, in begetting the Soul of the Son: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit is so fictitiously absurd, as it is repugnant to the total method of the causes and effects of Generation.</p>
            <p>However, to repel these Contradictions, the Abettors of this Doctrine assure us, by an unintelligible method, That the Soul is divinely infus'd from above, and spiritually commix'd with the Act of Generation: But how a Spirit, as has been argu'd before, can mix with a corporeal Substance, is a Riddle fit to be left to such Authors to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p>The last Opinion that remains to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to a free judiciary Determination, is, That Soul and Body of every Individual of Mankind, is restor'd to an immortal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Union after Death. Which Doctrine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53027:22"/>
has gain'd a very plausable Reception with many: Nor can it be thought ungrateful to the beautiful of both Sexes, if the excellency of their Features and Proportions accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to a future Life; which wonderful Receptacle of the Persons of Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men after Death, not a few of you <hi>Grecians,</hi> said the <hi>Fidefendon,</hi> call the <hi>Elysium,</hi> or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, in which Mankind shall have Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by a miraculous Restauration after Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving here, and where they shall be more or less happy or unhappy; how long, they have not certainly determin'd, after made Survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors in their future Abodes.</p>
            <p>But should it be ask'd of any of these wonderful Tutors, what possible Assurance they have, that the Persons of Mankind shall be remov'd, after the manner they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, from the visible corporeal World to another, whose place they are not able to demonstrate, otherwise than by an implicit Belief, that goes farther with them than real Proof.</p>
            <p>I cannot apprehend what Answer they'd return, unless they would ingeniously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that they do not know, nor can I guess on what they ground their Notion of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Persons of all after death, from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53027:22"/>
one World to another pretended; unless it be, that they believe the compass of this World is not spacious enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the vast numbers of both Sexes, that is to say, all that have and shall enter the Confines of Mortality by Death: And I grant that it may be some Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Terrestrial Globe be sufficiently large to give entertainment to all of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Composition after living here; or if room enough for them to move or stand foot by foot together. But whether mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, sitting, standing or lying, be the general suppos'd posture of such as by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Life shall reside in the <hi>Elisium</hi> Abodes, is not derermin'd by your <hi>Grecian</hi> Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists. But as for the personal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if they grant that bodily Organs are restor'd to both Sexes, as they survive again, I do not see how they can deny our corporeal Sense and Appetites in the <hi>Elisium</hi> they ordain.

what Political Rules or Measures the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that Island hath been so long happy in not perplexing its Natives by the admission of novel Forms of Religion, so pernitiously frequent and destructive in many other Dominions to their publick Tranquility.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jussinedo,</hi> who had diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd the precedent Discourses, conceiv'd that the Philosopher had given him a fit occasion to speak something, in order to the Political satisfaction he expected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; and which, as a Magistrate of that Region, he thought convenient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare.</p>
               <p>Wherefore with a Gravity becoming the Quality of his Office, he told them, That their Religion did effectually disown all subordinate dependency on Ordinations and Precepts of State. And had it not been so capacitated, it would have been subject to alterations and change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, according to the practice of other Nations, who make Faith the top of their Dominions, when its own validity is not able to support its esteem without the aid of Civil Institutions: which, how variously they are and have been propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53027:26"/>
in divers Countries is notorious, and likewise the alteration and change of Rule emerging from thence; so that if the verity and Simplicity of Worship be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of it self to withstand temporal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes, it consequently must be oblig'd to political Establishment, however by that means lessen'd in Repute, for its continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and support</p>
               <p>Neither do we at all insinuate our Creed, on the account of Custom and Education, the usual and grand deceptions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whose Allurements are the Nurseries in which the Children of Religion are edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, in order to believe as weakly when they arrive to the years of Men.</p>

In summ, concluded the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> our Religion is not supported by our acts of State, but rather our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beholding to our Creed: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an entire and sensible conviction, does not admit of any perplexity or fragments of faction to divide it from our understandings, as has been precedently instanced; nor does it lye in the power of prevaricated Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to outface our belief, by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant insinuation of their opposite do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jussinedos</hi> having thus ended, and thanks respectfully given him by all that were present, the <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator desir'd him, that as they had been fully acquainted with their Religion, and its reference to the essential Constitutions of his Nation; so he would do them the favour to inform them, with what brevity he thought fit, of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity and nature of their political establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he assur'd himself would not appear less prudently determin'd, than the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he had receiv'd of their holy Creed,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53027:28"/>
and the advantage that redounded from it to Civil dominion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jussinedos</hi> reply'd, That he being an <hi>Astreadan</hi> Magistrate, his qualification did import that he was conveniently knowing in that Islands government: Which he told them was perfectly Monarchical, with all the requisites incident to Soveraignty; that it had continu'd uninterrupted in the due course of lineal succession beyond their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Ages; yet so establish'd, as by the excellency of Rule, there was no deviation in King and People from the Original Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity annex'd to the most primitive constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their nation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator assur'd the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> that he was not a little surpriz'd in hearing what had been formerly deliver'd on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Astreadan</hi> belief, however per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous the fond and principles of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship were obvious to the most ordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, considering how busie and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriously prevalent the inveiglements of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious perswasions had been dispers'd in the world.</p>
               <p>But it was more his admiration to hear him declare that the Scepter he obey'd, and order of government had so anciently enjoy'd the felicity of an entire and uncorrupted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; when many Nations, precedently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, were so unhappy as not only to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53027:28"/>
the change and subversion of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, but oblig'd to lament its ruine, as wicked accessories, by the depravation of their manners, to the Calamities of their native Country.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Philosopher, having given full attention to what the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> had last deliver'd, acknowledg'd that he was no less desirous than the Senator, to understand in what manner the Monarchical government was founded on Vertue, but likewise by the goodness of its Constitution and Moralities, had so long continu'd the original excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and prosperities arising from thence: and because in the Schools of <hi>Athens</hi> some poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquely learned had thought fit to allow se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral denominations to Soveraign Rule, whereby they defin'd Monarchical Regiment either absolute, or limited by Laws, or mix'd by participating of nobility, or people, or a mixture of both: He was earnest with the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> to declare how far the <hi>Astreadan</hi> gubernation did concenter with any of these, or whether totally different.</p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> readily comply'd, in these words: There is nothing, said he more generally difficult to humane nature, than due perception and complaisance relating to Civil Superiority; and this infelicity chiefly proceeds from not rightly apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the original fond of Dominion, and such
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53027:29"/>
measures of Government as ought to oblige their Submission. And it is wonderful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that man by the prerogative of reason should impose Subjection on all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and yet with the best of his Capacity not sufficiently compleated to give Law to himself, in reference to subordinate duty; which enormous and pernicious mistake ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from no other sourse of evil, than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural depravity of man, in being too pronely averse and contumacious of the benefits of orderly Tranquility. This irregular defect and Inclination of the humane mind, too often byass'd and enhans'd by worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Interest; can have no proper Remedy, unless by a rational cure whereby we may discern the useful Integrity, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Obedience, that ought to be paid to Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Dominion.</p>
               <p>In doing of which, if men would resolve to imploy sincerely their Understandings; the Perplexities and Disputes that seem to pose too many, in their discussions of the Rights and Measures of human Government, will soon vanish, together with the abusive Gloss that the depraved and subtle Industry of some has endeavoured to conceal, by the utmost abilities of their Pens and Science. As to our Government, said the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> as I before express'd, it has been with us perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally monarchical; To which kind of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And therefore one of your great Philosophers observes, that a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy or Kingdom will be a paternal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and naturally it can be no other. And wheresoever there is an unjust or forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Intruder into a Throne, he may by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53027:30"/>
possess the room of a paternal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, but cannot be deem'd a rightful father of people.</p>
               <p>When the World encreas'd, and families were numerous enough to give denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Cities, and Nations were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd; 'tis probable that the paternal Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of Kings did (in divers Countries, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the multiplicity and trouble of Rule) cease, by their voluntary determination, whereby they Adopted others to succeed them in the supream Magistracy. Because no man could have any title to primitive go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but either as it was his by pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Right, or as he receiv'd it from him that had power to confer it on whom he thought fit, as his proper Donation.</p>
               <p>And this, pertinently consider'd, explodes all pretence of <hi>original Contract</hi> betwixt the Monarch and People: or comparatively as Immoral as if the Parent should covenant with his Children for his good behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: Which undutiful and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Allegation has not seldom created such a restless Brain-worm in the noddles of the multitude, that, swell'd with this popular conceit, they have precipitated themselves into such intolerable and destructive absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, as have caus'd unspeakable Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their native Country.</p>

               <p>But in part, to salve this main objection it will be said, that Children may be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Votes of their Parents: This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy may cure some little of the mischie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> but it destroys the whole Cause: And at last stumbles upon the true original of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For if it may be allow'd that the acts of the Parents bind the Children, then fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel the doctrine of the natural freedom of mankind; and where Subjection to Parents is indispensable, there can be no natural Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. If any reply, that not all Children
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53027:33"/>
shall be bound by their Parents consent, but only such as are under age; it must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that in nature, there is no non age: If a man be not born free, she doth not assign him, any other time, when he shall attain his Freedom; or if she did, then Children com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating that age should be discharg'd of their contract. So that in conclusion, if it be imagin'd that the people were ever free from Subjection, by nature; it will prove a mere impossibility to introduce any kind of Government, without apparent wrong to a multitude of People.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, said the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> it is evident from what I have express'd, that by primitive fatherly Superiority no Inhabitants of the Earth were ever destitute of a rightful Monarch; and if at any time, by reason of worldly Alterations, and Revolutions of State the proper Soveraign is unknown; yet this, is no fault in Nature, but the Negligence, or Ignorance of those by whom the right Heir ought to be discern'd: And if we look gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually backward, as far as we can imagine the beginning of humane Race, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was from paternal Prerogative, and not by Contract, Mixture, or popular Condescension, that Monarchy was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally obey'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator, return'd the <hi>Jussine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi> his thanks, for the satisfaction he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53027:34"/>
from the prudence of his Discourses, in every particular; and assur'd him withal, that his Decision of the Rise of humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which according to the Grandeur of his reasoning, must exert it self from Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Fatherhood, and enlarg'd as Families en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd; and the world, by degrees was reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with People. And I judge, that it is almost impossible to observe the innumerable Errors, and Contradictions, that redound from the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>And if, as you judiciously reason'd, there be no distinction of persons, in a suppos'd primitive Freedom of Mankind; who can deny, in such a condition of natural equality, that Children and Servants might not pretend to stand on the same level Candidates with their Fathers and Masters by their joynt Votes, they having been, wheresoever men were, far more in number than Parents and Masters; they might, as the major part, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the Election of their Superiors, in order to the Choice of their Monarch.</p>
               <p>Pardon me, said the Senator, if I presume to add, to what you have deliver'd: not that I conceive any thing you have spoken wants Illustration, but as I thought fit to confirm you, by the example I mention'd, that I have receiv'd no small Satisfaction, from your Judgment; notwithstanding I have that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, as being a <hi>Grecian,</hi> for my native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53027:34"/>
and the wisdom it claims, that I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous that the opinion of some grand Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans there may be examin'd, and why by their maxims of State they undertake to assure us, that there is naturally such a political Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as mixture in the monarchial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was first introduced.</p>
               <p>The argument they produce seems to have a specious regard to Equity, and the publique Security; for how can it be thought, say they, that reasonable men would be subject to the Preheminence and Rule of one sole person, unless he were conditionally oblig'd to govern accordingly, or which is all one, bound by publique contract to observe such Laws as the People, the prime Legislators, judg'd necessary to annex to their choice of a Soveraign; and turning to the Philosopher, his Countryman, told him that he being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in their learned Schools, and more accurately knowing in the philosophical and political disputes than he could pretend to, he desir'd, that he would briefly acquaint the worthy <hi>Astreadan</hi> that spoke last, with such tenents of State, as the science and practice of his Country had most reputed; that it might be discernable whither the Politiques of the <hi>Asiatiques</hi> or <hi>Grecians</hi> were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher replyd, that by the best search and strength of his understanding, he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53027:35"/>
perceiv'd from the Writings and Discussion of the most erudite of his Sect, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> dilucidly prov'd, was derived from paternal Superiority, as ancient as the first being of mankind; and that it could not procede from any original Stipulation or Covenant betwixt the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and People: And if otherwise debated or insisted on by the popular notions of some, the fond that they pretend of Monarchical Government, must needs be very instable and perpetually uneasy to King and People; for what is more pronely conceiv'd and dispers'd from the seducing Industry of those who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to interest themselves in vulgar esteem, than to allure common Understandings, by teaching them to believe that their assent was primitively essential, to the erecting of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; which plausibly effected, on the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born conceptions, pride, and resolution of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary persons, they are with no less facility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigu'd, and taught to conclude, that they were makers of Kings by original contract, and so far, at least, a share in the foundation of Monarchy. Which maxime, however delusively or seditiously convey'd, has seldom fail'd by instigating vulgar apprehensions to contest and quarrel with their supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate as they have occasionally thought fit, and likewise too often incited them to lift up their armed hands not only to oppose,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53027:35"/>
but to dethrone their Soveraign, as the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable and barbarous effects of violence and blood, when caus'd by popular preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, deplorably testifie to the ruine of common tranquility.</p>
               <p>In some exigents of state, the soveraign power may reside in the most considerable part of a nation; as put the case the King dies without an Heir, the conferring of royal Dignity shall not appertain or escheat to the whole people, but to the supream Heads, and Fathers of Families; not as they are the people, but as they are Fathers of the people, over whom they have a superintendent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er devolv'd unto them after the death of their Monarchical Ancestor; and if any can have a right to chuse a King, it must be in these paternal Superiors, by conferring their distinct fatherly prerogatives on one sole person.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, said the Philosopher, that Monarchs are not now as they were at the first planting or peopling of the World, if consider'd in the direct sense of fathers of their Subjects and Kingdoms: But howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes so to pass, by worldly revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the primitive and natural claim is not extinguish'd thereby; because no argument that can be brought from matter of fact is sufficient to defeat the concern of Right.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53027:36"/>True it is, that in some parts of our <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> precincts, there have been soveraign domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, which by the promoters and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of such governments have been term'd limited, or mix'd in point of Rule by an equality of Legislative Power in the King and People, but how more than one Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount Establisher of legal Constitutions can consist with the nature of Monarchy is not to be understood.</p>
               <p>And wheresoever there are divers supream State-holders, there can be no Soveraignty by reason that Monarchical Regiment is essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially Indivisible, and therefore not capable of partition or mixture.</p>
               <p>If in a Royal Government there be allow'd a joint concurrence of King and People in the Constitutions of Laws, 'tis reasonable to conclude that it proceeded from the Grace of the Monarch, for no such right could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the People neither by Nature, as has been explain'd, or original Contract with the Soveraign, however the liquorish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence may gratify some vulgar Pallates, who too pronely relish the glib Insinuations of factious Contrivers.</p>
               <p>And whosoever will imagine that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Power can be so intrigu'd or mix'd, must upon maturer consideration, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that he totally subverts the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quality of Soveraign Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53027:36"/>And thus I prove it: Let us suppose that in such a pretended Monarchical estate there should arise a difference betwixt the King and People; as who can doubt but in that mingle of rule it would too frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, who shall be the Judge of that misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding betwixt them, or by what means it ought to be Compos'd. If the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be affirm'd to belong to the People, the Soveraign Authority is then destroy'd, and consequently the being of Monarchy. If they grant, as I conceive they ought, That the Judiciary Power is solely in the Royal Person, they bid adieu, in those words to their so much celebrated notion of limited and mix'd Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>Neither is it avoidable, in such a Contest betwixt the Monarch and People, that recourse must be had, for want of other Judiciary Determination, to the unruly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Multitude; and whether such a method of disorder would not produce Anarchy and Confusion, I refer it to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of every unbyass'd Understanding.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> Senator, tho somewhat more nicely inquisitive than the rest, into policies of State, assur'd the Philosopher that he comply'd with his precedent discourse in affirming, as the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> had before Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously prov'd, That Monarchy in the most early time of humane being, had a rise and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53027:37"/>
institution from Paternal Right, in whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the first Father, and therefore King of his Family.</p>
               <p>Nor do the most ancient Records mention other Primitive Rule than perfect Royalty; so that no Popular form of State but must have a later date than Kingly Superiority.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding it is apparent that subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently other Governments have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, Entitled, Republicks or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and sometimes intermix'd with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, as the total Community have been representatively Interested in the enacting of legal Establishments.</p>
               <p>That this kind of Soveraignty has in some parts of the World, and by such as value themselves on the suppos'd Wisdom of their Politicks, been highly applauded, if not preferr'd in their opinion, before all other.</p>
               <p>Witness the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Monarchies in our native Country of <hi>Greece,</hi> by which Constitution the Royal Government is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and mix'd with Popular Authority; in that severe manner too, that the Votes of the People, as they are there assembled or represented by Persons delegated to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, do not only over-rule the Commands of their Monarch, but render him accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them, whensoever they please to question the actings of their King, as is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally known from the proceedings of the <hi>Ephori</hi> within that Dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53027:37"/>To which the Philosopher Answer'd, That the qualification and titular nature of the <hi>Spartan</hi> or <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King was easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd, if duely compar'd with the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Propriety of Monarchical Rule. And what <hi>Grecian</hi> does not know that the <hi>Spartan</hi> King had nothing to do with the execution of the Laws, or Civil Government, tho main Kingly Attributes, and was but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Captain General, for he had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsive Power but when actually in the Field, and therefore no other than Principal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Army of that State, tho bearing, for Honours sake, the Name of Soveraign?</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding which, there are a sort of perverse and litigious discussers of the concerns of Kings, that would pretend that the figure of this <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Royalty ought to be resembled by other Monarchical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments; or that the Soveraign should be guided and impos'd on at the arbitrement of the People, which were in effect to debase a King beneath the People, and render Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty no other than a Property at their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. To which purpose, some Popular Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants presume to maintain, That all Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was originally in the People, and that Crowns and Scepters, but as the Pageantries of Thrones, were bestow'd on Kings by common donation, and revocable on breach
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53027:38"/>
of such Conditions as they please to call the original of Laws and Regal Dominion. And if any Judicious search be made whereby to discover the fond of such Principles, they may be charg'd with as much notional obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the brain of Man must necessarily encounter, that would undertake to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the elemental Congress of the material parts of the Universe, when Chaos was first dissolv'd.</p>
               <p>And should we so far Indulge this wild and licentious Maxim, as to concede that the Monarch was oblig'd not to supersede, or in many cases, alter the known Laws; and that if he did, that it is radically in the People, under the notion of original Contract, to Compel or Depose their King. Is it not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely requisite, that those many cases should have been undoubtedly inserted at the time of this grand bargain, for the initiating of the Monarch and Subject? Now if it be not clearly so recorded, nay, manifestly legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in National Constitutions, it ought to be slighted as a most extravagant fiction; for what is more Absurd, than to imagine such an uncontroulable Power in the People, yet find no such Capacity, relating to them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd by any known Law, however Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the safety and well being of King and Subject, to be acquainted with their funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental obligations and punishments in case
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53027:38"/>
of violation; and it were highly unjust, should any opposition or penalty be inflicted on the supream Magistrate, and he less safe or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg'd than a common Person, to defend himself; if there be no Law extant that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, in what manner he ought to be call'd to account by the People.</p>
               <p>Others, who would be thought no less cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than deep in their political Sentimenrs, have imploy'd the best of their skill to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince mankind, that no Government can be more exactly ballanc'd, in reference to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Satisfaction and Benefit, however, skew'd appears the domination than a compleat mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Legislators by a temper of Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy; or which is the same, a compound of three Estates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd by King, Nobility, and Commons.</p>
               <p>Which kind of rule, if duly constituted, doth presuppose a suitable Goodness and Complaisance in order to the promoting of Grandeur, in every respect; on which ground I readily acknowledge, if the Principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the main body of a Nation, are of fix'd Integrity and Duty, as must be imply'd by the intended Virtue and Participation of Rule, committed to the trust of Persons thus signally concern'd, that there is undoubtedly an Excellency, as well as publick advantage and glory, in a Goverument so establish'd.</p>

               <p>To which purpose, our great Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> determines; where he affirms, That wheresoever is said to be a King according to Law, there is no sort of Government or Kingdom at all. His meaning, I conceive, is, That the Law cannot be suppos'd superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to the Monarch, but it must be likewise granted that the Legislators by whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence it is produced have also more supream Power than the Monarch within his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>And I undoubtedly believe, concluded the <hi>Greek</hi> Philosopher, that conditional Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, as some may imagine it relates to King and People, is morally inconsistent with monarchiual Regiment.</p>

And this kind of Phanaticism in politiques having dispers'd some of its seeds in <hi>Asia,</hi> about the time that the mighty <hi>Zerxes</hi> planted a Colony of <hi>Grecians</hi> in a neighbouring Country to this Island: Whither this perverse and wrangling Sect, in their measures of Submission to civil Dominion, had soon imported their motly Principles. But this endeavour of theirs did neither far or long propagate their Cavils; by reason that our Government had in prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent time, provided against such extravagant and disorderly opinions that might tend to molest or deprave the publick manners of our Natives; as you shall soon understand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53027:41"/>In the mean space I will impart, by your leaves, the sense that our wise predecessors had of the pernicious tenent of a heteregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or mix'd Soveraignty. Well knowing that a paradox in stare, if speciously diffus'd, no less than an intricate novelty in worship, meets not seldom with a facile reception from the multitude; by reason that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects are for the most part so capricious and uneasie in their esteem of the Rule they are under, as they judge that no dominion can have a substantial support, unless in the main bulk it has a gross relish of popular composition.</p>
               <p>Which surly conceit, when patroniz'd by such guides whom they are most inclin'd to follow, provokes them to conclude that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ought to be so intrigu'd and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, from whence the consequence has been unexpressibly inconvenient, and instead of promoting common interest and repose, it has been, in some Nations, the prevalent sourse of overflowing animosities.</p>
               <p>Insomuch that where the Soveraignty has been thought most exactly to participate of two other Estates, that is to say, of Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy and Democracy, it has encourag'd and produc'd as dangerous enormities as their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral oppositions could bring to pass. And 'tis an undoubted truth, that such States, wherein the Soveraignty is said to be divided,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53027:42"/>
are not rightly to be call'd Commonwealths, but corruption in the civil rule.</p>
               <p>In like manner, where the people are but taught to believe that they are in themselves or Representatives, in any kind sharers with the Monarchical state; such a people are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom without horrible divisions, seditious contrivements, which as the height of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and misery, too often produce the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious calamities and bloody violence of Intestine War. Neither was it ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, where the Soveraign power has been but reputed devisible betwixt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and People, that the disturbance and quarrels for Superiority in Rule, have not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prov'd of that pernicious Consequence, as they have turn'd the State into Confusion, until by change of Dominion either in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or more, a new model of Government be introduc'd by a total Subversion of the old.</p>
               <p>If the Monarch by national constitutions provides so favourably for his People as to have their advise and concurrence in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating of Laws, which in Prudence is the best choice that a wise King can make, both as to his information of publick concerns, and in what manner they ought to be provided for by the most effectual expedients; by reason <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

knowing of the State of the body politick, and how by their assistance their Monarch may be enabled with most Glory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to his Nation, to support the Grandeur of his Throne and People; doth it therefore follow, that any such may so far prevaricate from this Grace and Complaisance in their Monarch, as to conceive by their being elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and called for the service of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they may take leave to impose on their Prince, by pretending to have a share in his Government, or that of right they ought to be so admitted on the account of original Contract; or as they claim, by their conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed determination, however improbable or absurd, that the Sovereign power ought to be divided betwixt their Monarch and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Would not every indifferrnt man conclude, that such a bold Intrigue of State could tend to no other end but to instigate and ferment, with more applause, misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings betwixt the Monarch and People.

               <p>Nor has the dangerous encrease of those pernicious and unaccountable tenents, in past time, wanted the severest animadversions from our <hi>Astreadan</hi> Dominion; whereby there might condign impression remain in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity of those whose Progenitors had, in precedent Ages, tainted their Allegiance by being malevolently dispos'd in opposition to the purity of our establish'd Monarchy.</p>
               <p>And thus by the publick diligence of our State, care was seasonably taken that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Authors, Contrivers, and Abetters, of such perplex'd and froward Principles, should be notoriously disreputed and convey'd to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Memory, whereby their Names and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies might be distinguish'd from the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of sounder Judgments; to which end they stand mentioned in our Annals and Records with the Epithites of Mungrel, or pied Politicians.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53027:45"/>And I am apt to believe, that it is rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observable that any Supream Rulers, however naturally evil, have made it their choice to be rather impertinently exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, or brutishly wicked in governing of men, than to have executed their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion on a fond of obedient and sound Morality, if possible to be effected by any general desert of their Subjects: Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that if the Worlds most Universal Experience be duly examin'd, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center with the truth of this assertion, That no Monarch, or other Magistracy, ever acted so prejudicial to their Interest, as to elevate their Power above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary height, unless provok'd by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Corruption, and ungovernable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of their People.</p>
               <p>From whence it has too often come to pass, that Monarchy, tho by Paternal Right the most Ancient and Natural, as is manifest from our former discussions, has exerted it self, by some unusual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to a securer height, or by the Irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sedition and Violence of the multitude totally subverted; and instead of a Lineal descent of Rightful Kings, the Blood of Usurpers advanc'd to the Throne. Or if not so, where the vulgar have been more emphatically successful, they have never fail'd to convert their predominancy, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53027:45"/>
representation of themselves, into the figure of a Republick.</p>
               <p>And it cannot be denied, that out of the ruine of Hereditary Monarchy and the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if not Anarchy, that has risen from thence; the Popular States, within our Countries of <hi>Greece,</hi> have had their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
               <p>But you <hi>Astreadans,</hi> as I gather from what the Reverend <hi>Jussinedos</hi> has intimated, avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that your Monarchical Rule is practically manag'd by a Political Integrity, above the felicity of other Dominions, I presume to make it my request, that the method might be declar'd, that so much conduces to the stability and happiness of your King and Nation.</p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> readily answer'd, That the happiness and security of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment depended on a few particulars, which had been very anciently in usage with them, and he hop'd would continue unsha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in many Ages to come.</p>
               <p>The main Pillar that supports the reverend esteem of our Political Constitutions, is, That our Religion has had such an entire value and prevalency in our Nation, that no novelty of Worship has been able to stain the clearness of the verity on which it depends; and this has effectually, I doubt not, been explain'd by the Scheme of our belief, that our <hi>Fidefendon</hi> has before express'd: There being nothing more
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53027:46"/>
certain than that the soundest props of legal establishments, will be otherwise too weak to support the bulk of Government; insomuch, that wheresoever diversity of Beliefs have any tolerable reception, the Sacerdotal Function will be so Intrigu'd, and Interested thereby, and the Manners of Men so prevalently byass'd, that Corruptions, under the Notion and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Zeal, will debase the obedience that ought to be acknowledg'd to the Civil Dominion. And this can no way be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by obliging men to believe no more than by the conviction of sense they must grant true, and with that sincerity and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that every common understanding shall not want the assistance of a profession, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their Creed. And where the People are fully intelligent to that end, their Obedience and Manners will be assur'd, as long as humane Reason can be suppos'd predominant, against all sinister Innovations to the contrary. Thus, whosoever rests satisfied of the conviction of our worship of Providence, without annexing any devis'd Articles of Faith, stands most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely prepar'd to prefer and obey the goodness of the Rule to which he owes submission; on which evident foundation, both the worship of our Natives and obedience does chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. On the contrary, as you <hi>Grecians</hi> must confess, the alterations and subversions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments amongst you, have proceeded from
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53027:46"/>
no other cause than the various changes and deceits of worship, as is manifest from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms and adorations amongst you: so that if the publick profession of Faith be not in its own nature equally manifest to every rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable apprehension, it must create Dubitants in Belief, and consequently Despisers of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Authority, as men question the truth of what is propos'd or injoyn'd: But cannot do so if the maxims of their Creed are as sensibly intelligible as Seeing and Feeling is generally the capacity of mankind. And whosoever doth judge that he is rationally able to give the lye to the Religion of a Government, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to promote his opinion, tho it prove no less prejudicial than faction in the State, or a means to introduce a change of rule to confirm his Perswasion.</p>
               <p>From all which 'tis very demonstrable, that where the soul of the Subject doth most rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally Concenter with the authoris'd belief of a Nation, such a Government will be more permanently endear'd and obey'd than any other, whose sacred Edicts have not an assurance beyond Polemick Debate or Question.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator reply'd, that in their Country of <hi>Greece,</hi> nothing was more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult or less sucessful by the Endeavours of such as ruled, however claiming under any deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination the most perfection in civil Estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishments,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53027:47"/>
then to be considerable enough to suppress Nonsense, in belief and worship within their Dominions.</p>
               <p>It having been, with them, the constant success of foppish Deceivers to make a Fool of the Conscience of men, that they might, for their ends, more surely deprave their manners: So that I cannot but acknowledge, that the grand corruption of States, have generally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merg'd from the Silliness of their Creeds; by which their Devotion and civil Obedience is highly impair'd: And this mischief is usually so taking with the Multitude, that sincerity and clearness in either is most neglected by them. If Laws be ordained sufficiently useful, both as to divine and humane concern, they who are least dispos'd to like any, will always be requiring new or better; so that nothing is harder, than for Governments to season Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishments suitable to the distemper'd Pallats of such as ought to obey; and wheresoever that humour is predominan, 'tis a Symptom that the body politick is sick; and the multiplicity of Laws, the miserable pretence of its Cure: because evil men, and those ever the greatest part, are the Complainers, and as much as in them lyes, the Obstructors of Emendations in State, being resolved that no expedients, how numerous soever, shall be enough to provide against their Crimes and Faction: If under a Monarch, they have Pleas against
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53027:47"/>
his Ministers; if rul'd by Aristocracy, they are angry with the Nobility; if Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be supream, then they blame such as represent it: And I do not find, said the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian</hi> Magistrate, turning to the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, that any of your learned Schools have made any Decision, whereby to prevent the Growth of this dangerous Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
               <p>The Philosopher answered, that he did acknowledge, that no position of their Schools, or those which the divine <hi>Plato</hi> had most acutely deliver'd, could prevent the vain Superstitions and Fopperies of Religion, that mixt with Governments. Neither had any of their learned, by any Scheems of Policy, proceeded farther than to declare, by way of Theory, what sort of Dominion was in it self the best : In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which they have generally preferr'd Monarchical Regiment: On this maxim, that whatsoever is most one, is least to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided. But in the practick part, which is certainly most useful, their Treatises are deficient, by reason they have not presented the world with any sure expedients, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Persons that govern may be suitably qualified to communicate and preserve the Goodness intended by civil Dominion.</p>
               <p>For since it little avails humane Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have a sound Foundation, unless
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53027:48"/>
its Conveniences be likewise regular and lasting: So where personal Enormities and Failings, especially such that deprave and weaken the body politick, are not duely prevented, let the Laws be never so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, evil manners will too soon give Law to them; On the contrary, there is nothing more certain, that in what kind soever a Government be constituted, that ought to have the celebrated Approbation, let its name be what it will be, of ruling by such measures as both incline and secure Obedience from their People, it ought to be reputed more exact than others, that may perhaps have better pretence to the Theory or Title, than to such ordinations of State as tend to the compleating of due Obedience in their People; wherefore the Philosopher told the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> that he join'd his request with the Senator that spoke last, by desiring he would particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly declare, the essential method where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he conceiv'd the <hi>Astreadan</hi> Monarchs had so long continu'd, their happy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Royalty.</p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Jussinedos</hi> readily consented, telling them that he conceiv'd he had in general effectually mention'd before, how it had been anciently the prudent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his Nation to explode motly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, no less than mungrel politicks,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53027:48"/>
that had some time endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest their Monarchy. The first was easily brought to pass by our professing of a Religion that was more sensibly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible than any other that undertook to dissent from it; of which so much has been expressed before, that I need nor, said the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> trouble you with any repetition.</p>
               <p>As for our State managements, it hath been of long and constant use with us to prepare Persons that might be most advantageous to the Essential Prosperity and Grandeur of our Government, and not only so, but by a proper method se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all subordinate Trusts and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy in a suitable manner, whereby their Integrity might appear most avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Publick. And this has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways with us, proceeded from gracious allowance of our Kings, and the ready de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Subjects.</p>
               <p>You much surprize me, reply'd the <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator, to hear you speak of rendring the Persons of Men so service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as you express, to your Nation: And I grant, could that be effected, the exemplary Integrity of your Prince and Nation, together with such Laws as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently must fortify the Glory and Happiness of your Monarch, would be
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53027:49"/>
a President, whence other Dominions might take Copies in order to their future Greatness.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but they would, reply'd the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> if they did not too pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily judge that the Civil manners of Men, as they too often relate to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Transactions, without having to do with such particular failings as naturally are incident to Mankind, are harder to be remedy'd by the endeavour of a State, than really they would be found, if the Cure be prudently provided.</p>
               <p>As in our <hi>Astreadan</hi> Principality, where it can be no Mans Honour or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to be otherwise than faithful to the Publick, and what is more supreamly great, no less the concern of the Monarch than the Subject; might not one rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that the continuation and fond of such a Dominion, would have a large share of remembrance in Records of Time?</p>
               <p>By your leave, said the Philosopher, I will make a Query before you come to particulars: Suppose your King, for I take him to be, as you declare, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Monarch, should by violent extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy alter the form of Rule you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, might not the expedient you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd fall short of expectation?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:53027:49"/>I grant, answer'd the <hi>Jussinedos,</hi> that had we ever been Rul'd by a King that possibly could be imagin'd to act so oppositely to his own Greatness, the objection might have some Validity; but we must suppose him in this case both a Fool and a Tyrant, purposely to lessen himself. Neither did I ever hear of any Monarch so foolishly wicked, that he would rather choose to Rule by the assistance of Evil Men, if the good could do him greater service.</p>
               <p>On the other side, if the Supream Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate observes that Factious and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Inclinations have, in the greatest part of his People, Corrupted, and, as it were, separated from his Throne, the Morality that ought to be annex'd to Publick Duty: To be sure their Prince, if his temper be none of the best, thinks himself in a high measure provok'd to be worse than he was before, and so blends and spreads his evil Genius with the Impiousness of his Subjects, that he, in being Wicked, may be more point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly Supream in the Grandeur he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs.</p>
               <p>But the mischief is, that a bad and unquiet People will be more scrutinously Inquisitive into the Morals and Conduct of their Soveraign, than if they were
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53027:50"/>
as Loyal as they ought; or that it were easie for their Prince, by the meer Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy of Goodness, to over-rule the Impious disposition of his Subjects. And tho this implies a Contradictory and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible humour in Men, relating to such as Govern, it is very much the Topicks of the multitude in all Corrupt Dominions.</p>
               <p>But these particulars have been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough insisted on, I will therefore, in the most essential manner, according to your desire, declare what remains to be deliver'd as it respects Peace and Wars: Which take briefly thus:</p>
               <p>Our Monarchy, as I acquainted you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is perfectly such both in Name and Nature, not admitting of commixture of Power or Rule, in any kind, with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And that this Royal preheminency and greatness, might be more securely dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and continued, our Monarch seldom confers Titles of Dignity or Honour upon any, unless generously descended and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably accomplish'd with Abilities and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and if low Birth doth require Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement, it must be qualified by Actions and Parts extraordinarily eminent, it having been prudently observ'd by our Government, that the exalting of mean Blood, when not throughly cleans'd by the Vertue of Desert,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53027:50"/>
is resented as scandalous, if admitted to have room a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Inheritors of Nobility, because Experience assures us that none are more presumptuously haughty or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator reply'd, That what the <hi>Jassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nados</hi> alledged was in subtance actually the same in every well constituted Dominion; where tho all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not requir'd, under the severe Tests he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, to render themselves capable of national Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53027:51"/>
and Trust: Yet there is no prudent State but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts grievous Penalties on Criminals according to their demerits, and upon their Posterity too, both in the forfeiting of Honour, in case they were so qualified, and likewise of their Estates; but not by any such immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Decree, as could not be reversed by the Civil Magistrate, in mercy to the Heirs of Offenders: and I suppose you limit the severity you mention, as it may be requisitely abated by compliance or submission of men, when under the unhappy circumstance of having such Progenitors.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jassinedos</hi> answered, That the considerable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of State he mentioned, had been of long time with that Equity practised in their <hi>Astreadan</hi> Principality, that none could find cause to blame the means that was used for publick security, whereby their Nation was in a high measure preserved from the malign descent of Tenents and Crimes, that had sometimes infested their Dominion, when the impious positions of Ancestors had been too depravedly inherited by the Off spring and near Allies to men, who were not only the Patrons of such malevolent deeds and maxims, but likewise the Propagators of the blood of those that too propensely inherited the depravations of Predecessors, or thought it for their glory to be Assertors of the same Principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, without duly apprehending the contagion they derived from their Predecessors, by adhering to the Enormities of their Tenents and Practises, that had proved so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimental to common Tranquility and Preservation: against which high Inconveniences, our Government has provided an ample prevention, as you shall soon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Graecian</hi> Philosopher, being not a little surprised in expectation of what the <hi>Astreadan</hi> Magistrate intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deliver, told him, that he begg'd a Pardon from him, is, before he farther proceeded in opening to them the great and useful Prudence of their State, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding against the inheritable growth of Factions in that Nation, he took leave, as a Philosopher, to express

               <p>And I am so far from censuring the proceeding of your State, in the method you declare, that if a broader token of Renunciation, than the Letter R, in reference to the Issues and Consanguinities of such Criminals, were visibly expanded on the Garments they wore, I should judge it a very useful and exemplary caution to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of others, as it signally relates to the honor of their Families and Descent. Wherefore this grand expedient of your <hi>Astreadan</hi> Government, does not only surpass the many endeavors of the wisest of our <hi>Graecian</hi> Legislators, who applied the best of their Learning and Experience to erect and model such a constituted body politick, as might sufficiently depress the corruption of Tenents and practices of men, but may be properly allowed, for its excellent rarity, the Phoenix of civil Regiment; and doubtless whensoever its perfection shall be duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and actually exercised by other Nations, it will receive a suitable estimate.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Graecian</hi> Philosopher, having duly observ'd what his Associate and Countryman, the <hi>Athenian</hi> Magistrate, had before utterred to the <hi>Astreadan Jassinedos,</hi> declared to 'em both, that he fully concentered with their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in approving of the expedient they had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently discussed; adding withal, for its higher Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Praise, that it might well have deferred the ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what reason can question, that the giving a disrepute to the enormous principles and crimes of such as would otherwise convey a derivative evil to their Consanguinities and Issues, is not a commendable policy; Men being too propensely disposed and interested in adhering to the crimes of their nearest Kindred and Acquaintance. Especially if tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the same hopes of popular ends and advantage. For as it is naturally true, that humane prevarications have a near degree of familiarity in the relations of blood, so 'tis no less observable that the ungovernable affections and appetites of mankind, have a like similitude and propagation in the Alliances and Descent of Persons: Nor is any thing more manifest, than that the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious attempts against Principalities and States have proceeded from the Conspirations and Facts of Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Traitors.</p>

               <p>And I assure you, continued the <hi>Jassinedos,</hi> that 'tis manifest from former computation, that no season has afforded a more impious and plentiful gain to the Purse of disloyal Pleaders, than when Apostates of that sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have plac'd their exaltation or thriving on the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Law.

               <p>All which, said the <hi>Jassinedos,</hi> to the Philosopher, was in substance deliver'd in your prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus to their lasting disgrace, were their figures exposed to view, in the largest Appartments and Halls of their Society; that their crimes, by these visible memorials, might occasion a more frequent detestation in the Eyes of old and young, appertaining to that science<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Besides all which, there was an irrevocable command ordained by our government, that together with the frequent Readings on Law, to perform which some learned Professors were appointed for the instruction of Youth, there should be apposite statutes constantly explained, that most palpably expanded the subversion of Law by the ante-judiciary proceedings of such execrable gown'd Transgressors. Which useful determination and infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in time past, after a wonderful Restauration of our Monarchy, and that by its illustrious shining forth, the monstrous Cloud of foregoing usurpation was total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispers'd.

               <p>The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senator and Philosopher, assured the <hi>Jassinedos</hi> that he had sufficiently declared the necessary reflections and punishments which effected that sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the <hi>Astreadan</hi> Soveraignty it now so prosperously injoyed; and might be of exemplary benefit to other States and Principalities, whereby they might obliterate seditious Tenents and Principles out of the Subjects heart: Nothing now remaining to their farther information, if he pleased so far to gratifie their desire, but to acquaint them with the manner of their Policy and Conduct in war; which they doubted not would deserve their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation no less than what he had expressed, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

               <p>To which Request of theirs, the <hi>Jassinedos,</hi> with a becoming gravity, replied, that war was a violence so dreadfully antipathiz'd to humane society and conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as it was generally applied, it vastly compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ning of their being and subsistence: As also that they could not remove the inconvenience without exposing to forcible destruction some part of the whole, that the remainder might more commodiously survive; so that Providence seems, in a manner, permissively to discompose the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date felicity that by rational accord men might otherwise possess; and thus they appear no less the contrivers of their own destruction, by the violent fate of war, than at other seasons the fury of malignant diseases compels to Graves no less a multitude; nor does the rage of Arms, otherwise than in course, seem to have a reciprocal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression with not a few obnoxious distempers, incident to humane Nature. All which are fully resembled in the temper and disposition of the subordinate creature; whose number, were they not impaired for the nourishment and use of mankind, and also lessened in their sum by accidental infirmities and periods of life, together with the destruction they make in preying on the bodies of one another, there would not be room, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the habitable world, to give their individuals sustenance or being. Which inclines me to conclude, that the dispensations of Providence do in some measure comply with common necessity, tho in the severe epithite of permiting destruction, in the kinds I have mentioned, to men and creatures. And I would gladly understand, concluded the Philosopher, if the world does afford any such integrity in a People who are not, for ends I have expressed, Infringers of their repose, or not for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ready to aggress a neighbouring Dominion. Nor did I ever hear of national League or Confederacy that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53027:61"/>
was longer preserved than suitable to their reciprocal benefit; so that men are generally more beholding for their respites from war to public conveniency, than to the conscience of their supream Rulers. Which shews us that War and Peace, like the usual products of nature, are generated and corrupted by their several vicissitudes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jassinedos</hi> granted, that the Philosopher had ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously strengthned his manner of reasoning with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived notion of his science; but told him withal, that there was no general observation, appliable to the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, conducts of men, but might admit of some excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if compared with the upright measures approved and practised by others; and this was palpably verified in the actual methods of War and Peace, constantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to by their <hi>Astreadan</hi> Monarchy; insomuch, that our Scepter was never stained with the disposs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it is very observable, that a bold Invader will find more confederated partakers, in hopes to be sharers In his acquisitions, than a people can readily engage to their assistance, that act no farther than their internal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, without any prospect of enlarging their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or being impower'd by the valor of their Troops to oblige the arms of such as would, on those terms, be their Allies in war.</p>

And this difficulty proceeds from their not being able to fit entirely their several Interests, for their common advantage, to any considerable progression of time: Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when their military opposition is requir'd against a powerful and united Enemy in the figure of a sole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. Well known 'tis to you <hi>Grecians,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> Father of the Great <hi>Alexander</hi> tho the extent of his Dominion was small, if compared with the Territories of his Adversaries, not only withstood, by the single force of his Arms and Policy, the confederated Power of the most considerable, if not all the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and States of <hi>Greece,</hi> when combined to his opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but subdued their strongest Forts and Cities; nor

were his Legions less signally victorious, when attacking in battel their combin'd Battalions; till wearied and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the vanquishments they felt by his Force; they separated from their unsuccessful Confederacy; either as they submitted on his terms, or at their request were received into his Alliance. And in this manner was that one Kingdom more prevalent than opulent <hi>Greece</hi> with its numerous Adherents; which could not proceed from the fertility or supernumerary strength of his Territory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the soil and extent of his Kingdom, was in neither of those respects superior, if compared to the large Surface of <hi>Greece,</hi> and the Natives it produced. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it must be attributed to the nature and affection of the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> as they were in soul duly united and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to support and enlarge the glory of their Monarch, rather than any advantageous or prosperous enterprize that could be attributed to the Fortune or Conduct of their military Power. And I dare aver, continued the <hi>Jassinedos,</hi> that the single Potency of our <hi>Astreadan</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mion would prove not inferior, as it now stands consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, were there more strenuous Confederates, its Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, than I have mentioned, subdu'd by the Grandeur of the <hi>Macedonian Philip.</hi> It being not easily imaginable how any bundles of People associated or combined in the strictest League of War, shall ever be able to vanquish a Nation entirely united, could they perfectly cement their undertakings to that one end, which seldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for the reasons before given, they will unanimously conspire to do. And thus, in the consideration of us <hi>Astreadans,</hi> a foreign Confederacy contriv'd against our Dominion, would rather provoke our contempt than fear; believing, our defence to consist more on the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Peoples Hearts, and the firm tenure of their Obedience to their supream Magistracy; than in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, however considerable, of embattell'd Squadrons: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Either as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of finding them, or have beforehand prepared Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, in a Nation, suitable to their purpose. And this can in no kind come to pass, but where the Hearts of Subjects are perniciously retrograde from the line of their due Obedience, a danger which cannot befall us in the Rectitude our Government now stands: Having by the prudent conferring of Rewards and Penalties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to the Shame of Offenders, as I precedently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, such notorious aversions to our Monarchical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And dangerous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions must needs be incident to humane Rule that cannot expeditely provide, by Inflictions or condign Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, to avert the delinquencies of evil Principles from the souls and practice of men.

               <p>If he would gratify his Subjects by repose at home, to be sure the factious part of them will term it his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseness to Luxury and Ease, and not his genuine incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to give them a sedate Tranquility.</p>
               <p>If contrarily, he would advance his, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, by war abroad; 'tis no less certain, that they will detract from his conduct on every account, so that 'tis almost impossible for a Monarch so prejudiced by the disaffections of his People to be tolerably secure, either as he would preserve peace within his Territories, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the insults of his Neighbor Enemies. Wherefore the main endeavor of a Soveraign, who is complicated with humorous disaffections of any considerable part of his Nation, to perfect his first Victory at home, by

subduing obnoxious Principles in the minds of his People; and what can be expected but Seditions and fatal Disasters within his Circle, unless he can reduce the Persons of such disturbers to a due Renunciation of their precedent errors, till when it concerns him to hope, little from Subjects so complicated; whilst too many of them will hold themse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Insomuch that a wise and just Soveraign will prove it very hard, in such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous and disturbed condition of his State, to select Hands and Hearts, notwithstanding their obligation by Oaths and Benefits, that will serve him, as becomes the duty of their trust, in a civil or military Imployment, It being very suitable to the temper of such persons, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from their sworn and known Allegiance, when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageously tempted with a fresher Interest; tho they have no better argument to make, for being Criminals in that superlative degree, than as they were guided by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous motives to the deserting of their King, and the Laws of their Country. All which high and terrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, proceeding from disaffection caus'd by evil Principles, when patronized by men of popular breadth and vogue in their Nation, have been happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, within our <hi>Astreadan</hi> Principality, by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I have formerly expressed.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is usual in other Dominions, where indirectness and aversion in Tenents are dangerously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, to provide for the safety of their King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, such a chargeable number of armed Legions as may readily suppress any internal disturbance or sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, within the compass of their State: A provision un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary with us, where there is no occasion to maintain a greater number of warlike Troops, than as a prime nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of military Discipline and Glory, are convenient to attend on the Dignity of our Monarch: His whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being firm in principle, and therefore both his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and invincible Army, whensoever he summons, for his royal defence, their ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
