            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mr. CHUTES Caſe Upon the Lady <hi>Dacres</hi> Appeal in, <date>1685.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THE points of the Lady <hi>Dacre</hi>'s Petition of Appeal, are to reverſe two points by way of Explanation of the Lord's Order made upon a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Hearing in the Houſe of Lords, upon Mr. <hi>Chute</hi>'s Appeal in <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1680.</p>
            <p>
               <label>The 1ſt.</label> Touching the Maintenance of her Younger Grand-Children.</p>
            <p>
               <label>The 2d.</label> Touching a Specifick Legacy of Goods at <hi>Sutton</hi> Court.</p>
            <p>And as a new Appeal for Relief, touching Goods at <hi>Dorſet</hi> Houſe, given her as pretended by Mr. <hi>Chute</hi>'s Grandfather's Will in 1659. of about 900. <abbr>l</abbr> value.</p>
            <p>And that ſhe is by the Court of <hi>Chancery</hi> lately ordered to pay 20 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> as a rent for the Vine-Houſe; and 20 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per Annum</hi> for Fewel by her ſpent there.</p>
            <p>As to the Firſt Matter of Reverſal,</p>
            <p>
               <label>1ſt.</label> The Lord's Order was, that a Clauſe in a Decree in 1668, for allowing the Lady 120. <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per Annum,</hi> for Maintenance of the ſaid Children ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, and conſequently that the Money paid her for it, ſhould be applyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her other demands from Mr. <hi>Chute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ſhe ſayes that ſhe has ſince diſcovered Mr. <hi>Chute</hi>'s Father's Will, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his Eſtate with Maintenance for the Children, which had ſhe had before (ſhe is Confident) the Lords would not have reverſed that decree.</p>
            <p>But yet it is fully proved ſhe did before know of that Will, and in Truth it is not to the purpoſe, for it does not charge the Eſtate at all; nor was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree for the Maintenance grounded on it, nor did it mention it. And therefore could not (were there any thing in it) be uſed by her.</p>
            <p>
               <label>2d.</label> As to the Specifick Legacy of Goods at <hi>Sutton</hi> Court; The Lords Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is plain and poſſitive, that ſhe ſhall have no benefit by that Legacy, till the Debts are paid, and that the value ſhall be applyed to pay her Debt, when ſhe firſt had it, which was in 1659. and yet ſhe would, by a Pretence of Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have that Order ſet aſide, and have it preſently allowed her, altho the Debts were not paid in 20 Years after, and note that by his Will, he ſays he looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Goods, not to be the further from his Son.</p>
            <p>As to the new Matters of Appeal.</p>
            <p>Touching the Pretence to the Goods at <hi>Dorſet</hi> Houſe, the Will was plain that he gave her ſuch Goods only as ſhould be at <hi>Sutton</hi> Court at his Death. And thoſe ſhe had by the ſaid Decree.</p>
            <p>And altho by her Bill in Chancery in 1662, ſhe might claim thoſe at <hi>Dorſet</hi> Houſe too; yet Mr. <hi>Chute</hi>'s Father was charged with them in 1666. by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree upon her Bill as aſſetts to pay debts, and ſo he applyed them. And ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver excepted to the Maſters Report of that Charge, but acquieſſed ever ſince, thereupon without any claim for 20 years.</p>
            <p>As to the 20 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per Annum</hi> for the Houſe; it is proved (by ſeveral Gentlemen living near the ſaid Houſe) to be worth 50 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for the 20 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per Annum</hi> for Firewood, it is likewiſe proved that the ſaid Lady <hi>Dacres</hi> burnt to the value of 70 <abbr>l</abbr> 
               <hi>per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe two laſt are the only Points, wherein the Lady</hi> Dacres <hi>appeals againſt the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all the other Points, ſhe appeals to the preſent Houſe of Lords againſt the laſt.</hi>
