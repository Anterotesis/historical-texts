            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Paris, Anno Dom. 1490.</head>
            <p>THe Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> having court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anne</hi> sole Daughter and Heir to the Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> prevailed at last with the young Lady, and with the principal Persons about her, as the Marriage was consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by <hi>Proxy,</hi> with a Ceremony at that time in these parts new. For she was not only pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly contracted, but stated as a Bride, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly Bedded; and after she was laid, there came in <hi>Maximilian</hi>'s Embassadour with Letters of Procuration, and in the presence of sundry Noble Personages, Men and Women, put his Legg (stript naked to the Knee) between the Espousal Sheets; to the end, that that Ceremony might be thought to amount to a Consummation and actual Knowledge. This done, <hi>Maximilian</hi> (whose property it was to leave things then, when they were almost come to perfection, and to end them by imagination; like ill Archers, that draw not their Arrows up to the Head; and who might as easily have bedded the Lady him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as to have made a Play and Disguise of it,) thinking all now assured, neglecting for a time his further proceeding, and intended his Warrs. Mean while, the <hi>French</hi> King (consulting with his Divines, and finding that this pretended Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation was rather an Invention of Court, than any ways valid by the Laws of the Church,) went more really to work, and by secret Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and cunning Agents, as well Matrons about the young Lady, as Counsellours, first sought to remove the Point of Religion and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour out of the mind of the Lady her self, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there was a double labour. <hi>Maximilian</hi> was not only Contracted unto the Lady, but <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi>'s Daughter was likewise Contracted to <hi>King Charles;</hi> So as the Marriage <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alted upon both feet, and was not clear on the other side. But for the Contract with <hi>King Charles,</hi> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception lay plain and fair; for that <hi>Maximilians</hi> Daughter was under years of Consent, and so not bound by Law, but a power of Disagreement left to either part. But for the Contract made by <hi>Maximilian</hi> with the Lady her self, they were harder driven; having nothing to alledge, but that it was done without the consent of her Soveraign Lord <hi>King Charles,</hi> whose Ward and Client she was, and he to her in place of a Father; and therefore it was void, and of no force, for want of such consent. Which defect (they said) though it would not evacuate a <hi>Marriage,</hi> after <hi>Cohabitation</hi> and <hi>Actual Consummation;</hi> yet it was enough to make void a Contract. For as for the pretended <hi>Consummation,</hi> they made sport with it, and said, <hi>That it was an argument that</hi> Maximilian <hi>was a Widdower, and a cold Wooer, that could content himself to be a Bridegroom by Deputy, and would not make a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Journey to put all out of question.</hi> So that the young Lady; wrought upon by these Reasons, finely instilled by such as the <hi>French King</hi> (who spared for no Rewards or Promises) had made on his side, and allured likewise by the present Glory and Greatness of King <hi>Charles,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eing also a young King, and a <hi>Batchelor)</hi> and loth to make her Countrey the Seat of a long and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable War, secretly yielded to accept of King <hi>Charles.</hi> Those of the Court of <hi>Britain</hi> her Subjects and Familiars, insinuated into the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> mind the invalidity of a <hi>Marriage by Proxy,</hi> that there was more of Solemnity and State in those contracts, then Obligation. That She ought not to make any Scruple of Conscience about the point, where the good of her self and Subjects was so much concerned. However in such accidents, the <hi>Pope</hi> who hath power over all Laws Ecclesiastical, would easily be brought to dispense with such Covenants not personally performed, to prevent the miseries that grow by War.

And whether it were not most convenient for the <hi>Realm,</hi> that <hi>Francis</hi> Duke of <hi>Valois</hi> should marry <hi>Her, He</hi> being the undoubted <hi>Heir</hi> of the Kindom.</p>

               <hi>Arguments</hi> upon each side.</head>
            <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> thought the Case to contain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much difficulty. In the first place he thought it repugnant to the <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that he should violate his <hi>Royal Word</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> plighted with the Eldest Son of the K. of <hi>Castile:</hi> And therefore <hi>He</hi> said that <hi>He</hi> could not <hi>upon any terms</hi> condescend and yield unto the <hi>Humble Request</hi> and <hi>Petition</hi> of his <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> who did, (and that <hi>rationally)</hi> conclude that it would exceedingly contribute to the <hi>Peace</hi> &amp; <hi>Welfare</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> if <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> did marry with <hi>Claude.</hi> The <hi>Nobles</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective <hi>Parliaments</hi> proceeded upon this ground. That <hi>Claude</hi> after the decease of King <hi>Lewis</hi> would as <hi>Inheritrix</hi> possess sundry Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories and Lordships in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> which if they should be alienated from the Realm of <hi>France</hi> by her <hi>Marriage</hi> into <hi>Castile,</hi> it would prove an unspeakable loss to the <hi>Crown</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> For what was this else but to deliver up the Keys of the said <hi>Realm</hi> unto the <hi>Castilians,</hi> the <hi>Hereditary</hi> Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> for <hi>Preservation</hi> or the <hi>Recovery</hi> whereof there
<pb facs="tcp:36318:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must needs arise most grievous Wars betwixt the immediate Successor of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and the Crown of <hi>Castile?</hi> It did not seem credible unto them, nor did they think the Councels of <hi>France</hi> ought to proceed on such uncertain Measures, <hi>that the Alliance aforesaid would produce any great and durable Amity betwixt the two Nations.</hi> There being nothing so <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>Solemn</hi> in the Leagues and Confederacies of Princes which doth not yield to their <hi>Ambition.</hi> Enlargement of <hi>Empire</hi> is the <hi>Supream consideration</hi> in their Councels; and from <hi>those desires</hi> even the most firm bonds of <hi>Friendship</hi> are daily violated. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore least the Territories <hi>of such Importance</hi> should come into the possession of the <hi>Castilians,</hi> and their already potent <hi>Neighbour</hi> should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so great an accessional of <hi>strength,</hi> they thought the <hi>Espousals</hi> did not only <hi>deserve</hi> to be <hi>annulled,</hi> bu ought in point of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> to be <hi>invalidated,</hi> For the which they alledged two most powerfull reasons. First, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, that <hi>His Majesty would proceed most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly according to the dictates of Honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; if, out of a tender regard unto the welfare and safety of his people, He did insede from those Counsils which he had either presipitously assented unto, or entertained upon the Exigency of a special juncture of Affairs: That He was obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the humble request of his natural Subjects, aiming at the generall, rather than by too strict a respect unto His Word, given unto a Forreigner, to endanger the whole Realm. That the most obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory and powerfull toys upon Princes, are those whereby they stand engaged to their people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for Him to adhere, 'twas true Honour and Conscience.</hi> Secondly they argued against the <hi>Marriage,</hi> that in such Contracts above all others there ought to intervene a <hi>voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> which She at those Years was incapable to give; and therefore the Contract was null by the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon Law.</hi>

            <head>The Resolution taken.</head>
            <p>King <hi>Lewis</hi> being over-ruled by <hi>these reasons,</hi> and by a particular concernment <hi>for the welfare of His Realm,</hi> did annull the said <hi>Contract;</hi> and to answer the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquility</hi> of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions did give <hi>Her</hi> in Marriage unto <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> who did afterwards succeed him in the Realm of <hi>France.</hi>
