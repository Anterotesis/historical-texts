            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THis Catechism having luckily arriv'd into my hands, I thought it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me (and would be a service to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick) to be a means that others should have the like contentment and profit by the view of

it, as I had. It would have bin a sin to let this talent ly bury'd in the earth without mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying. This advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage spirituall goods have of corporeal ones; that one grows not the poorer by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating them. Receive then out of my hand this worthy Treatise, which (if I be not much deceiv'd) is as usefull a piece as any this age hath brought forth.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45274:3"/>
The Author's name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is enough to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy thus much: who, for profoundness of science, and consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateness in all parts of literature, both divine and human, is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our times, and may be the envy of the happiest: though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45274:4"/>
needing such weak supports. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this, was but an entertainment of divertisment to him, in a time when he had strong and sollicitous thoughts for the good of others: which so fully possess'd him, as he would have even his recreations contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to that end. And this he did so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, and unveil'd the deepest mysteries
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45274:4"/>
of our faith so know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and deliver'd them so familiarly and plainly, and made them appear so reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as they of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est years (for whom he made it) with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to learn the weightiest and abst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

them; And yet the most vers'd in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall speculations, found matter to busy their most vigorous thoughts upon, and learn'd the Reasons &amp; Causes of those things of which before they had no more but a bare knowledge that they were true. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them for whom he compos'd it, hath made him sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his conceptions by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45274:5"/>
using the gentlest style and famil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Or rather, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd his questions with such artifice and judgment (as <hi>Socrates</hi> did, when he made an unletter'd childe give account of most subtil speculations) that one must be notably weak in the power of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, not to fall of one's self upon the true and solid answers to most of them, without further instruction. By which means, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terechumen

will learn knowingly what he is to beleeve; and not pay himself with the sound of words, often times misunderstood; which begets yet greater errors in the collections and inferences dravvn out of those mistaken grounds.

               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>You are in the right, and<note place="margin">But God can do all that (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self or) his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can do;</note> that is it, which I would bring you to.

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes Sir, for seeing whatever the thing made does, is done by somewhat that thing has in it<note place="margin">He is then</note> self; and all that thing has, was made, or given by the maker; and nothing can give what it self has not; the Maker must have in himself al that by which the the thing made had power to do such a thing; that is, hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus you see you have plainly shewn God to be <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty;</hi> for, nothing can be done, but what's done by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and that some-thing, is made by God; therefore, seeing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45274:11"/>
God can do whatever any thing made by him; 'tis clear <hi>he can</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> 
                     <hi>do all things;</hi> which is, to be <hi>Almighty.</hi> But tell me now; do<note place="margin">and Knows all that Himself</note> you think when God does a thing, he knows what he does?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>It were a shame to doubt of that, since we accompt him a fool who knows not what he does; besides, since God makes us know what we do; and is<note place="margin">or</note> himself perfecter than we, he must needs know what he does even better than we.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>And he that knows a<note place="margin">His Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can do;</note> thing, does not he know what that thing can do; for example, can a man know a knife or a clock, without knowing, that<note place="margin">and so is</note> the one can cut, and the other tell the hour of the day?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>That's impossible; as also that God should not know what any work of his can do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>See again how you shew<note place="margin">All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> that <hi>God knows all things:</hi> for, since he knows what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45274:11"/>
made, and what all the things he made can do, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is or can be done but what himself and they do; it follows that God knows all, and every thing that is done, great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to the number of the thoughts of men and angells, to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of dust and sands, and whatever els is done; nay and<note place="margin">Wherefore</note> what can be done, though it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be nor ever will be done.

                  <p>Do you conceive what's meant by these words <hi>Mind, Understanding, Wit, Thought Knowledge</hi> &amp;c. If you do, you have made some apprehension of a spirit.

                  <p>'Tis very true that he is pleas'd with our good works, and displeas'd with our bad.

Now, as<note place="margin">all possible thanks</note> for God Almighty, you know there is no cause concurring, nor any least part of the work which belongs not totally to him, on all sides, and from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: Therefore, how much the<note place="margin">are</note> good is, 'tis wholy and entirely due unto him; but your Parents, and Master are not the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of the Causes; and, therefore, though thanks be due to them in respect they are the immediate causes, yet in comparison of what's due<note place="margin">totally due to him.</note> to God, you are not one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part beholding to them. Again, you told mee God knew perfectly all things belonging to this good you possess, and the best owing of it; But, the next cause understands not perfectly what himself does, but is bent to his work beyond his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing: as you may easily see by this, that your self when you walk know not how you do it,

                  <p>Yes, Sir, I see well enough, that because my self, and all other causes of my action come from God, it must needs follow that my actions come from him.

                  <p>'Tis well thought on. But if you knew that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45274:17"/>
or want of edge in the knife: and likewise, the writing proceeds from the Scrivener; but, that the pen gives not ink well, or blots, comes from the evill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioning, or slitting of the pen: so, what a man does is from God, but that he does not so well as he ought (which is to sin) proceeds<note place="margin">Defect of action)</note> from some defect in the man. For, as from fire cold cannot proceed, nor from water driness; so from the Fountain of Being and Goodness, the want of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and being cannot spring.<note place="margin">Hence</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this you easily gather that God is the <hi>Governour of this</hi>

               <p>Here the Catechist ought to exhort his Catechumen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member and perform his duty towards God; who as he gives us all things freely, so he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves that we offer, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from reward, all our

As he is more cause then the next causes, so is hee to be preferr'd before all. As he does all our works in us, so requires hee the honour of all be attributed to him. As he is not author of sin, so is he not to be charg'd with any fault or want on his side.

                  <p>True, Sir, for 'tis one thing to bee apt to burn, another to bee apt to burn differently. I conceive therefore this difference arises from the severall dispositions in the Matter, or severall Fuells you spoke of.</p>

For, though every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be a thing, it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that every two persons be<note place="margin">yet</note> two things; since you see that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>And is not every corner of of it one corner? and to bee a corner is not nothing.</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Then as you see that<note place="margin">

                  <p>How was this done? was God turn'd to man, or man turn'd into God, or both turn'd into a third thing, when God became man?</p>

                  <speaker>S.</speaker>
                  <p>God cannot be chang'd, and, so none of these three mutations could be made: but man was joyn'd to God, and so God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came<note place="margin">not by charging God,</note> man.</p>

                  <p>No sure, Sr, if God and man be in one thing, the main thing<note place="margin">but by joyning Man</note> must needs be God; and man but a small portion of it. As we see if a litle water be cast into a great deal of wine, it remains still wine; so, since God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitly greater then man, the thing made remains principally God?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>It remains then both God, and man: and seeing what hath not the nature of man is not man, and much more what has not the nature of God is not God; in Christ remain <hi>two natures,</hi> the<note place="margin">to God's</note> nature of God, and the Nature of man.

                     </note> God came to make us Sons of God? therefore was it fitting that amongst the three persons, the son<note place="margin">because 'tis p o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> or <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> to teach us or be our Master.</note> should be chosen to be our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, and example, and as it were elder Brother.

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45274:46"/>
and second person. But how this was done, and the whole history<note place="margin">A shore History of some signal passages belonging to our Saviour.</note> of his oeconomy, or dispensation in this world, you may find in the Gospels. Yet will I briefly deliver it unto you. It was (as is generally thought) the 25. of March upon which the Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell Gabriel being sent from God, brought the Message of this great work unto the B. Virgin; and, having got her happy consent, by the power of the Holy Ghost wrought the frame of this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous child in her entrails without the help of man; into which bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, God, as into <hi>Adam,</hi> breath'd the breath of life in the womb of his Mother. Where having layd nine moneths he was brought forth in a stable upon the 25. of December, swadled in clouts, layd upon straw, began to feel hunger and cold, and such like extremities, as we see it fares with other Infants. After eight days he was circumcis'd, and his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45274:46"/>
body painfully wounded. And these three Mysteries the Church celebrates on three seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dayes. His <hi>Conception</hi> on the day we call <hi>our Lady's</hi> of <hi>Lent:</hi> his <hi>Birth</hi> at <hi>Christmass,</hi> and his <hi>Circumcision</hi> on <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>years day.</hi> After this he is thought to have been kept in Bethlem till the three Kings came out of east to adore him; whereupon King <hi>Herod</hi> growing jealous, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>led into Egypt, and Herod executed his tyranny up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the children under two years old in all the confines of Bethlem. In Egypt you must imagin he was provided as poor people are wont to bee in strange countries; Yet there remains for some years till the death of Herod. After which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd (for fear of Herod's Son) he return'd into Nazareth. Whence hee every year went to Hierusalem at the solemn feasts, and there was lost by his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45274:47"/>
parents at 12. years of age; and, after three dayes seeking, found in the midst of the Doctors in the Temple astonishing them with with his wise and learned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers; so he liv'd, helping his Father to work, and being obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient both to Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (for Father wee may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call him who was maried to his Mother, and had paternal jurisdiction over him; as also his Mother call'd him) till the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Angel from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, summoning mankind to penance, sounded the march for him towards his Eternal Fathers work, for which hee was sent. Wherefore, baptised by S. John, and receiving the visible testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Holy Ghost, he made his tryall in the desart by a fast of 40. dayes, and 40. nights, and by the temptation of the Devil. His Baptism the Church cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brates on Twelf day, the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the first Sunday of Lent.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45274:47"/>
Then, he began his preaching, &amp; gathering of disciples, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of miracles: beginning from the changing of water into wine, which is likewise comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated upon Twelf day. So he proceded through great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and dangers, til the raising of Lazarus. Upon which he entred in triumph into Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, which we solemnize on Palmsunday. Four dayes after he celebrated his last Supper, and the next day, his bitter Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: and, within three dayes, having set free our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (who never till then were admitted unto the sight of God) he rose, and instructing his Church 40. dayes, in it's sight ascended into heaven, whence after ten dayes, he sent the Holy Ghost, himself remaining there till the day of judgment: when he will return to take accompt of his benefits he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon us.</p>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45274:50"/>
not with the eyes by which you walls, and trees, and sun, and stars, but with the eyes by which you know you are this day, and neither yesterday nor tomorrow: &amp; by which you know you must have been yesterday, yet it may happen you may nor be tomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; and other Truths or things of this quality, which the least<note place="margin">and</note> of you is capable of. Now, he that loves God above all things<note place="margin">Love of God</note> (especially if he have done it long) cannot chuse but desire to know and see him whom he loves so much. Wherefore, when he dies and has no more any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction<note place="margin">disposing</note> by his senses, he is wholy set upon that object; and, so, extreamly miserable unless he<note place="margin">and</note> can obtain it: wherefore, if God be not hard-hearted (as Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it self cannot be) what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains but that he must needs let<note place="margin">determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily to this,</note> himself be seen by him? which is, <hi>to be in heaven.</hi> And, this a Divine would tel you, were to

But I have heard that we<note place="margin">to increase that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge by Study of such things, that is, by <hi>Prayer:</hi> of which <hi>Mentall</hi> has three parts</note> must get Vertue by praying.

                  <p>I child, but there's this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt your prayer for vertue, and your prayer for play; that the one is a Study, the other not. And, not to detain you long, you have heard perhaps, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45274:55"/>
some Prayer is <hi>mentall,</hi> some <hi>vocall.</hi> And, first, to tel you what mentall prayer is, know there be three parts of it. The first is to <hi>know,</hi> and be sure of the truth<note place="margin">To <hi>Know</hi> the truth of the point,</note> you are to consider: and this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belongs to him who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the meditation in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose; for 'tis his part to give a strong and plain conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that hee who comes to prayer, need not much ado to be<note place="margin">To <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</note> convinc'd of the truth. The next part is to <hi>make a resolution</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the knowledge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, by exhorting himself out of the weightiness of the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: and this is properly Meditation: for <hi>meditor</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies to think on oft, conn, or exercise somthing: this part<note place="margin">and</note> then being frequent beating upon good life, &amp; the rectifying<note place="margin">To raise the heart to God, expecting a Blessing,</note> of our heart and will, is properly <hi>meditation.</hi> The third is to turn <hi>our heart to God</hi> for whose sake we are to do al things, and from
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45274:56"/>
whom wee are to expect the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of our labours. For, as al the husbandman's labour is to litle purpose unless God send rain, heat and fair weather at due seasons: so likewise, unless God direct our lives, 'tis to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle purpose what ever our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours go about.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Preparation to prayer, what's substantial, is, that your thoughts be not preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupated by any other care ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of play, or study; or any other such matter, which may draw you away: and therefore it ought to be the first thing you do after you are risen. Then shortly to remember that all other business be bables, and things not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you in respect of this: and this the onely thing which can do you good in this life and the next. Thus much is enough for a Catechism, the rest you are to seek-in treatises made purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this subject; amongst the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45274:56"/>
rest I recommend to you a little one of <hi>Antonius Molina</hi> a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusian. As concerning <hi>vocall prayer,</hi> I hope you can tel me what that is.</p>

                  <p>The Apostles were the chief; and all others who came since; have learn'd of them, and so I see the Church is truly Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical.</p>

                  <p>Yes, and onely shee; ask any Hereticks whether they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd their doctrin from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, they will answer, yes. By whose hands? they answer, by the scripture. But a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like says, from his Forefathers &amp; they from theirs &amp;c. so that none lays claym to have their Church Apostolical, but onely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. For the question's not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were al the while some of their Religion; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>these who now are, were taught and receiv'd it from them by true succession. For, if two studying one thing in divers times, finde<note place="margin">and</note> the same, the one does not receive it from the other, and so 'tis not true succession.

You ought<note place="margin">as plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostles univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,</note> therefore to know that the true Church is the onely Catholick in three respects. First because it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was at first planted by the Apostles in the whole world; which is clear, since only one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends her doctrin by succession<note place="margin">as having some of her profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in each c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

you have now two signes or marks of the true Church. The third is <hi>sanctity:</hi> can you tel how the true Church is onely <hi>Holy?</hi>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis wel answer'd; but, to go more orderly, you know <hi>sanctity</hi> is nothing but the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise or Confirmation in those virtues that lead us to heaven; which is the life God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty sent his onely Son to give us.<note place="margin">Also, Having an entire Body of Faith, or Doctrin fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, Laws &amp; Customes conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Faith, and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by her Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and practis'd by her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</note> This consists in Three things. First in Faith and Doctrin; wherein you shall find all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, in the points of difference, swarve from this end, and the Catholick Church hold to it; as in praying to Saints, praying for the dead, and the like. Secondly,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45274:79"/>
in Laws and Customs, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are according to Faith, must needs be different ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it. Thirdly, in Life and executions of those Rules: wherein likewise the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence must hold, with this <hi>cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,</hi> that there may be more, and greater wickedness among Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks by reason of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the professors of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; nay of it self; for who have not so good things to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend against, cannot be so wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>How then can Holiness be a sign of the true Church, if there be so much wickedness in the members of it?</p>

                  <speaker>M.</speaker>
                  <p>Though there be much and perhaps more wickedness among Catholicks, yet is there more San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity<note place="margin">she is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Holy.</hi>
                     </note> also. For, among others there is hardly ever any man of extraordinary devotion heard of: Congregations of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men abstaining from pleasures,

and separating themselvs from the world, none are found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less such as were begun in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick times; extraordinary acts of penance, or heroick virtue are are not to be look'd for.

danger is double from the double power of our soul; against the fear of death we are secure by Extreme-Unction; and against the flesh, by Mariage. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you see that to furnish our spiritual to the proportion of our corporal life, the Sacraments are to be just seven.

Why? because one can give but what's his own, and when 'tis given 'tis no more his to give: so, if a man give his service to God which he does in Baptism, as a Man; in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as a Souldier; in Order,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45274:83"/>
as a married man to propagate God's Church; unless God will release his gift, he can never be his own to give again. And therefore these Sacraments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be given ofter; the others may.

For since al Religion is but a doctrin or practise to perform what's due from us to God; and we must first know there is a God, before we perform our duties to him; and to knowing, follows acknowledging, as the proper extern act; and Sacrifice is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a rit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                     </gap>, or ceremony by which we acknowledg God to be our God; it follows that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is the first, and chief act of Religion. Now, to shew you the particulars: God signifies as much as the Author of Being to al things, or as our phrase goes, Mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45274:85"/>
away from our selvs, in testimony that he is God; as we give the first fruit of our corn or other har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest, in sign we acknowledg he gave it us. So now you see what means a Sacrifice; which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but the making away the Being of something in testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that God is the Author of all being to us, and ours. But, can you tel in particular what Christian Sacrifice is?</p>

heard that sorrow also has two parts, Contrition and Attrition? which I think I must help you to understand what they are. And in a word: you know that take a hard stone and grate it against a harder, you shal bring it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what fashion you list; yet you leave it stil hard in the middle: but, put it in a morter and beat it, you turn it al into dust. The first is call'd Attrition; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, Contrition. And, by a metaphor deriv'd from hence, if a man that has lov'd some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful object or action, and, be withdrawn from it by fear of either loss of good, or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting evil, but so that stil hee keeps some longing towards the thing: such a man's <hi>attrite;</hi> But if he perfectly forgo and grow into a hatred of the thing before loved: then hee is <hi>contrite:</hi> and by this you see, how Attrition leaves a desire and stain to be burn'd and cleans'd hereafter in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:45274:95"/>
Contrition purifies the heart to go immediatly to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But, whereon must<note place="margin">as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</note> wee ground all our sorrow for sin?</p>

                  <p>well said. All hate is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the loss of some good, or the enduring some evil; Each of which may be both natural, and supernatural. Supernatural goods<note place="margin">and</note> lost by sin, are the friendship, and face of God in the next world: and the sweetness which is in such excellent virtues even in this life. The harm gotten is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall<note place="margin">Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary harms.</note> damnation in the next: and perpetual torture of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this, to those who know and conceive what they do. Natural goods lost by vice, are health, peace, credit, estate. Natural harms are the inconveniences which sin drives its lovers to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45274:95"/>
dayly: as diseases, vexations, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit, poverty, the usual effects of a disorder'd life. How do you procure amendment?</p>

                  <p>Wel. But 'tis very hard for a man to purpose to avoid what he's almost certain he shal not. Therefore, I take it for your su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest way to purpose to do your best endeavour to escape all you confess, rather than directly and positively to purpose what's<note place="margin">full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to endeavour amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</note> not morally in your power; and to be sorry you are not likely to have your endeavours correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to your wil.

                  <p>So may you come of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to Confession with little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. You must therefore consider<note place="margin">which, if reall;</note> the occasions which draw you

into danger, and study with your self, and take your Ghostly Father's advice how without greater inconveniences, you may fly such occasions: that, so, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding of sin may be the easier. And know the causes of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions<note place="margin">studies to avoid oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</note> are as well in omission, as in commission.

                  <p>True; but, on his part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main two things, which belong to you<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> one, the giving absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the other, imposing of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or satisfaction: the first contains rather a Theological<note place="margin">what <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Priest is;</note> difficulty than Catechistical, that is, what Absolution the Priest gives. For, if a man betruly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he is absolv'd before: if not, the Priest's absolution does him no good.

'Tis not enough that children be born, but they must be bred up, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,<note place="margin">It's offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</note> and govern'd. And this is wont to be divided into three actions. The first, to wean them from the love of naturall objects. The second, to instruct them, and let them know what's necessary to supernatural life. And, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to induce them to do what they have learnt is necessary. Which three actions in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall language are called the <hi>Purgative, illuminative,</hi> and<note place="margin">and Division.</note> 
                     <hi>unitive</hi> way. And according to these three is constituted the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Hierarchy, of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, Priests, and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters who are chiefly Deacons &amp;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45274:100"/>
Subdeacons; and afterward the other four lesser orders. And is called <hi>Hierarchy;</hi> that is, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power</hi> or Principality. The first is done by ceremonies and majestickness of holy rites, at which sensual men standing in admiration, begin to think there is some greater mystery in the matter thus handled, and desire to learn and understand it. The second is done chiefly by Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising: by which the people understand what's to be beleev'd, hop'd, and practis'd. The third by Government; by which men are set forward &amp; kept in order, to do what they have understood to be their duty.</p>

                  <p>Sir, by this, the Deacons &amp; Subdeacons should be the chief instruments of the Sacraments; whereas wee see they belong chiefly to Priests, and Bishops<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Besides, I have heard Preaching is proper to Bishops, which is not Government<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> nor belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therunto.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I never understood but that saving Mass, and hearing Confessions was the greatest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Priest; and likewise, of a Bishop to confirm and give Orders: whereas you seem to prefer other offices before these.</p>

                  <p>Do you not know that God has no need of our serving him, and therfore that all serving of God was made for the profit of man; and that more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which is most mankind's spiritual profit? So that if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions

                  <p>Thus much is onely for the common. But, even for particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Bishops are necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to spiritual direction.

                  <p>Sir, I ever thought, that for spirituall Directions we were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to go to spiritual men; that is, to Religious, who seem to have more practise therin.</p>

                  <p>Truly, if there were but one way to heaven by actually for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the world, what you say were advisable; but the spirits of secular persons being as different from the spirits of Religious, as one life is from the other; their direction also must be no
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:45274:103"/>
less different; so that for a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man to be fit to direct a secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man inspirit, he must either live among seculars, or else have that defect supply'd by others directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Moreover even for spiritual life of Religious, Bishops are the Rule, and Judges. since all tend (though by diverse wayes) to the encrease of Faith and Charity, whose laws are put into their hands. And, hitherto we have declared the necessity of Bishops, or Hierarchy, which the Divines call <hi>necessitatem medii,</hi> that is to say, towards gaining the end, and consists in this; that though particular persons may come to salvation without the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Bishops, yet whole Countries cannot; nor the Church be without them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis they who are to direct the whole, as every man by the understanding directs himself; and so we may see some commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities govern'd by Superiours

without laws, and prosper for a while; but, never was there any seen govern'd by laws without Superiours; and, if there were, the Laws would be but occasions of quarrels, and dissensions.

us follow the troden path of our fore-fathers. Yet one thing wil I add; that wee have not by Jesus Christ or his Church left us any externall actions with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of grace and reward for the <hi>deed done,</hi> but onely the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; which are necessary, more because they are professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our faith and charity, and certain initiations or associati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Christ's Church in some degree, (whence the very exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall action proceeds from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall grace when done as it ought:) than that there is any connexion betwixt those exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal<note place="margin">Fretences of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary grants to certain Private Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as from Christs promise, without proof therof by manifest miracle, to bee sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected;</note> actions and merit, by Christ's voluntary conjunction of them: and therfore all those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions which promise particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar effects or rewards to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain prayers, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ's special grant to some Saint, as they cannot bee easily convinc'd of superstition, because God can if he please do

such things, so they are not easily to be credited without manifest miraculous proof, at least of the good life of the Saint who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins such a devotion; and that certainly it came from him. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not acccording to the spirit which Christ has left to his Church; which is to make us <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers in spirit and truth:</hi> And<note place="margin">and breed ill-groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidences.</note> therfore Christians ought to be drawn from putting their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in such things, to place their trust in Christ, and walk towards him in the known path of Charity and good works.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Pater noster,</hi> or <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is ordinarily thought to consist of Seven Petitions; or as others count them, six: without prejudice or disrespect to which opinions I think it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly divided into two parts; one consisting of three Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or wel wishings. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of three Petitions correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the three Salutations. The three Salutations are accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the three Persons of the Blessed Trinity: Essence, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Goodness. The first salutation therefore (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>after the address or determination of the person to whom we speak which is done in these words, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in heaven</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the next following words
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45274:116"/>
               <hi>hallowed be thy Name.</hi> A <hi>Name</hi> is a word signifying <hi>what</hi> the thing signify'd by the Name <hi>is.</hi> And, so, this Salutation belongs to Essence, the property of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Holy</hi> is that which is sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fixt in vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For <hi>sanctus</hi> comes of <hi>sancio,</hi> which is as much as to make a firm, constant or irrevocable sentence. And, by holy Writ and Ecclesiastical use, the word <hi>sanctus</hi> is appropriated to vertue &amp; supernatural goodness; putting which together, to sanctify and hallow the name of God, must be, that the Essence or Nature of God be firm and constant in Goodness. But, because we do not wish for what already is, this must not be understood of the Name of God in himself, but in us. The meaning then is, that we wish all men and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in word and deed, may carry themselvs towards God as towards <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:45274:117"/>
self; having that opinion and esteem of Him, and bearing themselves towards Him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And, it seems to be in short what the Psalms and Canticles more largely dilates in these and the like words; <hi>Bless our Lord al ye works of our Lord,</hi> and the following; <hi>Sing to our Lord al the whole Earth. Praise our Lord all ye Nations, O praise our Lord from Heaven.</hi> And many more such like.</p>
            <p>The second Salutation is, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi> Which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by this word <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> to belong to <hi>Wisdom,</hi> For <hi>regnum</hi> which signifies <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> is deriv'd a <hi>regendo,</hi> from <hi>governing:</hi> and Government is an order of Subjects; and to order, is the work of <hi>Wisdome;</hi> as we see in all arts and busines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, 'tis the charge of the wisest to direct and order what's to be done; and the office of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest or quickest, to pat in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:45274:117"/>
what's order'd.</p>
            <p>The meaning of this Salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we learn from Saint Paul, who teaches us that at the day of Judgment our Saviour Jesus Christ shall deliver up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Government which he has received of him to his Father, and that then God shal be all in all. Whereby is given us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that at that day shal be an end of all motions and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and so the work of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which is to govern and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the variety of things, shal pass into the strain of Essence and Being; and so become a constant Emanation of the same invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Beeing for ever and everin all things. In the mean while the Kingdome of God is as it were a making; as a King who is going upon a conquest either of Rebels or other enemies, is making himself a Kingdome. And, by this petition wee wish him happy and speedy success
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:45274:118"/>
therin; not that we fear or doubt of that which cannot fail; but shew our good will and desire to see that effected which Hee's a doing.</p>
            <p>The third Wish is comprised in those words, <hi>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</hi> Which we collect to belong to Goodness, and the Holy Ghost, from the words <hi>will</hi> and <hi>be done;</hi> for goodness consists in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>, that all be done; and rational Goodness, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly such, is in the wil and it's motions: The meaning is plain, that wee wish, as in heaven there's a full subjection without resistance, so there may be the like on earth. These three I call Salutations or wel-wishes, such as in civil conversation is <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>l,</hi> or <hi>God save you;</hi> and in spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>The Lord be with you;</hi> or <hi>Peace be unto you;</hi> and the like; because it is not natural to pray to one for himself, and this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:45274:118"/>
word <hi>thy</hi> expresses, that these three are goods wisht to God. Much less do we intreat any one to do good to himself unless wee think hee be out of reason by passion or ignorance. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is not in the words any expression that God should do any thing, as in the following; but onely that we would see the things bee. And, lastly, if we look into what's ask'd, wee find that all is one, and one all; for if his Name be sanctify'd, as wee wish, his Kingdome is come, and and his Will is done as in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and so turn them which way you wil, out of any one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the other two.</p>
            <p>To this succeeds the second part, consisting of three petitions or requests. The first, <hi>Give us this day our dayly bread;</hi> that is, all things fit for our mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And this corresponds to that property of God by which hee's Author and Creatour of all
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:45274:119"/>
things. For, it belongs to him that makes a thing, to conserve and maintain it. Some instead of <hi>dayly</hi> put <hi>supersubstantiall;</hi> but they are deceiv'd in the propriety of the Greek word, looking more into the der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>vation than into the use. For, <hi>daily,</hi> is the more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual and proper signification, and joyning it with the other word <hi>this day,</hi> wee learn two excellent documents. One, that it was our Saviour's will wee should say this prayer every day; since wee pray but for one day. The other, that wee should not bee sollicitous or troubled with anxiety for future things; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as far as they belong to God Almighty, but enjoy the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>esent with thanks giving.</p>
            <p>The second Petition is express'd in these words, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts as we forgive our debtours.</hi> Debts signify Offences, and debtours Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; so that he that wishes
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:45274:119"/>
any harm to those who have offended him, because they have offended him, is excluded from this prayer; but not he that wishes due punishment to an offender, either for his own amendment, or the example of others, and good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> God cannot forgive him that is not in love and charity<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and who ever wishes harm to his neighbour, loves him not; and, so, is void of Charity. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>s Petition answers, <hi>Thy Kingdom come;</hi> For, as we see Christ's expression in the Gospel, that his coming was chiefly for remission of sins: So, his Government likewise since he's gone to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, all, principally tends to same merciful end Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the last Petition thus express'd, <hi>Lead us not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but deliver us from evil.</hi> And by those words of <hi>temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> which belong unto
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:45274:120"/>
will, we easily see the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence it has with the third salutation and fulfilling of God's will. The meaning is not hard, onely we may note, that wee pray not here, not to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for temptation is often for our good; as appears in Saint Paul, who was deny'd to be freed from carnal temptations for his good; but, not to be overcome by temptation; for hee's gone <hi>into</hi> temptation, whom temptation compasses round about, so that he finds no way out: not he who is, as it were, but touch'd with it on one side. The word (<hi>but</hi>) seems to shew the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is not different in sence from the foregoing; and so the Petition but one.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> or Hail Mary, consists likewise of two parts: One containing four sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations or well wishes. The first is exprest in these words, <hi>Hail Mary full of grace,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:45274:120"/>
in the word <hi>Hail,</hi> from whence comes Health; and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails or imports what the Latin <hi>Ave</hi> or <hi>Salve</hi> does; of which the first seems to be as much as <hi>Habe,</hi> or <hi>habe salutem.</hi> that is, <hi>have</hi> or enjoy Health; and in some ancient copies is written <hi>Have:</hi> and <hi>salve</hi> we know sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>sis salvus,</hi> which is the same: and in English may be explicated, Health be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>ide you, or have all the perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness due to your Nature, or which your Nature is capable of. By use 'its come rather to be an Interiection of salutation, or excitation to the hearing an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain good wish, than to retain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> first and proper significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The second Salutation consists in these words, <hi>our Lord be with you;</hi> that is, his protection and assistance. As it is a good use of some who when they come into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>any house, say, God be here, or
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:45274:121"/>
in certain occasions say, God speed you.</p>
            <p>The third and fourth are two Blessings; one upon the blessed Mother, and the other upon her more blessed Son. A Blessing we call not, as in other places, the wishing of bliss, or happiness: but, either our approving and congratulating of the felicities they enjoy, or else a simple and devout admiration of them.</p>
            <p>The later part is a Prayer to the same Mother of God for her intercession for us now and at our deaths.</p>
            <p>The two prayers thus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, I could wish him who says his Beads, when he recites his <hi>Paternoster</hi> to direct mentally his three salutations to the three Persons, each to the Person to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 'tis proper, with a bowing to them if time and place be fitting. And, in saying the <hi>Ave-Maria,</hi> at the two Blessings to remember some passage or benefit of our Saviour
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:45274:121"/>
Jesus Christ unto us, for which we bless him &amp; his holy Mother; for, seeing She brought forth unto us him that bestow'd such benefits upon us, 'tis reason Shee should partake of the blessings which we heap up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Son for them. Likewise, in the later part<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> where we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire her to pray for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> may determin some good we have need of: But 'tis best if we mark some property of the Mystery we bless him for, and thence take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of some virtue we want, and heartily intreat for it. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when we make comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of our Saviour's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, speaking to our Lady in prayer we say, Blessed art thou amongst women, <hi>for feeding the Son of God at thy breast,</hi> and blessed be the fruit of thy womb Jesus, <hi>for humbling himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</hi> Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, <hi>that wee may encrease in Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:45274:122"/>
And at the hour of our death.</p>
            <p>But, those words which be added, are to be spoken onely with the heart; the rest with heart and mouth both. For, so doing, they make us think of what we say and do; whereas, if we did add them with our tongues, they would slip over like the rest, and neither help our memory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>
               </gap>or make us pray with Spirit.</p>
            <p>The number of <hi>Ave Maries</hi> to one <hi>Pater noster,</hi> or of <hi>Pater noster</hi> and <hi>Ave Maries,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> at will; and every one who taken the course p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>b'd, may do well to consider how much time<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> he was wont to spend in his whole Beads, and say as many as wil take him up as much time, and not care though he has not made an end of his Beads, if he has no special obligation to the saying them all. Yet, because the ordinary number is of the five tens, I thought good to designe
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:45274:122"/>
our Saviour's life, and his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Mother's, as far as it goes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with it, appointing one payr of beads for every day of the week, and five and twenty points for every payr of beads; that is, for every two <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> one point. The profit is that by this means we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and give our Lord thanks once a week for the most of the passages of his blessed life registred unto us by holy writ, and stir up our selves to the imitation thereof, that is, to good life, which is our intent in prayer and al other our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For, as for the ordinary direction of meditating upon some one mystery while you say a ten, what has it to do with the saying of the ten: or why were it not better onely to meditate and let the ten alone? or is the time of saying a ten just suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have fruit of meditating upon a mystery? And, lastly, if
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:45274:123"/>
delving or spinning, one thought of the mystery, wherein were it worse then such saying of our beads? But, this way, every <hi>Ave Mary</hi> is made a jaculatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the mystery; and your heart and mouth go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and truly you use vocal prayer; whereas in the other your mind prays one thing and your mouth another quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
