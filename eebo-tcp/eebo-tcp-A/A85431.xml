         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

moſt knowing men, to goe about to uſe in any
ſet way, exhortatory motives to perſwade to
<hi>peace &amp; reconciliation the people of God amongst
us.</hi> The provocations are ſo high, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperations
ſo freſh and encreaſing, that if I had an audience
made up of thoſe alone that have the ſwaying power of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and together therewith their moſt favourable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and intereſt in affection without prejudice, I ſhould
not know how to attempt it with any hope of ſucceſſe. But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114819:3"/>
though the animoſities of mens ſpirits, augmented by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident
circumſtances, are gon beyond the power of the
perſwaſions of men in this preſent paroxiſme: yet they are
not above the power of Gods wiſedome and providence,
nor the force and efficacy of Chriſts bloud. You may
therefore, in the midſt of all contrary appearances, give me
leave, though I cannot hope to <hi>perſwade,</hi> yet to BELEEVE
(The <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> and <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> they are
in my Creed) and <hi>becauſe I beleeve therefore to ſpeake,</hi>
and ſo to give you an account of my faith as to this iſſue.
Let your faith but wait, and give God time for it, and leave
him to effect it his owne way. And to this end I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
this Text, <hi>Chriſtus Pax noſtra: For he is our peace who
hath made both one, &amp;c.</hi> and my inference is, That <hi>therefore
the Saints</hi> SHALL <hi>and</hi> MUST <hi>be one, and reconciled in
the end.</hi> And this is the beſt newes which in theſe times
can be told you, the ſeaſonableſt we can heare of, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
one great part of the glad tidings of the Goſpell it
ſelfe, without which it were imperfect, which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<hi>our peace</hi> (who came to purchaſe it, as theſe words
ſhew, ſo) came <hi>to preach,</hi> as the very next v. 17. hath it.</p>
            <p>The maine and principall intendment of theſe words is,
to give an eminent inſtance of the efficacy of Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
in ſlaying the enmities that are amongſt the people
of God themſelves, and of his being our peace in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect;
inſtancing in that the greateſt that ever was between
Jew and Gentile; <hi>Whom yet</hi> (as here) <hi>he hath made both one,
and hath broken downe the partition wall betweene us:</hi> and
however he mentions in the 16. v. our <hi>reconciliation made
with God</hi> (of which elſewhere he treats more largely) yet
(here) but by <hi>way of confirmation of our faith</hi> in this other
of reconciliation amongſt our ſelves. For the aime of its
introduction here is but to ſhew, how that Chriſt in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
us to God himſelfe, carried it ſo, and did it under
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114819:3"/>
ſuch a conſideration and reſpect, as neceſſarily drew on and
involved our reconciliation one with another; namely
this, that he <hi>reconciled us unto God</hi> IN ONE BODY
among our ſelves. It is an happy clauſe, that addition
<hi>[in one body]</hi> and on purpoſe inſerted thereinto, to ſhew,
that when God was to tranſact our peace and reconciliation
to and with Chriſt, hanging upon the Croſſe, he would not
nor did not acknowledge himſelfe, to him, then, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to us by him, upon any other termes, then as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
we were lookt at, and <hi>repreſented to him by Chriſt as one
body;</hi> and therein reconciled one to another, whileſt we were
reconciled to himſelfe.</p>

               <head>The Connection of the 16. ver. with the 15. diſcuſſed: And

               </head>
               <p>I Meet but with one eminent difficulty in the coherence
and contexture of theſe words, and that is the connexion
of theſe two verſes, v. 15. 16. as namely of theſe words,
And <hi>that he might reconcile us to God, v. 16. &amp;c.</hi> with the
former v. 15. <hi>Having aboliſht the enmity, &amp;c.</hi> Now this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
mentioned v.<note place="margin">v. 14.</note> 15. is evidently intended of the enmity

                     </gap>.</note> as is clear by its connexion with
v. 14. <hi>Who hath made of twaine one, and broken downe the
partition wall: Having ſlain the enmity.</hi> Now <hi>the twaine,</hi>
or the <hi>two,</hi> thus made <hi>one</hi> (between whom this enmity was)
is not God and we, but the <hi>Jewes</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> (of whom
he had ſpoken in the former verſes) for he adds, <hi>that he
might create both in one new man,</hi> which could not be ſaid
of God and us.</p>
               <p>Now then the difficulty is, <hi>what reconciliation to God in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114819:4"/>
one body</hi> that ſhould be v. 16. which the Apoſtle makes
the conſequent of <hi>having ſlain the enmity betweene theſe
Jewes and Gentiles;</hi> For the connexion ſeemes to import
the one a conſequent of the other: And the words to
run thus, <hi>Having ſlain the enmity between themſelves,</hi> v. 15.
<hi>that he might reconcile them to God,</hi> v. 16. Now this recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
to God muſt be either meant of the <hi>work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi>
wrought <hi>in us,</hi> whereby we turne unto God,

theſe ſhould be intended,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. 16.</note> is the Queſtion. And ſo withall the
Queſtion is, whether thoſe words, v. 16. <hi>And that he might
reconcile both unto God,</hi> are to be caſt unto the 15. verſe as a
part of the diſcourſe thereof, or doe not rather begin a
new and entire diſcourſe full and compleat within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>For the firſt ſtand many Interpreters, and the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for that opinion is,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> The coherence of theſe words with
thoſe next immediately foregoing, <hi>Having aboliſht the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
that he might create in himſelfe of twayne one New man,
and that he might reconcile both unto God, &amp;c.</hi> The reſolve
of which ſeemes to be this, That Chriſt having on the
Croſſe wrought in himſelfe this great worke for us, to ſlay
the enmity betweene us, and make both one, by the ſacrifice
of himſelfe, and this as the <hi>antecedent</hi> worke: That yet
there remained <hi>two</hi> other as <hi>conſequent</hi> works as the effects
that follow therefrom. Namely,</p>
               <p>1. To <hi>create both one new man,</hi> ſo making actually peace
between themſelves. And 2. To bring them both into an
actuall ſtate of reconciliation with God, by working re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
in them towards God, ſo making them <hi>one
body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reaſon for this interpretation further is, That
both theſe two are brought in and yoked in the like Tenour
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114819:4"/>
of ſpeech,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>That he might create, &amp;c. And that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile;</hi>
as if they were like parallel fruits of that <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>
worke, <hi>ſlaying that enmity</hi> mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this parallel, looke as <hi>creating</hi> them both into
<hi>one new man,</hi> is and muſt be acknowledged to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of a worke wrought <hi>in them, viz.</hi> the <hi>new Creation:</hi>
ſo alſo that other, the reconciling them to God muſt be
underſtood of the worke of reconciliation unto God
wrought in them alſo; and ſo the <hi>new man</hi> they are <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
into, v. 15. anſwereth but unto that <hi>one body</hi> they are <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi>
unto, v. 16. being one and the ſame.</p>
               <p>And that which encreaſeth the difficulty is, that if it
ſhould be underſtood of reconciliation unto God himſelfe
wrought by Chriſt on the Croſſe, how ſuch a reconciliation
ſhould be the conſequent of his ſlaying firſt the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Saints themſelves, ſo as it ſhould be ſaid, <hi>He ſlew
the enmity among the Saints, that he might reconcile them to
God:</hi> This is not conſonant to reaſon, ſeeing rather (that
according to the harmony and dependance of Theologicall
truths) his reconciling them unto God upon the Croſſe is
the <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>cauſe</hi> of his ſlaying the <hi>enmity</hi> of them
<hi>mutually,</hi> becauſe our reconciliation one with another is
rather depending upon, and the fruit of reconciliation with
God himſelfe, who being firſt reconciled to us, all things
elſe are reconciled one to another; as Subjects that have
beene at variance, when reconciled to their Prince or Head,
become reconciled one to another among themſelves.</p>
               <p>But yet I rather incline to thinke, that <hi>other kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi>
betweene <hi>God and us,</hi> wrought by Chriſt <hi>for
us on the Croſſe,</hi> to be intended v. 16. and ſo to be brought
in as a parallel <hi>with that former reconciliation wrought by him
alſo on the Croſſe</hi> betweene and on behalfe of the Jew and
Gentile mutually. And ſo this 16. v. to begin a new and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114819:5"/>
intire diſcourſe, apart and ſejunct from the other, namely,
of our <hi>reconciliation with God,</hi> as the former verſes had
diſcourſed of that reconciliation which is wrought for us
<hi>betweene our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo the <hi>maine proportions</hi> of this parallel are theſe,
that as that reconciliation betweene Jew and Gentile,
wrought by Chriſt on the Croſſe, had two parts, 1. <hi>Poſitive,
making both one. 2. Privative,</hi> the amoveing the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that cauſed the enmity, v. 15. (the conſequent of
which is the <hi>creating</hi> of both into <hi>one new man:)</hi> So the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
diſcourſing, v. 16. of this other reconciliation with
God,<note place="margin">v. 14, 15.</note> he therein intends to make like two parts thereof, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to the other, onely with a tranſpoſition of ſpeech,
1. Poſitive, <hi>reconciliation to God</hi> in one body: 2. Privative,
<hi>Having ſlaine that enmity,</hi> namely, againſt God: The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of all which is, as if he had ſaid, Whereas there
was a double enmity, one <hi>to God,</hi> another <hi>among our ſelves;</hi>
Chriſt that is <hi>our peace</hi> hath dealt with both: He having
<hi>ſlaine the enmity betweene themſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>hath made both one:</hi>
And having <hi>ſlaine</hi> in like manner the <hi>enmity to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>hath
reconciled us unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that which cleares and confirmes this connexion
is,</p>
               <p>1. That this renders a more full and juſt analyſis of the
words, which is this: 1. That v. 14. He in generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes
Chriſt our peace. And then 2. In the next words
proceeds to the two particular branches, wherein Chriſt is
made our peace, 1. Betweene our ſelves mutually, 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
God and us. And then 3. In the handling of either,
obſerveth this parallel in either, namely, betweene a <hi>privo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
part, <hi>ſlaying the enmity;</hi> and a <hi>poſitive</hi> part, <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling</hi>
and making one, ſo enumerating the compleat requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites
to either.</p>
               <p>Then 2. To ſhew, that theſe are indeed two disjunct and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114819:5"/>
compleat diſcourſes of two ſuch heads of Reconciliation:
He ſevers the firſt, v. 15. from the ſecond, v. 16. by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a full period, and as it were a <hi>Selah</hi> to the firſt, thus
ſealing up the v. 15. <hi>So making peace,</hi> namely, fully and
compleatly, that peace, which had beene ſpoken of among
Jew and Gentile, that ſo he might enter anew, and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from <hi>this,</hi> upon that <hi>other</hi> of reconciling both unto God,
which he doth, v. 16.</p>
               <p>Then 3. For the cloſe of that 16. v. that he ſhould in
like manner bring in <hi>a ſecond time</hi> theſe words, <hi>[Having
ſlaine the enmity]</hi> upon occaſion of his mentioning our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
to God,</hi> argues ſtill more, his aime to be to cut
off the 16. v. from the 15. For if thoſe words, v. 16. <hi>That he
might reconcile us to God,</hi> had referred to that other <hi>[Having
ſlaine the enmity, v.</hi> 15.] as a part of that ſentence not made
compleat; then this ſecond <hi>[Having ſlaine the enmity]</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to have been: but doth rather ſhew, that there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
enmity betweene God and us, diſtinct from the former
intended by him; and ſo the ſlaying thereof, joyned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
and genuinely with its <hi>fellow conjugate,</hi> namely, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
unto God,</hi> as the former, v. 15. had in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
beene connected with <hi>its conjugate</hi> alſo, <hi>making both
one</hi> among themſelves. If indeed the Apoſtle had carried
his ſpeech in the 15. v. thus, <hi>Having aboliſht the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, that he might create one new man, and that he
might reconcile both unto God in one body,</hi> and ſo ended his
diſcourſe of it: then theſe <hi>two,</hi> in their reference could not
have beene parted: but he moreover adding to their <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
to God,</hi> a ſecond time theſe words, <hi>Having ſlain the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
(namely, that betweene God and us) he ſo maketh the
16. v. an entire ſentence and period of it ſelf, as the 14, and
15, doe make in like manner a full period of themſelves:
and ſo the 14, and 15, are to be read and joyned thus; <hi>Chriſt
hath made both</hi> (Jew and Gentile) one, <hi>having ſlain the enmity</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:114819:6"/>
(that was betweene them:) thus <hi>Beza</hi> and others: and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably
the 16. to this ſenſe, with an eaſy and faire tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<hi>And having ſlaine,</hi> Or, <hi>And hath ſlaine the enmity</hi>
(namely, betweene God and them) <hi>that he might reconcile
both unto God in one body by the Croſſe,</hi> on which he alſo ſlew
that enmity.</p>
               <p>And whereas it will be ſaid, That the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>(And)</hi>
which the 16. v. begins with, ſeemeth to caſt the reference
of this, upon the former <hi>ſlaying the enmity, v.</hi> 15. and ſo the
latter to be but an emphaticall repetition of the ſame: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
That <hi>that (and)</hi> v. 16. is but all one with <hi>moreover,</hi>
as it is often uſed, as introducing a new and diſtinct diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
added to a former.</p>
               <p>And ſo 4. As thus underſtood the parallel is rendred
yet more full; for as there is here found a <hi>double enmity,</hi>
and an anſwerable <hi>double ſlaying</hi> of each in order to a <hi>double
reconciliation,</hi> ſo to make up the parallel (which the Apoſtle
intended) yet the more full, there are <hi>two</hi> further <hi>clauſes
added</hi> to each, fitly anſwering to one another. For as of
the one he ſayes, Having <hi>aboliſht the enmity</hi> IN HIS
FLESH, <hi>v.</hi> 15. ſo of the other (the latter) in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he ſpeakes, having <hi>ſlaine that enmity</hi> IN HIM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SELFE,
<hi>v.</hi> 16. as the Greeke beares, and the margent
varies it.</p>
               <p>Now as to any difficulty propoſed, That which is left
as materiall to be conſidered, is onely this; How his having
ſlaine that enmity betweene us our ſelves firſt, ſhould be
conceived to be the <hi>antecedent</hi> to reconcile us to God?</p>
               <p>Now for anſwer hereunto; 1. Beſides, that according
to that connexion which I have given, that the 16. v. ſhould
thus make up a full period of it ſelfe, and doth keepe it ſelfe
intire within it ſelfe (as v. 14, and 15, alſo doe) and ſo not
at all referring <hi>to the ſlaying the enmity, v.</hi> 15. as hath beene
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114819:6"/>
explained; which coherence doth at once cut off the
whole of that objection at firſt made: But beſides this
(ſuppoſing it might take in, and referre to that ſlaying
<hi>the enmity v.</hi> 15. among the Saints, as the antecedent, or
at leaſt ingredient unto their reconciliation with God)
there may perhaps this juſt aſſoylment be given thereto.</p>
               <p>That 2. In order of nature, <hi>All enmity</hi> muſt firſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
removed, ere <hi>friendſhip</hi> or (as here) reconciliation,
can be ſuppoſed to be procured: the reaſon of which is
obvious to any judgement, <hi>firſt peace</hi> by ſlaying enmity,
and <hi>then good will.</hi> And ſo upon this and the like grounds,
theſe words, <hi>that he might reconcile unto God in one body,</hi>
may well be ſuppoſed to have a <hi>ſecondary aſpect</hi> to his <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt</hi> aboliſht the <hi>enmity</hi> between <hi>our ſelves,</hi> ver. 15. as
well as our <hi>enmity againſt God,</hi> ver. 16. And the Apoſtle
his adding [IN ONE BODY] (which he ſtudiouſly hath
done) ſhewes, that they being under that notion and
reſpect <hi>reconciled</hi> unto God by Chriſt upon the Croſſe;
that then withall at the <hi>ſame time,</hi> yea in <hi>order of nature,
firſt,</hi> their <hi>enmities one againſt another were removed</hi> as well
as againſt God himſelfe: <hi>All</hi> ſorts of <hi>Enmities</hi> being to
be removed ere <hi>Any</hi> ſort of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> attained, ſurely
under that notion, they cannot be conſidered reconciled
<hi>to God,</hi> but withall it muſt be ſaid, they are at peace,
and ſo made one <hi>among themſelves,</hi> at leaſt theſe two
doe mutually <hi>argue</hi> each the other. If indeed there had
beene roome left for us to conceive, that our reconciliation
with God had beene ſo wrought by Chriſt for us, as for
<hi>each perſon</hi> conſider'd <hi>onely ſingle,</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> (though even ſo
it was intended, namely for each and every perſon; and this
is involved in that other:) Then indeed it might have beene
ſuppoſed that their <hi>enmities to God,</hi> had been ſlain and done
<hi>firſt away,</hi> and reconciliation wrought with him firſt, by
one <hi>primary</hi> act, &amp; then after that, <hi>ex conſequenti,</hi> as a <hi>ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114819:7"/>
worke,</hi> our reconciliation amongſt our ſelves had been
caſt in, and followed thereupon; or which is all one,
wrought and procured by a ſecond act or intention of
Chriſts. But if <hi>in one and the ſame very individuall act,</hi>
and <hi>intention</hi> of their being <hi>reconciled to God,</hi> they were
conſidered [AS ONE BODY] and that this is put in
as an involved ingredient thereinto, ſo, you muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ſuppoſe <hi>their owne</hi> mutuall <hi>enmities</hi> done away alſo,
at leaſt together therewith, by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame individuall</hi>
act alſo; and <hi>this conſideration</hi> if there were no other, is a
ſufficient <hi>ſalvo</hi> to the forementioned <hi>difficulty.</hi> Now how
this reconciliation <hi>unto God in one Body</hi> was performed
by Chriſt on the Croſſe, I ſhall handle in the ſecond
<hi>Section</hi> of this diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall trouble you no further with untying this knot,
or the drawing out into one ſmooth continued line, the
ſeries of this coherence: For however (take the 16. <hi>ver.</hi>
in which of theſe ſenſes you pleaſe) the words in the 14. and
15. <hi>ver.</hi> are ſufficient bottome for the heads of that whole
diſcourſe I intend. For theſe words, <hi>ver.</hi> 14, 15. doe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably
(as all muſt confeſſe) treat of the <hi>reconciliation</hi>
of <hi>the people of God</hi> among themſelves, and ſufficiently
hold forth theſe <hi>two Generalls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The <hi>work of Chriſt on the Croſſe</hi> to procure it, <hi>He hath
made both one, having ſlaine the enmity in his fleſh:</hi> and
hath virtually (in the virtue of his death) broke downe the
partition wall that occaſioned it, which in his providence
he after ruined. And 2. <hi>the work of Chriſt</hi> by his <hi>ſpirit in
us, creating both one new man in himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now take the other words <hi>ver.</hi> 16. in either ſenſe,
or in both, (which are not inconſiſtent) however this is
obſervable even therein; that the Apoſtle was not content
to have ſetly purſued the Saints reconciliation among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114819:7"/>
in thoſe two whole verſes, the 14, 15. but when he

of any accurate diviſion of them, I ſhall onely draw forth
theſe <hi>four propoſitions,</hi> which will ſuck into themſelves the
ſtrength of what theſe words have in them, as to this great

               <p>1. The <hi>ſtory of the greatneſſe of that enmity,</hi> (the greateſt
that ever was,) betweene <hi>Jew and Gentile</hi> afore Chriſts
comming, and a while after, by reaſon of thoſe Jewiſh <hi>rites</hi>
and <hi>ordinances</hi> of the Ceremoniall Law, which the Apoſtle
by a <hi>Metonymie</hi> termeth therefore <hi>the enmity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>The ſtory of Chriſts tranſactions on the Croſse,</hi> by
which he <hi>virtually</hi> ſlew and aboliſht this enmity, and <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly</hi>
made them both one, and reconciled both in one
body.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>The ſtory of their actuall accord,</hi> and becomming one
as the records of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and they in their

by which, and the <hi>providences</hi> whereby, that partition <hi>wall</hi>
was <hi>broke downe,</hi> and the enmity allayed; chiefly by <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
both one New man in himſelfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That <hi>the inſtance of all this was intended by God as a</hi> PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CEDENT,

<hi>circumciſion</hi> was firſt given (for that began the quarrell)
reared up higher by <hi>Moſes rites,</hi> Further lengthned and
ſtretched out in all the times of the Prophets, throughout

it downe.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, an <hi>Univerſall</hi> hatred in the <hi>Jewes</hi> to <hi>all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

               <p>Thus God foreordained, that as to honour his Sonne in
reconciling us to himſelfe, he permits the greateſt ſins and
enmities to be in the hearts and lives of thoſe he intends to
ſave, againſt himſelfe: ſo likewiſe that the higheſt and
tougheſt animoſities ſhould be found, amongſt thoſe, (when

to ſhew the <hi>Soveraigne power,</hi> and <hi>efficacy of his media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in conſtituting them one <hi>new-man</hi> in himſelfe. Theſe
but in <hi>generall</hi> for a foundation out of the text.</p>
               <p>The ſtory of the <hi>Particulars</hi> of it hath <hi>two branches:</hi>
1. What <hi>it was betweene</hi> them <hi>before Chriſt,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of either to the Chriſtian faith. 2. What <hi>after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,</hi>
and that both equally had embraced Chriſt.</p>
               <p>1. Take the elevation of it <hi>before,</hi> both out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

                  <hi>Jew.</hi> And I ſhall withall by the way, make a <hi>parallel</hi> of the

               <p>1. Of <hi>the Jew againſt the Gentile.</hi> The quarrell was begun
indeed by them; they out of a carnall fleſhly boaſting of
their priviledge to be the onely people of God, (as they
were) ſcorned and contemned the poore Gentiles. The
11. verſe inſinuates this: <hi>Yea were Gentiles</hi> who <hi>are called
uncircumciſion by that</hi> (nation namely) <hi>which is called the
circumciſion in the fleſh.</hi> It began at Nicknames: and the
Jewes were they, that began to call names firſt, as interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have obſerved. And it began <hi>early,</hi> almoſt from the
time when the <hi>ſeed of Abraham</hi> firſt received <hi>that badge</hi> of
difference. You heare on't in <hi>Jacobs</hi> time, <hi>To give our ſiſter to

36. By <hi>Saul,</hi> Chap. 31. 4. They judging it, (though but a

<hi>uncircumciſed</hi> and <hi>uncleane</hi> are all one. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32. 1. When
they would accurſe one to the moſt accurſed <hi>death,</hi> (as all
Nations, according to what they have eſteemed the worſt
of Deaths, they have accordingly expreſſed ſuch like curſes;
As <hi>Abi in malam crucem,</hi> among the Romans) <hi>Let him dye</hi>
(ſaid the Jew) <hi>the death of the uncircumciſed,</hi> as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.
10. When they imprecated the moſt ignominious <hi>buriall,</hi>
Thou <hi>ſhalt lye in the midſt of the uncircumciſed,</hi> Ezek. 31. 18.
A perſon excommunicate, <hi>accurſed,</hi> and a <hi>heathen</hi> was to
them all one; <hi>Let him be as an heathen,</hi> Mat. 18. and they
diſtinguiſh themſelves from the Gentiles, by appropriating
the title of <hi>ſinners,</hi> wholly to the Gentiles; <hi>we that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114819:10"/>
are Jewes</hi> BY <hi>nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles,</hi>  Gal.
2. 15. and God foreſeeing how apt their ſpirits were to
grow from hence into an <hi>abhorrency</hi> of all other Nations,
made a ſpecall Law to prevent it, concerning ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Nations. Deut. 23. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not abhor an Edomite,
for he is thy brother: thou ſhalt not abhor an Egyptian, becauſe
thou waſt a ſtranger in his Land.</hi>

and this after the light of Chriſtianity appeared to them,
that they would have <hi>killed Paul,</hi> Acts 21. 31. for no other

the Bookes of the Prophets doe ſhew, eſpecially <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where the Cup is carried to all Nations for
no other crime then their enmity to the Jewes; likewiſe
the Bookes of <hi>Eſther</hi> and <hi>Ezra:</hi> and accordingly perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Emperours: and at laſt they deſtroyed both their City and

               <p>You have ſeene the enmities of both. And was there not

            <head type="sub">II. Head. What hath been done in the perſon of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
on the Croſſe, Virtually and Repreſentatively, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our reconciliation Mutuall. A two-fold reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>THis <hi>ſecond</hi> is to unfold the <hi>tranſactions</hi> by which

and procured this peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to make way for the diſtinct handling of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to this <hi>ſecond Head</hi> from what is to follow in the
<hi>third;</hi> And to ſever the one from the other, I deſire that in
the text this difference may be obſerved betweene <hi>the things</hi>
that Chriſt hath done for the effecting and accompliſhment
of that peace. 1. What was tranſacted and done ſimply
and <hi>abſtractly</hi> in his owne <hi>perſon alone,</hi> for the <hi>procurement</hi>
of it, <hi>On the Croſſe.</hi> 2. What he workes <hi>efficiently</hi> in <hi>us,</hi>

            <p>Onely for the clearing of this method, I ſhall deſire it
may be noticed, how evidently <hi>in the text,</hi> theſe <hi>two ſorts of
workings by Chriſt</hi> are diſtinguiſhed each from other, and
ranged there in the order I have propoſed them.</p>
            <p>Here is manifeſtly a <hi>double making</hi> of theſe <hi>twaine one:</hi>
1. The one expreſt in <hi>time paſt;</hi> the other as <hi>to come,</hi> and
to be perfected. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </gap>, <hi>having aboliſht,</hi> v. 15. in his owne fleſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally.
2. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>That he might make both one.</hi> The
firſt <hi>antecedent,</hi> and already done; the other <hi>conſequent,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114819:14"/>
to be accompliſht: the latter diſtinguiſht from the former,
as the <hi>conſequent</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> from its <hi>cauſe: He hath made
both one,</hi> THAT HE MIGHT <hi>create both one</hi> into
<hi>one new man;</hi> the influence and vertue of the firſt, bringing
about the latter. And 2. accordingly in the Originall, theſe
<hi>two</hi> are further <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> by words of a different import
(though our Tranſlation hath taken no notice of it, but hath
folded them up each, under one and the ſame word <hi>[ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
one]</hi> ſo making them one indeed; But) the firſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>making one,</hi> v. 14. is of a more <hi>large</hi> ſignification, and is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
and extendible to expreſſe (as here alſo it is intended)
a <hi>virtuall, influentiall making</hi> Us <hi>one</hi> in his own <hi>perſon,</hi> afore
we are made one in <hi>our ſelves.</hi> The latter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (more <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive)</hi> properly and ſtrictly ſignifies <hi>Creation,</hi> [CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING
<hi>both one]</hi> or making both one by a new creation:
And therefore [IN ONE NEW MAN,] is added as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of this <hi>ſecond kind of making:</hi> and this imports a <hi>phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
efficiency,</hi> and working <hi>upon us;</hi> a moulding and forming
<hi>us,</hi> by <hi>creation,</hi> into this oneneſſe among our ſelves, although
the mould in which this latter is wrought and caſt, is his
perſon alſo, <hi>[in himſelfe:]</hi> Yet not <hi>in himſelfe,</hi> conſidered
<hi>perſonally</hi> and <hi>alone,</hi> but as uniting us <hi>to himſelfe,</hi> and ſo
working upon us <hi>concretely</hi> through in and by himſelfe. And
therefore 3. they differ, the firſt being performed <hi>in himſelfe
ſingly,</hi> perſonally when he was in this world, and eſpecially
<hi>on the Croſſe,</hi> and is therefore expreſt as paſt, <hi>Hath made one,</hi>
as a buſineſſe <hi>done,</hi> and <hi>perfected</hi> already, as much (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſuch a way making one) as ever it ſhall be. The other
to be effected <hi>afterwards</hi> in <hi>us,</hi> in our ſeverall ages, and by
degrees, as the <hi>new Creature</hi> is: that he might <hi>create of two,
one new man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To illuſtrate the difference of theſe two <hi>makings one,</hi> but
in one parallel inſtance (although the like <hi>duplicate</hi> is found,
and diſtinction holds in all kind of works done in us, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114819:14"/>
for us by Chriſt:) becauſe it is the next akin to this. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
is that of <hi>Reconciliation or making peace betweene God
and the Saints.</hi> Theſe two workes, as they are the neereſt
twins of all other done for us by Chriſt: ſo are they, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
exactly parallel and alike. Now unto the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our <hi>reconciliation with God, a double reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is neceſſary: The one wrought <hi>out of us,</hi> in Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for us; <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world:</hi> The
other <hi>in us; We beſeech you to be reconciled to God,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.
19, 20. The like holds in this <hi>our Reconciliation Mutuall.</hi>
Or to ſet the likeneſſe of theſe <hi>Gemelli</hi> to your view
in another glaſſe (that is, another Scripture) that gives
forth the neerneſſe of the reſemblance of this ſort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,
in <hi>parallel words and lines,</hi> to thoſe in the text,
it is, 1 Coloſſ. 20. He ſayes firſt, <hi>Chriſt having made peace by
the bloud of his Croſſe, to reconcile all to himſelfe;</hi> this is a work
already done, and done FOR ALL, at once, <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi>
and <hi>repreſentatively,</hi> as there it followes. <hi>[In the body
of his fleſh through death,</hi> v. 22.] After which he ſpeakes of
<hi>another reconciliation</hi> of us, wrought <hi>in us, towards God too,</hi> in
theſe words, <hi>And you that were enemies hath he</hi> NOVV <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled.</hi>
This latter therefore wrought ſince, and after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
was perfected, as the effect of it. The very ſame or like
here you have expreſſed of that <hi>reconciliation</hi> or making one
of the <hi>Saints mutually,</hi> which we have in hand. 1. <hi>He hath
made both one,</hi> v. 14. <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> v. 15. <hi>in one body</hi> by <hi>the
Croſſe,</hi> v. 16. thus <hi>meritoriouſly</hi> and <hi>repreſentatively. 2. That
he might create of twaine in one new man,</hi> ſo <hi>efficiently:</hi> Both
muſt goe in their ſeverall ſeaſons and ſucceſſions to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
thereof, or there would not be peace. I have given
you the grounds for theſe generall heads out of the text;
I come to ſuch particular branches of each, as into which the
text alſo ſpreads it ſelfe, and is a roote unto them.</p>

               <head>1 SECTION. Two Branches of what Chriſt did in his own perſon, On the
Croſſe, to reconcile the Saints. 1. By way of ſacrifice,
and taking on him their enmities. 2. Of repreſentation, [in

               <p>THat which is <hi>proper</hi> (as was ſaid) to this PART, is,
<hi>What hath beene done in Chriſts own perſon.</hi> The
particulars hereof are two, which I find in the text,
(to the materialls of which I confine my ſelfe, and ſhall
take them in that order in which they lye:) 1. <hi>By way of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
having taken on him before God the enmities of
both againſt each other, and ſo offering up <hi>his fleſh</hi> as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for both. The 2. By a <hi>voluntary aſſuming</hi> and <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering</hi>
the <hi>perſons of all the Elect into one</hi> BODY in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
he repreſenting and ſuſtaining their perſons, and ſo <hi>[in
one body] reconciling them unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both are <hi>expreſſely</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly</hi> mentioned: The <hi>firſt</hi>
in theſe words, <hi>Having aboliſht the enmity</hi> (namely, between
them) <hi>in his fleſh:</hi> which fleſh, taking on him their enmities,
was made a ſacrifice on the Croſſe, therefore v. 16. <hi>By the
Croſſe</hi> is added. The <hi>ſecond</hi> in theſe words, <hi>That he might
reconcile both to God in one body:</hi> and though both theſe
were performed at once, and by one individuall act, yet
that act is to be lookt at, as having theſe two diſtinct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
concurring in it. And the firſt in order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
making way for the ſecond, as in opening the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
of v. 15, and 16. I have already ſhewed; I muſt
handle them therefore each apart.</p>
               <p>How Chriſts offering himſelfe up as <hi>a ſacrifice</hi> to God,
and his ſtanding as a common perſon in our ſtead <hi>before
God,</hi> ſhould aboliſh all our <hi>enmities againſt God himſelfe,</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:114819:15"/>
and <hi>reconcile us unto him,</hi> This is ordinarily and generally
apprehended, and were <hi>proper</hi> to ſpeake of, if our <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
to God himſelfe</hi> had beene the theme ſet out to be
treated of: But how <hi>theſe very ſame acts and tranſactions of

to be eyed as the <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>proper levell</hi> of what doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue:

                  <head>1. Branch. Two things to explicate the firſt Branch. 1. That

                  <p>TWo things are diſtinctly to be ſpoken unto for the
clearing of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>1. That the offering up Chriſts fleſh on the Croſſe,
was intended as a ſacrifice, as well for our reconciliation mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
as for reconciliation with God.</p>
                  <p>2. How according to the <hi>analogy of the ends,</hi> uſe, and
intent of <hi>ſacrifices of old,</hi> the <hi>offering up of Chriſts fleſh</hi> ſhould
be intended and directed as <hi>a ſacrifice,</hi> to take away theſe

                     </gap> of this point, That <hi>as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
it was ſo intended,</hi> the whole frame and contexture
of theſe words doth evince it.</p>
                  <p>1. When he ſayes v. 15. <hi>That he hath aboliſht the enmity
in his fleſh,</hi> he doth undeniably intend that enmity which
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114819:16"/>
was betweene theſe <hi>twaine,</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> (this
hath beene proved afore:) and therefore he is found par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to inſtance in the <hi>rites of the ceremoniall Law,</hi>
(which by a metonymie he calls <hi>the enmity,)</hi> as the outward
occaſion of that bitter enmity in each others hearts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now then 2. That</hi> this enmity was taken away by his fleſh
as a ſacrifice;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The laying together the <hi>phraſes</hi> of the Text, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
it; as when he ſayes, <hi>He hath aboliſht this enmity in his
fleſh.</hi> 1. In ſaying <hi>the enmity in his fleſh,</hi> it neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
<hi>his having taken that enmity in or upon his owne fleſh,</hi>
to anſwer for it in their ſtead. Even as well, as when in the
16. verſe, he is ſaid <hi>to have ſlaine the enmity</hi> (namely, againſt
God) <hi>in himſelfe;</hi> thereby is intended, that he <hi>tooke that
enmity on himſelfe;</hi> undertaking to pacify and allay, and
by being <hi>himſelfe ſlaine,</hi> to <hi>ſlay</hi> it. 2. In ſaying in the time
paſt, that <hi>he hath aboliſht it,</hi> in his fleſh, this notes out a <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi>
act <hi>perfectly done</hi> and paſt, <hi>(as in him:)</hi> by vertue of
which it is to be deſtroyed actually in us after. Unto which
3. adde that in the 16. v. there is an additionall word <hi>[By
the Croſſe]</hi> put in, which <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or in common, is to
be referrd to the <hi>aboliſhing of this enmity</hi> in his fleſh, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and
reconciling us mutually; as well as to the ſlaying of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
againſt God mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 16. as that which equally
and alike ſhewes the way, how, we are to underſtand that <hi>in
his fleſh,</hi> he hath perfectly <hi>aboliſht</hi> both theſe enmities; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by taking <hi>on his fleſh</hi> that enmity, and offering it up upon
the Croſſe as a ſacrifice for it. For to ſay, <hi>by the Croſſe,</hi> or
<hi>by the ſacrifice of himſelfe on the Croſſe,</hi> is all one: ſo as
what the one verſe wants, the other ſupplies: <hi>In his fleſh,</hi>
ſayes the 15. v. <hi>By the Croſſe,</hi> ſayes the 16. and (which will
warrant this) we have elſwhere both put together, 1 Coloſſ.
20, 22. <hi>By the bloud of his Croſſe, in the body of his fleſh, through
death.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:114819:16"/>
2. The paralleling this place with that of the 2 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi>
argues this: The <hi>enmity</hi> here inſtanced in, by a metonymie
is the <hi>rites of the ceremoniall Law:</hi> which he is ſayd to have
<hi>made voyd or weake.</hi> Thus expreſſely <hi>v. 15. Having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſht
in his fleſh the enmity, the Law of Commandements
in Ordinances:</hi> Now the aboliſhing thereof is in that <hi>ſecond</hi>
to the <hi>Coloſsians</hi> expreſſely ſaid to have beene by the
ſacrifice of His Fleſh on the Croſſe: or which is all one,
That, by His being nayled to the Croſſe, He nayled it to
His Croſſe, <hi>Coloſs. 2. 14. Blotting out the hand-writing of
Ordinances that was againſt us, and tooke it out of the way,</hi>
NAYLING IT TO HIS CROSSE, which fully
accords with this Text, <hi>He aboliſht it in his Fleſh by the Croſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, (for a winding up of this) The parallel which
the Apoſtle obſerveth in his Diſcourſe betweene his effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Peace and Reconciliation with God, and this our
Peace and Reconciliation one with another, will induce to
it: He being firſt alike in common termed <hi>our peace.</hi> v. 14.
in reſpect to either. Then to demonſtrate each apart,
a double enmity (as I obſerved at firſt) is diſtinctly
and apart mentioned by him. The one <hi>v.</hi> 15. the other <hi>v.</hi>
16. Of the one he ſayes, he hath <hi>aboliſht:</hi> of the other, hee
hath <hi>ſlaine</hi> it: of the one he ſayes, <hi>he hath aboliſht it in His
Fleſh:</hi> of the other, <hi>in himſelfe</hi> (as the Greeke hath it <hi>v.</hi>
16.) And ſo thoſe words <hi>by the Croſſe</hi> are common to each:
As thoſe firſt words, <hi>[He is our Peace]</hi> were to all that
followed. And ſo as the Parallel hath hitherto run along in
theſe particulars, ſo it holds on, that looke How in this, or
by what way <hi>He ſlew the enmity</hi> betwixt God and us, <hi>on the
Croſſe,</hi> by <hi>the ſame way he</hi> aboliſht the enmity betweene the
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> or the people of God mutually: But he ſlew
the enmity betweene God and us, <hi>on the Croſſe</hi> by <hi>taking
thoſe our enmities</hi> againſt God <hi>on Himſelfe,</hi> and they being
found on him, he was ſlaine and ſacrificed for them on the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114819:17"/>
Croſſe, and thereby ſlew them and reconciled us to God:
In like manner then it is to be underſtood, that HE <hi>firſt
tooke</hi> all our <hi>enmities againſt one another</hi> on His Fleſh [in
His Fleſh] ſayes the Text: (and it was the generall intent of
Sacrifices to be offred up, for what was layd upon them or
reckoned to them.) And ſo, our enmities being there all
found in <hi>His Fleſh,</hi> that Fleſh was offred up for them, and ſo
they were all <hi>diſſolved</hi> and <hi>aboliſht and made weak,</hi> as the Text
ſpeaks of them, in his being <hi>diſſolved</hi> or <hi>made weake</hi> (as the
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. ſpeakes in like manner of him.)</p>
                  <p>So then as there was a <hi>double enmity,</hi> and a <hi>double ſlaying</hi>
which the Apoſtle mentions; ſo there muſt be in this one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
a <hi>double conſideration</hi> in the intention thereof: It is a
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſerving at <hi>once,</hi> to <hi>ſlay</hi> &amp; aboliſh <hi>both the one and the
other:</hi> he being in common alike and indifferently termed,
<hi>Our peace,</hi> as in relation unto either; there being nothing
alſo done for us by Chriſt, but the like was firſt done on
Himſelfe.</p>

(of which <hi>latter,</hi> namely, that <hi>by eating together,</hi> friendſhip
was ſealed,<note place="margin">Liquet quod apud Iſrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas faedera partim epu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis partim Sacrificiis inita fuiſſe &amp; ſancita. <hi>Vide Rivet in Gen. 31. Exercit.</hi> 135.</note> we ſhall have further uſe anon to confirme
and explicate this very Notion in hand.) I ſay <hi>leagues of
peace and friendſhip were uſed to be ratifyed by Sacrifices</hi>
ſolemnly <hi>afore God:</hi> ſo to make ſuch Covenants, <hi>a matter
of Religion</hi> (to bind the ſtronglier:) and not to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the obligations of <hi>humane faith and honeſty:</hi> even by
this, that men did finde them ratifyed in the preſence of
<hi>a Deity;</hi> which they worſhipt as their God, by ſo ſolemne
and <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Action;</hi> which did withall invocate from
<hi>God a curſe</hi> upon the infringers of that peace and friendſhip
made thereby. This to have beene their uſe, I am to
cleare.</p>
                  <p>We may conſider that though all Sacrifices were offred
up <hi>afore</hi> and <hi>unto God,</hi> yet not all onely by way <hi>of expiation,</hi>
or <hi>atonement</hi> made <hi>unto God,</hi> or as expreſſions of <hi>thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>
unto him: but ſome were Sacrifices of <hi>pacification,</hi>
and <hi>faederall</hi> in their intention, betweene Man and Man,
being offred up <hi>before God as a witneſſe</hi> and avenger. This
to have been one uſe of Sacrifices is evident both among
Jewes, and likewiſe Gentiles (who were in their Sacrifices
and the rites thereof imitators of the Jews.)</p>
                  <p>1. The <hi>Jewes. Jer.</hi> 34. from <hi>v.</hi> 8. &amp;c. we reade, That
<hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King made a ſolemne Covenant <hi>with the
people,</hi> and they <hi>with their ſervants</hi> to let them goe free
according to Gods Law in that behalf made <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 1. and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114819:18"/>
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 12. and this Sacrificiall Covenant was ſolemnely
performed in <hi>Gods Houſe,</hi> and <hi>before God,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 15. and 18.
The rites of it were, <hi>They cut a Calfe in twaine, and paſſed
betweene the parts of the Calfe, even the Princes and all the
people, v.</hi> 19. in token that it was one common Sacrifice
between All thoſe parties, Maſters and Servants, and the
joint act of each, which being thus ſolemne, <hi>afore God,</hi>
carried with it an implicit or tacit execration, That if either
brake this Covenant in this manner confirmed, <hi>then let God
ſo deale with them,</hi> as this Calfe ſacrificed was dealt withall:
and therefore theſe having broken this Covenant, <hi>v.</hi> 11.
(which breach of Faith was the occaſion of this part of
<hi>Jeremies</hi> meſſage to them) God threatens to bring the curſe
invocated and ſignified by that rite, upon them, and to reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate
the like unto them <hi>v. 18. I will</hi> GIVE <hi>the men that have
tranſgreſſed</hi> MY COVENANT ſo he calls it, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it was his command, and it had been ratified before
him, as it followes:) <hi>which have not performed the words of
the</hi> COVENANT <hi>which they had made</hi> BEFORE ME,
<hi>when they cut the Calfe in twain, and paſſed betweene the parts
thereof. That,</hi> therefore <hi>[I will give,]</hi> it is <hi>verbum ſimilitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
(as 'tis often uſed:) whoſe meaning is, I will make them
as that Calfe, <hi>I will anſwerably deale with them:</hi> and ſo
it is explained; <hi>I will give them into the hands of them that
ſeeke their life,</hi> and expoſe them to the Sword of the ſlayer,
to ſlay at his pleaſure, as you have done this beaſt, which you
Sacrificed: <hi>and their dead bodies ſhall be for meate to the fowls

                  <p>The like intendment of Sacrifices with the ſame rite,

ſtrucken between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> other the <hi>elect</hi>
of God, who ſhould be <hi>at variance</hi> in any Age; and <hi>Chriſt</hi>
having interpoſed himſelfe as a <hi>Mediatour</hi> for us to God,
he did with all undertake to be an <hi>Arbiter</hi> betweene them,
(and us all) among Our ſelves, for all Our differences
alſo: and he offred up his Fleſh as one common Sacrifice
upon the Croſſe, at once to be <hi>expiatory,</hi> to God, to blot
out the ſinnes and enmities of ours againſt God Himſelfe:
So alſo <hi>pacificatory</hi> betweene <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Man, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,</hi>
and all other the elect: and therein anſwering to, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114819:19"/>
fulfilling one true end and intendment of Sacrifices, as well
as in the other of making atonement to God. And the
Text you ſee having ſaid firſt, that hee is made <hi>our Peace,
in making both One, verſ.</hi> 14. and then pointing us to his
Fleſh, as <hi>(in)</hi> which he bore their enmities, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. and
then carrying us <hi>to the Croſſe, verſ.</hi> 16. it evidently (as was
ſaid,) argues, That Hee was made our Peace, by being
thus made <hi>a pacificatory Sacrifice,</hi> for <hi>both.</hi> And ſurely
(if there were no other reaſon to confirme it,) all Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in all their ends and uſes having beene but <hi>ſhadowes</hi> of
this, and <hi>His Fleſh</hi> and the Sacrificing it being the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
this eminent Sacrifice of his muſt needs be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
(as ſuch,) to have the <hi>Perfection, Uſe</hi> and <hi>Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
that all other Sacrifices could any way be ſuppoſed
ſubſervient unto, or it had not beene the complete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of them; Eſpecially there being <hi>this need</hi> of having
His Sacrifice directed to <hi>this end,</hi> as well as <hi>to that other,</hi>
there falling out ſo great animoſities among thoſe that
were members of Him; which as it <hi>call'd</hi> for a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to bee offred up to allay and deſtroy them: ſo
CHRIST in Sacrificing Himſelfe would <hi>not leave</hi>
out, or loſe this part of His Glory and Perfection in this
reſpect.</p>
                  <p>Hence accordingly, as here He is termed <hi>our Peace;</hi>
ſo elſewhere the <hi>Covenant of the People,</hi> and both in the
like latitude of ſenſe and meaning. When here He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>our Peace,</hi> the meaning extends not onely to His being
our Peace betweene God and us; but betweene our ſelves
alſo: ſo when Hee is called <hi>the Covenant of the People,</hi> it
intends not onely His being a Covenant <hi>unto God for us,</hi>
but a Covenant <hi>afore God</hi> OF US; or (as there 'tis expreſſed)
<hi>of the People</hi> of God, namely among themſelves. Hee is
<hi>twice</hi> ſo called, and with much evidence, as to this ſenſe:
<hi>Iſai. 4 2. 6. I will give thee for a Covenant of the People,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:114819:19"/>
that is, (ſayes <hi>Sanctius,)</hi> to the <hi>Jew,</hi> and <hi>for a light of

that is, to this end, to ſettle in peace the <hi>whole Earth,</hi> both
<hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> ſo then a Covenant of the People (as you

as well as <hi>good will toward men</hi> from God in Heaven, being
the foote of that Song was ſung at His Birth, and the ſum

and this Sacrifice of Chriſts as offred up for our mutuall
enmities: and how This end and intention of Chriſts Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
is held forth in the Lords Supper.</head>
               <p>NOw obſerve further, A correſpondency unto thoſe
rites mentioned, that were uſed in thoſe Sacrifices of
peace, alſo held forth in this Sacrifice of His. The Beaſt in
ſuch caſes was <hi>divided</hi> and <hi>cut in</hi> twain for both parties to
paſſe through, and ſo peace to be made between them. And
<hi>Chriſt</hi> to make <hi>both,</hi> or, <hi>twain one</hi> (as here,) was <hi>divided</hi>
and cut (as it were) in twain: The <hi>Godhead</hi> for a time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
the <hi>manhood,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
me?</hi> His Soule alſo being by Death ſeparated from
His Body; his <hi>joynts looſned,</hi> to diſſolve this enmity; the
<hi>vaile of His Fleſh</hi> rent, to rend the partition wall. Thus
He was cut in twain as <hi>one common</hi> Sacrifice, between
both.</p>
               <p>And againe as the ſacrificing of the beaſt cut a ſunder
was reckoned the <hi>common joynt Act</hi> of both parties in ſuch
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114819:20"/>
a caſe, and they were eſteemed by God, and by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>each</hi> to have an hand in the ſacrificing of it, and
as <hi>conſenting to the Covenant</hi> and peace that was intended
to be entred into and ratified by it: ſo here in this. And
though we then perſonally exiſted not, yet all <hi>we</hi> being
conſidered <hi>in Him,</hi> by God, (who gave us to Him;) and by
Himſelfe, that voluntarily ſuſtained our perſons, and He
offering up Himſelfe as a Sacrifice on our behalfe, and for
our behoofe and in our names; Hence His <hi>Will</hi> in offring
up Himſelfe, was <hi>volunt as totius,</hi> the act and will of the
whole body, whoſe perſons He ſuſtayned; our wills were
thereby involved in His will; His act was our act: and it
may truly be ſaid, that a Covenant of peace was then made
afore God, BY US, and <hi>for us:</hi> for He was <hi>our Prieſt</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
for us, as well as our <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hence in a further correſpondency to the manner
of thoſe typicall Sacrifices: Therein although the Prieſt
onely offred up the Sacrifice for the People, and in their
name and ſtead, yet to ſhew it was their act, they uſed
to <hi>eate of it</hi> after, or <hi>of that which was offred up with it.</hi>
The interpretation of which eating thereof, by the People,
the Apoſtle gives us to be this, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 18. They that
did eate of the Sacrifices were partakers of the Altar:</hi> that
is, thereby they declared the Sacrifice to be theirs, the
offering it up to be their Act, that they partook,
and had an hand in it, as if they had been <hi>at the Altar</hi> with
the Prieſt himſelfe. Juſt in like manner, to ſhew that we
were reckoned conſenting to, and partakers in this ſacrifice
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Prieſt, and that it was our own act, <hi>we doe
in like manner partake of that Sacrifice by eating of it;</hi>
The <hi>Lords Supper</hi> being as <hi>Tertullian</hi> rightly termed it,
<hi>Participatio Sacrificii,</hi> which Notion the Apoſtle there
confirmes in a parallel of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> in this very reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
to the caſe of thoſe Sacrifices then (for unto this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114819:20"/>
purpoſe it was that he brings in that inſtance of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
<hi>v.</hi> 16.) <hi>The bread which we breake,</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>is it not
the communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> namely conſidered, as <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed</hi>
once upon the altar of the Croſſe, and ſo <hi>by eating
thereof, we are all partakers of that one bread,</hi> as the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying;
and of that <hi>one body</hi> ſacrificed, as the thing ſignified:
and ſo by this way of partaking therein, namely, by eating
thereof, is ſhewn, as in the ſacrifices of old, <hi>that it is our
owne ſacrifice.</hi> And this not onely as<note n="a" place="margin">Edendo cenſebantur, ipſius ſacrificii tanquam pro ipſis oblati fieri par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipes. <hi>Eſt. in loc.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>Eſtius</hi> upon the place, who ſayes, <hi>That by eating
they were accounted partakers of the ſacrifice, as
that which was offered for them:</hi> But further as
<note n="b" place="margin">Chriſtus vult in ſe credentes participes fieri ejus ſacrificii, plane, quaſi ipſi hoc ſacrificium ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuliſſent, quia oblatum ab eo qui naturam eorum ſuſceperat.</note> 
                  <hi>Grotius,</hi> (ſpeaking of the Lords Supper, upon
<hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 25.) <hi>They are in Chriſts intent,</hi> ſayes he,
through their eating thereof, So <hi>partakers of this
his ſacrifice,</hi> quaſi ipſi hoc obtuliſſent, <hi>as if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
had offered it up.</hi> And thus to hold forth
this previous conſent of theirs, was one part of
Chriſts intent in inſtituting eating and drinking in the Lords
Supper, in a correſpondency to the like myſterious intent in
the peoples eating of the ſacrifices of old: <hi>Grotius</hi> indeed puts
the reaſon, why it is to be eſteemed, as if we had offered up
that ſacrifice, onely upon this, <hi>becauſe it was offered up by him</hi>
(ſayes he) <hi>that had taken their nature:</hi> but I adde out of
this text, <hi>becauſe he had tooke on him their perſons, in One
Body,</hi> and <hi>their enmities,</hi> and <hi>ſtood in their ſtead,</hi> as their
<hi>Prieſt,</hi> as well as their <hi>ſacrifice:</hi> and ſo it was to be reckond
their act on his Croſſe, as much as the peoples then, who
uſed to bring the ſacrifice to the Prieſt, who, there, offered it
alone upon the Altar; whereas here WE (our ſelves) <hi>were
brought</hi> to Chriſt by the Father to undertake to be a Prieſt
for Us, and he voluntarily undertooke Our perſons. And
ſo, as <hi>Levi</hi> is accounted to have offered tithes in <hi>Abraham</hi>
his Father, when he paid them to <hi>Melchiſedech;</hi> ſo we much
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114819:21"/>
rather to have offered up a common ſacrifice of peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
our ſelves, when Chriſt offered up himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And hence alſo likewiſe, as in thoſe pacificatory foederall
ſacrifices between two parties of men, whoever of them
went about to violate or infringe the tearmes of peace, that
ſacrifice was intended to confirme, did (by reaſon it was
his act) bring upon himſelfe the curſe, which ceremonially
and viſibly was inflicted on the beaſt or ſacrifice ſlaine:
ſo here this act of ſacrificing of Chriſt for mutuall peace
being thus <hi>interpretativè</hi> OURS, and our conſent involved,
Hence I ſay in like manner, whoever goeth about to breake
this Covenant, and ſeeketh to uphold the enmity among
the people of God, he doth not onely renounce his owne
act, but what in him lies, fruſtrates that intention of it;
and ſo further incurres the imprecation infolded in it, and
brings upon himſelfe <hi>the bloud of the Covenant,</hi> as in alluſion
to this curſe (according to the implyed intent of ſuch a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificiall
Covenant) the Apoſtle ſpeakes <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>Now further to finiſh this Branch, let this be added; That
Chriſt was not ſimply offered up as a ſacrifice to confirme
a meere or bare <hi>league of peace</hi> and amity betweene us:
(ſometimes ſuch ſacrifices afore ſpoken of were deſigned
onely to make and bind new Leagues and Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
ſuch parties, as never had beene at variance:) But
here in this caſe of ours, as there was a Covenant of <hi>amity</hi>
to be ſtrucke, ſo there were <hi>enmities to be aboliſht</hi> and <hi>ſlaine,</hi>
as the text hath it; and that by this ſacrifice and ſlaying
of his fleſh: which cannot be conceived otherwiſe to have
beene tranſacted, but that as in other ſacrifices offered up,
the treſpaſſes were laid upon the head of the ſacrifice, and
ſo in a ſignificant myſtery ſlaine and done away in the death
of the thing ſacrificed: And that as in <hi>that</hi> other way of
reconciling us to God, <hi>The Lord did lay upon him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
of us all,</hi> namely, againſt himſelfe (as <hi>Iſay</hi> ſpeakes in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114819:21"/>
alluſion unto the rites (and the ſignification therof, in thoſe
ſacrifices:) to which this text ſimularly ſpeakes when it
ſaies, <hi>He ſlew the enmity in himſelfe,</hi> v. 16.) So anſwerably
it was in this (which is its parallel:) All the enmities and
mutuall injuries and feuds between us the people of God,
were all laid upon him, and he tooke them <hi>in his fleſh,</hi> and
in ſlaying thereof ſlew theſe alſo, and <hi>aboliſht</hi> them, that ſo
he might <hi>reconcile them in one body.</hi> And ſo the ſame nailes
that pierced through his hands and feet, did naile all our
enmities, and the cauſes and occaſions of them, to the ſame
Croſſe, as 2 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> inſinuates. So as, we are to looke upon
Jeſus Chriſt hanging on the Croſſe, as an equall Arbiter
betweene both parties, that takes upon himſelfe whatever
either partie hath againſt the other. Lo here I hang (ſaies
Chriſt a dying) and let the <hi>reproaches</hi> wherewith you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
each other <hi>fall on me:</hi> The ſting of them all fix it
ſelfe on my fleſh; and in my death dye all together with
me; lo I dye to pacific both: Have therefore any of you
ought againſt each other? Quit them, and take me as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
in bloud betweene you; onely doe not kill me, and
each other too, for the ſame offence: for you, and your
enmities, have brought me to this altar of the Croſſe, and
I offer my ſelfe as your peace, and as your Prieſt: will you
kill me firſt, and then one another too?</p>
               <p>And thus, if taking all your ſinnes againſt God himſelfe
upon his fleſh, and ſacrificing it for you, is of prevalency
to kill, and ſlay <hi>that enmity;</hi> much more is it of force to kill
theſe your enmities alſo. Thus, like as by aſſuming
<hi>the likeneſſe of ſinfull fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>he killed the ſinne in our fleſh:</hi> ſo by
taking theſe our enmities and animoſities in his fleſh, he
ſlew and aboliſht them:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> and as his death was the <hi>death of
death,</hi> ſo of theſe. And like as he cured diſeaſes by taking
them on himſelfe by ſympathy, 'tis ſaid of him when his
healing of them is recorded) <hi>Himſelfe tooke our infirmities,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114819:22"/>
and bare our ſickneſſes:</hi> And as not our ſinnes againſt
God onely, but our ſickneſſes by ſympathy: ſo, not our
enmities againſt God onely, but our animoſities one againſt
another; and by bearing them aboliſht them; by dying as
an Arbiter betweene us, ſlew them: and therefore in the
text, he is called <hi>our peace,</hi> not <hi>our peacemaker</hi> onely, (when
this peace amongſt our ſelves is ſpoken of,) to note out, as
<hi>Muſculus</hi> obſerves, that he was not onely efficiently <hi>our
peacemaker,</hi> the Author of our peace, but <hi>our peace materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi>
the matter of our peace, by the ſacrifice of himſelfe.
God is ſtiled <hi>our peacemaker,</hi> our reconciler; <hi>God was in
Chriſt reconciling the world:</hi> but <hi>not</hi> our <hi>peace;</hi> this is
proper to Chriſt: and why? but becauſe he onely was the
ſacrifice of our peace, and bore our enmities. Even as he is
not only called <hi>the Redeemer,</hi> (ſo God alſo is,) but <hi>redemption</hi>
it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now for a <hi>coronis</hi> to this firſt <hi>Branch,</hi> and withall to
adde a further confirmation yet, that Chriſts death was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as a ſacrifice to theſe ends, for amity and unity
among Gods people, we may clearly view and behold this
truth in the Mirrour of the Lords Supper. One moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
and primary import whereof, and end of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, being this very thing in hand: (I ſhall have recourſe

that now.)</p>
               <p>The Lords Supper in its full and proper ſcope, is, as you
know, a ſolemne commemoration of Chriſts death offered
up upon the Croſſe, or if you will, in the Apoſtles owne
words, it is <hi>a ſhewing forth his death till he comes:</hi> And <hi>doe
this</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>in remembrance of me;</hi> namely, in dying
for you: and ſo withall to commemorate with application
to themſelves, the principall <hi>ends</hi> and <hi>intendments</hi> of that
his death, which is therein acted over afore their eyes. Hence
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114819:22"/>
therefore I take <hi>this</hi> as an undoubted maxime, which no
knowing Chriſtian will deny (and its the foundation of
what I am now a building:) <hi>That looke what principall ends,
purpoſes or intendments this Supper or ſacrificiall feaſt holds
forth in its inſtitution unto us: thoſe muſt needs be lookt at, by
all Chriſtians, in the like proportion, to have been the maine ends
and purpoſes of his death to be remembred.</hi> So that we may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
mutually from what were the ends of Chriſts death, unto
what muſt needs be the deſigned intendments of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And <hi>we may</hi> as certainly <hi>conclude,</hi> and inferre to our
ſelves, <hi>what were the intendments of his death, by what are the
genuine ends of that Sacrament.</hi> Theſe anſwer each to other,
as the image in the glaſſe doth to the principall lineaments
in the face; the impreſſe on the wax, to that in the ſcale;
the action, the ſigne and remembrances, to the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and to be remembred.</p>
               <p>Now it is evident that Chriſt upon his death inſtituted
that Supper, <hi>As,</hi> to be a ſeale of that Covenant of Grace
<hi>betweene God and us,</hi> ratified thereby; <hi>ſo,</hi> alſo to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
the higheſt <hi>outward pledge,</hi> ratification and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<hi>of love and amity among his members themſelves.</hi>
And accordingly, it being in the common nature of it, <hi>a
feaſt:</hi> looke as betweene God and us, it was ordained to
be <hi>epulum foederale,</hi> a Covenant feaſt betweene him and
us: (the evidence whereof lyes in this, That <hi>he</hi> invites
us to <hi>his table as friends,</hi> and as thoſe he is at peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and reconciled unto:) So, in like manner betweene
<hi>the Saints themſelves,</hi> it was as evidently, ordained to be
a <hi>Syntaxis,</hi> a <hi>love feaſt,</hi> in that they <hi>eate and drinke together
at one and the ſame table,</hi> and ſo become as the Apoſtle
ſaies, ONE BREAD. And againe, looke as <hi>betweene
God and us,</hi> to ſhew that the procurement of this peace
and reconciliation betweene him and us, was this very
<hi>ſacrifice of Chriſts death,</hi> (as that which made our peace,)
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114819:23"/>
God therefore <hi>invites us,</hi> poſt ſacrificium oblatum, <hi>after
the ſacrifice offered up, to eate of the ſymboles of it;</hi> that is,
of Bread and Wine, which are the ſignes and ſymboles
of his body and bloud ſacrificed for peace: So in like
manner doth this hold as to <hi>the peace betweene our ſelves:</hi>
And we may infer, that we were through the offering up
thereof, reconciled one to another, and all mutuall enmities
ſlaine and done away thereby, <hi>in that we eate together</hi>
thereof in a communion; which was a ſacrifice <hi>once offered,
but now feaſted</hi> upon together: And doth <hi>ſhew,</hi> that Chriſtians
of all profeſſions or relations of men have the ſtrongeſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations
unto mutuall love and charity: For the bread
broken and the cup are the ſymboles of their Saviours body
and bloud once made <hi>a ſacrifice;</hi> and therefore they eating
thereof together, as of <hi>a feaſt after a ſacrifice,</hi> doe ſhew
forth this Union and Agreement, to have been the avowed
purchaſe, and impretation of the body and bloud ſo ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.</p>
               <p>There was a <hi>controverſie</hi> of late yeares fomented by ſome
through Popiſh complyances, <hi>That the Lords Supper might
be ſtiled a Sacrifice,</hi> the Table an Altar, which produced in
the diſcuſſion of it (as all controverſies doe in the iſſue ſome
further truth) the diſcovery of this true deciſion of it: That
it was not a ſacrifice, <hi>but a feaſt after and upon</hi> Chriſts ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing
of himſelfe; <hi>Participatio ſacrificii,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls
it, <hi>a ſacrificiall feaſt commemorating</hi> and confirming all thoſe
<hi>ends</hi> for which the onely true and proper ſacrifice of Chriſt
was offered up, and ſo this feaſt a <hi>viſible ratification of all
ſuch ends,</hi> whereof <hi>this,</hi> is Evidently <hi>One.</hi>

was a farther confirmation of Mutuall peace, both among

               <p>NOw therefore to draw all theſe lines into one center,

notions the more full; and together therewith to
render the harmony more compleat betweene the <hi>Lords
death,</hi> and its being intended <hi>as a ſacrifice</hi> to procure this
peace, and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> as a <hi>feaſt after</hi> this ſacrifice,
holding forth this very thing, as purchaſed thereby, and
ſo further to confirme all this: looke as before I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(as in relation to the demonſtration that Chriſts death
was intended as a ſacrifice for ſuch a peace) that <hi>that</hi>
was one end and uſe of ſacrifices both among Jewes and
Gentiles, to found and create Leagues of amity between man
and man ſo it is proper and requiſite for me now to make
another like digreſſion, (as in relation to this notion of the
Lords Supper) <hi>to ſhew how that alſo by eating and feaſting
together</hi> (eſpecially <hi>after</hi> or <hi>upon</hi> ſuch a kind <hi>of ſacrifice)</hi>
theſe <hi>Leagues of Love</hi> were anciently uſed to be <hi>further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
and ratified:</hi> that ſo it may appeare that as <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the analogy of ſuch ſacrifices,</hi> Chriſts death was a
ſacrifice directed and intended to that end; ſo alſo that
<hi>according to the analogy of ſuch feaſting in and upon ſacrifices,</hi>
this eating and feaſting together upon the ſymboles of that
ſacrifice by believers, is as genuinely intended a ſcale of
this reconciliation amongſt them, and that in a due corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114819:24"/>
and anſwerableneſſe to the genuine intent of that
ſacrifice it ſelfe, as that which had purchaſed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
it.</p>
               <p>I might be as large in this as in the former. When after
a grudge and enmity paſt betweene <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Laban</hi>
to bury all things betweene them would enter into a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of peace; Come</hi> (ſayes he, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 44.) <hi>let us make a
Covenant I and thou: and</hi> (that by a ſigne, for he addes)
<hi>let it be a witneſſe betweene thee and me:</hi> Now what was that
ſigne and witneſſe? in the 46. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They tooke ſtones, and
made an heape, and did</hi> EATE THERE: and v. 54.
(after an <hi>Oath</hi> paſſed v. 53.) Jacob <hi>offered a ſacrifice on the
Mount; and called his Brethren</hi> (or Kinſmen) <hi>to eate bread;
and early in the morning</hi> Laban <hi>departed.</hi> The like did <hi>Iſaac</hi>
with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 26. 28. <hi>David</hi> with <hi>Abner,</hi> 2 Sam.

               <p>Now then to bring all this home to the point in hand,
<hi>Chriſt our Paſſeover,</hi> (and ſo our Sacrifice for us) having been

and ordained us Believers <hi>to keepe this feaſt,</hi> (It is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
own alluſion, agreeing with and founded on the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114819:25"/>
notion we have been proſecuting:) and that to this end,
That by <hi>partaking of it as a Sacrifice,</hi> and by ſhewing forth
His death, wee might hold forth, all the avowed ends of
that Sacrifice with <hi>Application to our ſelves.</hi> The eminent
ends of the <hi>one</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> correſponding and anſwering
to the eminent ends of the <hi>other</hi> as <hi>a Feaſt.</hi> A <hi>Feast</hi> it is,
of <hi>Gods</hi> providing, and he the great entertainer of us at it,
in token of peace <hi>betweene Him and us:</hi> for HE it was, who
prepared the Sacrifice it ſelfe, and unto whom as a <hi>whole
burnt offring</hi> Chriſt was offred up; But <hi>God</hi> is <hi>not</hi> as <hi>one
that ſits down</hi> and eates with us, though He ſmelt a ſweet
ſavour in it, we are the gueſts, and He the <hi>Maſter,</hi> of this
Feaſt: And yet He thereby proclaimes, and profeſſeth His
being reconciled, in that He <hi>cauſeth us to ſit downe</hi> at <hi>His</hi>
Table. And this is the prime, and moſt eminent ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy
of it. And to hold forth this intent thereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God us, others have proſecuted this notion. But there
is <hi>another,</hi> (more conſpicuouſly ſuited to the notion
which hath been driven, and) which is no leſſe in the
intention of the inſtitution it ſelfe: and indeed of <hi>the
two more obvious</hi> to outward ſence,) and that is, that
the <hi>Perſons themſelves, for whom it is prepared, that
doe viſibly ſit down, and doe eate and drinke (in proper
ſpeech,) the Bread and Cup together, that they are agreed,
and at peace each with other. God</hi> He is but as an <hi>inviſible
entertainer:</hi> but <hi>our eating</hi> and drinking <hi>together,</hi> is <hi>viſible</hi>
to all the world; we outwardly <hi>ſhew forth his death,</hi> and
doe withall as <hi>viſibly</hi> ſhew forth <hi>this</hi> to have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it. Yea and if wee could raiſe up thoſe Nations of
old, both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and call together the moſt
part of the world at this day: and ſhould but declare, that
this is a <hi>Feast,</hi> eſpecially a <hi>ſacrificall Feaſt,</hi> a Feaſt after a
Sacrifice, offered once up for our amity &amp; peace by ſo great
A Mediatour: the common inſtinct, and notion which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114819:25"/>
their own cuſtomes had begot in them, would preſently
prompt them, and cauſe them univerſally to underſtand
and ſay among themſelves, <hi>Theſe men were at enmity one
with another, and a Sacrifice was offred up to aboliſh it, and
to confirme an Union and Pacification amongſt them, and loe
therefore, they doe further eate and participate</hi> thereof, <hi>and
communicate therein.</hi> A manifeſt profeſſion it is, that they are
in mutuall love, amity and concord one with another: and
thereby <hi>further ratifying that Unity,</hi> which <hi>that Sacrifice,</hi>
had beene offred up afore, for the renewing of. This
is truly the interpretation of that ſolemn celebration even
in the ſight of all <hi>the Heathens</hi> and unto the Principles of all
the Nations, among whom Sacrifices were in uſe: yea and
this they would all account, the <hi>ſtrongeſt and firmest bond</hi>
of union that <hi>any Religion could afford.</hi> And add this, the
<hi>more noble</hi> the Sacrifice was, as if of <hi>a man,</hi> beeing a
more noble Creature, the <hi>more obliging</hi> they accounted (as
was obſerved) the <hi>bands of that Covenant</hi> made thereby.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>our Paſſeover</hi> is ſlain, <hi>our peace</hi> is ſacrificed, not
man, but <hi>Chriſt God-man;</hi> He <hi>ſanctifying</hi> by the fulneſſe of

               <p>But that this ſort of Peace and Love, namely mutuall
among the Receivers was an avowed intendment of our
partaking of the Lords Supper, needs not to be inſiſted
on: <hi>this import</hi> of it hath tooke the deepeſt impreſſion upon

&amp;c. hath remaind in all ages of the Church, upon the
ſpirits of the moſt ignorant and ſuperſtitious, when thoſe
<hi>other higher ends</hi> and <hi>intendments</hi> of it were forgotten.
My <hi>inference</hi> therefore is ſtrong and ſure: <hi>that what was

of that Sacrifice it ſelf, as ſuch.</hi>
               </p>

eate of this Feaſt through difference of judgement, (And
it is ſtrange, that this which is the Sacrament of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
ſhould have in the controverſies about it more
differences, and thoſe more dividing then any other part
of Divine truth or worſhip,) yet ſtill however this ſtands
good, to be the <hi>native originall end,</hi> and inſtitution of <hi>the
Ordinance it ſelfe,</hi> and ſo by inference, This to have been
the intent of Chriſts death as a Sacrifice to the ſame end:
of which death, to be ſure, they all muſt partake; and unto
which <hi>Christ</hi> they muſt have recourſe, even <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every</hi>

engaged and obliged unto peace and concord
with all the Saints in the world, how differing ſo ever in
judgement, <hi>in Him, who is our Peace, and by that Sacrifice
hath made both one.</hi> And thus much for this Branch,

               <p>I will not now inſiſt on that which at firſt, to make my
way cleare, I was ſo large upon: That <hi>that kind</hi> of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of us, wrought by Chriſt for us on the Croſſe, is here
intended: to all which this may be added; That it was that
Reconciliation which <hi>at once</hi> tooke in and comprehended,
<hi>all</hi> both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile in all ages into one body;</hi> which
was never yet ſince <hi>actually</hi> done, but therefore <hi>then</hi> was
done <hi>in himſelfe.</hi> That which is now onely left for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my way, is the opening the import of thoſe words
<hi>[in one body,]</hi> which clauſe is that I take for my founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </p>
               <p>There is a queſtion among interpreters, whether by this
<hi>one body</hi> in the text be meant the Church onely, conſidered
as one myſticall body in Chriſt; or onely <hi>the body</hi> and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature of Jeſus Chriſt Himſelfe, hanging upon the
Croſſe: I would to reconcile <hi>both ſenſes take in both,</hi> as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

               <p>1. Suppoſing, (which is neceſſary,) Chriſts <hi>perſon,</hi> His
<hi>humane nature,</hi> or <hi>(His Fleſh</hi> v. 15.) to be the <hi>Ubi,</hi> the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratum,
the meeting place,</hi> and <hi>Randezvouz</hi> of this other
great <hi>body of the Elect,</hi> where this whole company ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and was repreſented, ſo to be reconciled unto God.
For indeed what the Apoſtle mentions here apart, and at
diſtance each from other: <hi>His Fleſh,</hi> v. 15. and <hi>Body, v.</hi> 16.
theſe elſewhere he brings together, 1 <hi>Coll. 22. Having made
peace</hi> IN THE BODY OF HIS FLESH <hi>through death.</hi>

Which body as hanging on the Croſſe was 2 cloathed
upon when moſt naked with this other <hi>body,</hi> which He
Himſelfe tooke on Him to ſuſtaine and repreſent, and to
ſtand in their ſtead, even <hi>the whole body of His Elect:</hi> His
body <hi>(perſonally His)</hi> becoming by repreſentation one
with that His other body, <hi>(myſtically His.)</hi> In ſum, in the

and <hi>Chriſts own repreſentation</hi> of the ſame perſons <hi>to His

for there is the ſame reaſon of both. Now of the one <hi>Chriſt</hi>
ſayes, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me,</hi> Joh. 6.
37. Chriſt mentions that <hi>gift</hi> of them, by the lumpe to
him, by the Father, as the reaſon <hi>or cauſe</hi> (rather) why
they <hi>could not</hi> ever be <hi>kept from him:</hi> And as none can keep
them from him, <hi>becauſe given</hi> of the Father to him, in like
manner and for the like reaſon, the whole body of them
cannot be kept one from another, <hi>becauſe preſented</hi> by him
<hi>againe</hi> to the Father: Chriſt mentions both theſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
as of equall efficacy in that prayer, whereby he ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifyed
that Sacrifice of himſelfe, <hi>John 17. Thine they were,
And thou gaveſt them me. All mine are thine, and thine
are mine,</hi> And I pray <hi>v. 21. that they all may be one,</hi> (and that
in this world) <hi>as we are.</hi> Chriſt then not onely <hi>died for his
ſheepe</hi> apart, that they might <hi>come to himſelfe,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.
15. but further that they might <hi>be one fold,</hi> as it followes
there. And as the Evangeliſt interprets <hi>Cajaphas</hi> prophecy;
<hi>Hee died to gather together in one the children of God, that
were ſcattered abroad.</hi> Joh. 11. 51, 52. To <hi>make ſure</hi>
which gathering to come, He in and at His death <hi>gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

the firſt <hi>generall Rendezvouz in this world</hi> appointed for
him and his members, where they were <hi>crucified in him and
with him,</hi> as the Apoſtle often ſpeakes. Chriſt told the
Jewes, <hi>If I be lifted up,</hi> Joh. 12. 32. (ſpeaking of his death
on the Croſſe, v. 33.) <hi>I will draw all to me:</hi> And here you
ſee the reaſon of it, for in their <hi>lifting up him,</hi> they <hi>lift up
all his</hi> with him, as hung to and adjoyned with him <hi>in one
body, in his body.</hi> This great and <hi>univerſall loadſtone</hi> ſet in
that <hi>ſteele of the Croſſe,</hi> having then gathered all theſe leſſer
magneticke bodies, pieces of himſelfe, into himſelfe; the
<hi>vertue</hi> hereof <hi>will draw them all together in one againe,</hi> as
they come to exiſt in the world: They <hi>may be ſcattered,</hi> they
<hi>may fall out,</hi> but as branches united in one root, though
ſevered by winds and ſtormes, and beaten one from and
againſt another, yet the root holding them in a firme and
indiſſoluble union, it brings them to a quiet order, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againe. And if the now ſcattered Jewes muſt one day
come together, and make one body againe; becauſe thoſe
<hi>dry bones</hi> (the <hi>Umbrae,</hi> the ghaſtly Shadowes of them) were
ſeene once to meet in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> viſion: how much more
ſhall the <hi>Elect coaleſce</hi> in one <hi>New man,</hi> becauſe they once
met in him, that is, <hi>the body,</hi> and not <hi>the ſhadow?</hi> If thoſe
Jewes muſt meet, that the <hi>prophecy,</hi> the <hi>viſion might be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,</hi>
theſe muſt much move, that the <hi>end of his death,</hi>

all <hi>viſions</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> have their <hi>Amen</hi> and <hi>accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
As in <hi>his death,</hi> ſo <hi>in his reſurrection</hi> alſo, they
are conſidered as <hi>one body</hi> with him, <hi>Iſay 26. 19. Together
with my dead body they ſhall ariſe</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) and both,
in death and reſurrection, one body, to the end they
may be <hi>preſented</hi> (together) <hi>in one body, all at laſt,</hi>
Coloſſ. 1. 22. and in <hi>the meane time</hi> in the <hi>efficacy</hi> of theſe
forehand meetings are they <hi>to be created into one new man,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114819:29"/>

wrought by the vertue of it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that if ſuch a force and efficacy flowes
from their having <hi>met once,</hi> as <hi>One Body,</hi> then much more
from this, (which the text addes) that <hi>they</hi> WERE RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CONCILED

them (as then) by him, that ſo, <hi>dum ſociaret Deo, ſociavit

                  <note place="margin">Crocius.</note> their reconciliation with God was not conſidered,
nor wrought onely apart, ſingly, <hi>man by man</hi> (though
Chriſt bore all their names too) but the tearmes were ſuch,
<hi>unleſſe all</hi> were, and that as in <hi>one body,</hi> and community
together among themſelves <hi>reputed reconciled,</hi> the whole
reconciliation, and of no one perſon, unto God, ſhould be
accounted valid with him. So as their <hi>very peace with God,</hi>
was not onely <hi>never ſevered from,</hi> but <hi>not</hi> conſidered, nor
effected, nor <hi>of force</hi> without the conſideration of their
being one each with other, in Chriſt. Inſomuch as upon the
law and tenour of this <hi>Originall</hi> act thus paſt, <hi>God might</hi>
according to the true intent thereof, yea and <hi>would renounce</hi>
their reconciliation with himſelfe, if not to be ſucceeded
with <hi>this reconciliation of theirs mutually.</hi> And allthough
this latter doth in reſpect of <hi>execution</hi> and <hi>accompliſhment</hi>
ſucceed the other in time, (the Saints they doe not all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
agree, and come together as one body) yet in the

               <p>That Supper being ordeined to ſhew forth his death;
looke <hi>as</hi> he dyed, ſo it repreſents it. As therefore Chriſt
was ſacrificed repreſenting the <hi>Generall aſſembly</hi> of Saints,
&amp; ſo in <hi>one body</hi> reconciled them to God: ſo, <hi>this Supper</hi> was
ordeined, (in the regular adminiſtration of it,) to hold forth
the <hi>image</hi> of this, as neer as poſſible ſuch an ordinance could

many are òne bread and</hi> ONE BODY. He had ſaid <hi>v. 16. That
the Lords Supper it was the Communion of the body of Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:114819:30"/>
&amp;c. that is, a <hi>Communion</hi> of Chriſts Body, as to each,
ſo as of a company united together among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and accordingly the Apoſtle ſubjoynes this as
the reaſon; <hi>For we</hi> (whom you ſee, doe ordinarily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

<hi>many,</hi> are <hi>one bread</hi> and <hi>one body: One bread</hi> as the ſigne;
<hi>One Body</hi> as the thing ſignified. And thus we are, then, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
to be, when Chriſt <hi>as dying</hi> is communicated by us.
For to <hi>ſhew forth His Death</hi> is the end of this Sacrament.

ſhewing forth, thereby, not onely that Chriſt died for them

forth here in that each perſonally doth partake thereof,)
That might have been ſufficiently evidenced if every <hi>perſon</hi>
or <hi>family apart,</hi> had been warranted to have received, and
eaten this ſacrificiall feaſt alone (as they did the Paſſeover
and the Sacrifices, <hi>Lent.</hi> 7. 18.) but the inſtitution is for <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
which very word Chriſt mentions in the <hi>inſtitution, This
is the bloud of the new Teſtament ſhed for many,</hi> which word,
I believe the Apoſtle had aney unto when he ſayd, <hi>We being
many are partakers, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt indeed principally aimed
therein, to ſhew, that his intent in dying, was for a <hi>multitud</hi>
of mankinde, the whole body of his Elect: yet becauſe
he inſerts the mention hereof; at the delivery of thoſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and that the ordinance it ſelfe was ſuited to hold
forth this intent, The Apoſtle takes the hint of it; and adds
this gloſſe and conſtruction upon it as glaunced at in it:
that according to the inſtitution and import of this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
the partakers hereof are to be <hi>a many</hi> (not one or
two alone:) and theſe united <hi>into one Body,</hi> to the end that
thereby may be held forth this great intendment in His
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114819:31"/>
death, <hi>That he died for the many of His Church, as one
collective body.</hi> This however wee are ſure of, that this
way of partaking this Supper as <hi>in one Body,</hi> was to the
Apoſtle a matter of <hi>that</hi> moment, That we find him bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inveighing in the next Chapter, that the ſame individuall
Church of Corinth, <hi>when they came together in one</hi> for that
and other Ordinances, ſhould of all Ordinances elſe, not
receive this Ordinance together in ſuch a community, but
perverting that order, ſhould even in that place appointed for
the meetings of the whole Church, divide themſelves into
private ſeverall companies, and ſo make this as <hi>a private
Supper,</hi> which in the nature and intendment of the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it, was to be a <hi>Communion of the whole Church</hi> or body
together. Inſomuch as he ſayes, <hi>This is not to eate the Lords
Supper: for in eating</hi> (namely this Sacramentall Supper,)
<hi>every one takes before</hi> (others perhaps do come:) <hi>His own Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
together with <hi>the Lords,</hi> &amp; ſo maketh it as a private col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
or as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>wherefore my brethren when you come
together to eate</hi> (that Supper,) <hi>tarry one for another,</hi> to
make a full meeting of the whole body: and as for other
Suppers, every man is at liberty to take them at home as he
pleaſeth, <hi>v.</hi> 34. The Apoſtle is thus zealous in it, as he had
reaſon, becauſe hereby is ſhewne forth one principall my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in Chriſts death, for <hi>from this,</hi> at leaſt <hi>upon</hi> occaſion
<hi>of this</hi> particular as well as any other, doth the Apoſtle ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this great maxime, <hi>yea ſhew forth His death till he comes,
v.</hi> 26. Of ſuch moment in their import and ſignificancy are
things (thus ſmall and meane in the eyes of ſome) that yet
are full of Myſtery in Chriſts intendment. And thus much
