         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Few
PLAIN WORDS
Concerning
CONFORMITY
IN
Matter of Religion and Worſhip: And alſo
concerning Evidence and Judgment in
Caſes of Conſcience.</head>
            <head type="sub">Publiſhed to all Magiſtrates, Jurors, and People, within the Nation
of England.</head>
            <p>SEing that the main thing now intended by the late Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
is to bring people into Conformity unto the Lyturgie of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as appears by the ſaid Act, in providing
Remedies againſt all other Aſſemblies and Meetings as ſeditious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles:
Now the main Queſtion will be this; <hi>Whether the Lyturgie of
the Church of</hi> England <hi>be the true Reformed Religion and Worſhip, according
to the purity in Primitive times? And whether ſuch as diſcent from it do yet
remain in the Apoſtaſie?</hi> This is the main Queſtion now to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for the Lyturgie-worſhip, as now practiſed in the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is generally taken to be the <hi>best Reformed,</hi> and <hi>neareſt to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick
Order,</hi> and ſo is preſſed and urged as the moſt <hi>Refined Religion and
Worſhip to be obſerved.</hi> Now how far it is <hi>Reformed,</hi> and how near it is
brought unto the <hi>Apostolick Order,</hi> I ſhall not at this time compare or
diſtinguiſh; but if it were truly and rightly <hi>Reformed</hi> into the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Purity,</hi> and that the ſame <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> had the ordering of it as
the Apoſtles were ordered by, then no Perſecution would riſe out of
it, for in the <hi>Apoſtolick Order</hi> there were never any; therefore the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>
is yet a far off from that <hi>Religion and Worſhip</hi> which was in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98126:2"/>
               <hi>Primitive times,</hi> and ſo the diſſenting from it, or not conforming to it,
doth not conclude the diſſenters to be in Error, becauſe ſomething
may lie nearer the truth of the <hi>Apoſtolick Worſhip</hi> then what the Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is reformed into. For if ſuch as have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>therein worſhip him,</hi> have found ſomething
nearer to the <hi>Apoſtolick Practice,</hi> than what is obſerved by the Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then they are to be allowed the liberty
in their Worſhip without reſtraint or prohibition, for the true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Spirit, and they that worſhip God in the Spirit, they are
truly Reformed into the <hi>Apostolick Order,</hi> and they cannot perſecute
any, but walk in love and meekneſs towards all, which is the cleareſt
Evidence of the beſt <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> and that which lies neareſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Apoſtolick Order:</hi> For the word <hi>Lyturgie</hi> ſignifies, <hi>The Publick
Service of the Church.</hi> Now if the Lyturgie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
do not agree with the Lyturgie of the true Church in Primitive times,
then it is not tranſgreſſion to diſſent from it, and there is nothing
doth more infallibly demonſtrate the diſagreement, than Perſecution
by it, and ſuffering under it; for the Publick Service in the true
Church, is by the Spirit of God, and none can order the Church in
things pertaining to God but by the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of
God never perſecuted any, nor ſuch as worſhip God in the Spirit
cannot be of that mind, for that is not a good ſervice in the
Church, neither do ſuch as are guided by the Spirit of God diſſent
from the Lyturgie, but may be truly in the publick Service of the
Church, though not in the publick Service of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
So then it remains to be enquired by ſuch as yet know not what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Worſhip is beſt Reformed and moſt agreeable to the Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
or publick Worſhip of the Church in Primitive times? and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
may herein be ſaid to anſwer any enquirer.</p>
            <p>1. That is the beſt Reformed Religion and Worſhip, which is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the Spirit of God, becauſe that hath power to Reform
and Change the heart, and ſo to order the heart in the fear of God,
and in the publick ſervice of the Church.</p>
            <p>2. That is the beſt Reformed Religion and Worſhip which ſtands
in the freedom of the Spirit, in which there is no binding or limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but a free Service in the Church.</p>
            <p>3. That is the beſt Reformed Religion and Worſhip, which ſtands
in love, peace, and good-will, in which there is no Reſtriction nor
Perſecution, but a ſerving one another in love, which is the publick
Service of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98126:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
4. That is the beſt Reformed Religion and worſhip, when every man
doth to another as he would be done unto himſelf, in which there is
no envy, hatred, or malice, but a peaceable and a holy life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
and honeſty, which is the publick ſervice of the Church.</p>
            <p>Theſe few things being well conſidered, it will appear, that the
people who are called Quakers, do not diſſent from the Lyturgie, but
are due obſervers of it; for as they are guided by the Spirit of God,
ſo their ſervice is a publick ſervice of the Church; but the ſervice of
the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a private ſervice compared with the many
Religions and Worſhips that are in the world: For nothing can be a
publick ſervice of the Church, but that which is performed in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Spirit of God; becauſe the Spirit is an univerſal principle, and
in every Nation it guideth ſuch as receives it and believes in it, into
one way and ſervice, and that is publick in every Nation, and not tied
or bound unto one Nation only, for that which may be obſerved in
one Nation, is but a private thing compared with other Nations in
the world, that differ from them in matter of Religion and worſhip:
But the Spirit and power of God reforms Nations, and gathers them
into unity and peace in which they are true members of the Church,
and ſet in the publick ſervice of it; and if the word Lyturgie may be
allowed to the Quakers according to its proper ſignification, then
they are in practice the beſt obſervers of it, for their ſervice is a publick
ſervice in the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let all Magiſtrates who are commiſſioned to give judgement
touching offences, ſeriouſly conſider, for the matter is of ſuch weight
and concernment, as worthy to be deliberated, and not haſtily to fall
upon it in any raſh concluſion; for it is only ſeditious <hi>Conventicles</hi>
which the late Act provideth Remedies againſt, and gives this reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
becauſe at their Meetings they contrive Inſurrections, as late experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
hath ſhewed: Now the <hi>Quakers</hi> are not any way guilty of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
in theſe caſes; and that it may be the better underſtood, I
ſhall explain the ſignification of the words unto the Capacities of all
ſorts of ſenſible people. <hi>Sedition</hi> is diſcord, ſtrife, and debate. <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle</hi>
is a ſmall Aſſembly commonly for ill things, or as the Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
it, where many do impart with others to kill a man, or to take
anothers part in ill things, <hi>Lam. 173. Inſurrection</hi> is a riſing of men in
Arms: Now concerning all theſe things, which is the very ground of
the ſaid Act, there cannot any thing juſtly be laid to the <hi>Quakers</hi>
charge; for if experience in theſe caſes be taken for good evidence,
then the <hi>Quakers</hi> Meetings are wholly cleared by the ſaid Act, for no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98126:3"/>
ſuch things hath ever been experienced to riſe from their Meetings;
and therefore the ſaid Act not lying againſt them in the ground, no
Penalty or puniſhment is to be laid upon them by vertue of the ſame.
And this is written unto you Magiſtrates, who are commiſſiioned to
give judgment in caſes of offences; for it is a plea generally uſed by
Magiſtrates, That they are bound to put the Law in Execution: well,
if it be ſo, and that you are ſo careful to diſcharge your truſt, yet you
muſt find an offender before you can legally execute the Law, and the
offence muſt ariſe by good and ſound evidence to be a tranſgreſſing of
that Law, and that according to the purpoſe of the Law: So that you
may be in a capacity to judge and determine Cauſes equally, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to good evidence, in things pertaining to men; but as to things
pertaining to Conſcience, they are too high for you, for you can have
no evidence to inform you concerning the offence, and ſo cannot
judg or determine the matter equally in that caſe: And if in this
caſe of Meeting, there nothing doth appear of diſcord or ſtrife, or any
ill things, then there is not any thing for you to take knowledg of as
an offence, or that can be charged as tranſgreſſion upon ſuch as ſo
meet, though they meet in greater or leſſer numbers; for the Act is
not againſt peaceable Meetings, nor againſt the true Worſhip of God;
but where there is Religion and Worſhip pretended in Meetings, and
ſome ill thing intended by that Meeting, and according to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
break forth into a publick manifeſtation, then, upon good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
in that caſe you may proceed to Penalties and puniſhment of
the offendors, and ſo every apparent offence may have a witneſs
(without) to give evidence to the Fact, by which Judgment may
be given according to the offence. But if the Conſcience offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
God, that muſt be left to his witneſs within, and to his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
alone, who both ſees the offence, and knows how to puniſh it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of it; and therefore all ſuch caſes as relate to
to the Conſcience, is to be left to God alone, who ſeeth ſecrets, and
judgeth ſecrets, and gives to every man according to his deeds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect of perſons.</p>
            <p>And now a few words unto you that ſerve upon Juries, ſeeing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the ſaid Act may come within your enquiry; for the third
offence in order to Tranſportation, is to be tryed by Verdict: Now
where you come to be concerned in any ſuch caſe, wherein the matter
lies in point of Conſcience, be very careful what you do. And firſt,
you that ſerve upon grand Juries, the matter lyes of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
unto you, foraſmuch as you are the finders and accuſers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98126:3"/>
of offenders, and ſo prepares the way in order to conviction or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Now if there be not ſome evidence, that can make good proof
that there was ſome appearance of diſcord or ill things at ſuch a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for which any Party or Parties may ſtand Indicted, then you are
not in a capacity to find the Bill to be true, foraſmuch as you cannot be
informed whether ſuch a Meeting was pretended to Worſhip, and ſome
ill thing intended by it, or whether it was a Meeting to worſhip God
ſingly in Spirit and in Truth, which the Act is not againſt; and ſo if it
lye as a caſe of Conſcience, without any appearance; you can have no
true evidence in it, and therefore you are not to find it, nor accuſe any
in that caſe as guilty of an offence worthy of puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object</hi> But ſome may ſay, We only enquire for the King, and therefore
upon good evidence to the Indictment, we are bound to find it, and let the Party
clear himſelf upon his Tryal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As you ſtand only to enquire for the King, ſo you are to enquire
what wrong the King ſuſtains by the Fact, of which the Party-ſtands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
for if the evidence to the Indictment prove not ſome wrong done
to the King in matter of Fact, then you cannot know the Bill to be a true
Bill, and ſo is not to put the Party upon his Tryal: For if the Indictment
do not lye, as to ſome wrong done by the Party Indicted, either a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to
Life, Eſtate, Peace, or Liberty of another, and that it be not ſo proved
by your evidence then the King is not wronged, and you may clearly
acquit the Party on the Kings behalf, and leave things that pertain to
the Conſcience unto God alone, for none beſides him knows what is in
man. And you that are ordered upon Juries for Conviction, your places
is of the greateſt weight and concernment, foraſmuch as you try the
Life, and may either ſave it, or deſtroy it: For though the grand Jury do
enquire and find the Indictment, yet it is you that either caſts or clears a
man upon his Tryal, for you are Judges of the Fact, and if you Judge
the Party guilty of the Fact, then you expoſe him to the Judgement of
the Law, in that Caſe. Now foraſmuch as there is a late Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made, which doth refer the Tryal of the third offence puniſhable
by it, unto a Verdict, if it ſo come to paſs, that any ſuch Tryal be brought
before you, conſider well what evidence you have to prove it, for there
lyes the main thing on your Parts, who according to your evidence doth
either find the Party guilty, or clear, concerning the fact and if you find
him clear as to the Fact, then you free him <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Sentence of the Law.
Now it may be in ſuch Caſes, you may have ſome Evidence that will
prove a Meeting above the number of five beſides the Family, but then
conſider whether ſuch Evidence be ſufficient to prove any people offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98126:4"/>
againſt the ſaid Act, except it be alſo proved, that there was diſcord
and ſtrife, or any ill things practiſed in ſuch a Meeting, which is the very
ſignification of the words upon which the ſaid Act is grounded; now if
no ſuch thing can be proved unto you, then there is not any Meeting
that doth amount to tranſgreſſion againſt the ſaid Act, though there be a
Meeting to the number of five hundred or more; for it is the thing done
that makes the Fact, but if no ſuch thing as before-mentioned be done
in the Aſſemblies of people in the way wherein they worſhip, then the
Act is not tranſgreſſed, and if not tranſgreſſed, then ſuch as meets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are not to be puniſhed as offendors: therefore conſider well your
places, for your ſervice ſtands in judging the Fact according to your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
but wherein any caſe of Conſcience is brought before you, there
can no Evidence prove the matter truly to you, and therefore you are
to leave it unto God, and to his Witneſs in the Conſcience, and by your
Verdict to acquit all People in things relating to their Conſcience, and
let them account unto God before whom they muſt ſtand or fall.</p>
            <p>And now a few words unto all People, for ſeeing there is Information
and evidence to be given in the aforeſaid caſes, before there can be any
proceedings as to Conviction or Judgement, it doth concern every one
to be careful what they do, for the Act doth not impoſe any penalty or
puniſhment upon any for not informing, and therefore where any do
ſet themſelves to do it, they will but manifeſt a forward mind in the
thing wherein they may keep themſelves free, and if any do put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon it, as to Inform againſt any peaceable meeting of the people
called Quakers, they will manifeſt more envy and malice to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
than love and good will: For the Act is not againſt the Quakers
Meetings, being their Meetings are peacable, and no peacable Meeting
is a ſeditious Conventicle, and how can any truly Inform of unlawful
Meeting, when the Law is not againſt it, for that makes a thing unlawful
when the thing done is againſt the Law in that caſe; but the Quakers
Meetings are not againſt the Act in that caſe made, for it is made to
prevent and ſuppreſs ſeditious Conventicles, and pretenders of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and not peaceable Meetings, and the true Worſhip. And ſo to meet
peaceable, as the Quakers do, and all along have done on their parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the number of 5 beſides the Family, is not an unlawful Aſſembly or
Meeting, for the Law is not againſt it, but to meet to the number of five
beſides the Family; under Pretence of Religion and Worſhip, and at ſuch
Meetings to enter into diſcord and ſtrife, and do ill things, as to riſe in
Armes, and be tumultuous to the diſturbance of the Nations peace, then
it is a Seditious Conventicle, and an unlawful Meeting, becauſe the Law
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98126:4"/>
is againſt it, and they that meet in that manner, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the hazard of the
penalties and puniſhment that the Law in that caſe provideth againſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors,
and it is onely ſuch as are dangerous Sectaries, who at their
Meetings contrive Inſurrections, or to raiſe up ſtrife, and ill things, which
makes a Seditious Conventicle, as is before explained: Therefore let all
people be careful how they inform and give evidence in this caſe, for the
Act doth not prohibit any peaceable Meeting, where people meets toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the fear of God, and truly worſhips him in tenderneſſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
this is not only a pretended thing but a real true thing, which the
Act doth not prohibit. Therefore all people be in love with your
Neighbours, and then no haſty Information or evidence will be given
againſt any for their obedience unto God, and for worſhipping him in
Spirit and in Truth, according to his mind; for if there be no Informers,
there can be no proceedings, and therefore as Information is the cauſe
that gives motion to the Wheel, ſo there ought to be great care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
in it becauſe one Neighbour may thereby expoſe another unto
great ſufferings, and where any do ſo they do not love their Neighbors
as themſelves, which is a ſure mark of the true Religion. And now if any
ſhould have it in their mindes to inform and give Evidence in the caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid,
I ask you, what you will inform touching the Quakers Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
will you Inform that there was a Meeting of five beſides the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and will you ſay that you will give Evidence of it, you ſhall not need
for we confeſſe it; but will you inform that there was ſtrife and diſcord
amongſt them, or any ill thing in action, or any apperance of riſing in
armes, and ſo a Seditious Conventicle, according to the Act? if you ſay
nay, we cannot give ſuch Information in the truth, nor we dare not give
Evidence to any ſuch thing; it may be that ſome may be thus honeſt, and
it may be ſome again, that will not fear to inform, and evidence the matter
by the Act intended, though they neither ſee not know that ſo it is
amongſt ſuch againſt whom they Inform; and therefore, as to the firſt,
that honeſtly confeſſeth the truth, there needs not any thing be ſaid, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own confeſſion clears us; but unto ſuch as wilfully and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
reſolve to do us harm, if it be in their power; unto ſuch we ſay,
that your Information and evidence is not to be regarded by ſober Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
or Jurors; for our practice is ſo generally known, that it will be
apparently manifeſt to be envy and malice, where any ſuch Iuformation
of Evidence is given againſt us.</p>
            <p>And further, conſider this one thing more in general, which I ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to you by way of queſtion: Was not the Chriſtian Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
in primitive times a true Religion and Worſhip? and was there not
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98126:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> gathered in it? and was there not many <hi>Jewes</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> that differed from them in Religion and Worſhip? and did
the true Chriſtians endeavour to force the Diſſenters by an outward
Law to joyn with them? You do not read in all the Scripture, that the
true Chriſtians did ever practice any ſuch thing, either to inform or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
any in matter of Conſcience. Therefore let not this Nation of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
give occaſion unto other Nations, to upbraid them with perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for it will be much to the diſhonour of it, if not to the ruine of it, by
the hand of the Lord. Oh ſurely it cannot but touch many tender hearts
who are obſervers of the Lyturgie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to ſee ſuch
perſecution riſe out of it, and that againſt an innocent people; for we
that are called <hi>Quakers</hi> are a people well known in our Countries, and
the Witneſs of God doth bear a ſure teſtimony for us, however men may
witneſs againſt us, or however they may accuſe judge and condemn us,
yet doth the Witneſs of God clear us from the guilt of any juſt offence
againſt the preſent power, and the Peace thereof; and whatſoever may
come to paſs concerning us in this matter, yet there is no Law againſt us,
and being no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion, and ſo no Fact worthy of
condemnation Much might be ſaid in theſe things, but I ſhall leave all
with the Lord, and to his juſt and righteous Witneſs in every conſcience
which will plead with all for us, when Tongues and Pens are ſtill and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
and let not any think it ſtrange that I have uſed ſuch plainneſſe of
ſpeech in this matter, for it is in the behalf of Gods precious Truth, and
all that live in it. And being that our liberty, Eſtates, and lives are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
concerned, the plainneſſe of my ſpeech may well be allowed, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo, that it is no leſſe than true love to all your ſouls who are or may
be any way concerned in this matter; for we that are called <hi>Quakers</hi> do
truly love the Lamb, and follow him, and the Lamb and the ſaints muſt
have the Victory; and in the Lambs Love, Meekneſs, and Patience we
have Reſt and Peace.</p>
