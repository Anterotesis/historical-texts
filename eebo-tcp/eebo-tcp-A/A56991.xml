         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wonderment and document: And as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

whereby our wiſe good God hath brought

Though God uſeth a generall Uniformity,

God ſometimes ſtepping out of
the ordinary courſe of inſtituted means, to
meet with the darkneſſe, unbelief, and other
weakneſſes of poor ſouls, eſpecially in theſe
laſt Ages of the World, wherein there are
ſome rarities of Providence, whereby God
ſeemes to ſpeak unto us, that he is intending
to do ſome new and ſtrange thing in the
Earth.</p>
            <p>And if you look narrowly what theſe
means are which God hath choſen out,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 27, 28.</note> you
ſhall plainly diſcover that of the Apoſtle to

prove inſtrumentall for the promoting
of ſome part at leaſt of that glorious Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Deſigne
of Love towards lapſed Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
(which you will finde recorded in the
ſubſequent Relation, and that both in the
time of her extream weakneſſe, as alſo ſince
her Reſtauration and Recovery: and becauſe
God hath raiſed up one, ſo extraordinarily
to declare ſo much of his Will unto us; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God expects that we ſhould more then
ordinarily improve theſe his diſpenſations,
and the rather, becauſe ſuch <hi>Mirabilia Dei</hi>
are uſuall preſages of great mutations in the

anſwer not God in ſuch Providences, he u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
gives them up to ſpiritual evils, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that to temporal Deſolations. May not
<hi>Germany, Scotland, Ireland</hi> acknowledge this
<pb facs="tcp:103520:4"/>
with teares in their eyes? that they have
not walkt worthy of the glorious appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

<hi>England</hi> ſubſcribe the ſame confeſſion in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

their own Blood? Hath not God ſhewed
ſignes and wonders in all theſe Nations?
And are not ſpirituall Judgements as gray

is it not obſervable, that the Jewes before
their being given up to utter Deſolation, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the higheſt diſpenſations that ever?
when a people are lifted up to Heaven (as
<hi>Capernaum</hi> was) with Goſpel-priviledges,

the next news we hear of them will be, that
they are brought down to Hell by Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall
Providences.</p>
            <p>The extraordinary works of Gods mercies
being abuſed, make way for extraordinary

This Childe being acquainted with
ſome intentions of ſome of her Friends to

<hi>Childe!</hi> who for her age might be a

               <hi>ſitting amongſt the Doctors, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, and asking of them Queſtions.</hi>
'twas he (I ſay) who hath ranked this <hi>Twelve
years-old Childe</hi> amongſt the <hi>Doctors</hi> of our
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> 'Twas he that made her Sermons,
ſhe onely did but preach them: For her
Speech bewrayed ſhe had been with Jeſus.
Oh what gracious words ſhe uttered! no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but honey dropt from her mouth, and
that ſuch honey as taſted much of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<hi>Canaan.</hi> And indeed, Chriſtian, none
can ſpeak ſo heavenlily, none ſo healingly,
none ſo ſweetly, none ſo feelingly, as thoſe
that have much of God ſpeaking in them.
The Sentences ſhe uttered are in this Book
recorded. And now canſt thou read, and
not wonder; wonder, and not deſire to
read? And yet the manner of her ſpeaking
added <hi>Emphaſis</hi> to the things ſhe ſpake. Her
eyes were fixed, as if ſhe ſaw Chriſt; her
countenance cheerfull, as if ſhe imbraced
Chriſt; her lips ſmiling, as if ſhe kiſſed
Chriſt; yea, her armes ſometimes ſweetly
claſping, as if with <hi>Simeon</hi> ſhe had got an
arm-ful of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What think you meant her ſoul, whileſt
her body uſed ſuch an action? Oh what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
for a poor ſoul to loſe it ſelfe in the
<pb facs="tcp:103520:9"/>
All-fulneſſe of Chriſt! truly, theſe things
made us all cry out,<note place="margin">Luke 1. 66</note> 
               <hi>What manner of Childe
ſhall this be?</hi> But oh ſee the wonderfull
workings of our God. He has let her come
down into this lower room againe. God
ſeemed to take her out of the crowd into
his Chambers up above, where he ſweetly
whiſpered his minde unto her; and now he
hath ſent her back again, that ſhe may live
over her own Sermons. And yet ſo was
God taken with her company, that he would
not let her come down again, till his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
had petitioned again &amp; again for her.
And then the more to endear his mercy to
us, he ſends her down in the Armes of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
So that now we finde this truth in our
own experiences: <hi>That a Chriſtian reacheth
higheſt when he is on his knees.</hi> I might ſpeak
much more of her, but I had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
grace the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> gracious perſons. Oh let
this (I beſeech thee) with the other ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helps
Chriſt affordeth thee, prevail with thee
to be good in good earneſt: it's not leaves or
bloomes that Chriſt looks for now, but fruit.
I confeſſe indeed, the <hi>Winter</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi>
ſeems to be paſt, wherein both bloomes and
fruit, <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> was nipped and
<pb facs="tcp:103520:10"/>
ſuppreſſed: and now is the <hi>Spring,</hi> wherein
moſt men are fair in bloom, which gives me
hopes that the Lord is bringing about a
time, when holy lips and holy lives, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Communication, and heavenly Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
ſhall meet together; ſo that flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Profeſſours</hi> will prove fruitful <hi>Practicers.</hi>
Oh! be not thou one, who ſhalt keep off
ſuch hoped-for times as theſe: think how
thou wilt anſwer all Gods coſts about thee.
And if thou be he that muſt be called in to
give an account for every word thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt;
ô then what account wilt thou give for
every word that God ſpeaks to thee? Thou
that haſt ſuch heavenly Doctrine, ô take
heed of earthly Uſe: heart-warning exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and heart-cooling converſations are
fearfull and incongruous ſights. I confeſſe,
if I did not in ſome meaſure know the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachableneſſe
of a corrupt heart, I ſhould
conclude, that <hi>Non-profiting by ſuch wonders
as theſe, is the greateſt wonder of all.</hi> Well,
Chriſtian! thou haſt a Providence here
thrown into thy lap, ô improve it, and be

that they may pray for me? I had a father
and a mother, and brethren and ſiſters.</p>
               <p>Again, ſhe was much troubled, and ſaid,
What a naughty, naughty Laſs was I, to be

the Lord hath given me more patience; now
I can ſay with <hi>David, It is good for me that I

my father hath got good, and my mother

though God gave Satan power over his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yet not over his ſoul, and though his wife
tempted him to curſe God, (what a wicked
woman was that? what a wicked woman
was that? ſaid ſhe) yet his ſoul was precious
in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>Then muſing with herſelf, ſhe uttered
herſelf thus by way of Queſtion: Why did
God create man? for his glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why doth he afflict his children?

when we are in afflictions? ſeeing the grave
praiſeth him not, and ſeeing it is for Gods
glory to live?</p>
               <p>Again, ſhe ſaid; <hi>Come to me, all ye children,</hi>
and <hi>I will gather you as a Hen gathereth her

Chickens:</hi> and you ſhall ſing <hi>Halleluiahs</hi> in

               <p>Again, Happy are they who appear for
Chriſt, for they ſhall appear with him in
glory.</p>
               <p>Again, at another time ſhe ſaid, that no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>body
knew what troubles ſhe had gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
(in reading the Word and Prayer) by
reaſon of evil and wicked thoughts, and that
ſhe was glad ſometimes to leave off reading,
and to go to prayer, and ſaid, I have ſought
to God many times with teares (which no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>body
knew of) to help me againſt unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thoughts, but now ſhe had got the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thorough Chriſt: and then ſhe laught.</p>
               <p>This (I conceive) was the cauſe of thoſe

               <p>Theſe and many other ſweet expreſſions
fell from her in thoſe ſeven or eight dayes,
which yet are forgotten, none thinking then

and whether theſe things be related in the

ſay (Mother forſooth) is not this a good ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
(if you pleaſe) I will read it over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
ſhe was noted to be a very loving, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted,

                  <hi>May</hi> the firſt or ſecond, ſhe was
freed from that extremity of pain, her diſeaſe
much varying, and ſhe was ſtricken all over
ſtiff, all her parts being extended, as if ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
forth, and if any one lifted up her arm
higher or lower, there it would fix where
they ſet it; and ſo buckle any joynt of her
hand, and it would ſtand as it was ſet, &amp; thus
ſhe continued for 17 dayes,<note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntill May 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and never ſpake
word, neither did ſhe take any thing, but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103520:24"/>
they waſht her mouth with beer or water
ſeveral times in a day.</p>
               <p>It was noted, that when any did ſpeak to
her concerning any thing of the World, or
of any particulars (which as a childe) ſhe had
delighted in, ſhe would then ſhew diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
but if they diſcourſed of heavenly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
then ſhe ſhewed no ſignes of diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
but ſeemed to give attention.</p>
               <p>Then her Convulſion fits were grown to
greater extremity,<note place="margin">May 19. 1652.</note> the diſeaſe working with
ſtrange varieties, cauſing ſeveral motions and
poſtures, and then at ſomtimes ſhe had thoſe
ſtiff fits or congelations, and then ſhe did
utter thoſe ſweet ſayings afterwards ſet down;
and when ſhe grew limber, ſhe gave over
ſpeaking.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall briefly note ſome things, and
then ſet down her ſpeeches.</p>
               <p>1 She ſpake not but in a ſtiff fit (or very
rarely, and then but a word or two) and ſhe
continued ſpeaking from <hi>May</hi> the 19, until
<hi>June</hi> the 21, 1652: beginning uſually about
eight of the clock at night, and ſo continued
with ſome little intermiſſion between every
ſentence to ſpeak for two houres or more,
and then ceaſed until the next night about
the ſame time: She did ſpeak ſome things in
the morning, or ſometimes in the afternoon,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103520:24"/>
but ſo very ſeldome, and then ſhe was limber
all over, but then there were ſtrange work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the Convulſions, twiſting her fingers,
writhing her neck, drawing her mouth to
her ear.</p>
               <p>2 It was obſerved, that ſometimes in
thoſe ſtiff fits wherein ſhe ſpake, ſhe would
change her countenance, and look very ſadly
and frowningly; and it was conceived by
thoſe who beheld her, that then ſhe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome temptation, becauſe the next thing
ſhe ſpake (after ſuch frowning fits) was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
ſomething againſt Satan that roaring
lurking lion, and then ſhe would ſmile, and
look very cheerfully.</p>
               <p>3 The manner of her coming into thoſe
ſtiff fits, was with beatings of her hands
upon her breaſt, and ſhe had ſore Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and then of a ſudden ſhe had all her
parts extended, and then ſhe ſmiled; and
then they knew that ſhe would ſpeak pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently;
ſhe lay upon her back, and had the
moſt ſweet, amiable, cheerful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance that
ever I beheld (excepting one or two frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fits in a night) all the time of her ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
She had alſo rejoycing fits, claſping
her arms, and laughing ſometimes, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhe ſpake when the Convulſions drew
her mouth awry, and when ſhe ſpake, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103520:25"/>
her ſpeech was lower, ſometimes more
audible; alwayes with that vigour, vivacity,
and earneſtneſs of ſpirit, that it did much
affect the hearts of them who heard her;
and ſometimes ſhe was ſo weake that her
chaps only moved, but no words could be
heard: further, it was obſerved that ſhe did
alwayes ſpeak very good ſenſe, and when
ſhe miſtooke, ſhe would go over with the
matter again, and make it good ſenſebefore
ſhe left off.</p>
               <p>4 Obſerve, that when her times of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
came, there was one who wrote her
words, all helping to remember the very
words as ſhe uttered them, and after they
were written down (in the ſpace between
her ſpeakings) they were read over, and
every one deſired to manifeſt their aſſent if
they judged the words to be truly related,
and there were uſually many preſent, many
ſtrangers comming daily to hear her, when
her ſpeaking times were known, and I do
believe and know, and many will witneſſe,
that there was great care taken that her own
words might be ſet down.</p>
               <p>5 From this time untill a little before the
Lord was pleaſed to reſtore her, it was
thought that ſhe neither did ſee or hear, or
know any body, and that ſhe never minded
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103520:25"/>
what was ſaid to her, nor anſwered to any
thing that was ſpoken to her.</p>
               <p>6 Theſe wonderfull providentiall allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
ſome have ſiniſterouſly interpreted
ſurmizing, nay, ſome ſpeaking that ſhe was
bewitched, poſſeſſed, &amp;c. and that Satan
did ſpeak in her, and that it was not her
voice, but a voice in her; to whom God
ſhall give an anſwer from Heaven in his late
dealings and gracious diſpenſations towards
her.</p>
               <p>It was the judgement of a very judicious
Phyſician who was ſometimes with her, that
her diſeaſe was natural, her ſpeech ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>It's true, we read in the Scriptures of God,
that <hi>Satan can transform himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
of light,</hi> and hath ſpoken ſometimes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
matters, and quoted Scriptures (but cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly
often;<note place="margin">De ſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

imitates Gameſters, who ſuffer young
heires to win to make them more eager of
the game; and ſo engages them till they have
wonne all. Satan will comply with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and diſpoſitions of ſuch as he ſees
ſtrongly enclined to gracious actings, rowing
with the tide of their inclinations; but he
notes alſo out of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
that he doth this, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t to inſinuate into them,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103520:26"/>
and to draw them by theſe artifices, by theſe
delightful baits to ſwallow the hook of evil
ſuggeſtions and temptations; but this childe
never ſpake of her temptations, or uttered
any of Satans language in thoſe her times of
ſpeaking, but all her ſpeeches were ſweet and
gracious, much of Chriſt and Faith, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Satan; and againſt many Errours of
the preſent times, both in judgement and
practice, but nothing that might tend to
promote Satans Kingdome, and I cannot
think that Satan would have bin a mid-wife
to help to the birth ſo many maſculine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
and high-born truths, as this childe
hath uttered; ſuch Diviſions would much
tend to the deſtruction of his Kingdom; he
would have mingled ſome of his droſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
this pure gold, if he had prevailed ſo
far as to gain any intereſt in and power over
this childe.</p>
               <p>7 In this long time of her ſilence, <hi>viz.</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
dayes, her friends began to be much
perplexed, fearing God had left her, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Prayers were ſent up that he would pleaſe
to open her mouth again, and upon the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
of <hi>May,</hi> God having much ſtirr'd up
her mothers heart to ſeek that mercy from
him; ſhe comming into the room where the
childe lay, could ſcarcely take her ſeat there,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103520:26"/>
before the Childe began to ſpeak, and the
firſt words which ſhe uttered, and that with
much vivacity of ſpirit, were theſe: <hi>viz.</hi>

               <q>I was in darkneſs, but now I am in light.</q>

them will need ſuch Apologie) in weakneſſe,
as a childe under ſuch ſtrange diſtempers, as
did ſomwhat confuſe and perturbe her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals;

but other things ſhe uttered tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the ſtrength of the Spirits aſſiſtance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
guiding her tongue to utter
ſuch things, as now ſhe cannot tell that ever
ſhe did ſpeak them. There be ſome things
oft repeated; yet becauſe either they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with ſome variety, and were things that
it ſeems her heart was much carried forth to
mention; therefore I have ſet them down,
and hope they will not be tedious, but may
raiſe up further thoughts of them, when you
read them over again, and compare them
with the Scriptures in the Margin; and if
you knew the ſtate of the family, and the
condition of ſome that came occaſionally
to hear her,<note place="margin">Exod. 12. 4</note> you would ſay, there was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hand that guided her tongue, and that
God was with her mouth, adapting her
ſpeeches to their neceſſities.</p>
                  <p>And I ſuppoſe her heart was more affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with ſome truths before this ill fit, and of
thoſe things ſhe makes the moſt frequent
mention: But whileſt I am Apologizing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her Repetitions, ſome may tax me for Omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
ſome have ſaid, that ſhe propheſied,
and no ſuch paſſages are here related; to
which I anſwer, there is no ground for ſuch
a report: there is one paſſage related in one

about, Raiſing of the Maid; unleſſe they
fancie this to be a Prophetick foretelling of
her Recovery, I know not any thing uttered
by her, nor could upon enquiry hear of any
thing that might give ground for ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
but the truth is, ſuch Reporters (I

                  <p>My hearts deſire and prayer to God ſhall
be, that theſe Speeches may take as deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion

they did upon her body, who was the Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
God was pleaſed to hold her upon the

yet to enable her to ſpeak ſuch things, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>MAny dayes had been ſet apart in the

which Duties her parents, (as <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> the

times, ſo) now in this their afflicted conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
They have had much experience that
God was a <hi>God hearing prayer;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
would not be beaten off from theſe (now

which they had ſucked much ſweetneſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

found God ſometimes marvellouſly
helping of them,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 26. 15. Dan. 11. 34.</note> till they were <hi>ſtrong in the
power of his might,</hi> but alwayes helping them
with a little help, and bearing up their ſpirits
under the trials, though they did not obtain
a full enlargement: and when one told the
father of this childe, that the room was not
able to bear ſo many as came to ſeek God in
thoſe duties: he replied, The more, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſo that thoſe who come, can pray and
believe.</p>
               <p>But yet the Lord in wiſdome ſeemed to us

                  <note place="margin">Jer. 14. 9.</note>

growing more violent, ſhe having moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
crying fits, (by reaſon of her extream
pain, which crying fits continued till ſhe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited

were very grievous and afflictive to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of all that heard her; and the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

Which dealings of the Lord with that
family did ſerve to awaken them to a more

judged, that it was his purpoſe to have his

ſo they might not be hid in a corner, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Miniſters of his Word, (two of which
have prefixed Epiſtles to this Narrative) and
a Day was fixed to be ſet apart for Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of which many precious ſervants of

Company vvas aſſembled, that then ſhe
might poſſibly be quieter; vvherefore her

continued quietly all the time vve vvere at

<hi>eye did</hi> ſerve to <hi>affect the heart,</hi> and to helpe
them to vvraſtle vvith God more affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately;

Speeches <hi>November</hi> the eighth, vvhere ſhe

cries, nor their hearts vvith thoſe fears and

               <p>At the end of that day of Humiliation a

reſolution we parted, waiting to ſee what
the Lord would do for his Servants in that
Family, whoſe condition God did very much
aſſiſt thoſe who were engaged in that Duty
to bear upon their hearts continually, with
much tenderneſſe. The time appointed for
the next day of Humiliation was, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member;
the 9 day of <hi>December</hi> next enſuing.</p>
               <p>But the Lord ordered things ſo, that the
childe grew exceeding weak, not being able
to ſpeak from the 21 of <hi>November,</hi> any more,
(as was before noted,) ſo that her friends did
think that God was comming to finiſh his
work, and her time of warfare here in the
body.</p>
               <p>Wherefore her father diſpatcht meſſages to
the Miniſters and Chriſtians to meet &amp; keep
a day of Humiliation, on Thurſday, the ſecond
of <hi>December,</hi> (a week ſooner then we thought
of) and accordingly we met on that day, and
found her very weak, (ſo that ſhe was not
brought into the room, where we perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Duties of the day:) That which (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other things, as particularly relating
to her) was deſired of God, was, that God
would manifeſt his power in enabling her to
ſpeak again, that ſo, whileſt ſhe lived, ſhe
might be uſefull and inſtrumentall for his
glory; her Speeches having bin very powerful
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103520:88"/>
upon the hearrs of many (we hope, to the
converſion, at leaſt, conviction of ſome,
and the edification of moſt that heard
them:) God was alſo very earneſtly intreated
(with many arguments which his Spirit ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted)
to raiſe her up, that he, perfecting his
work, might have perfect praiſes; and his
work might be cleared to the conviction of
ſlanderous tongues, and the further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and ſatisfaction of the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
the day being finiſhed, we departed to
our Homes, deſiring to ſubmit, and wait the
Lords leaſure, and (if ſhe lived) to continue
ſeeking of him. But, behold, God was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to us then we could think, and when we
had ſcarce faith to believe what he had (in
ſome meaſure) ſet our hearts a work to ask
(upon the ninth of <hi>December,</hi> the Day which
formerly, as I noted, we had agreed together
to have ſought God for her, but did perform
the duty a week ſooner: I ſay, upon that
day) we had (as a reall Teſtimony of her

eighth day of <hi>September,</hi> (as I noted before)
ſhe yawned, and triall was made, and we
found her mouth opened, and then ſhe took
food without ſpilling; after an hours ſpace
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103520:89"/>
ſhe knew her youngeſt ſiſter, being about
4 years of age, who uſed to lie by her, and be
very fond of her, and would be oftentimes
kiſſing of her; and ſoon after ſhe knew her
Mother, and rejoyced to ſee her with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſtroaking of her face, and claſping
her armes about her neck; and then her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
came, and asked her, if ſhe knew him,
and after a while (for her eyes were yet
ſomewhat dim) ſhe did the like to him, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up her hands together, as if ſhe would
deſire him to pray for her, &amp; ſhe did the like
to her Mother. And we plainly diſcovered
that God had reſtored at that inſtant the
ſenſes of Hearing, Seeing, Smelling and
Handling, for when we called her by her
name, ſhe had an expreſſion, whereby we
perceived ſhe heard us, as alſo that ſhe ſaw
us, and there was a pair of ſweet Gloves, and
we bad her ſmell at them, and ſhe put them
to her Noſe ſeveral times; and ſhe had at
that time much uſe of her hands, which ſhe
had not before. And her Mother came to
her again, &amp; ſaid, What hath the Lord done
for thee? art thou not willing to give God
all that he hath given thee, thy Life, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and all thy Senſes, and Heart, and
all? and ſhe manifeſted her ſelfe by ſignes,
that ſhe was cheerfully willing ſo to do, by
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103520:90"/>
holding up her hands, and lifting up her eyes
with ſmiling, and plucking at her heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
times, and then lifted up her hand as
high as ſhe could reach, as though ſhe would
give God her heart, and all; and about nine
a clock ſhe knew her ſiſter <hi>Hannah,</hi> and her
Grand-Mother, the Wife of Mr. <hi>George
Weſtby,</hi> a Gentleman well known in the
North and South, (a very godly Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
and ſhe did expreſs the ſame by laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſtroking their faces, and cloſing of
her hands to her Grandmother, as if ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
her to pray for her.</p>
               <p>Then ſhe went to bed, and God gave her
reaſonable good reſt and ſleep; that next
morning, being the eighth of <hi>Decembor,</hi> ſhe
had four or five ſick fits, her body, face and
lips being very much ſwelled; but when ſhe
was better, the ſwelling did fall again at an
inſtant, and then alwayes ſhe held up her
hands and eyes, ſeeming to praiſe God, and
all the afternoon ſhe played with ſome odde
toys, and Spice, which Neighbours had
brought her, which ſhe had in a little Basket
untill betwixt five and ſix a clock at night,
and then ſhe fell into a ſtiffe fit, yet without
any appearance of the Convulſions before,
(as it had been formerly with her) and then
ſhe ſpake, as ſhe uſed to do in a ſtiffe fit, and
ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:103520:90"/>
                  <hi>Oh let us wait and be patient until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time of our wiſe God; for his time is
the beſt time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 2.</note> And he that ſhall come, will come,
and will not tarry; and the juſt ſhall live by
faith; but if any draw back, my ſoul ſhall take
no pleaſure in them.</p>
               <p>Let us labour for Chriſt, that <hi>Holy One, by
whom we live, move, and have our being, he is
all in all;</hi> Oh truſt in him, and believe in
him for all things, truſt in him, fear him, and
love him, for he hath promiſed, <hi>All things
ſhall turn to the good of them that love him and
delight in him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Oh let us labour for faith, for <hi>He that is
faithfull unto the death, ſhall receive a crown of
life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She ſpake all theſe ſentences with much
fervencie, lifting up her hands, and ſhaking
her head; ſhe continued in this ſtiffe fit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a quarter of an houre, and then ſhe
came to her ſelfe; and her mother being ſet
upon the bed by her, ſhe laughed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
and ſaid,</p>
               <p>Mother, ah Mother, how do you? Ah my
dear Childe, (ſaid her Mother) how doeſt
thou? ſhe anſwered, Me is pretty well, I
praiſe my God. Oh Mother, love God, love
him; ô get faith, get faith: her Mother
ſaid, So I have need.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:103520:91"/>
It is obſervable (though I did not ſo note it
before) that one of the laſt things ſhe
ſpake of, before God took away her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
and ſenſes, was to ſtir up her
Mother to get Faith, &amp; that would carry
her above all difficulties, and now ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with preſſing that counſell again,
which her Mother deſires to make ſpeciall
uſe of; and the Lord help her to do ſo.</q>
               <p>Her Mother further ſaid to her: Ah Childe,
thou haſt been a Preacher of righteouſneſſe,
and taught us the way to heaven. The
Childe anſwered, Have I? Have I? me can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, I can do nothing of my ſelf; it was
not me, it was the Spirit of God in me; I am
nothing but a poor Earth-worme, and me
hath nothing in me but what my God giveth
me, for me is nothing but duſt and aſhes:
and ſhe ſpake all this evening after, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
any Queſtion (that was put to her)
very ſenſibly, and was carried to bed, and
hath had a very quiet nights ſleep; ſhe ſaid
this morning, being the ninth of <hi>December,</hi>
ſhe never awaked till that time, which was
about ſeven a clock.</p>
               <p>The Lord be praiſed for his marvellous
Works, for they are wonderfull in our eyes.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given you a true Relation of
things ſince our meeting before God in her
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103520:91"/>
behalfe, whereby it is very apparent, that
the Lord hath heard and anſwered the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions
of his people, and that the <hi>Sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
is riſen with healing under his wings.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 4. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The glory of the Lord be advanced with
much thankfulneſſe for all, and of all; and
more eſpecially of you, who ſent out the
Dove that returned at the laſt with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live-Branch
in her mouth.</p>
               <p>The Copy of this Relation I received the
ninth of <hi>December,</hi> when the Officers and
Members of the Church of Chriſt in <hi>Sheffield</hi>
were met at a private Conference, and I read
over this Relation to them, which cauſed
many tears of joy, and their hearts were
mightily raviſhed with the appearances of
God in this Buſineſſe; and as they had
prayed for her, ſo did they then return praiſe
to him.</p>
               <p>Upon the 15 day of <hi>December,</hi> I did go
to viſit her, at which time did viſit her the
Lady <hi>Lambert,</hi> as alſo Colonel <hi>Bright</hi> and
his Lady, who were much affected with the
wonderfull Workes of God, which were ſo
evident upon that Childe: When I came
thither, I met with the Miniſters, with whom
I had joyned in ſeeking to God for her,
though I little thought of meeting them
there at that time: but ſo God mercifully
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103520:92"/>
ordered it, that we might agree upon a day
to call the Company together, who had
joyned in ſeeking Gods face, then to exalt
his glorious Name, who had wrought ſuch
wonders in that Family, and we agreed to
keep the 28th. day of <hi>December</hi> as a day of
Thanks-giving for what God had done; but
the Lord knowing our dulneſſe and weaknes
before the day came, did caſt in further mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
that ſo we might be quickened to make
his praiſe more glorious, as you will ſee in
the ſubſequent Relation, which I received
from Mr. <hi>Hatfield,</hi> whoſe fidelity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious
walking is well knowne in the
Countrey, and therefore his Teſtimony the
more worthy credence.</p>
               <p>The ninth of <hi>December</hi> the Childe lying in
a Trundle-bed, at her Mothers bed-feet; her
Mother (when ſhe awaked) asked her what
a night ſhe had: ſhe replied, a very good
night, I praiſe God, I never awaked till now,
which was about ſeven a clock. Her Mother
ſaid, <hi>Mattee,</hi> God hath done great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
things for thee, in manifeſting ſo
much of his power upon thee, and to us in
thee; the Lord ſet theſe things aright upon
our hearts. Then <hi>Mattee</hi> replied with a
ſigh,<note place="margin">

great things from us; even as the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that ſowes a great deal of ſeed, he looks
for a great crop; if he have a great ſeed-time,
he looks to reap a great Harveſt: So the
Lord, when he is pleaſed to do great things
for his people, he expects great things from
them.</p>
               <p>Then her Mother ſpake again to her, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
The Lord hath ſet thy condition upon
the hearts of his people, and thou art a
Childe of prayer, by which I hope the Lord
will have much glory; for there have been
many dayes ſet apart to ſeek the Lord on thy
behalfe.<note place="margin">Her ſpeec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> Then ſhe ſaid, Oh is not that a
great mercy? thoſe dayes were dayes of

mercies to be mercies, we are ſo full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
and ſin, becauſe the ſtrong man arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
had taken poſſeſſion in our hearts, but
there is a ſtronger then he that will diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
him.</p>
               <p>Her Mother ſaid, there are many Miniſters
who have wreſtled with God for thee both
in publique and in private. She ſaid, I would
be glad to ſee them,<note place="margin">Her ſpee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </note> that I may give them
thanks for their pains, and love to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Her Mother further ſaid, We are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
incouraged to depend upon the Lord
in the duty of prayer, for we have had appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103520:93"/>
and immediate Anſwers from Him.</p>
               <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech Iſai. 45, 19.</note> ſaid ſhe, that is a ſweet mercy; <hi>The

               </p>
               <p>That morning ſhe very freely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
expreſſed her ſelfe in any thing which
concerned her ſpirituall condition; and ſhe
was ſo free, and her ſpirit was ſo enlarged to
ſpeak, that her Mother diſſwaded her from
ſpeaking ſo much, for fear of ſpending her
little ſtock of ſpirits, ſhe being but weak.</p>
               <p>Oh,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech</note> no, no (ſaid ſhe) my ſpirits can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſpent with ſpeaking of my God: if
any would feed me with ſpeaking of my God,
I could live upon it.</p>
               <p>The ſame day, being the ninth of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
her Uncle <hi>Hatfeild</hi> (a Captain in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
a godly man) came to her, and did ask
her if ſhe knew him? She ſaid, Me have
forgotten you, but I hope God will give me
my memory in due time, that I may know
you; then he asked her, how ſhe did? ſhe
ſaid, Me is pretty well, I praiſe God; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
an hour and a halfe after he came to her
again, and did ask her if ſhe did know him,
and after a little time, earneſtly viewing of
him, (her eyes being yet weak) ſhe ſaid,</p>
               <p>Oh my Uncle <hi>John,</hi> my good Uncle, my
dear Uncle <hi>John!</hi> then ſaid he, You have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103520:93"/>
been a long time afflicted, but I hope you
have found the love of God towards you in
this Affliction: for thoſe whom he doth
love, he doth chaſtize. She ſaid, I hope ſo.
<hi>They are baſtards and not ſons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Her ſpeech</note> 
                  <hi>whom the Lord
correcteth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he asked her, If ſhe had not a dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
before her eyes? Yes,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech</note> ſaid ſhe, but I
hope, that if God pleaſe to lend me life, he
will give me the comforts of life, to make
my life comfortable, and that he will raiſe
me up, and give me my ſenſes by little and
little; then ſaid he, You have ſpoken much
of God, and have been an Inſtrument of
much good to people that came to hear you:
She replied,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech</note> My ſoul will rejoyce in that; it
was not me, it was the Spirit of God in me:
I am but a poor Earth-worm, and can do
nothing of my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Then he ſaid,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech</note> You have ſpoken very much,
there be two Books written of what you did
ſpeak; Is there ſo, ſaid ſhe? I wiſh they
may look at a good end. He did ask her,
whether ſhe did remember what ſhe had
ſaid? No,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech Pſal. 66. 16.</note> ſaid ſhe, I have forgot, but I hope
God will give me my memory, that I may

               <p>Being asked ſeverall queſtions of ſuch
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:103520:94"/>
things as ſhe had uttered in her ſtiffe fits:
ſhe anſwered to the ſame ſenſe, and in moſt
of the ſame words.<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> It was asked her, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
faith or repentance was the firſt work
in converſion?<note place="margin">Her anſ.</note> ſhe ſaid, You muſt firſt lay
the ground-work of faith, and then repent,
and turn home to the Lord; you are not at
home here, you are but pilgrims and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>It was asked her,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> what was the Corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
in the ſpiritual building of the Church?
ſhe ſaid,<note place="margin">Her anſ.</note> Chriſt, but the ſtone is three-cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered,
the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>It was asked her,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> what was faith, hope,
and charity? <note place="margin">Her anſ.</note>She ſaid, Faith is a gift of God
to believe in Chriſt; hope, is a hoping to
enjoy Chriſt; and charity, is the love of
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>It was asked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> how we may do to get the
door of faith opened?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> She ſaid, Walk in
the paths of Righteouſneſſe.</p>
               <q>Here by the way you may note, that the
Spirit of God did ſometimes help her
to ſpeak things that yet ſhe did not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtand; ſhe had in one or two
of her ſtiffe fits uttered theſe words.</q>
               <p>Knock at the gate of Righteouſneſſe, and
God ſhall open unto you the door of Faith;
in reference to that ſpeech this Queſtion was
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103520:94"/>
asked her, but God had not at that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
it to her; I believe more of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of the Goſpel could ſcarcely have been
uttered in ſo few words; It's the great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
with poor ſouls; they ſay, If we could
believe, then we might have any thing; but
how ſhall we get faith? here many puzzle
themſelves, as if God had put them to ſhift
for themſelves: as a poor man works and
gets money, and that will buy him all things,
no though we muſt ordinarily get faith in
Hearing, &amp;c. yet not by our Hearing; the
Anſwer is here, Stand and knock at the gate
of Righteouſnes:<note place="margin">Gal 2. 16.</note> that Righteouſnes which
juſtifies us when we believe,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 1.</note> doth purchaſe
faith for us that we may believe. Pardon
this digreſſion.</p>
               <p>It was asked her, if the Devil did not go
about to deſtroy her. Yes, ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>It was asked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Who conquered thoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations:<note place="margin">Anſ.</note>
ſhe ſaid,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Jeſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> the Devil
goeth about to deſtroy us with his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations;
but I hope they will not be laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our charge, but to the charge of him from
whence they came.</p>
               <p>At another time ſhe was asked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> why Chriſt
had conquered Satan:<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> ſhe anſwered, For
his own Names ſake, and for my ſake.</p>
               <p>At another time, I being with her,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> did ask
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:103520:95"/>
her, whether ſhe thought that God would
recover her ſtrength by his immediate pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
(as he had begun) or by the uſe of means?
She anſwered me very ſolemnly, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that God will raiſe me up by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
power without means, <hi>h.e.</hi> Phyſick.</p>
               <p>Then I asked her,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> if ſhe did not deſire
that means might be uſed?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> She anſwered,
that ſhe had oft preſt her ſelfe to be willing
to uſe means, but yet ſhe could not finde her
heart made willing.</p>
               <p>Then I asked,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> why ſhe deſired to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to uſe means?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> She anſwered, Becauſe
her friends deſired it, and for their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>Then I asked her,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> what ground ſhe had
to believe that God would raiſe her up by
his immediate power? She anſwered,<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God did not make her willing to uſe
the means, though ſhe had oft deſired it of
him; and if he would have her uſe means,
he would make her willing: and then ſhe
had heard of that Providence, how God
ſhut up her teeth, whileſt the Phyſician was
in the Houſe from the eighth of <hi>September</hi>
till <hi>December,</hi> about three moneths; and ſhe
further ſaid, that ſhe thought that God
would not that the Phyſician ſhould have
any one part of the honour of raiſing her
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:103520:95"/>
to health, but he would have all the glory to
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>At another time I ſpake thus to her, Cozen
<hi>Mattee,</hi> you told me that you did believe
God would raiſe you up by his immediate
power, he hath done much for you, but yet
you have many reliques of weakneſſes upon
you;<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Will you endeavour to act faith upon
that power of God?<note place="margin">Anſ.</note> She anſwered, It is my

given me of my God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>One night when they were undreſſing of
her, one told her, ſhe had no ſhoes, (for
they had given all her clothes and wearing
things to ſome poor children, not expecting
her life) and her Father ſaid, there was a
Shoe-maker in the Town, but he was a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker;
ſhe asked, what that was? it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
he was one that ſleights Miniſters,
and Gods Ordinances: She replied, ſhe
would have no Quakers Shoes then.</p>
               <p>At another time, the ſame thing being
diſcourſed of, and ſhe giving the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
her Siſter <hi>Hannah,</hi> (who was very
tender of her, and had prejudiced herſelf
with her care of her and of her Mother
in their weakneſſes) asked her, if ſhe
knew, what the Quakers were? She
anſwered, They are ſuch as are above
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103520:96"/>
Onances (for then ſhe could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
many words, her ſpeech being gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
reſtored to her) her ſiſter ſaid, What
mean you? ſhe anſwered, I ſhall make you
underſtand, they are ſuch as ſlight Gods
Miniſters, whom he hath ſent to preach his
Word.</p>
               <p>Another hearing of this diſcourſe, did ask
her why ſhe would have no Quakers ſhoes,
did ſhe think there was any errours ſewed
up in the ſeames of the ſhoes? ſhe anſwered,
No, but (ſaith ſhe) they ſay I am a Quaker,
and to convince them, that I am not, I will
have no dealings with them.</p>
               <p>Many other ſuch paſſages there were, but I
forbear to adde more.</p>
               <p>She continued pretty well, and with much
cheerfulneſſe of ſpirit, and the Lord was
pleaſed to make her meat and ſleep comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to her; but ſhe had no uſe at all of her
legs, but was carried to bed, and from bed,
untill the 21th. of <hi>December,</hi> which day ſhe
being in bed about 9 a clock at night, her
Father being in the room, ſhe told him, ſhe
felt ſtrength come into her legs: he asked
her, How? ſhe ſaid, It trickled down, and
came into her thighs, knees, and ancles, like
warm water, and ſo continued a quarter of
an hour: and after that working was paſt,

and that being over, ſhe had much

from the head to the feet; then at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſhe ſaid, I praiſe God, I am now as well

               <p>Then her Mother ſpake to her, Ah Childe,
now thou underſtandeſt how ſuddenly the
Lord hath given thee thy limbs, even ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
did the Lord give thee thy ſenſes and
thy ſpeech, but then thou waſt not able to
apprehend it.</p>
               <p>Oh, ſaid ſhe, how ſhall we be ever able in
any meaſure to extol the Name of the Lord
in praiſes that are due unto him for all his
mercies to us; I deſire that the Lord would
be pleaſed to perfect my heart, and frame it
as he will be pleaſed to accept of it, for I

               <p>Then her Mother ſaid, What are we poor

make choiſe of a childe of ours to hold
forth ſo much of his power and glory? She
anſwered,<note place="margin">Her ſpeech</note> It is not any worthineſſe that is in

ſaw It good in his all-ſeeing Decree, for he

be ſo.</p>
               <p>Her Mother ſaid, Oh, my unbelieving heart
would never yield to think that there would
be ſuch a glorious end of this affliction. Ah
Mother (ſaid ſhe) the Lord hath done above

               <p>The 22th. of <hi>December,</hi> when ſhe roſe in

were afraid to truſt her ſtrength, it being ſo
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103520:97"/>
long a time ſince ſhe had any uſe of her legs,
yet ſhe deſired leave to make triall how ſhe
could go, and ſhe went up and down the
room beyond all expectation, and the Lord
ſo continued his good hand upon her, and
ſhe encreaſed in ſtrength daily, ſo that upon
the 28th. of <hi>December,</hi> the time appointed for
the Thanks-giving, when we met there, ſhe
was able to come forth into the Hall to meet
and welcome us; and we did behold a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
it was wonderfull in our eyes, ſo that
our hearts did rejoyce with a kinde of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
at the glory of the Lord, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in that Object, and it did the more
affect, becauſe it was more then many (if not
moſt) of us heard of before we came into
the houſe; ſo that we ſee God had put ſtill
more matter of praiſe into our mouths: when
we came together to the duty, she came and
joyned with us moſt part of the day; but
the place where we met being very full of
people, she towards the cloſe of the day
grew ſomewhat faint and weary, and ſo
withdrew, but was well preſently, and much
affected was her heart with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> goodneſſe of
the Lord; in the morning, before we enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
our ſelves in the duty of that day, she
deſired that we might ſing a Pſalme or two
which she had made choice of, <hi>viz.</hi> the 103
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:103520:98"/>
Pſalme, or the 118 Pſalm, which of them
the Miniſters pleaſed, and in the cloſe of the
day the Aſſembly were deſired to praiſe
God in the words of <hi>David,</hi> written in the
118th. Pſalme, and ſome of the verſes of
that Pſalme which did beſt ſuit with the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the day, were cull'd out, as the ſix
firſt verſes, and the 13th. verſe to the end of
the 18th. alſo the 21 and 23, 24. and the two
laſt verſes. In that day as we deſired to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt
the Lord in our hearts, who had ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
fulfilled divers promiſes, and that in
particular, Pſal. 118. verſ. 15. which had been
often urged formerly; ſo were her Parents
very ſolicitous, leſt they should not render
unto the Lord according to his marvellous
appearances for them and to them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was that promiſe urged, Psal. 50. 15.
<hi>Thou ſhalt glorifie me,</hi> which (as was declared
to them) is not onely demonſtrative of their
duty, but operative to enable them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their duty; and ſo we parted with our
hearts full of joy, and deſires that we <hi>might,
be ſtrengthened by the power of the Lords might
to walk worthy</hi> of theſe glorious ownings of
his poor worthleſſe creatures.</p>
               <p>Since this day of Thanks-giving the Lord
hath in much mercy increaſed her ſtrength
every day: she did not then go ſo ſtrongly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:103520:98"/>
as ſince she hath done: one obſervable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
there was; she was ſitting in a Chair,
and both she and the Chair fell, and she
hurt her leg; but not long after she was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to go with more ſtrength and nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
then before; and God made that fall a
means of her riſing up to more ſtrength, and
not onely are her outward parts (through
the goodneſſe of God) ſtrengthened, but
her underſtanding, memory, and ripeneſſe of
apprehenſion are much enlarged, beyond
what they vvere before her ſickneſſe, which
we vvere much afraid had been utterly and
altogether deſtroyed in this ſad viſitation;
and as a further addition, to make the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
yet more compleat, the Lord hath been
pleaſed to work a great change in the frame
and temper of her diſpoſition, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
(by reaſon of the prevalencie of the
Spleen, vvhich she is novv vvholly freed
from; as from all other infirmities vvhich
she had formerly) vvas much inclined to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and fretfulneſſe; but novv she is of a
vvondrous, meek, quiet, and ſedate temper,
and vvalks on vvith much cheerfulneſſe and
evenneſſe of ſpirit; ſo that vve may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
much of God in her carriages; she is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very diligent in reading and prayer, and
ſuch other employments as her Mother ſees
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:103520:99"/>
fit to exerciſe her in, ſo that she may be a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for many, vvho far exceed her in years;
and God doth keep her in a wonderful hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
frame; she is not lifted up vvith her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
but deſirous to vvalk up to her
Mercies; she hath not much raviſhing joys,
but God hath made good that promiſe to
her,<note place="margin">Jer. 33. 6.</note> He hath brought her health and cure,
and hath revealed to her abundance both of
peace and truth.</p>
               <p>It hath pleaſed God, ſince theſe paſſages
of his Providence, again to try that Family,
in removing from them that precious Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,
Mrs. <hi>Fr. Weſtby,</hi> Mother to
Mrs. <hi>Hatfeild,</hi> and Grandmother to this
Childe, an ancient Diſciple of Chriſt, vvho
had gained a great addition to her ſtock of
Graces, and comforts by this Childes Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

vvonderfull vvorkings of God in that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and is novv tranſlated to Heaven,
where she is praiſing God for thoſe &amp; many
other Mercies, in a higher ſtrain then our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned

had brought that affliction upon the Family
this Childe perceiving her dear Mother to be
much dejected vvith that diſpenſation, did
much labour to comfort her; and amongſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103520:99"/>
other paſſages this vvas one. With tears ſhe
ſpake to her Mother thus: Good Mother,

               <head>The Concluſion of the
NARRATIVE.</head>
               <p>THat Caution, which this ſweet Childe
hinted, (as was before noted) that we
should look to a good end in publishing her
ſpeeches, took ſuch Impreſſion on my ſpirit,
that (though I was ſtrongly urged to it) I
durſt not venter upon the preſenting of theſe
things to Publique view, before I had firſt
examined my ends in that undertaking, and
could (through the free grace of God, I
hope, in ſone meaſure) approve my Heart to
him in that enterprize.</p>
               <p>And ſince I have undertaken it, I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that I could not diſpatch it ſooner, whileſt
the impreſſions were fresh upon the ſpirits
of her Friends, but my many diverſions and
interruptions in that populous place, where
God hath eaſt my lot, muſt be my Apology,
and I hope the publishing of theſe things
now may ſerve (through the ſupply of the
Spirit of Chriſt) to revive thoſe thoughts and
reſolutions, which I hope wil never be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oblitterated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:103520:100"/>
That which I ſhall onely adde, is the ends
and uſes, which, I conceive, our wiſe God
might have, and which we and others should
make of ſuch wonderfull works of his, and
I shall refer them to
two Heads, they are
ſuch as concern
Either 1 Particularly,
that Family.</p>
               <p>Or 2 Generally, the
Nation.</p>
               <p>1 Particularly, that Family: and there</p>
               <p>1 God did foreſee what his intentions
were, as to that Family, in taking to himſelfe
that precious Gentlewoman Mrs <hi>Weſtby,</hi> the
Grandmother of this Childe: she was one
of the moſt affectionate Mothers that I have
been acquainted with; she had two ſonnes,
Mr. <hi>Thomas Weſtby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Weſtby;</hi>
and two daughters, Mrs. <hi>Hatfeild,</hi> and Mrs.
<hi>Spencer,</hi> Wife of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer;</hi>
and she had much comfort in them, (as
in her Grandchildren, all of them that are
growne up, giving good hopes of Grace
wrought in them.)</p>
               <p>Theſe were planted neer together, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them she ſpent her time &amp; ſtrength;
ſome of them being much viſited with
bodily weakneſſes, and manifold Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in all which she was a ſingular help of
their faith and comforts; I have heard of
many dutifull Children, who have been very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:103520:101"/>
ſerviceable to their Mothers, but have not
heard of a Mother ſo officious (shall I ſay
ſerviceable) to her Children; ſo that their
affections could not but be much let out
to her; and therefore the parting with her
would be the more difficult: wherefore I
think, God did act theſe wonders in that
Family to ſtrengthen their faith, to arm them
for ſuch a triall as this; that they who had
ſeen ſo much of God, might be taught (in
any triall) more willingly to ſubmit to God;
He that raiſed ſo great comfort to them out
of ſuch an affliction, they might now ſtay
upon, that he would give an abundant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to them, whatever comforts he should
take from them; He did therefore give them
thoſe Cordials to carry with them, when
they should be put to Sea again, and meet
with new Stormes and Tempeſts; and I
wish they may, and hope they will improve
thoſe experiences to theſe ends and uſes.</p>
               <p>2 That Family (vvhereof this Childe is a
member) hath been much afflicted more
then other Families, and it hath been a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Family; and many vvere ready to ſay,
What are they better for their Faſting and
Praying? they are alvvayes under affliction:
I conceive therefore God hath ovvned them,
that <hi>as their afflictions have abounded,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo their
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103520:101"/>
comforts much more;</hi> God hath made them
eminent in reſpect of his wonderfull work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for them; as they were before, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his afflictings of them; and I hope
that when they lay their afflictions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
in the Balance, they will experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that afflicted godlineſſe is better then
ſucceſſefull wickedneſſe; and that if the
ſauce had not been ſo tart, their ſtomacks
had not been ſo quick; and that if they had
not ſunk into the waters of afflictions, they
had never learnt to ſwim in the Rivers of
true pleaſures.</p>
               <p>I deſire they may yet more and more, and
hope they do finde out many medicinal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in the great Herball of the Scriptures,
which they had never diſcovered, had they
not been exerciſed with new maladies; they
would not ſo have learnt to live <hi>the life of
faith,</hi> if they had not been ſometimes under
the <hi>ſentence of Death</hi> in their own ſenſe; they
would never have ſo powerfully diſcovered
Gods power and faithfulneſſe, if they had
not ſeen manifeſtly their own weakneſſe.
Truly, I finde the moſt of God in thoſe who
are moſt afflicted by God.</p>
               <p>2 Generally, to the Inhabitants of this
Nation, I conceive Gods ends are:</p>
               <p>1 To convince them by his Works, who
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:103520:102"/>
will not be won by his Word; the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
way of manifeſting theſe precious Truths
by this Childe doth cry aloud to us to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
them: God hath raiſed up a Childe to
reprove the men of this generation for their
oppoſitions <hi>againſt that Holy Childe Jeſus</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 4. 27.</note>
and to exhort them to ſeek more for Chriſtwho
are ſo much in ſeeking great things for
themſelves; ſhe ſpeaks much of ſlighting
the world to thoſe that are ſo much ſlighting
the Word: and ô that this uſe were made
of it; that there were more ſeeking faith
and Chriſt, and leſſe ſeeking of ſelfe and
creatures; that there were more practice of
reall holineſſe, and leſſe breaking forth of
open prophaneneſſe, and that under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(ô dreadful!) of perfection; and that we
may not be like, as was ſaid of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who turned all Religion <hi>in utrum, non
in uſum;</hi> for, as <hi>Luther</hi> elegantly, God loves
<hi>Curriſtas,</hi> not <hi>Quaeriſtas,</hi> practicers, not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;<note place="margin">Iſai. 2. 2.</note>
walkers, not talkers of Religion.</p>
               <p>2 God hath in theſe glorious actings moſt
eminently and evidently carried on this great
deſigne of love to confirm the hearts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

Ordinances and Officers, and thoſe deſpiſed

               <p>It may be ſome (whoſe principles and
practices are looſe enough) will ſay, God
hath owned them in their ſeekings of him:
To ſuch I ſhall onely ſay this, that as when
men comply vvith Antichriſt, (though indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly)
God hath oppoſed their enterprizesthough
he may love ſome of their perſons:
ſo thoſe that oppoſe Antichriſt (though it
may be indirectly too) yet he may and hath
owned and proſpered their undertakings, and
yet be angry with their perſonal errours and
miſcarriages, and it was their happineſſe that
they had a good cauſe, and though he heard
prayers that were ſent up for them as they
did his vvork,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 9.</note> yet not as they intended their
ovvn vvork.</p>
               <p>But ô that poor miſ-led ſoules would hear
the voice of theſe providentiall actings of
God in this example, and would now with
others of Gods people gather together, and
appoint themſelves one Head Jeſus Chriſt,
owning him and his Inſtitutions, till they be

inſtituted by his unqueſtionable Authority,
that <hi>Great might be the day of Jezreel,</hi> even of
