            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For this game hath a certaine alluſion or ſimilitude of a ranged battel, as by order in placing the men and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them forth in their marche, it maye eaſely appeare.

And although this bee but a briefe inſtruction to teache to playe, yet the onſet beinge geuen, ſome other will folowe to amplifie or to finiſhe this ingenious and pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie deuiſe, that thereby the ſubtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and hidden gyles of this game maye be more diſcouered, with the maner how to play without bourd or men walking or riding on horſe backe with as great delite and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentation as if thei had the cheſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourde and men in their handes, which thing is done by diligent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the place and houſes wherein eche man ſtandeth, and whither or into what houſe he marcheth or may marche, euery one hauing his way appoynted him to go. And in the meane tyme content your ſelfe with this, for I aſſure you the diffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cultie to expreſſe or ſet out the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes and figures of the men is ſo muche and the chardges ſo greate, that as yet no man woulde euer

gladly take in hand to prynt them. Albeit <hi>Hieronimus Cardan'</hi> in his boke <hi>de varietate rerum,</hi> geueth a certayne forme and maner, how to ſet out in print the cheſte bourd and the men vpon it, according to the diuerſitie of the colours blacke and whyte. But he that would folow him ſhuld cut as many bourdes and diuers fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of men as the playe hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes to bee played, whiche woulde be intollerable charges. And therefore (curioſitie ſet a part) take in good worth theſe types and figures here preſented vntyll ſome better inuention be founde. For I doubt not but there be in England as good heades as either Italians or Spaniards, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> can if thei woulde inuent as fine a way to plai at this game as this is: but yet when a thing is begon, it is the eaſier and the ſoner made an end of. Now thei that will playe well at this game, muſte beware that they talke not with any other ſtandinge by, nor geue eare to anye that talketh by,

for then ſhal his ſenſes be occupied ſo with other matters that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie that playeth againſt him will with his dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> foyle: for this game (as the beſt players ſay) requireth the whole man, and conſequently all the ſenſes. Take hede alſo that the by ſtanders (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che commonlye ſee more then the plaiers) do neither by ſigne or word admoniſhe your aduerſe partie of any good or gaynfull draughte: for that is one thing amonge many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that cauſeth choler, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth one of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaiers, but it is ſuch a kind of choler that paſſeth awaye lightly, farre vnlike y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyſe plaiers anger, for he fretteth, he fumeth, be curſeth, and banneth the dyſe, &amp; deſpyteth his ill lucke, and you at the cheſt, blame not your men but your ſelfe, ſo that yf you haue a mate you ſaye commonly, yf I had played thus or thus I had ſaued the mate, herein is no offence to anye but vnto your ſelfe, and anone it is gone.
