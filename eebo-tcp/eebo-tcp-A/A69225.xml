            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

when I beginne this booke, I have no purpoſe

perchance increaſe in uſe; if I doe borrow any

that hath lighted mee a candle to the place. All
which I will bid you remember, (for I will
have no ſuch Readers as I can teach) is, that the
Pithagorian doctrine doth not onely carry one
ſoule from man to man, nor man to beaſt, but
indifferently to plants alſo: and therefore you
muſt not grudge to finde the ſame ſoule in an
Emperour, in a Poſt-horſe, and in a Mucheron,
ſince no unreadineſſe in the ſoule, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
in the organs workes this. And
therefore though this ſoule could not move
when it was a Melon, yet it may remember,
and now tell mee, at what laſcivious banquet it

was ſerv'd. And though it could not ſpeake,
when it was a ſpider, yet it can remember,
and now tell me, who uſed it for poyſon to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

her other faculties, her memory hath ever been

            <l>Vertue hath ſome perverſeneſſe; For ſhe will</l>

Too many vertues, or too much of one</l>
            <l>Begets in you unjuſt ſuſpition.</l>

            <l>Of vice becomes well ſome complexion.</l>
            <l>Stateſmen purge vice with vice, and may corrode</l>
            <l>The bad with bad, a ſpider with a toad:</l>
            <l>For ſo, ill thralls not them, but they tame ill</l>
            <l>And make her do much good againſt her will,</l>
            <l>But in your Commonwealth or world in you</l>
            <l>Vice hath no office, or good worke to doe.</l>
            <l>Take then no vitious purge, but be content</l>

               <l>The Princes favour is defus'd o'r all,</l>
               <l>From which all Fortunes, Names, and Natures fall;</l>

            <l>FAire ſoule, which waſt, not onely, as all ſoules bee,</l>
            <l>Then when thou waſt infuſed, harmony,</l>
            <l>But did'ſt continue ſo; and now doſt beare</l>
            <l>A part in Gods great organ, this whole Spheare:</l>
            <l>If looking up to God; or downe to us,</l>
            <l>Thou finde that any way is pervious,</l>
            <l>Twixt heav'n and earth, and that mans actions doe</l>
            <l>Come to your knowledge, and affections too,</l>
            <l>See, and with joy, mee to that good degree</l>
            <l>Of goodneſſe growne, that I can ſtudie thee,</l>
            <l>And, by theſe meditations refin'd,</l>

            <l>This place a map of heav'n, my ſelfe of thee.</l>
            <l>Thou ſeeſt mee here at midnight, now all reſt;</l>
            <l>Times dead-low water; when all mindes deveſt</l>
            <l>To morrows buſineſſe, when the labourers have</l>
            <l>Such reſt in bed, that their laſt Church-yard grave,</l>
            <l>Subject to change, will ſcarce be'a type of this,</l>
            <l>Now when the clyent, whoſe laſt hearing is</l>
            <l>To morrow, ſleeps, when the condemned man,</l>
            <l>(Who when hee opes his eyes, muſt ſhut them than</l>
            <l>Againe by death,) although ſad watch hee keepe,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:22691:75"/>
Thou at this midnight ſeeſt mee, and as ſoone</l>
            <l>As that Sunne riſes to mee, midnight's noone,</l>
            <l>All the world growes tranſparent, and I ſee</l>
            <l>Through all, both Church and State, in ſeeing thee;</l>
            <l>And I diſcerne by favour of this light,</l>
            <l>My ſelfe, the hardeſt object of the ſight.</l>
            <l>God is the glaſſe; as thou when thou doſt ſee</l>
            <l>Him who ſees all, ſeeſt all concerning thee,</l>
            <l>So, yet unglorified, I comprehend</l>
            <l>All, in theſe mirrors of thy wayes, and end;</l>
            <l>Though God be our true glaſſ, through which we ſee</l>
            <l>All, ſince the beeing of all things is hee,</l>
            <l>Yet are the trunkes which doe to us derive</l>
            <l>Things, in proportion fit by perſpective,</l>
            <l>Deeds of good men, for by their living here,</l>
            <l>Vertues, indeed remote, ſeeme to be nere;</l>
            <l>But where can I affirme, or where arreſt</l>
            <l>My thoughts on his deeds? which ſhall I call beſt?</l>
            <l>For fluid vertue cannot be look'd on,</l>
            <l>Nor can endure a contemplation;</l>
            <l>As bodies change, and as I do not weare</l>
            <l>Thoſe Spirits, humors, blood I did laſt yeare,</l>
            <l>And, as if on a ſtreame I fixe mine eye,</l>
            <l>That drop, which I looked on, is preſently</l>
            <l>Puſht with more waters from my ſight, and gone,</l>
            <l>So in this ſea of vertues, can no one</l>
            <l>Bee'inſiſted on, vertues, as rivers, paſſe,</l>
            <l>Yet ſtill remaines that vertuous man there was;</l>
            <l>And as if man feeds on mans fleſh, and ſo</l>
            <l>Part of his body to another owe,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:22691:76"/>
Yet at the laſt two perfect bodies riſe,</l>
            <l>Becauſe God knowes where every Atome lyes;</l>
            <l>So, if one knowledge were made of all thoſe,</l>
            <l>Who knew his minutes well, hee might diſpoſe</l>
            <l>His vertues into names, and ranks; but I</l>
            <l>Should injure Nature, Vertue, and Deſtinie,</l>
            <l>Should I divide and diſcontinue ſo,</l>
            <l>Vertue, which did in one intireneſſe grow.</l>
            <l>For as, hee that would ſay, ſpirits are fram'd</l>
            <l>Of all the pureſt parts that can be nam'd,</l>
            <l>Honours not ſpirits halfe ſo much, as hee</l>
            <l>Which ſayes, they have no parts, but ſimple bee;</l>
            <l>So is't of vertue; for a point and one</l>
            <l>Are much entirer then a million.</l>
            <l>And had Fate meant to have his vertues told,</l>
            <l>It would have let him live to have beene old,</l>
            <l>So then, that vertue in ſeaſon, and then this,</l>
            <l>We might have ſeene, and ſaid, that now he is</l>
            <l>Witty, now wiſe, now temperate, now juſt:</l>
            <l>In good ſhort lives, vertues are faine to thruſt,</l>
            <l>And to be ſure betimes to get a place,</l>
            <l>When they would exerciſe, lacke time, and ſpace.</l>
            <l>So was it in this perſon, forc'd to bee</l>
            <l>For lack of time, his owne epitome.</l>
            <l>So to exhibit in few yeares as much,</l>
            <l>As all the long breath'd Chronicles can touch;</l>
            <l>As when an Angell down from heav'n doth flye,</l>
            <l>Our quick thought cannot keepe him company,</l>
            <l>Wee cannot thinke, now hee is at the Sunne,</l>
            <l>Now through the Moon, now he through th'aire doth run,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:22691:76"/>
Yet when he's come, we know he did repaire</l>
            <l>To all twixt Heav'n and Earth, Sunne, Moon, and Aire.</l>
            <l>And as this Angell in an inſtant, knowes,</l>
            <l>And yet wee know, this ſodaine knowledge growes</l>
            <l>By quick amaſſing ſeverall formes of things,</l>
            <l>Which he ſucceſſively to order brings;</l>
            <l>When they, whoſe ſlow-pac'd lame thoughts cannot goe</l>
            <l>So faſt as hee, thinke that he doth not ſo;</l>
            <l>Juſt as a perfect reader doth not dwell,</l>
            <l>On every ſyllable, nor ſtay to ſpell,</l>
            <l>Yet without doubt, hee doth diſtinctly ſee</l>
            <l>And lay together every A, and B;</l>
            <l>So, in ſhort liv'd good men, is'not underſtood</l>
            <l>Each ſeverall vertue, but the compound good.</l>
            <l>For, they all vertues paths in that pace tread,</l>
            <l>As Angells goe, and know, and as men read.</l>
            <l>O why ſhould then theſe men, theſe lumps of Balme</l>
            <l>Sent hither, the worlds tempeſt to becalme,</l>
            <l>Before by deeds they are diffus'd and ſpred,</l>
            <l>And ſo make us alive, themſelves be dead?</l>
            <l>O Soule, O circle, why ſo quickly bee</l>
            <l>Thy ends, thy birth and death clos'd up in thee?</l>
            <l>Since one foot of thy compaſſe ſtill was plac'd</l>
            <l>In heav'n, the other might ſecurely'have pac'd</l>
            <l>In the moſt large extent, through every path,</l>
            <l>Which the whole world, or man, the abridgment hath.</l>
            <l>Thou knowſt, that though the tropique circles have</l>
            <l>(Yea and thoſe ſmall ones which the Poles engrave,)</l>
            <l>All the ſame roundneſſe, evenneſſe, and all</l>

Yet, when we come to meaſure diſtances,</l>
            <l>How here, how there, the Sunne affected is,</l>
            <l>When he doth faintly worke, and when prevaile,</l>
            <l>Onely great circles, then, can be our ſcale:</l>
            <l>So, though thy circle to thy ſelfe expreſſe</l>
            <l>All, tending to thy endleſſe happineſſe,</l>
            <l>And wee, by our good uſe of it may trye,</l>
            <l>Both how to live well young, and how to die,</l>
            <l>Yet, ſince we muſt be old, and age endures</l>
            <l>His Torrid Zone at Court, and calentures</l>
            <l>Of hot ambitions, irrelegions ice,</l>
            <l>Zeales agues; and hydroptique avarice,</l>
            <l>Infirmities which need the ſcale of truth,</l>
            <l>As well, as luſt and ignorance of youth;</l>
            <l>Why did'ſt thou not for theſe give medicines too,</l>
            <l>And by thy doing tell us what to doe?</l>
            <l>Though as ſmall pocket-clocks, whoſe every wheele</l>

            <l>Or be not ſet, or ſet at every will;</l>
            <l>So, youth is eaſieſt to deſtruction,</l>
            <l>If then wee follow all, or follow none;</l>
            <l>Yet, as in great clocks, which in ſteeples chime,</l>

An error doth more harme, being generall,</l>

            <l>That, that place which is conquered, muſt bee</l>
            <l>Left ſafe from preſent warre, and likely doubt</l>

            <l>And hath he left us ſo? or can it bee</l>

            <l>But though this freedome to upbraid, and chide</l>
            <l>Him who Triumph'd, were lawfull, it was ty'd</l>

               <p>I Send not my Letters as tribute, nor intereſt, nor
recompence, nor for commerce, nor as teſtimonialls
of my love, nor provokers of yours, nor to juſtifie my
cuſtome of writing, nor for a vent and utterance of
my meditations; For my letters are either above or
under all ſuch offices, yet I write very affectionately,
and Lehide and accuſe my ſelfe of diminiſhing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
which ſends them, when I aske my ſelfe why.
Only I am ſure that I deſire that you might have in
your hands letters of mine of all kindes, as conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and deliverers of mee to you, whether you accept
me as a friend, or as a patient, or as a penitent, or as a
Bedeſman, for I decline no juriſdiction, nor refuſe any
tenure. I would not open any doore upon you, but
looke in when you open it. Angells have not, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
not other knowledge of one another then they
liſt to reveale to one another. It is then in this only,
that friends are Angells, that they are capable and fit
for ſuch revelations when they are offered. If at any
time I ſeeme to ſtudy you more inquiſitively, it is for
no other end but to know how to preſent you to God
in my prayers, and what to aske of him for you; For
even that holy exerciſe may not be done inopportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no nor importunely. I finde little errour in that
Grecians counſell who ſayes, If thou aske any thing of
God, offer no ſacrifice, nor aske elegantly, nor vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:22691:181"/>
but remember that thou would'ſt not give to
ſuch an asker. Nor in his other countryman, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
ſacrifice of blood to be ſo unproportionable to
God, that perfumes, though much more ſpirituall, are
too groſſe; Yea words which are our ſubtleſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licateſt
outward creatures, being compoſed of
thoughts and breath, are ſo muddy, ſo thicke, that our
thoughts themſelves are ſo, becauſe (except at the
firſt riſing) they are ever leavened with paſſions and
affections. And, that advantage of neerer familiarity
with God, which the Act of incarnation gave us, is
grounded upon Gods aſſuming us, not our going to
him. And, our acceſſes to his preſence are but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents
into us. And, when we get any thing by prayer,
hee gave us before hand the thing and the petition:
for, I ſcarce thinke any ineffectuall prayer free from
both ſinne and the puniſhment of ſinne: Yet as God
ſepoſed a ſeventh of our time for his exterior worſhip,
and as his Chriſtian Church early preſented him a
Type of the whole yeare in a Lent, and after impoſed
the obligation of canonique houres, conſtituting ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
morall Sabbaths every day, I am far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dehorting
thoſe fixed devotions: But I had rather it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon thanksgiving then petition, upon praiſe
then prayer. Not that God is endeared by that, or
wearied by this; All is one in the receiver, but not in
the ſender. And thankes doth both offices. For, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
doth ſo innocently provoke new graces, as grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
I would alſo rather make ſhort prayers then
extend them, though God can neither bee ſurpriſed,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:22691:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor beſieged: For, long prayers have more of the man,
as ambition of eloquence, and a complacency in the
worke, and more of the devill by often diſtractions:
For, after in the beginning wee have well intreated
God to hearken, we ſpeake no more to him. Even this
letter is ſome example of ſuch infirmity; which being
intended for a letter is extended and ſtrayed into a
Homily. And whatſoever is not what it was purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
is worſe. Therefore it ſhall at laſt end like a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to write a good hand, which hath equaled one excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
maſter in his A, another in his B, much leſſe hee
which hath ſought all the excellent maſters, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
all his time to exceede in one letter, becauſe
not ſo much an excellency of any nor every one, as an
evenneſſe and proportion, and reſpect to one another
gives the perfection; So is no man vertuous by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
example. Not he which doth all actions to the
patterne of the moſt valiant, or liberall, which Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
afford: Nor he which chuſes from every one their
beſt actions, and therupon doth ſomething like thoſe.
Perchance ſuch may bee <hi>in via perficiendorum,</hi> which
Divines allow to Monaſticall life, but not <hi>Perfectorum,</hi>
which, by them, is only due to prelacy; For vertue is
even, and continuall, and the ſame, and can therefore
breake no where, nor admit ends, nor beginnings; It
is not only not broken, but not tyed together. He is
not vertuous, out of whoſe actions vou can pick an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
one. Vice and her fruits may be ſeene, becauſe
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:22691:182"/>
they are thick bodies, but not vertue, which is all light.
And vices have ſwellings and fits, and noiſe, becauſe
being extremes, they dwel far aſunder, and they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
both a foraine warre againſt vertue, and a civill
againſt one another, and affect ſoveraignty, as vertue
doth ſociety. The later Phyſitians ſay, that when
our naturall inborne preſervative is corrupted or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and muſt be reſtored by alike extracted from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
bodies, the chiefe care is, that the mummy have
in it no excelling quality, but an equally digeſted tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per:
And ſuch is true vertue. But men who have
preferred money before all, thinke they deale honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
with vertue, if they compare her with money:
And think, that as mony is not called baſe, til the allay
exceed the pure; So they are vertuous enough, if they
have enough to make their actions currant, which is,
if either they get praiſe, or (in a lower abaſing) if they
incurre not infamy or penalty. But you know who
ſaid <hi>Anguſta innocentia eſt ad legem bonum eſſe,</hi> which
rule being given for poſitive lawes, ſevere miſtakers
apply even to Gods law, and (perchance againſt his
commandement) binde themſelves to his counſailes,
beyond his lawes. But they are worſe, that think that
becauſe ſome men formerly waſtfull, live better with
halfe their rents then they did with all, being now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
with diſcretion and experience, therefore
our times need leſſe morall vertue then the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we have Chriſtianity, which is the uſe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of all vertue. As though our religion were but
an art of thrift, to make a little vertue goe far. For as
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:22691:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>
plentifull ſprings are fitteſt, and beſt become large A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queducts,
ſo doth much vertue ſuch a ſteward and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
as a Chriſtian. But I muſt not give you a Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for a letter. I ſaid a great while ſince, that cuſtome
made men like; We who have beene accuſtomed to
one another are like in this, that we love not buſineſſe.
This therefore ſhall not be to you nor me a buſie let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
I end with a probleme, whoſe errand is, to aske

               </opener>
               <p>THis Teuſday morning, which hath brought me to
London, preſents mee with all your letters. Mee
thought it was a rent day, I meane ſuch as yours, and
not as mine. And yet ſuch too, when I conſidered
how much I ought you for them. How good a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how fertile and abundant the underſtanding is,
if ſhee have a good father. And how well friendſhip
performes that office. For that which is denyed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
generations is done in this of yours. For hers is
ſuperfaetation, child upon child, and, that which is
more ſtrange, twinnes at a latter conception. If in my
ſecond religion, friendſhip, I had a conſcience, either
<hi>Errantem</hi> to miſtake good and bad, and indifferent,
or <hi>Opinantem</hi> to be raviſhed by others opinions or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
or <hi>Dubiam</hi> to adhere to neither part, or <hi>Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puloſam</hi>
to encline to one, but upon reaſons light in
themſelves or indiſcuſſed in mee (which are almoſt all
the diſeaſes of conſcience) I might miſtake your often,
long, and buſie letters, and feare you did but intreate
me to have mercy upon you and ſpare you. For you
know our court tooke the reſolution, that it was the
beſt way to diſpatch the French Prince backe againe
quickly, to receive him ſolemnely, ceremoniouſly;
and expenſively, when he hoped a domeſtique and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:22691:184"/>
entertainment. I never meant to excell you in
waight nor price, but in number and bulke I thought
I might: Becauſe he may caſt up a greater ſumme who
hath but forty ſmall moneyes, then hee with twenty
Portugueſſes. The memory of friends, (I meane only
for letters) neither enters ordinarily into buſied men,
becauſe they are ever employed within, nor into men
of pleaſure, becauſe they are never at home. For theſe
wiſhes therefore which you wonne out of your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and recreation, you were as excuſable to mee if
you writ ſeldome as Sir H. Wotton is under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of buſineſſe or the neceſſity of ſeeming ſo: Or
more then hee, becauſe I hope you have both pleaſure
and buſineſſe. Only to me, who have neither, this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
were ſinne. For though writing be not of the
precepts of friendſhip, but of the counſells: yet, as in
ſome caſes to ſome men counſells become precepts,
though not immediately from God, yet very roundly
and quickly from his Church, (as ſelling and dividing
goods in the firſt time, continence in the Romane
Church, and order and decency in ours) ſo to mee
who can doe nothing elſe, it ſeemes to binde my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to write. And it is ſinne to doe againſt the
conſcience, though that erre; Yet no mans letters
might be better wanted then mine, ſince my whole let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is nothing elſe but a confeſſion that I ſhould and
would write. I ought you a letter in verſe before by
mine owne promiſe, &amp; now that you thinke you have
hedged in that debt by a greater by your letter in verſe
I thinke it now moſt ſeaſonable and faſhionall for mee
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:22691:184"/>
to breake. At leaſt, to write preſently were to accuſe
my ſelfe of not having read yours ſo often as ſuch a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
deſerves from you to mee. To make my debt
greater (for ſuch is the deſire of all, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or meane not to pay) I pray reade theſe two
problemes: for ſuch light flaſhes as theſe have
beene my hawkings in my Surry journies. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
them with another ragge of verſes, worthy
of that name for the ſmalneſſe, and age, for it hath
long lyen among my other papers, and laughs at them
that have adventured to you: for I thinke till now you
ſaw it not, and neither you, nor it ſhould repent it.

               <p>IN the hiſtory or ſtile of friendſhip, which is beſt
written both in deeds and words, a letter which is
of a mixed nature, and hath ſomething of both is a
mixt parentheſis: It may be left out, yet it contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
though not to the beeing, yet to the verdure,
and freſhneſſe thereof. Letters have truly the ſame
office, as oathes. As theſe amongſt light and empty
men, are but fillings, and pauſes, and interjections:
but with waightier, they are ſad atteſtations: So are
letters, to ſome complement, and obligation to others.
For mine, as I never authorized my ſervant to lye in
my behalfe (for if it were officious in him, it might be
worſe in mee) ſo I allow my letters much leſſe that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
diſhoneſty, both becauſe they goe from mee more
conſiderately, and becauſe they are permanent, for
in them I may ſpeake to you in your chamber a yeare
hence before I know not whom, and not heare my
ſelfe. They ſhall therefore ever keepe the ſincerity
and intemerateneſſe of the fountaine whence they are
derived. And as whereſoever theſe leaves fall, the
root is in my heart, ſo ſhall they, as that ſucks good
affections towards you there, have ever true impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof. Thus much information is in very leaves,
that they can tell what the tree is, and theſe can tell
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:22691:185"/>
you I am a friend and an honeſt man. Of what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
uſe, the fruit ſhould ſpeake, and I have none: and
of what particular profit to you, your application and
experimenting ſhould tell you, and you can make none
of ſuch a nothing; Yet even of barren Sicamores, ſuch
as I, there were uſe, if either any light flaſhings, or
ſcorching vehemencies, or ſudden ſhowers made you
need ſo ſhadowie an example or Remembrancer. But
(Sir) your fortune and minde do you this happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,

not you and mee, but the Spheare in which your

to God: for me thinkes the new Aſtronomie is
thus applyable well, that wee which are a little earth
ſhould rather move towards God, then that hee
which is fulfilling, and can come no whither, ſhould
move towards us. To your life full of variety, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is old, nor new to mine. And as to that life, all
ſtickings and heſitations ſeeme ſtupid and ſtony, ſo to
this, all fluid ſlipperineſſes and tranſitory migrations
ſeeme giddy and feathery. In that life one is ever in
the porch or poſterne, going in or out, never within
his houſe, himſelf: It is a garment made of remnants, a
life raveld out into ends, a line diſcontinued, &amp; a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſmall wretched points; uſeleſſe, becauſe they
concurre not: A life built of paſt &amp; future, not propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
any conſtant preſent. They have more pleaſures
then wee, but not more pleaſure: they joy oftner, wee
longer; and no man but of ſo much underſtanding as
may deliver him from being a foole, would change
with a mad-man, which had a better proportion of
wit in his often <hi>Lucidis.</hi> You know, they which
dwell fartheſt from the Sunne, if in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
diſtance, have longer dayes, better appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:22691:186"/>
better digeſtion, better growth, and longer life.
And all theſe advantages have their mindes who are
well removed from the ſcorchings, and dazlings, and
exhalings of the worlds glory; but neither of our lifes
are in ſuch extremes; for you living at Court without
ambition, which would burne you, or envy which
would deveſt others, live in the Sunne, not in the fire;
and I which live in the Country without ſtupifying,
am not in darkneſſe, but in ſhadow, which is not no
light, but a pallid, watriſh, and diluted one. As all ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
are of one colour if you reſpect the body from
which they are caſt (for our ſhadows upon clay will be
dirty, and in a garden greene, and flowery,) ſo all rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
into a ſhadowie life are alike from all cauſes, and
alike ſubject to the barbarouſneſſe and inſipid dulnes
of the countrie: Only the employment, and that upon
which you caſt and beſtow your pleaſure, buſineſſe,
or bookes, gives it the tincture, and beauty. But truly
whereſoever we are, if wee can but tell our ſelves truly
what &amp; where we would be, we may make any ſtate &amp;
place ſuch: For we are ſo compoſed, that if abundance,
or glory ſcorch &amp; melt us, we have an earthly cave, our
bodies to go into by conſideration, &amp; coole our ſelves:
and if we be frozen, and contracted with lower and
darke fortunes, wee have within us a torch, a ſoule,
lighter and warmer then any without: we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>BEcauſe I am in a place and ſeaſon where I ſee every
thing bud forth, I muſt do ſo too, and vent ſome
of my meditations to you; the rather becauſe all other
buds being yet without taſte or vertue, my letters may
be like them. The pleaſantnes of the ſeaſon diſpleaſes
mee. Every thing refreſhes, and I wither, and I grow
older and not better. My ſtrength diminiſhes, and my
load growes, and being to paſſe more and more
ſtormes, I finde that I have not only caſt out all my bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſt
which nature and time gives, reaſon &amp; diſcretion,
&amp; ſo am as empty &amp; light as vanity can make me, but
I have over-fraught my ſelfe with vice, and ſo am rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
ſubject to two contrary wrackes, ſinking and
over-ſetting, and under the iniquity of ſuch a diſeaſe
as enforces the patient when hee is almoſt ſtarv'd, not
onely to faſt, but to purge; for I have much to take in,
and much to caſt out. Sometimes I thinke it eaſier to
diſcharge my ſelfe of vice then of vanity, as one may
ſooner carry the fire out of a roome then the ſmoke:
And then I ſee it was a new vanity to thinke ſo. And
when I thinke ſometimes, that vanity, becauſe it is
thinne and airy, may be expelled with vertue or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
or ſubſtantiall vice; I finde that I give entrance
thereby to new vices. Certainly as the earth &amp; water,
one ſad, the other fluid, make but one body: ſo to vice,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:22691:188"/>
and vanity, there is but one <hi>Centrum morbi.</hi> And that
which later Phyſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſay of our bodies, is fitter for our
mindes; for that which they call deſtruction, which is a
corruption and want of thoſe fundamentall parts
whereof we conſiſt, is vice: And that <hi>Collectio Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum,</hi>
which is but the Excrement of that corruption,
is our vanity and indiſcretion. Both theſe have but
one root in mee, and muſt bee pulled out at once, or
never. But I am ſo far from digging to it, that I know
not where it is. For it is not in mine eyes only, but in
every ſenſe, nor in my concupiſcence only, but in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
power and affection. Sir, I was willing to let you
ſee how impotent a man you love, not to diſhearten
you from doing ſo ſtill (for my vices are not infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
nor wandring, They came not yeſterday, nor
meane to goe away to day: They Inne not, but dwell
in mee, and ſee themſelves ſo welcome, and finde in
mee ſo good bad company of one another, that they
will not change, eſpecially to one not apprehenſive,
nor eaſily acceſſible) but I doe it, that your counſell
might cure mee, and if you deny that, your example
ſhall, for I will as much ſtrive to be like you as I will
wiſh you to continue good.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Hope you are now welcome to London, and well,
and well comforted in your fathers health and love,
and well contented that we aske you how you doe, and
tell you how we are, which yet I cannot of my ſelfe;
If I knew that I were ill, I were well; For we conſiſt
of three parts, a Soule, and Body, and Mind: which I
call thoſe thoughts and affections and paſſions, which
neither Soule nor Body hath alone, but have beene
begotten by their communication, as Muſique reſults
out of our breath and a Cornet. And of all theſe the
diſeaſes are cures, if they be knowne. Of our Soules
ſickneſſes, which are ſinnes, the knowledge is, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
and that is her phyſick, in which wee are
not dieted by drams and ſcruples, for we cannot take
too much. Of our bodies infirmities, though our
knowledge be partly <hi>ab extrinſeco,</hi> from the opinion of
the Phyſitian, and that the ſubject and matter be flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and various; Yet their rules are certaine, and if
the matter be rightly applyed to the rule, our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof is alſo certaine. But of the diſeaſes of
the minde, there is no Cryterium, no Canon, no rule;
for, our owne taſt and apprehenſion &amp; interpretation
ſhould be the judge, and that is the diſeaſe it ſelfe.
Therefore ſometimes when I finde my ſelfe tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:22691:189"/>
with jollity, and love of company, I hang leads at
my heeles, and reduce to my thoughts my fortunes,
my yeares, the duties of a man, of a friend, of a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
of a father, and all the incumbencies of a family.
When ſadneſſe dejects me, either I countermine it
with another ſadneſſe, or I kindly ſquibs about mee
againe, and flie into ſportfulneſſe and company. And
I finde ever after all, that I am like an Exorciſt, which
had long laboured about one, which at laſt appeares to
have the Mother, that I ſtill miſtake my diſeaſe. And
I ſtill vexe my ſelfe with this, becauſe if I know it not,
no body can know it. And I comfort my ſelfe becauſe
I ſee diſpaſſioned men are ſubject to the like ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For divers mindes out of the ſame thing often
draw contrary concluſions, as Auguſtine thought de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
Anthony to bee therfore full of the holy Ghoſt,
becauſe, not being able to read, he could ſay the whole
Bible, and interpret it. And Thyraeus the Jeſuite for
the ſame reaſon doth thinke all the Anabaptiſts to be
poſſeſſed. And as often out of contrary things men
draw one concluſion. As, To the Romane Church,
Magnificence and Splendor hath ever beene an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods favour, and Poverty and Affliction, to
the Greeke. Out of this variety of mindes it proceeds,
that though all our Soules would goe to one end,
Heaven, and all our bodies muſt goe to one end, the
Earth: Yet our third part, the minde, which is our
naturall Guide here, chuſes to every man a ſeverall
way. Scarce any man likes what another doth, nor, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly,
that which himſelfe. But, Sir, I am beyond my
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:22691:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
purpoſe; I meant to write a letter, and I am fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a diſcourſe, and I doe not only take you from ſome
buſineſſe, but I make you a new buſineſſe by drawing
you into theſe meditations. In which yet let my open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
be an argument of ſuch love as I would fain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
in ſome worthier faſhion.</p>
