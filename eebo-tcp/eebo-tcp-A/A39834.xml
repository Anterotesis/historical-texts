            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The ſaid Perſon, afterwards falling upon ſome other Tranſlations, declin'd the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Title, and ſubſcrib'd himſelf thereto, thus, <hi>By the Tranſlator of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> as conceiving his rendring of that Author the moſt conſiderable of his performances.</p>
            <p>That Edition wearing out, the
<pb facs="tcp:45539:4"/>
Book-ſeller concern'd therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of putting forth a ſecond. In order to the coming forth of this, Dr. <hi>Meric Cauſabon</hi> took ſome pains, that is, he continu'd the firſt Tranſlation, but with ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here and there, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiv'd the firſt Tranſlator might have rendred the places otherwiſe, that is, more to the ſence and deſigne of <hi>Florus,</hi> than he had done. He alſo illuſtrated ſeveral paſſages with learned Notes and Animadverſions of his own, worthy productions of ſo eminent a perſon. This ſecond Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion came forth during the late Troubles, that is, ſince the year 1651.</p>
            <p>The ſaid ſecond Edition alſo, in time, growing ſcarce, it was thought requiſite to put forth a Third, which ſhould not onely comprehend the alterations made by Dr. <hi>Caſaubon</hi>; but alſo be abſolutely different, through the whole Book, from the firſt. And this is the attempt of this

by order from his Brother, is not certainly known. He certainly prov'd the firſt victime, and conſecrated the fortification of the new City with his blood. He had fram'd rather the Idaea of a City, than a City. Inhabitants were wanting. Hard by, there was a grove; he made it a Sanctuary; and immediately great numbers of men, <hi>Latines,</hi> ſome Shepherds, <hi>Tuſcians,</hi> and ſome from beyond the ſeas, <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,</hi> who came [into thoſe parts] under the conduct of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and <hi>Arcadians,</hi> under that of <hi>Evander,</hi> came into him. So, of diverſe principles he made up one body as it were, and was himſelf the founder of the <hi>Roman</hi> people. But a people of men onely could laſt but one age. They therefore deſired to inter-marry with their neighbours, which not obtain'd by fair means, was effected by force. For pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew ſome exerciſes on Horſeback, the Virgins who came to the ſhow, became a prey; and that occaſion'd Wars. The <hi>Veientes</hi> are defeated, and put to flight: The City of the <hi>Caeninenſes</hi> was taken and deſtroy'd. Beſides, the King himſelf, with his own hands, brought the rich ſpoils of their King, to <hi>Jupiter Fere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius.</hi> The gates [of <hi>Rome</hi>] were betrayd to the <hi>Sabines</hi> by a Virgin, not fraudulently; but ſhe had deſir'd for her reward what they had on their left arms; whether ſhe meant their ſhields or bracelets is doubtful. They to keep
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45539:7"/>
their word, and be reveng'd of her, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed her with their ſhields. So the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being got to the walls, there was a ſharp engagement in the very <note n="*" place="margin">In Foro.</note> Forum: ſo that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi> pray'd to <hi>Jupiter</hi> to put a ſtop to the ſhameful retreat of his people. Thence came the Temple, and [name of] <hi>Jupiter Stator.</hi> At length, the [Virgins who had been] ſurpriz'd, run in between the engaged parties, with their hair diſhevell'd. So a peace was made with <hi>Tatius,</hi> and a league entred into; and a ſtrange thing follow'd, [to wit] that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, leaving their own habitations, remov'd into the new City, and beſtow'd the wealth of their Anceſtors on their Sons in law, as a portion [with their Daughters.] Their forces being in a ſhort time increaſed, the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent King reduc'd the Commonwealth to this ſtate, that the young men, being divided into Tribes, ſhould be ready, with Horſe and Armes, for any unexpected occaſions of War; that the counſel of the Commonwealth ſhould be managed by the old men, who, for their authority were called <hi>Fathers</hi>; for their age, a <hi>Senate.</hi> Theſe things thus ſetled, while he was ſpeaking to the people, without the City, neer the Pool of <hi>Capra,</hi> he was of a ſudden taken out of their ſight. Some think him cut to pieces by the Senate, for the harſhneſſe of his diſpoſition; but the tempeſt then riſing, with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45539:7"/>
an Eclipſe of the Sun, were look'd on as argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Apotheoſis.

               <p>BUt our continual Enemies (by reaſon of their yearly Incurſions) were the <hi>Veiëntes</hi> [a people] of <hi>Etruria</hi>; ſo that the ſingle Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the <hi>Fabij</hi> promis'd an extraordinary Aſſiſtance, and waged a private war againſt them.

               <p>AFter this, either through the envy of the Gods, or by deſtiny, the ſwift current of the proſperous Empire was check'd a little by the incurſion of the <hi>Galli Senones,</hi> which time, whether it were more diſmal in reſpect of the loſſes [which happened to the <hi>Romans,</hi>] or more memorable for the diſcoveries of their

gallantry, I know not. So extraordinary was the calamity, that I think it ſent from above, as a tryal, whereby the immortal Gods would diſcover, whether the Romane vertue might deſerve the Empire of the World. The <hi>Galli Senones,</hi> a Nation naturally ſavage, utterly unacquainted with morality, beſides of great ſtature, and uſing armes proportionable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, were ſo terrible in all reſpects, that they ſeem'd born, for the deſtruction of men, and deſolation of Cities.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="362"/>
intercede for their Aſſociates and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes. According to cuſtome, Ambaſſadors were ſent. But what juſtice [could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted] among Barbarians? They grow the more inſolent, and thereupon reſolve upon a fight. Riſing therefore from <hi>Cluſium,</hi> and taking their march towards <hi>Rome,</hi> the Conſul <hi>Fabius</hi> meets them with an army, at the River <hi>Allia.</hi> The defeat at <hi>Cremera,</hi> was not more ſhameful; and therefore <hi>Rome</hi> numbers that day among the unfortunate. The [Romane] Army being defeated, they approach'd the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45539:18"/>
Walls of the City, wherein there was no Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Then it was, or never, that the true Roman greatneſſe of mind appeared. Firſt the more ancient, who had exerciſed the higheſt charges of Magiſtracy, meet in the <hi>Forum,</hi> and the Prieſt performing there the ceremony of devowing, they conſecrate themſelves to the Gods preſiding over the dead; and returning immediately thence every one to his own houſe, as they were then in their long Robes, and their richeſt ornaments, they ſeated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Ivory Chairs, that when the enemy came, they might die in their dignity. The Prieſts and Flamens taking what was moſt ſacred in the Temples, bury part in the ground, put up in empty casks, and carry part along with them in Wagons. The Veſtal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins alſo, barefoot, follow their ſacred myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries departing [from the City.] Then is it reported, that <hi>L. Albinius,</hi> one of the meaner ſort of people, took in the diſtreſs'd Virgins into his cart, putting out of it his wife and children. So far at that time, and amidſt thoſe extremities, did the conſideration of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick devotion ſmother private concernments. The choice youth (hardly amounting to the number of a thouſand, as is certain) went into the Capitol, under the command of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> praying <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whom they conſider'd as there preſent, that as they were come thither
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45539:18"/>
to defend his Temple, ſo he would protect their valour with his Deity. In the mean time, the <hi>Gaules</hi> were approach'd, and finding the City open, entred it, at firſt with a certain fear, leſt there might be ſome ambuſh, but afterwards, finding all quiet, they ruſh in, with ſhouting and violence. They go into the houſes ſtanding wide open, where at firſt having worſhipped the venerable Senators ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their Ivory Chairs, having on their purple Robes, as if they had been Gods or Genii, afterwards finding them to be men, and thoſe not deigning to anſwer them, they maſſacre them with a cruelty great as their former veneration, burn the Houſes, and with fire, ſword, and help of hands lay the whole City deſolate, and even with the ground. Seven months (who would believe it?) the Barbarians found work enough about one mount, trying all the ways they could imagine, both day and night, to reduce it. Whom at length coming under [the Fortreſſe] in the night time, <hi>Manlius,</hi> alarm'd by noiſe of a Gooſe, forc'd down from the top of the mount; and, to diſcourage the enemies, though he was in great want of proviſions, yet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his confidence, he caſt down loaves of bread from the Fort. And on a certain day, he ſent <hi>Fabius</hi> the Prieſt out of the Fort, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to paſſe through the enemies guards,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45539:19"/>
to perform a ſolemn ſacrifice on the mount <hi>Quirinal.</hi> And he, by the protection of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, return'd ſafe through the midſt of the enemies weapons, and brought word that the Gods were appeaſed. At length, the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians wearyed out with their own ſiege ſelling their departure at a thouſand weight of gold, yet even in that inſolent enough, when into their ballance, though unequal, they alſo put a ſword, with this proud exprobration, <hi>Wo to the vanquiſh'd; Camillus</hi> falling of a ſudden upon the rear of them, made ſuch a ſlaughter, that all tracks of the former conflagration were defaced by a deluge of <hi>Gauliſh</hi> blood. Here we have reaſon to give thanks to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods for the greatneſſe of our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Since that the fire took away the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of the Shepherds, and that flame ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd the poverty of <hi>Romulus.</hi> For what was the effect of that conflagration, but that a City deſign'd to be the manſion of Men and Gods, ſhould not be deſtroy'd or laid deſolate, but ſeem rather cleanſed and expiated.

                  <hi>Campania</hi> is the nobleſt region, not onely of <hi>Italy,</hi> but even of the whole world. Nothing more pleaſant then its Aire; in a word it produces Flowers twice a year. Nothing more fertile then its Soile; whence it is called the Theatre of <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus.</hi> Nothing more hoſpitable then its ſhores. Here are thoſe noble harbors, <hi>Caieta, Miſenus,</hi> and <hi>Baiae,</hi> famous for its baths, <hi>Lucrinus</hi> and <hi>Avernus,</hi> which are as ſo many with-drawing-rooms of the Ocean. Here the mountains are cloath'd with vines, as the <hi>Gaurus, Falernus, Maſſicus,</hi> and the moſt pleaſant of all <hi>Veſuvius, Aetna's</hi> competitor in caſting out fire. The maritine Cities are <hi>Formiae, Cumae, Puteoli, Naples, Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culaneum, Pompeij,</hi> and <hi>Capua,</hi> the chiefeſt of all theſe Cities, heretofore accounted one of the three greateſt, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> being the other two. For this City, for thoſe Regions, the Roman people invaded the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi> a Nation, if you enquire after its wealth, armed with gold and ſilver weapons, and clad in garments of divers colours even to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe; if you reſpect their ſubtlety in laying ambuſhes, ſtragling in the receſſes of Woods and Mountains; if their rage and fury, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated for the deſtruction of <hi>Rome,</hi> by horrid imprecations, and humane ſacrifices; if their obſtinacy, the more enrag'd and irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by their misfortunes, after ſix breaches

Under <hi>Marcus Attilius Regulus,</hi> the war ſayled over into <hi>Africk.</hi> Yet were there ſome who trembled at the very name of the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Sea, the Tribune <hi>Mannus</hi> adding to the fear; but the General threatning him with the naked Ax, if he obey'd not, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd him to embarque, out of a fear of death. Whereupon, they made all the haſte they could with the advantage of Winde and Oars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were ſo much ſtartled at the arrival of their Enemies, that <hi>Carthage</hi> had been almoſt ſurpriz'd with the gates open. The firſt Booty gain'd by that war, was the City <hi>Clypea</hi>; for, on the Carthaginian ſhore, that was the firſt Fort and place of diſcovery; and ſo that and three hundred Fortreſſes more were laid deſolate. Nor had we to do with men-onely, but alſo with monſters, when, as if bred for the revenge of <hi>Africk,</hi> a Serpent of extraordinary bulk infeſted our Camp at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grada.</hi> But <hi>Regulus,</hi> whom nothing withſtood, having ſpread the terror of his name far and near, and either ſlain a great number of their young men, and divers of their Commanders, or made them priſoners, and ſent the Navy home before him loaden with prey, and full of triumph, had alſo beſieg'd the Source of the war, <hi>Carthage</hi> it ſelf, and lay cloſe to the very gates of it.

For the enemies being forc'd to make uſe of forreign Aid, the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> ſent them <hi>Xantippus</hi> for a General, who being a moſt experienc'd perſon in Military Affairs, gave us ſo foul an Overthrow, that the moſt valiant General [of the Romanes] fell alive into the hands of the Enemies. But he was a man to ſupport ſo great a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. For neither Impriſonment among the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> nor the Embaſſy they forced him upon, could abate his conſtancy. For [being come to <hi>Rome</hi>] he urged things much different from what the Enemies had enjoyn'd him, to wit, that no Peace ſhould be made with them, nor any exchange of Priſoners. Nay his voluntary return to the enemies, nor the extremities of impriſonment and ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious crucifixion, took off nothing of his gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry; but rather being the more to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all theſe, what may be ſaid of him, but that being vanquiſh'd, he triumphed over his vanquiſhers, and, becauſe <hi>Carthage</hi> had not yeelded, of Fortune it ſelf? And the people of <hi>Rome</hi> were more eager and exaſperated to proſecute the revenge of <hi>Regulus,</hi> then to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the victory. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> growing ſo much the more inſolent, and the war being brought back into <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Conſul <hi>Metellus</hi>

gave the enemies ſo great an overthrow at <hi>Panormus,</hi> that there was no conteſtation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in that Iſland. An argument of the greatneſſe of the Victory, was the taking of about a hundred Elephants; which had been a great prey, had they not been taken in war, but in hunting. <hi>P. Claudius</hi> being Conſul, the <hi>Romans</hi> were not worſted by the enemies, but by the Gods themſelves, whoſe auſpices they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="504"/> had ſlighted, the navy being there ſunk, where he had commanded the birds to be caſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, becauſe they would have diverted them from engaging. <hi>M. Fabius Buteo</hi> being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, they defeated, in the <hi>African</hi> Sea, neer <hi>Aegyniurus,</hi> the enemies Fleet then bound for <hi>Italy.</hi> O what a great triumph happened then! when their navy fraught with wealthy prey, being forc'd by contrary winds, fill'd <hi>Africk,</hi> and the <hi>Syrtes,</hi> and the coaſts and ſhores of all nations and Iſlands, with their own wrack. Great was the loſſe, but without any derogation from the dignity of the ſupreme people, that their Victory was intercepted by a Tempeſt, and a wrack depriv'd them of their triumph. And yet, while the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> ſpoils floated up and down, caſt upon Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montories and Iſlands, the people of <hi>Rome</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="512"/> triumphed. <hi>Lutatius Catulus</hi> being Conſul, there was a period put to the war, at the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands called <hi>Aegates.</hi> Nor was there any grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45539:34"/>
Sea-engagement than this; for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Fleet, being over burthen'd with provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſoldiers, military engines, ammunition, as if all <hi>Carthage</hi> had been there, it prov'd the occaſion of its ruine. [On the contrary] the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet was clean, light, and nimble, and as it were reſembling a Land-Camp, or an engagement of Horſe, and guided by the Oars as with reines, and directed their beaks, here and there, as occaſion ſerv'd, as if they had been animate. So that the enemies ſhips being ſhatter'd of a ſudden, cover'd the whole Sea between <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia</hi> with the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of their wrack. In fine, ſo great was the Victory, that there was no thought then of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the walls of their enemies, ſince they thought it frivolous, to expreſſe their rage againſt Towers and Walls, when <hi>Carthage</hi> had been already deſtroy'd upon the Sea.</p>

With what expedition it was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, four years witneſſe: with how little difficulty, may be deduc'd from one City, for it was taken the ſame day it was firſt beſieg'd; and it was an omen of our victory over <hi>Africk,</hi> that <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> was ſo eaſily taken. Yet is it certain withal, that what moſt contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the reduction of the Province, was the admirable Sanctimony and continency of the General, who return'd back to the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, young lads that had been taken, and Virgins of extraordinary beauty, not having ſuffered them to be brought into his ſight, that he might not ſeem ſo much as with his eyes to have blaſted the flower of their Virginity. Thus did the <hi>Romans</hi> do in forreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, yet could they not remove <hi>Hannibal,</hi> lodg'd in the heart of <hi>Italy.</hi> Several Nations had revolted to the enemy, who being exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated againſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> made his advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="544"/> of the artifices of <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet had we forc'd him out of ſeveral Cities and regions. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentus</hi> was come in to us.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45539:41"/>
gave him ſo much trouble, that he thereupon brought all his Forces againſt <hi>Rome.</hi> O people worthy the world's Empire, worthy the favour and admiration of Men and Gods! Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the greateſt extremities, they deſiſted not from their attempt, and while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the ſafety of the City, they neglected not <hi>Capua</hi>; but part of the Army being left there under the Conſul <hi>Appius,</hi> part having follow'd <hi>Flaccus</hi> to the City, they fought both preſent and abſent? What therefore do we wonder at? <hi>Hannibal,</hi> encamped within three <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="547"/>
miles of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ready to come on, the Gods, I ſay the Gods (nor is it a ſhame to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it) once more prevented him; for there fell ſuch exceſſive rains at every motion of his, and ſuch extraordinary winds, that it ſhould ſeem they had been ſent from above, to remove the enemy, not from Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [as the Gyants ſometime were] but from the Walls of the City and the Capitol. He therefore departed, fled, and retired to the extremities of <hi>Italy,</hi> leaving the City when he was juſt upon the point of aſſaulting it. This is a thing hardly worth mentioning, yet a pregnant argument of the magnanimity of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> that during the time the City was beſieg'd, the ground on which <hi>Hannibal</hi> was encamped, being publickly ſet to ſale, met with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſor. On the contrary, <hi>Hannibal</hi> deſirous
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45539:42"/>
to imitate our confidence, proferr'd to ſale the Goldſmiths ſhops of the City, but found no buyer: whence it may be ſeen, that the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies had alſo their preſages. But there had yet been nothing done anſwerably to ſo great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and favour of the Gods. For <hi>Aſdrubal, Hannibal's</hi> brother, was upon his march from <hi>Spain</hi> with a freſh Army, new-raiſed Forces, and other requiſites for the proſecution of the war. We had, no doubt, been ruin'd, if he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="--6."/> joyn'd his Brother; but <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Salinator</hi> defeat him as he was encamping his Army. <hi>Nero</hi> was employ'd about the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodging of <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the moſt remote part of <hi>Italy. Livius</hi> was gone into the contrary part, ſo vaſt, that is, the whole territory of <hi>Italy,</hi> where it is longeſt, lying between them. By what intelligence, with what expedition the Conſuls joyn'd their forces, and joyntly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd the enemy, and all without <hi>Hannibal's</hi> knowledge of any thing done, it is hard to give an account of. This is certain, that <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal,</hi> being aſſur'd of it, when he ſaw his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's head caſt into his camp, ſaid, <hi>I now ſee the unhappineſſe of Carthage.</hi> This was the firſt acknowledgement of the man, not without a certain preſage of the fate hanging over him. Now it was taken for granted, that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> even by his own confeſſion, might be vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. But the people of <hi>Rome</hi> heightned by ſo
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45539:42"/>
many proſperities, thought it a noble attempt to ſubdue that moſt irreconcileable enemy in his own Country <hi>Africk. Scipio</hi> therefore being <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="549"/>
General, they removing the main ſtreſſe of the war into <hi>Africk,</hi> began to imitate <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and to revenge the miſeries of <hi>Italy</hi> upon <hi>Africk.</hi> Good Gods! what forces of <hi>Aſdrubal,</hi> what <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="550"/>
Armies of <hi>Syphax</hi> did he defeat? How extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary were the two Camps which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd in one night by fire? In fine, he was not onely within three miles, but ſhook the very gates of <hi>Carthage</hi> with a ſiege. By which means he forc'd <hi>Hannibal</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> where he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5-0."/>
would have ſate brooding and ſettled himſelf. This was the greateſt day ſince the beginning of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when the two greateſt Generals of any that ever went before them, or came after them, one Conquerour of <hi>Italy,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5--."/>
the other of <hi>Spain,</hi> were diſpoſing their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in order to an engagement. But there paſs'd a Conference between them about ſome conditions of peace: They ſtood ſtill a while, fix'd by mutual admiration; but not agreeing upon a peace, the ſignal was given.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="604"/> THe third war, with <hi>Africk,</hi> was ſhort, both as to time (for it was compleated in four years) and in compariſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of leſſe difficulty: for our buſineſſe was not ſo much againſt men as againſt the City it ſelf, but if we conſider the event, it was of great conſequence: for by that means <hi>Carthage</hi> was deſtroy'd. And if a man conſider the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of former times; in the firſt, the war was onely begun, in the ſecond, almoſt diſpatch'd, in the third, quite ended. But the occaſion of this war was, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Articles of the Treaty, they had, but once indeed, prepar'd a Navy and Army againſt the <hi>Numidians,</hi> but had ſeveral times alarm'd the territories of <hi>Maſiniſſa.</hi> For the <hi>Romans</hi> had a kindneſſe for that good King, their Ally. When the war was reſolv'd upon, it wat propoſed, what ſhould be done after it were ended. <hi>Cato,</hi> out of an irreconcileable animoſity, gave his vote for the deſtruction of <hi>Carthage,</hi> even while other things were under

The Haven, and the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond walls were already diſmantled, when the Caſtle notwithſtanding, called the <hi>Byrſa,</hi> made ſuch reſiſtance, as if it had been another City. But though the deſtruction of the City was in a good forwardneſſe, yet [was it conſider'd, that] the name of the <hi>Scipio's</hi> was fatal to <hi>Africk.</hi> The Commonwealth therefore, pitching upon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="606"/> another <hi>Scipio,</hi> was deſirous the ſee an end of that war. He was the Son of <hi>Paulus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Macedonicus,</hi> and had been adopted by the Son of the great <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> preſuming he would be an ornament to his race; it being deſign'd that the Grand-child ſhould abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely lay deſolate that City which the Grand-father had brought neer its deſtruction. But as the bitings of dying beaſts are moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, ſo we found more work with <hi>Carthage</hi> half ruin'd, than when it was entire. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being forc'd into one Fortreſſe, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had alſo beſieg'd the Port. Whereupon, the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> made another Port, on the other ſide of the City, not with any deſign to get away: but even from that place, whence no man imagin'd it poſſible they ſhould eſcape, a new Fleet ſtarts up. In the mean time, no day, no night paſt, but ſome new work, engine, or forlorn did appear, like

The firſt <hi>Roman</hi> enſignes that paſt over the <hi>Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naean</hi> Mountains were under the conduct of the <hi>Scipio's, Publius,</hi> and <hi>Cneus</hi>; and they, in memorable fights, defeated <hi>Annon,</hi> and <hi>Aſdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, Hannibal</hi>'s Brother, and <hi>Spain</hi> had been carried as it were by the firſt attempt, if thoſe gallant men, ſupplanted in the height of their victory, had not fallen by <hi>Punick</hi> treachery, after they had got the better both by Sea and Land. So that <hi>Scipio,</hi> the revenger of his Father and Uncle, who was ſoon after ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Africanus,</hi> invaded it as it were a new and entire Province. And he in a ſhort time, having taken <hi>Carthage</hi> and other Cities, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it not enough to have forc'd the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> thence, made it a tributary Province,

But it is a greater matter to retain a Province then to make one. Generals were therefore ſent into ſeveral parts, ſometime to one, ſometime to another; and they, with much difficulty, and and many bloody engagements, brought into ſubjection thoſe ſavage Nations, which till then were free, and impatient of bondage. <hi>Cato,</hi> the Cenſor, after ſome fights, worſted the <hi>Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiberians,</hi> that is, the ſtrength of <hi>Spain.

               <p>THus went things in the Eaſt. But there was not the like quiet in the Southern parts.

For when the <hi>Romans</hi> were glorious, and unconquerable by the way of Arms, this moſt ſubtle Prince engages againſt them by that of wealth; and yet it fell out beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that a King famous for his artifices ſhould be enſnar'd by artifice. He being Grand-child to <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> and Son by adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Micipſa,</hi> deſigning the murther of his Brethren, incited thereto by a deſire of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and yet fearing not them ſo much as the Senate and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> under whoſe tuition and protection the Kingdom was, compaſs'd his firſt miſchief by treachery; and having taken off <hi>Hiempſal's</hi> head, while he would have done the like to <hi>Adherbal,</hi> who had fled to <hi>Rome,</hi> he with the mony ſent by his Ambaſſadors brought even the Senate to ſide with him. And this was his firſt victory over us. Afterwards he in like manner treated thoſe who had been ſent to divide the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom between him and <hi>Adherbal,</hi> and having in the perſon of <hi>Scaurus</hi> [who ſuffer'd himſelf to be corrupted] overcome the integrity and cuſtomes of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, he proſecuted the wickedneſſe he had begun with greater confidence. But wicked actions lye not long conceal'd. The wickedneſſe of the corrupted Embaſſy [of <hi>Scaurus</hi>] came to light, and a war was reſolv'd upon againſt the Parricide. The Conſul <hi>Calpurnius Beſtia</hi> was the firſt ſent into

                  <hi>Numidia.</hi> But the King knowing by former experience, that gold could do more againſt the <hi>Romans</hi> than Iron, brought his peace. Of which hainous action being guilty, and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd upon a ſafe-conduct to appeare before the Senate, he with equal confidence both came and got <hi>Maſſina,</hi> Grand-ſon to <hi>Maſſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> his competitor to the Government, aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. This was another cauſe of the war againſt the ſaid King. The enſuing revenge is recommended to <hi>Albinus.</hi> But (ô diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour!) he in like manner ſo corrupted his Army, that by a voluntary flight of ours, the <hi>Numidian</hi> overcame, and became maſter of our Camp: and by a diſhonourable treaty, he ſuffered the Army, which he had before cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, to eſcape. About the ſame time, not ſo much to revenge the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as its honour, roſe up <hi>Metellus,</hi> who craftily ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy with his own artifices, while the other eluded him one while with intreaties, another, with threats, making alſo his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a feign'd as if it had been a real flight.

The firſt commotions of the <hi>Gauls</hi> began among the <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> who, ſeated between the <hi>Rhone</hi> and the <hi>Rhine,</hi> their Lands being too narrow for them, came to ſeek out other habitations, after they had fir'd the walls of their Cities, and taken an oath never to return. But time being required to conſider of it, and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> having in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, by breaking down the Bridge over the <hi>Rhone,</hi> deprived them of all means of flight, he drove back that moſt warlike Nation to their former aboads, as a Shepherd does his Flocks into the fold. The following fight with the <hi>Belgae</hi> was far more bloody, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a people who fought for their liberty.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45539:73"/>
Though the Roman Soldiery did many great actions upon this occaſion, yet this of <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf their General was highly remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when, the Army being inclin'd to flight, he took a Buckler from one that was running away, and running to the very Front, reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the fight with his own hands. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there was an Engagement at Sea with the <hi>Veneti</hi>; but we had a harder task with the Sea, than with the Ships: for theſe were rough, unſhap'd, and ſoon ſunk as ſoon as they felt our Beak-heads. But the ſhallows hindred the fight, as if the Ocean withdrawing it ſelf by its ordinary refluxes during the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement ſeem'd to intercede in the Quarrel. He had alſo to do with difficulties ariſing from the diſpoſition of Nations and places. The <hi>Aquitani,</hi> a crafty people, retired into Caves under-ground; he commanded them to be pent up in them. The <hi>Morini</hi> wandred into the Woods; he ordered them to be burnt. Let not any one ſay the <hi>Gauls</hi> were bruitiſhly ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they mannage their buſineſs with ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Induciomarus</hi> brought in the <hi>Treviri; Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biorix,</hi> the <hi>Eburones.</hi> Having entred into a conſpiracy, in <hi>Caeſars</hi> abſence, they met with his Lieutenants. But the former was gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated by <hi>T. Labienus,</hi> who brought away the Kings head. The latter having laid am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes in the valley, overcome us by craft;

whereupon our Camp was plunder'd, and all the Gold carried away. We there loſt <hi>Cotta,</hi> with the Lieutenant <hi>Titurius Rabinus.</hi> Nor could we ever after be revenged of that King who got over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and could never be ſeen. Nor did the <hi>Rhine</hi> therefore eſcape, it being not juſt a place that entertain'd and protected our enemies ſhould be free; but of the firſt Fight between <hi>Caeſar</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> there were juſt cauſes of his ſide. For the <hi>Bequani</hi> made complaints of their incurſions. What an haughtineſs was that of King <hi>Ario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſtus,</hi> when the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid to him, <hi>Come to Caeſar,</hi> reply'd, <hi>But who is Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar?</hi> And, <hi>If he will, let him come to me</hi>; And, <hi>What does it concern him what is done in our</hi> Germany? <hi>Do I meddle with the Romane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs?</hi> So that there was ſo great a terror of this new Nation in the Camp, that many made their Wills before they took up their Bucklers.

But there was a greater aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for perceiving their <hi>Rhine</hi> taken, and as it were yoaked with a Bridge, they again fled into the Woods and Marſhes, and what moſt troubled <hi>Caeſar</hi> was, that there were not any to be overcome. Being Maſter of all both at Sea and Land, he look'd upon the Ocean, and as if this world were not enough for the <hi>Romanes,</hi> he bethought him of another. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore got a Fleet together, he ſails towards <hi>Brittain.</hi> He croſs'd over with mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous ſpeed; for weighing from the Port of <hi>Morinum</hi> at the third Watch, he got the next day before noon into the Iſland. The ſhores were full of hoſtile tumult, and the chariots, trembling at the ſight of a ſtrange thing, went diſorderly up and down. Their fearfulneſs was look'd on as a preſage of our victory. He receiv'd their arms and hoſtages from the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and he had made a further progreſs, had not the Ocean chaſtis'd his bold Fleet
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45539:74"/>
with a wrack. Return'd thereupon into <hi>Gaul,</hi> and having reinforc'd his Fleet and Forces, he comes again into the ſame Ocean, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues the ſame <hi>Brittains</hi> into the <hi>Calidonian</hi> Woods, and puts <hi>Cavelianus</hi> one of their Kings into chains. Content with theſe things, (for the deſign was not to get Provinces, but Glory) he return'd back with a greater booty than before, the Ocean it ſelf being alſo more calm and favorable, as if acknowledging it ſelf inferior to him. But the greateſt and laſt conſpiracy of all, was that of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> when that Prince ſo dreadful for ſtature, martial skill, and courage, and whoſe very name was made to ſtrike a terror, <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> brought together into one body, the <hi>Aruerni</hi> and <hi>Bitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigae,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Carnutae</hi> and the <hi>Sequani.</hi> He, upon Feſtival days, and days of Aſſembly, when great numbers of them met in the woods, heightned them by his haughty expreſſions, to a recovery of their former liberty. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was then abſent, raiſing of new Forces at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna</hi>; and the <hi>Alps</hi> had ſo riſen in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they thought his paſſage ſtop'd. But what a fortunate temerity did this Meſſage force him upon? Over till then unpaſſable crags of Mountains, through unbeaten ways and ſnows, taking his march with a choice light-arm'd party, he comes into <hi>Gaul</hi>; he brought together his winter Gariſons, though
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45539:75"/>
at great diſtances, and was got into the midſt of <hi>Gaul,</hi> ere it was fear'd he might be coming from the remoteſt part of it. Then aſſaulting the Cities that were the cauſes of the War, he deſtroy'd the <hi>Avaricum,</hi> though defended by forty thouſand men; he fir'd <hi>Alexia,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though maintained by two hundred and fifty thouſand young men.

The covetouſneſs of this Conſul <hi>Craſſus,</hi> (a vice hateful to Gods and men) while he mindes nothing but <hi>Parthian</hi> Gold, was puniſh'd with the loſs of eleven Legions, and that of his own head; for that the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the people <hi>Metellus,</hi> had made horrid imprecations againſt him at his departure from <hi>Rome.</hi> And when the Army was paſt <hi>Zeugma,</hi> the <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſwallow'd our Enſigns forc'd into it by ſudden Whirlwindes; and when he had encamped at <hi>Nicephorium,</hi> the Ambaſſadors from King <hi>Orodes</hi> preſs'd him <hi>to call to minde the Leagues made with</hi> Pompey <hi>and</hi> Sylla.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45539:76"/>
the Gods, avenger of Leagues, promoted the Artifices and Valour of the Enemies. And firſt, <hi>Crassus</hi> left behinde him the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> the onely river whereby he could be ſupply'd with proviſions, and which ſerv'd him for a Rampart. Then he gave credit to a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Renegado, a <hi>Syrian,</hi> named <hi>Mazaras,</hi> by whoſe advice the Army being brought into a ſpacious Champian, lay open to the enemies of all ſides. So that he was hardly got to <hi>Carrae,</hi> but the Kings Generals, <hi>Syllaces</hi> and <hi>Surenas,</hi> diſplay'd their Enſigns glittering with Gold and Silk.

So having carried away his head, the enemy made ſport with it. His ſon they had kill'd with the ſame weapons, in his fathers ſight. The remainder of that unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Army, every one ſhifting for himſelf, was diſperſed into <hi>Armenia, Cilicia,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> ſo that there was hardly one left to bring the news of this defeat to <hi>Rome.</hi> His head and right hand being cut off, were carried to the

For as it was noble and praiſe-worthy to have reduc'd <hi>Gaul, Thrace, Cilicia,</hi> wealthy and powerful Provinces, as alſo the <hi>Armenians</hi> and <hi>Brittains,</hi> though not ſo much for the advantage, as the greater reputation of the Empire; ſo to have at the ſame time broke forth into civil diſtractions, and fought with our Allies, our Slaves, and Gladiators, and that the Senate ſhould be divided into Factions, is ſhameful and to be lamented. And I know not whether it had not been better for the <hi>Romane</hi> people to have contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> or indeed to have been without them, and confin'd their Government to <hi>Italy,</hi> than to arrive at ſo much greatneſs, as to be deſtroy'd by their own ſtrength.

Whence came it that the Knights diſſented from the Senate, to aſſume to themſelves the cognizance of judgements in Law, but from avarice, that the tributes of the Commonwealth, and the very judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Law might be converted to private lucre? Hence again came both the promiſe of communicating the freedom of <hi>Rome</hi> to all <hi>Latium,</hi> and by the means the wars with our Allies. What occaſion'd the ſervile wars, but the abundance of Families? What occaſion'd the <hi>Gladiators</hi> to raiſe Armies againſt their Maſters, but the profuſe liberality uſed to court the favour of the populace, who, being exceſſively taken with ſhowes, made that a profeſſion which was at firſt the puniſhment of our enemies?

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45539:85"/>
I know not by what name to call the war rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>Spartacus</hi>: as where the Soldiery were <hi>Slaves,</hi> and the Commanders <hi>Gladiators,</hi> thoſe the meaneſt of men by their condition, theſe added to their calamity by the ſcorn of their profeſſion. <hi>Spartacus, Crixus,</hi> and <hi>Oenoma,</hi> breaking <hi>Lentulus</hi>'s Fencing-ſchool, with sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty or more of the ſame quality, got away from <hi>Capua,</hi> and having call'd the Slaves into their aſſiſtance, and put them under their Enſignes, when they had got together above ten thouſand men, were not content onely to have made their eſcape, but would alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged. The <hi>Veſuvius</hi> was the firſt refuge theſe men were pleaſed to pitch upon. Where being beſieged by <hi>Clodius Glaber,</hi> they ſlip'd down the rifts of the hollow mountain with the help of cords made of vine branches, and got down to the very foot of it, and at the ſame time of a ſudden ſurpriz'd the General's Camp, who feared no ſuch thing. They after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards took another Camp. Then they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up and down <hi>Thora,</hi> and all <hi>Campania.</hi> And not content with the devaſtation of Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and Hamlets, they deſtroy all in <hi>Nola</hi> and <hi>Nuceria,</hi> and <hi>Metapont.</hi> Forces coming in daily, they became a compleat Army, and made themſelves Bucklers of twiggs and the skins of beaſts, and ſwords and other weapons of the Iron about the priſons. And that nothing
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:45539:85"/>
might be wanting to compleat the Army, they get horſe by taming thoſe they met with wild, and the Enſignes and Faſces taken from our Praetors they brought to their General. Nor did he refuſe them, though a perſon who of a mercenary <hi>Thracian,</hi> became a Soldier; of a Soldier, a Renegado, then a Robber, and at laſt upon the preſumption of his ſtrength, a Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. He alſo celebrated the funerals of his Commanders kill'd in fight with Princely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies, commanding ſuch as he had taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to fight about the funeral pile, as it were to expiate all <hi>Praetorian</hi> diſhonour, by becoming, of a <hi>Gladiator,</hi> a rewarder of thoſe who found him that divertiſement. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards engaging with Conſular Armies, he defeated that of <hi>Lentulus</hi> in the <hi>Appenine,</hi> and deſtroy'd the Camp of <hi>C.

faſten'd together with twigs, but vainly, by reaſon of the ſwiftneſſe of the current, at laſt ſallying out, they dy'd like men, and (as was fit under the conduct of a <hi>Gladiator</hi>) fought without reprieve. <hi>Spartacus</hi> behaving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gallantly in the front of the battel, fell like a General.</p>

               <p>THis onely wanted to compleat the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they might have a parricidial war amongſt themſelves, and that Citizens ſhould engage one againſt another, like <hi>Gladiators,</hi> in the midſt of the City and <hi>Forum,</hi> as in a Theatre. Yet would it grieve me the leſſe, if the wickedneſſe had proceeded from <hi>Plebeian</hi> Leaders, or if from Noble perſons, bad ones. But (ô indignity, what men, what Generals were they!) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> the glory and ornaments of their age, promoted that execrable evil with dignity, and it was carried on by three diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conſtellations, as I may ſay. The firſt was mean and ſlight, and rather a tumult then
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45539:86"/>
a war, the cruelty being onely between the Leaders: the next was more cruel and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the victory ſpreading through the Bowels of the Senate: the laſt exceeded in point of rage, not onely a civil but even a hoſtile fury, when the horrour of the war engag'd all the Forces of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>animoſities</hi> being exaſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo far, till there were not any to be kill'd. The beginning of the war proceeded from <hi>Marius's</hi> inſatiable deſire of honours, while he laboured to deprive <hi>Sylla</hi> of the Province de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd him. But <hi>Sylla</hi> impatient of the injury, brought about his Legions, and deferring the war with <hi>Mithridates,</hi> pour'd into the City at the <hi>Eſquiline</hi> and <hi>Colline</hi> gates, with two great bodies. Whence <hi>Sulpitius</hi> and <hi>Albinovamis</hi> oppoſing them with their Forces, and as alſo with poles and ſtones, and darts caſt of all ſides from the walls, <hi>Sylla</hi> alſo falls a throwing, and forc'd his paſſage by fire, and poſſeſſed himſelf as Conquerour, of the Fortreſſe of the Capitol, which had eſcaped the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Then by an edict of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, <hi>Sylla's</hi> adverſaries being adjudg'd ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the State, they exerciſed their fury on the preſent Tribune, and others of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faction. <hi>Marius</hi> by a ſervile flight eſcaped, or rather fortune reſerv'd him for another war. <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and <hi>Cn. Octavius</hi> being Conſuls,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45539:87"/>
the fire not well quench'd broke forth again, and that proceeded from their not agreeing among themſelves, when it was referr'd to the people, whether thoſe whom the Senate had condemn'd ſhould be recalled. They came to that aſſembly with their ſwords about them; but they who deſired quietneſſe prevailing, <hi>Cinna,</hi> leaving his Country, fled to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary party. <hi>Marius</hi> returns from <hi>Africk</hi> grown greater by his loſſe, in as much as impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, chains, flight, and exile had heightned his dignity. At the name of ſo great a perſon they flock to him from all parts; Slaves, and perſons condemn'd to priſons (ô horrour!) are put into Arms, and the unfortunate Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral eaſily got an Army together. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon returning to his Country by force, as he had by force been driven out of it, he might ſeem to have proceeded with ſome Juſtice, if he had not ſtain'd his cauſe with cruelty. But returning hateful to Gods and Men, at the firſt eruption of his fury, <hi>Oſtia,</hi> a place under the tuition and overſight of <hi>Rome,</hi> is with a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſtruction pillaged. Afterwards, with four Battalions he enters the City, the Forces being commanded by <hi>Cinna, Marius, Carbo,</hi> and <hi>Sertorius.</hi> Here all the Forces of <hi>Octavius</hi> were beaten off at the <hi>Janiculum,</hi> whereupon a ſignal was given for the murthering of the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45539:87"/>
Senators, which was effected with greater cruelty, than was exerciſed at the ſacking of <hi>Carthage,</hi> or the City of the <hi>Cimbri.</hi> The head of the Conſul <hi>Octavius</hi> is expoſed on the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra: that of <hi>Antonius</hi> a Conſular perſon is ſerv'd up to <hi>Marius</hi>'s table. <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Fim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bria</hi> are murther'd in their own Houſes. The two <hi>Craſſus</hi>'s Father and Son were kill'd in fight one of the other; <hi>Baebius</hi> and <hi>Numitorius</hi> were drawn through the midſt of the <hi>Forum</hi> by hooks of the common Executioners. <hi>Catulus</hi> avoided the ſport his enemies would have made with him, by ſwallowing burning coals. <hi>Merula, Jupiter's</hi> Prieſt in the Capitol, opening his veins made the blood guſh out into <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> eyes. <hi>Ancharius</hi> was run through the body in the preſence of <hi>Marius,</hi> becauſe when he ſaluted him, <hi>Marius</hi> did not reach to him that fatal hand of his. All theſe maſſacres of the Senate happen'd between the Calends and Ides of <hi>January,</hi> in the ſeventh Conſulſhip of <hi>Marius.</hi> What had been done, had he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the year? <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Norbanus</hi> being Conſuls, the third tempeſt of that civil rage, broke forth with greateſt fury, there being of one ſide eight Legions, on the other five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cohorts ſtanding to their Arms, beſides <hi>Sylla</hi> returning from <hi>Aſia</hi> with a victorious Army. And certainly, <hi>Marius</hi> having been
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45539:88"/>
ſo cruel, what cruelty muſt <hi>Sylla</hi> needs uſe to be reveng'd of him? The firſt engagement was at <hi>Capua,</hi> neer the River <hi>Vulturnus,</hi> where <hi>Norbanus's</hi> Army was ſoon defeated, and ſoon after all <hi>Scipio's</hi> Forces, baited with a hope of peace, worſted. Whereupon young <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Carbo</hi> being made Conſuls, as it were deſpairing of the victory, yet not to die unreveng'd, celebrated their own funerals with effuſion of the blood of the Senators, brought forth, as it were out of a priſon, to be kill'd. What funerals were there in the <hi>Forum,</hi> in the <hi>Circus,</hi> and in the open Temples? For <hi>Mutius Scaevola,</hi> the Prieſt, flying to the Altars of the Veſtals, hardly eſcapes burying in the same fire. <hi>Lamponius</hi> and <hi>Teleſinus,</hi> the Leaders of the <hi>Samnites,</hi> waſte <hi>Campania</hi> and <hi>Etruria</hi> with greater cruelty than <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> had done, and, under pretence of ſiding with <hi>Marius,</hi> reveng'd themſelves upon the <hi>Romans.</hi> At <hi>Sacriportus</hi> and the <hi>Colline</hi>-gate all the Forces of the enemies are cut off; at the former <hi>Marius,</hi> at the latter <hi>Teleſinus</hi> was defeated: yet did not the war end with the maſſacres. The ſword was drawn even in the time of peace, and they puniſh'd thoſe who had voluntarily ſurrendred themſelves. It is no leſſe remarkeable, that at <hi>Sacriportus</hi> and the <hi>Colline</hi> gate, <hi>Sylla</hi> ſlew above ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45539:88"/>
men. Then it was a war. But he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded four thouſand unarm'd Citizens, who had ſurrendred themſelves, to be kill'd in the place called <hi>Villa Publica.</hi> Are not theſe a great number conſidering it was in a time of peace? But who is able to compute thoſe whom any one that would might kill about the City? till <hi>Furfidius</hi> adviſing, that ſome ſhould be left alive, that there might be ſome over whom they ſhould rule, that great table was hung out, whereby two thouſand out of the order of Knights and the Senators were condemn'd to die. A ſtrange kind of Edict. It grieves me to relate after theſe things, the opprobrious treatment of <hi>Carbo, Soranus,</hi> the Praetor and <hi>Venuleius</hi> after their death. <hi>Boebius</hi> dy'd not by a ſword, but was torn to pieces as they do wild beaſts. <hi>Marius,</hi> the Generals Brother, having his eyes put out, and his hand and leggs cut off; at the Sepulchre of <hi>Catulus,</hi> was kept a while, that he might dy by degrees. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of particular perſons being over, the nobleſt municipal Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> were expoſed to ſale, <hi>Spoletium, Interamnium, Praeneſto,</hi> and <hi>Fluentia.</hi> But <hi>Sulmo,</hi> that ancient and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City in Allyance with us, not yet reduced, <hi>Sylla</hi> (ô heynous fact!) commanded it to be utterly deſtroy'd, as Hoſtages condemned

               <p>THe whole world being now in a manner overcome, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was grown too great to be deſtroy'd by any forrein Forces. Fortune therefore, envying the Soveraign people of the world, armed it to its own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. The rage of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Cinna</hi> had

For if we conſider the Generals, the whole Senate was divided into factions; if the Armies, we find on the one ſide eleven Legions, on the other, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, both conſiſting of the flower and ſtrength of <hi>Italy</hi>; if the aſſiſtance of confederates, there was on the one ſide the choice of the <hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> on the other <hi>Dejotarus, Ariobarza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, Tarcondimotus, Cothus,</hi> the whole Force of <hi>Thrace, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Macedonia, Greece, Italy,</hi> and all the Eaſt; if the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the war, we find four years, a ſmall time, conſidering the deſtructions; if the ſpace and ſtage, on which it was acted, we and it begun in <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſpread thence into <hi>Gaul</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and returning from the Weſt, it ſeated it ſelf with its whole burthen in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Theſſaly</hi>; thence it made a ſudden ſally into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> then return'd into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſtuck a while in <hi>Aſia</hi>; at laſt, returning into

                  <hi>Spain,</hi> there after ſome time receiv'd its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. But the animoſity of the factions ended not with the war. For they reſted not till the malice of thoſe who were conquer'd had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd it ſelf with the murther of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and that done in the very City, nay in the midſt of the Senate. The cauſe of this ſo great a calamity was the ſame with that of all the reſt, to wit, exceſſive proſperity. For <hi>Quintus Metellus,</hi> and <hi>Lucius Afranius</hi> being Conſuls when the Majeſty of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſpread all over the world, and the City celebrated the late-gain'd victories, and the <hi>Pontick</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian</hi> triumphs of <hi>Pompey,</hi> in the <hi>Pompeain</hi> Theaters, the over great power of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, raiſed a jealouſy (as it is often wont) in ſome buſy Citizens. <hi>Metellus,</hi> diſcontented at the abatement of his triumph over <hi>Creet, Cato,</hi> ever an enemy to the powerful, calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated <hi>Pompey,</hi> and found fault with his actions. The grief he conceavid thereat ſtuck like a dart in his boſom, and forc'd him to endeavour the ſupport of his authority. As chance would, then flouriſh'd <hi>Craſſus,</hi> a perſon eminent for his extraction, wealth, and dignity; yet thought he not himſelf wealthy enough. <hi>Caius Caeſar</hi> was in great repute for his eloquence, wit, and his being then Conſul. Yet was <hi>Pompey</hi> more eminent than either. So that <hi>Caeſar</hi> being
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45539:94"/>
deſirous to attain greater dignity, <hi>Craſſus</hi> to increaſe his, and <hi>Pompey</hi> to retain his, and all equally aiming at power, they eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd together to invade the Commonwealth. Making therefore every one of them his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their mutual Forces, <hi>Caeſar</hi> invades <hi>Gaul; Craſſus, Aſia; Pompey, Spain,</hi> with three very great Armies, and ſo the Empire of the World was divided among three Princes. That Government laſted ten years. They had till then been ballanc'd by a mutual fear of each other; but upon the death of <hi>Craſſus</hi> among the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and that of <hi>Julia, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's</hi> Daughter, who, married to <hi>Pompey,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd concord between the Father and Son-in-law, emulation ſoon diſcover'd it ſelf. <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whereupon, having, during the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Marcellus,</hi> made the firſt breach of the conſpiracy, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that is <hi>Pompey</hi> [by whom they were guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed] moved the appointing of a ſucceſſor to <hi>Caeſar</hi>; nor was <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf againſt it, if in the firſt Aſſembly for the election of Conſuls there were a reſpect had of him: which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

ten Tribunes had decreed to him though abſent, and that with <hi>Pompey</hi>'s approbation, but now upon the ſame perſon's indifference, it is deny'd; alledginig that <hi>he ſhould come and demand it after the ancient form.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Caeſar</hi> was earneſt for the paſſing of the decrees, proteſting he would not disband the Army, if they perform'd not their promiſes. Whereupon they decree againſt him as an Enemy. <hi>Caeſar</hi> mov'd at theſe things, reſolv'd, by Arms, to maintain the rewards of Arms. The firſt ſcene of the civil war was <hi>Italy,</hi> the Fortreſſes whereof <hi>Pompey</hi> had ſupply'd with ſlight Garriſons; but all, upon <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ſudden advance, were reduc'd. The Firſt encounter was at <hi>Ariminum</hi>; Whereupon <hi>Libo</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out of <hi>Etruria, Thermus</hi> out of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbria, Domitius</hi> out of <hi>Corfinium.</hi> And the war had been at an end without any bloodſhed, if <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as he had attempted it, could have ſurpriz'd <hi>Pompey</hi> at <hi>Brunduſium.</hi> But he made his eſcape by night through the cloſures of the beſieged port. A ſhameful thing to be ſpoken, that he, who not long before had been chiefeſt of the Senate, and the umpire of peace and war, ſhould venture himſelf in a torn and unarm'd veſſel into that Sea, on which he had trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed. <hi>Pompey</hi> had no ſooner got out of <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Senate left the City, which almoſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:45539:95"/>
emptied by fear, <hi>Caeſar</hi> entring into, makes himſelf Conſul. He alſo commanded the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Treaſury to be broke open, becauſe the Tribunes were tedious in the doing of it otherwiſe, and violently ſeiz'd the revenue and patrimony of the people, before he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſoveraignety. <hi>Pompey</hi> being forc'd to flight, he thought fitter to ſettle the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then follow him. <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> he ſecur'd by his Lieutenants, that he might be aſſur'd of proviſions. There was no hoſtility among the <hi>Gauls,</hi> he himſelf had made a peace there. But he paſſing through it againſt the <hi>Pompeian</hi> Armies in <hi>Spain, Maſſilia</hi> preſum'd to ſhut her gates againſt him. Wretched <hi>Maſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> out of a fear of war, falls into a war. But having ſtrong walls, he order'd it to be reduc'd in his abſence. That half-Greek City, not ſo delicate as the name might intimate, preſum'd to force the enemies Trenches, fire their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, and give them a Sea engagement. But <hi>Brutus,</hi> who manag'd the war, overcame it both by Sea and Land. At length ſurrendring themſelves, all was taken from them, their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty onely excepted, which they valued above all. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s war in <hi>Spain</hi> with <hi>Petreius</hi> and <hi>Afranius,</hi> Lieutenants under <hi>Cneius Pompeius</hi> was various, doubtful, and bloody, whom having their Camp at <hi>Illerda</hi> he attemps to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45539:96"/>
at the River <hi>Sicoris,</hi> and to ſhut up in the Town. In the mean time by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the River, happening commonly in the Spring, he was reduc'd to a want of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. So his Camp began to be ſenſible of famine, and the beſiege himſelf was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner beſieged. But the River returning within its channel, he ſcowres the coaſts with deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation and fighting, and fiercely playes upon them, and purſuing them in their retreat into <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> he compaſſed them in ſo with Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that thirſt forc'd them to a ſurrender. Thus the hither-part of <hi>Spain</hi> was reduc'd, nor did the further ſtand out long. For what could one Legion do, after the defeat of other five? Wherefore <hi>Varro</hi> ſubmitting of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, <hi>Gades,</hi> the ſtreight adjoyning to it, the Ocean it ſelf, all things comply'd with <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s proſperity. Yet fortune would do ſomewhat in oppoſition to the abſent General, on this ſide of <hi>Illuricum</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> as if of purpoſe to make his proſperities the more glorious by croſſe accidents.

The boats ſent to their relief by <hi>Baſilius</hi> for want of better veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were taken as in a toyl by a new ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of the <hi>Cilicians,</hi> on <hi>Pompey</hi>'s ſide, by faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rops under water. Yet the Tyde got off two of them, one, wherein were the <hi>Opiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> running a-ground wrought an effect worthy to be tranſmitted to poſterity. For a party of ſomewhat leſſe then a thouſand young men, held out a whole day againſt the force of the whole Army, ſurrounding them of all ſides; and finding they could not extricate themſelves by their valour, to avoid a ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, upon the encouragement of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, <hi>Vulteius,</hi> they ſlew one another. In <hi>Africa</hi> alſo, a ballancing of ſucceſſe and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune attended <hi>Curio,</hi> who being ſent to reduce the Province, and glorying in his defeating of <hi>Varus,</hi> was not able to ſtand the ſudden ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of King <hi>Juba</hi> and the <hi>Mauritanian</hi> horſe. The conquer'd had the convenience of flight, but ſhame perſwaded him to die with that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which his temerity had loſt. But fortune deſirous to quit ſcores, <hi>Pompey</hi> had choſen <hi>Epirus</hi> for the ſeat of the war. Nor did <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſtay long behind; for having ſetled all things behind him, though it were the depth of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he embark'd in order to the proſecution of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:45539:97"/>
the war: and having encamped at <hi>Oricum,</hi> and part of the Army being left with <hi>Antonius</hi> for want of Ships and ſo forc'd to continue at <hi>Brunduſium,</hi> he was ſo impatient, that to get them over, though the winds and Sea were very high, he ventur'd out alone at midnight in a ſmall ſcout-veſſel. His ſaying to the Maſter frightned at ſo great danger is extant; <hi>What art thou afraid of?</hi> ſaid he, <hi>thou carrieſt Caeſar.</hi> Having brought all his Forces together, and the two Camps being neer one the other, the deſigns of the Generals were different. <hi>Caeſar</hi> naturally daring, and deſirous to compleat his work, embattell'd, challeng'd, provok'd the enemy, one while beſieging their Camp with a trench of ſixteen miles (but what injury could a ſiege do thoſe who having the Sea open, had plenty of all things?) another while by offering to aſſault <hi>Dyrrachium,</hi> though in vain (as being a place by its ſcituation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expugnable) and beſides with dayly skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, as the enemy ſally'd out (at which time the extraordinary valour of <hi>Scaeva</hi> the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion was remarkable, in whoſe Buckler were the marks of a hundred and twenty darts) and at length by plundring the Cities aſſociated with <hi>Pompey,</hi> deſolating <hi>Oricum</hi> and <hi>Gomphi,</hi> and other Fortreſſes of <hi>Theſſaly.</hi> On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Pompey</hi> hung off, and delay'd what he could,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:45539:97"/>
hoping to frighten the enemy, compaſſed of all ſides, with want of proviſions, and that the violence of that moſt daring General might abate. But he could make no longer advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of that prudent reſolution. For the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery blam'd the ſloath, the Aſſociates, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſſe, and the Senator, the ambition of the General. So the fates haſtening his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, he reſolv'd to fight it out in <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> and there in the <hi>Philippian</hi> Fields, the fates of the City, the Empire, nay of mankind are diſputed.

                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:45539:98"/>
who gave the firſt onſet, was obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for he being afterwards run into the mouth with a ſword, and ſo afterwards found among the Carcaſſes, ſhew'd, by the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the wound, with what earneſtneſſe and rage he had fought. Nor was the iſſue of the war leſſe admirable. For <hi>Pompey</hi> having ſo great a number of Horſe as that he thought to have ſurrounded <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he himſelf was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. For having fought long without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of eitheir ſide, and <hi>Pompey</hi> having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Horſe out of the right wing, of a ſudden, upon a ſignal given, the <hi>German</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, gave them ſo fierce a charge, that they ſeem'd to have been foot, and theſe mounted on Horſes. Upon that execution of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating Horſe enſu'd the overthrow of the light-armed men. Thereupon the terrour ſpreading farther and farther, and the whole Forces put to the rout, the remaining deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was compleated with little trouble.

Who would not have thought the war had been ended with <hi>Pompey?</hi> But the embers of the <hi>Theſſalian</hi> conflagration broke forth again into a much more violent flame; and in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there was war, without any of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s party engag'd in it. For <hi>Ptolemey,</hi> King of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> having committed the moſt heynous act of any during the civil war, and aſſur'd his Allyance with <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the means of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s head, fortune deſiring the <hi>manes</hi> of ſo great a perſon ſhould be revenged, there wanted not an occaſion. <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the King's ſiſter, falling at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s feet, demanded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of one part of the Kingdom. The
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45539:99"/>
young Virgin was beautiful, and what height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her beauty was, that, being ſuch, ſhe had ſuffered an injury; beſides he could not but have a horrour for the King himſelf, who had murther'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> not ſo much out of love to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as out of complyance with the preſent conjuncture, and would have treated him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, if it had been expedient. <hi>Caeſar</hi> therefore having commanded that <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra</hi> ſhould be reſtor'd to her own, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately beſieg'd in the Palace by the ſame perſons who had murther'd <hi>Pompey,</hi> and yet with a ſmall force ſtood out againſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of a vaſt Army. And firſt, firing the next Houſes and Ships, that were in the Port, he avoided the darts of his importunate ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; then he got off of a ſudden into the Peninſula of <hi>Pharos</hi>; and thence being forced into the Sea, by a ſtrange good fortune he ſwam to the Navy, that lay hard by, leaving behind him his Soldiers coat in the water, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by chance or out of deſign, that that might receive the darts and ſtones caſt by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Being thus received by his own Fleet and Soldiers, aſſaulting the enemies of all ſides, he performed the laſt obſequies to the manes of his Son-in-law, by being reveng'd on that cowardly and perfidious Nation. For not only <hi>Theodorus,</hi> the Kings Tutor (occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:45539:99"/>
of the whole war) but alſo thoſe men-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, the Eunuchs, <hi>Photinus</hi> and <hi>Ganimedes,</hi> making their eſcape differently by Sea and Land were conſum'd by exile and death. The King's body was found cover'd with ſlime, known onely by the gaudineſſe, of a golden breaſt-plate. In <hi>Aſia</hi> alſo, there broke forth now Commotions in <hi>Pontus,</hi> as if fortune had deſign'd the period of <hi>Mithridates</hi>'s Kingdom, that as the Father was overcome by <hi>Pompey,</hi> the Son ſhould be by <hi>Caeſar.</hi> King <hi>Pharnaces</hi> preſuming more upon our diſtractions then his own valour, with an offenſive Army inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Cappadocia.</hi> But <hi>Caeſar</hi> engaging him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him at one, and (as I may ſay) that not a compleat Battel: taking him like a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt, which in the ſame moment, comes, ſtrikes, and is gone. So that it was no vain aſſertion of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s, <hi>That the enemy was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ere he was ſeen.</hi> Thus went affairs with forreign enemies. But he had a harder task with our Country-men in <hi>Africk</hi> then at <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalia.</hi> Into theſe parts had ſome fluxe of fury forc'd the remainders of the wrack'd party; not remainders, but an entire war. The Forces were rather ſcatter'd than defeated. Nay the misfortune of their General engag'd them to a ſtricter proſecution of the war, nor did the ſucceeding Commanders degenerate from
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45539:100"/>
thoſe who had gone before them. For <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> ſounded full enough in ſtead of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s name. There were brought in additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Forces by <hi>Juba</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> to the end <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s conqueſts might ſpread the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There is therefore no difference between <hi>Pharſalia</hi> and <hi>Thapſus,</hi> ſave that in the latter the efforts of the <hi>Caeſarians,</hi> were greater and more violent, as being incenſed that the war ſhould have increaſed after <hi>Pompey</hi>'s death. Laſtly, what never happened before, the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounded a charge, before the General gave order for it. The overthrow began with <hi>Juba</hi>; his Elephants not accuſtomed to war, and not long before brought out of the woods, were ſtartled at the ſudden noiſe of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. Whereupon the Army was put to flight, and the chief Commanders could do no otherwiſe then endeavour an eſcape, when all were cut off nobly before them. <hi>Scipio</hi> was got away in a Ship, but the enemies having overtaken him, he fell upon his own ſword; and one asking, where he was, he himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd this anſwer, <hi>The General is well. Juba</hi> being got into his Palace, and having magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently treated his companion in flight <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treius,</hi> proffered himſelf to be killed by him in the midſt of the entertainment. <hi>Petreius</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd both the King and himſelf; and ſo the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45539:100"/>
half-eaten meats and the funeral meſſes were mixt with the blood of a King and a <hi>Roman. Cato</hi> was not in the fight, but having encamped at <hi>Bagrada,</hi> kept <hi>

For having diſmiſſed his Son and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with embraces, he went to bed, and after he had, by a light, read a while in <hi>Plato's</hi> Treatiſe, concerning the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> he took a little reſt: then about the firſt watch, having drawn his ſword, he thruſt it twice into his uncover'd breaſt. After which the Phyſicians would needs by violence trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the man with plaiſters. He bore with them till they were gone, but then opened the wounds afreſh, and there came forth ſuch abundance of blood, that his dying hands were congeal'd to the place.

Nay <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf ſeem'd dejected before the Army, not as he was wont to be, either out of a regard of humane frailty, or a miſtruſt of a too long continu'd proſperity, or fearing <hi>Pompey</hi>'s fate, ſince he began to be what <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> was. But in the midſt of the fight, there
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:45539:101"/>
happen'd an accident which no man could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he had heard before, when the two Armies were upon equal terms, and buſied in a mutual execution, in the greateſt heat of the work, there was of a ſudden a deep ſilence on both ſides, as if it had been by conſent. This was the general conceit of it. At laſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a misfortune which <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not ſeen before, the choice band of Veterans gave ground. And though that they had not fled, yet was their reſiſtance to be attributed rather to a certain ſhame, than valour. Whereupon <hi>Caeſar,</hi> lighting off his Horſe, runs like a diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perſon to the front of the Battel. There he ſtay'd ſuch as were ſhrinking, encourag'd them, and finally by his eyes, hands, and voice aſſures the whole body. It is reported that in that diſturbance, he was thinking of killing himſelf, and that it was apparent in his countenance, he would have haſten'd his own death, if five Cohorts of the enemies, croſſing the Battel, being ſent by <hi>Labienus,</hi> to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the <hi>Pompeian</hi> Camp then in ſome danger, had not ſeem'd as if they fled. Which <hi>Caeſar</hi> either really believ'd, or cunningly laying hold upon that occaſion, and charging them as a flying party, he both heightned the courage of his own people, and gave the enemy an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. For the <hi>Caeſarians,</hi> imagining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:45539:102"/>
Conquerors, purſue the more eagerly; on the other ſide, the <hi>Pompeyans,</hi> ſuppoſing their party ran away, began to fly. How great the ſlaughter of the enemies was, and how great the fury and animoſity of the victorious, may be gueſſed hence. When ſuch as had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the fight, had retreated to <hi>Munda,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> had given order that the vanquiſh'd ſhould immediately be beſieg'd, there was a rampire made of the carcaſſes brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which were faſten'd and kept in with ſpears and Javelins; a ſpectacle would have been abominable, even amongſt Barbarians. But <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Sons deſpairing of the victory, <hi>Cneus</hi> eſcaping out of the fight, wounded in the leg, and going towards the deſarts and unfrequented places, was overtaken at the Town of <hi>Lauro</hi> by <hi>Ceſennius,</hi> who there kill'd him fighting, ſo that he had not as yet deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. In the mean time fortune kept <hi>Sextus</hi> undiſcover'd in <hi>Celtiberia,</hi> and reſerv'd him for other wars after <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s time. <hi>Caeſar</hi> returns victor into his Country. His firſt triumph over <hi>Gaul</hi> was brought in by a repreſentation of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and the <hi>Rhone,</hi> and the captive Ocean in gold. The ſecond, the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Lawrel. In that was repreſented the <hi>Nile, Arſinoë,</hi> and the <hi>Pharus</hi> on fire. The third triumphal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, brought in <hi>Pharnaces</hi> and <hi>Pontus.</hi> The

Here at laſt, arms were laid down, the reſt of the peace was without bloodſhed, &amp; <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency made amends for the cruelties of the war. No man was put to death by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand but <hi>Afranius,</hi> ('twas enough that he had been pardoned once) and <hi>Fauſtus Sylla,</hi> (he had learnt to fear his Sons-in-law) and the Daughter of <hi>Pompey</hi> with her Couſin-germans deſcended from <hi>Sylla.</hi> This was to ſecure his poſterity. His Citizens, not ungrateful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all honours upon this one Prince; his Images are ſet up in the Temples, he hath in the Theatre a Crown ſurrounded with rays; a Chair of State in the Senate; a Terret upon his Houſe top, and is aſſign'd a month in the Heavens, and withal this is entituled, <hi>Father of his Country,</hi> and <hi>perpetual Dictator</hi>; laſtly, it is a queſtion whether with his conſent, regal ornaments were proffer'd him before the <hi>Roſtra</hi> by the Conſul <hi>Antonius</hi>: all which honours were done him, and ſeem'd as the garlands ſet about a Victim deſign'd to die. For the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of this Prince was envy'd, and the great power he had to confer benefits was inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:45539:103"/>
to free perſons. Nor did they delay it any longer; but <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> and others of the Senators conſpir'd the Prince's death. How inevitable is the blow of fate! The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy was known to many; nay a paper, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering it, was preſented that very day to <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, and of a hundred victims ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic'd, not one propitious. Yet he went to the Senate thinking on the <hi>Parthian</hi> expedition. There the Senate ſet upon him ſitting in his Chair of State, and layd him on the ground with three and twenty wounds.

                  <hi>BRutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> imagin'd to themſelves that they had put <hi>Caeſar</hi> out of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as King <hi>Tarquin</hi> had been: but that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which they thought to have reſtor'd they loſt by that very parricide. Being therefore afraid, after they had committed the murther of <hi>Caeſar's</hi> Veteranes, they fled out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate into the Capitol. The Soldiers had a deſire to be reveng'd, but they wanted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. When therefore it was apparent what deſtruction hung over the Commonwealth, all thoughts of revenge were layd aſide, upon an act of oblivion put out by the Conſul. However to be out of the eye of publick grief, <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius</hi> went into <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:45539:106"/>
the Provinces which had been beſtowed on them, by that <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whom they had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd. So <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s revenge was rather put off for a time, than quit ſmother'd. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth therefore being ſetled rather as it could, than as it ought, upon the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> and <hi>Lepidus</hi> left for the defence of the City, <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Antonius</hi> engage in a war againſt <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius.</hi> They having got very great forces together, pitch'd upon the ſame ſcene which had been fatal to <hi>Cneus Pompeius</hi>; nor wanted there at this time the manifeſt preſages of a decreed deſtruction: for thoſe birds which are wont to feed on dead carcaſſes were already ſeen flying about their Camp. A Negro meeting them as they were going to engage, was an apparent ſign of a diſmal event. And <hi>Brutus</hi> himſelf being retired after night, and a light brought him according to his cuſtom, a dreadful apparition ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, which being by him asked what it was? reply'd, <hi>Thy evil Genius.</hi> This ſaid, it vaniſh'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp, all the preſages, the Birds, and the Victims, promiſed proſperity: but nothing more remarkeable, than that <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Phyſician was admoniſhed in a dream, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſhould depart out of his own Camp, which were in danger to be taken, as it afterwards
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:45539:106"/>
happened. For the Armies being engaged, when they had fought ſome time with equal eagerneſſe, and though the chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were not then preſent, one by reaſon of ſickneſſe, the other through fear &amp; cowardize, the invincible fortune both of the perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging and him whom he reveng'd, declar'd which was to be the victorious ſide. At firſt the danger was doubtful and equal on both ſides, as the event of the battel made appear; on the one ſide <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp was taken, on the other, <hi>Caſſius</hi>'s. But how far more prevalent is fortune then vertue? and how true is that which <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaid at his death, <hi>That vertue was but a name, no real thing?</hi> The victory in this battel proceeded from a miſtake. <hi>Caſſius</hi> obſerving a wing of his Army to give ground, and ſeeing his Horſe retreating in full ſpeed, after they had taken <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Camp, upon an imagination that they were upon the rout, got to a Hillock, where the duſt and noiſe, and the approaching night, not permitting him to ſee what was done, and the ſcout he had ſent, to bring him an account, coming later than he expected, looking on his party as loſt, got one that was neer him to ſtrike off his head-<hi>Brutus</hi> having loſt all courage in the loſſe of <hi>Caſſius,</hi> that he might keep his promiſe with him (for ſo they had agreed to be equal ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:45539:107"/>
of the war) got one of his companions to run him through the body. Who cannot but admire, that theſe wiſe perſons would not diſpatch themſelves with their own hands? unleſſe it may be out of this perſwaſion, that they might defile them; but that, in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of their moſt ſacred and pious ſouls, the directions ſhould be theirs, and the crime of the execution another's.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Parthians,</hi> upon the defeat of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> had reaſſum'd greater courage, and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd the intelligence of civil commotions among the <hi>Romans</hi>: ſo that upon the firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, they ſtuck not to break out, being withal animated thereto by <hi>Labienus,</hi> who, ſent thither by <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> (how implacable is miſchief!) had importun'd our enemies to their aſſiſtance, and they, under the conduct of <hi>Pacorus</hi> their young Prince, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantle all the garriſons of <hi>Marcus Antonius.

                     <hi>The Alliance between the</hi> Romans <hi>and the</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians <hi>broken through the vanity of</hi> Marcus Antonius; <hi>The inconveniences endur'd by the</hi> Roman <hi>Army, and the generous reſolution of the Soldiery; the inſolence and brutality of</hi> Antonius.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THough in <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Brutus Caeſar</hi> had ſmother'd the factions, and in <hi>Pompey</hi> taken off the very name of them, yet had he not proceeded ſo far as to ſettle a firm peace, in as much as the ſhelf, the knot, and obſtacle of publick ſecurity, <hi>Antonius</hi> was ſtill alive. Nor did he want vices to bring him to his ruine; nay having out of ambition and luxury made tryal of all things, he delivered in the firſt place his enemies, then his fellow-Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and at length the age he liv'd in, from the terrour he gave them, [by procuring his own death.] The <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made tryal of each other, and <hi>Craſſus</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Pacorus</hi> on the other being teſtimonies of their valour, there was a league made between them with equal reverence and abſolute friendſhip, and that by <hi>Antonius</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:45539:110"/>
himſelf. But the exceſſive vanity of the man, while out of a luſt to enlarge his titles, he was deſirous to have the <hi>Araxes</hi> and the <hi>Euphrates</hi> written under his Images, made him leave <hi>Syria</hi> of a ſudden, and, without any cauſe, or advice, or ſo much as any imaginary pretence of war, (as if it had been the part of a great Captain to ſteal upon his enemies) make an unexpected incurſion among the <hi>Parthians.</hi> That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beſides the confidence they repoſe in their peculiar Arms, [is ſubtle] and pretends fear, and flight, croſſe the Fields. <hi>Antonius,</hi> as if already victorious, immediately purſues them, when of a ſudden, an unexpected, yet no great party of the enemies, fell upon our men wearied with marching, and in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as it had been a ſhower, and ſhooting their arrows of all ſides, two Legions were in a manner cover'd therewith. Yet was not this any thing in compariſon of the overthrow which was to have been the next day, if, through the clemency of the Gods, one who had ſurviv'd the defeat of <hi>Craſſus,</hi> riding about the Camp in a <hi>Parthian</hi> habit, after he had gain'd credit with the Commanders, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them with what was to happen; to wit, that the King himſelf withal his Forces was coming upon them, that they ſhould retreat, and get into the Mountains; and that ſo
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:45539:110"/>
doing they ſhould not haply be to ſeek an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. And ſo it happen'd that a ſmaller force of the enemies purſu'd them, then was deſign'd to do it. Yet they came on, and the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our Forces had been deſtroyed, had it not been, that, when the <hi>Parthian</hi> arrows fell like hail upon, the Soldiers luckily fell on their knees, and lifting their Bucklers over their heads ſeem'd as if they were ſlain. Then the <hi>Parthians</hi> gave over ſhooting with the bows. Whereupon the <hi>Romans</hi> riſing up, the thing was thought ſo miraculous, that one of the Barbarians ſaid, <hi>Go and do well, oh ye</hi> Romans; <hi>juſtly does Fame ſpeak you the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of Nations, who are able to endure the darts of the</hi> Parthians. We ſuffer'd afterwards as much through want of water, as we had done by the enemies. Firſt the Region it ſelf was oppreſſed with drought; then to ſome of us the water of the River <hi>Salmacis</hi> prov'd more deſtructive; and laſtly, being drunk exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, by ſuch as were unhealthy, even ſweet waters prov'd hurtful to us. Afterwards, the ſultrineſſe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and the ſnows of <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia,</hi> and the ſudden change of air from one to the other, were a kind of peſtilence: So, hardly a third part of ſixteen Legions being left, <hi>Antonius,</hi> that gallant General,

after his mony was cut to pieces with chizzels [by the mutining Soldiery] and he himſelf had in the interval begg'd death at the hands of his Gladiator, fled at length into <hi>Syria,</hi> where, out of an incredible ſtupidity, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more inſolent than before, as if he who had made his eſcape, had gain'd the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>LUſt and Luxury put an end to <hi>Antonius</hi>'s fury, though ambition could not. For after the expedition againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting war and giving himſelf over to ſloath, he fell in love with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and as if he had manag'd things excellently well, he enjoy'd himſelf in the embraces of a Princeſſe. This Aegyptian woman, deſires of the beſotted Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for the reward of her luſt, no leſſe then the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And <hi>Antonius</hi> promiſed it her, as if the <hi>Romans</hi> were more eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come than the <hi>Parthians.</hi> He therefore began to plot Soveraignty, not covertly, but, having forgot his Country, Name, Habit, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he abſolutely degenerated into that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, (a tyrant) not onely in his thoughts, but
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:45539:112"/>
alſo in his inclinations and attire. He walk'd with a golden ſtaff in his hand, had a Cimitar by his ſide, was clad in a purple garment, beſet with large Pearls; nay he wanted not a Diadem, that he might enjoy a Queen as a King. Upon the firſt intelligence of theſe new commotions, <hi>Caeſar</hi> croſſed the Sea at <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſium,</hi> to prevent the approaching war; and having encamped in <hi>Epirus,</hi> he ſurrounded the Iſland <hi>Leucades,</hi> and the Mount <hi>Leucates,</hi> and the points of the <hi>Ambracian</hi> Bay with a powerful Fleet. We had above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Ships, the enemies about two hundred, but their Bulk made up their number. For they had from ſix to nine Banks of Oars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides being raiſed up high with turrets and decks, like Caſtles and fortify'd Cities, they made the Sea groan, and put the winds out of breath to carry them; and that exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Bulk prov'd the occaſion of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Ships had from three to ſix banks of Oars, and none beyond: ſo that they were in readineſſe to take all advantages, whether to charge, recharge, or turn about; and diverſe of them at the ſame aſſaulting thoſe heavy and unweildy ſlugges, with their beaks, as alſo with darts, and fire caſt into them, they diſperſed them as they pleaſed
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:45539:112"/>
themſelves. Nor did the greatneſſe of the enemies Forces appear in any thing ſo much as after the victory. For that prodigious Fleet having been wrack'd in the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was ſcatter'd all over the Sea, became the ſpoil of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Sabaeans,</hi> and a thouſand other Nations of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Waves continually ſtirr'd by the Winds, caſt up Purple and Gold upon the ſhores. The Queen, beginning the flight, made to Sea with her Ship all gilt at the ſtern, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſails, and ſoon after <hi>Antonius</hi> follow'd; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> was not far behind him. So that neither their deſign'd eſcape into the Ocean, nor the two points of <hi>Aegypt, Paretonium</hi> and <hi>Peluſium,</hi> which they had fortify'd with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, ſtood them in any ſtead, in as much as they were in a manner within his reach. <hi>Antonius</hi> kill'd himſelf firſt. The Queen fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s feet, endeavour'd to dazzle his ſight; but in vain, for her beauty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayled not upon that Prince's chaſtity.

(ſo they call the Sepulchres of their Kings.)

The <hi>Illyrians</hi> alſo live under the <hi>Alps,</hi> and guard the lower Valleys and certain paſſages thereof, where they are ſecured by impetuous torrents. <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf engag'd againſt theſe, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Bridge to be made [to get over into their Province.] Being here put to a ſtand by waters and the enemy, he ſnatch'd the Buckler out of the hand of a Soldier who ſeem'd loath to get up on the Bridge, and march'd in the front of the Forces, when <note n="*" place="margin">Oum lubricus multitudine pons ſuccidiſſet.</note> the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſty Bridge ſhrinking down by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its being o'repreſſed with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, he was hurt in the hands and leggs, yet ſo as that deriving Majeſty from the danger, and the blood he had loſt rendring him the more amiable, he had the purſuit of the retreating enemy. The <hi>Pannonians</hi> are compaſſed by two Forreſts and three Rivers,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:45539:114"/>
                  <hi>Dravus, Savus</hi> and <hi>Iſter.</hi> Theſe having waſted their neighbouring Countries, retreated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the banks of their Rivers. He ſent <hi>Vibius</hi> to reduce them; and they were deſtroy'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the two Rivers: the Arms of the conquered were not burnt, according to the cuſtom, but were taken and thrown into the Rivers, to aſſure the reſt, who ſtood out, of our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The <hi>Dalmatians</hi> live for the moſt part in woods, and ſo ly moſt conveniently for Robberies. <hi>Marcius,</hi> having fir'd the City <hi>Delminium,</hi> had already given theſe a great blow. Afterwards <hi>Aſinius Pollio</hi> had puniſh'd them with the loſſe of their Flocks, Arms, and Fields. But <hi>Auguſtus</hi> recommends the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of them to <hi>Vibius,</hi> who forc'd thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages to dig the Earth and fetch pure gold out of its veins, which that moſt covetous Nation is ſufficiently inclined to do it ſelf, as if they ſeem'd to keep it for their own uſe. 'Tis a horrid thing to relate how ſavage and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane the <hi>Myſians</hi> are, nay how they exceed the barbariſm of other Barbarians. One of their Commanders coming up to our Army, deſir'd ſilence, and ſaid, <hi>Who are you?</hi> Anſwer was made, <hi>Romans, Maſters of Nations.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they reply, <hi>It ſhall be ſo, if you overcome us. Marcus Craſſus</hi> took it for a good omen. Whereupon the <hi>Myſians</hi> offering up a Horſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:45539:115"/>
before the Army, made a vow, That they would ſacrifice to their Gods the entrails of ſuch Captains as they kill'd of ours, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards eat them. I am apt to believe the Gods heard them: They could hardly endure the ſound of the Trumpets. The Barbarians were not a little ſtartled at an action of the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion <hi>Domitius,</hi> a perſon guilty of an extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance barbarous enough, yet prevalent upon people like himſelf, for having faſten'd a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand to his Helmet, the agitation of his body cauſed ſuch a flame, as if his head had been on fire. Before theſe, the moſt mighty people of the <hi>Thracians</hi> had revolted. Theſe Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians had learnt the cuſtom of carrying mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Enſignes, underſtood diſcipline, and the uſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Arms. But being ſubdu'd by <hi>Piſo,</hi> they ſhow'd their madneſſe even in their captivity, when, attempting to bite off their chains, they puniſh'd their own brutali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Dacians</hi> live in the Mountains. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of their King <hi>Cotiſo,</hi> when the <hi>Dannow</hi> is frozen over, they are wont to make incurſions, and deſtroy the bordering Countries. <hi>Caeſar Auguſtus</hi> thought it the beſt courſe, that a Nation ſo hard to come at ſhould be removed. To that end, he ſent <hi>Lentulus,</hi> who forc'd them beyond the further ſide of the River, and left Gariſion on this ſide. If <hi>Dacia</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:45539:115"/>
were not then conquer'd, it was at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to a great diſtance from us. The <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians</hi> ride up and down ſpacious Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians; <hi>Caeſar</hi> thought it enough, by the ſame <hi>Lentulus,</hi> to keep theſe from croſſing the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now,</hi> as having nothing but ſnows, and here and there ſome woods. The barbariſm is ſo great among them, that they know not what peace is. I wiſh <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not thought it ſo glorious a deſign to conquer <hi>Germany.</hi> It was loſt with more ſhame than it was ſubdu'd with honour; but in regard he knew that his Father <hi>Caeſar</hi> had twice cauſed Bridges to be made over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> for the proſecution of that war, he was deſirous, for his honour, to reduce it into a Province: and it had been done, if the Barbarians could as well have born with our vices, as ſubmitted to our commands. <hi>Druſus</hi> being ſent into this Province firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd the <hi>

they divided the prey before-hand. The <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſci</hi> were to have the Horſes, the <hi>Suevians</hi> the Gold and Silver, and the <hi>Sycambrians,</hi> the priſoners. But all happen'd quite contrary. For <hi>Druſus,</hi> being Conquerour, made a prey of their Horſes, their Cattel, their Gold-chains and themſelves, and ſold them. Beſides for the ſecurity of the Provinces he appointed gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons and guards at all places. All along the River <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Elbe,</hi> the <hi>Viſurgis,</hi> and on the banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he cauſed to be erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fifty Forts. At <hi>Bonna</hi> and <hi>Gelduba</hi> he cauſed Bridges to be built, and ſecur'd them with Ships. He made his way through the <hi>Hercynian</hi> Foreſt, till that time unpaſſable and inacceſſible. In fine, there was ſo great a peace in <hi>Germany,</hi> that the men ſeem'd changed, the ſoil different from what it was, and the air milder and calmer than it was wont to be. At length that young Prince of incomparable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour dying there, the Senate gave him a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name from the Province, (an honour it had never done any other) not out of flattery, but in acknowledgement of his merit. But it is more difficult to keep a Province than to make one: they are ſubdu'd by Arms, they are kept by Juſtice. That joy was accordingly but ſhort: the <hi>Germans,</hi> while <hi>Druſus</hi> was Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, were rather overcome than abſolutely
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:45539:116"/>
brought under ſubjection, and had rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with our manners, than ſubmitted to our Arms. After his death they began to hate <hi>Varus</hi> as well upon the account of his diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and pride, as his c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they who were long before <note n="*" place="margin">Moe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerent.</note> troubled to find their ſwords grown ruſty, and their Horſes foggy for want of exerciſe, thinking our habits and Laws more inſupportable than our Arms, break forth into open hoſtility, under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

more intolerable than the inſulting of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians, eſpecially upon the Advocats, putting out the eies of ſome, and cutting off the hands of others. One of them had his mouth ſow'd up, after they had before cut out his tongue, which one of the Barbarians holding in his hands, ſaid, <hi>O viper, give over hiſſing at length.</hi> Nay they digg'd up the Conſul's body, which the Soldiers had out of piety put under ground. The Barbarians have yet in their poſſeſſion the Enſignes and Eagles of two Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions; the third was ſav'd by the Enſign-bearer, who, to prevent its coming into the enemies hands, took it off, and hid it within the folds of his belt, and ſo eſcaped by skulking in that bloody march. The effect of this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw was, that the Empire, which had not ſtop'd at the <hi>Ocean,</hi> met with a check on the banks of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> Thus went things north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. In the Southern parts, there were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tumults than wars. The <hi>Muſulanians,</hi> and the <hi>Getulians,</hi> bordering upon the <hi>Syrtes,</hi> were reduc'd by <hi>Coſſus,</hi> whence he had the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name <hi>Getulicus.</hi> Nay the Victory ſpread far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Caeſar</hi> order'd the <hi>Marmarides</hi> and the <hi>Garamantes</hi> to be ſubdu'd by <hi>Furnius.</hi> He alſo might have return'd with the ſurname <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maricus</hi>; but his modeſty ſet not ſo high a value on his Victory. In the Eaſt there was
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:45539:117"/>
more to do with the <hi>Armenians</hi>; thither <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſent one of his Nephews. They were both ſhort-liv'd, but one dy'd ere he had gain'd any honour. For <hi>Lucius</hi> dy'd of a diſeaſe at <hi>Maſſilia; Cajus,</hi> in <hi>Lycia,</hi> of a wound, while he was employ'd about the reduction of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> then ready to revolt to the <hi>Parthians. Pompey</hi> having vanquiſh'd King <hi>Tigranes</hi> had brought the <hi>Armenians</hi> to this point of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as to receive Governours from us. That right of ours being interrupted was by this <hi>Caius</hi> reaſſerted, after a bloody though ſhort en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. For <hi>Domnes,</hi> whom the King had made Governor of <hi>Artaxata,</hi> pretending he would betray his Maſter, runs him with his Sword into the Temples while he was earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruſing a ſcroll, which he himſelf had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him, containing the accounts of the Treaſures. But the Barbarian purſu'd on all ſides by the incenſed Army was deſtroy'd by a ſword and a fire, into which, being wounded, he caſt himſelf, and ſo made ſome ſatisfaction to <hi>Caeſar</hi> not yet dead of his wound. In the Weſt, all <hi>Spain</hi> was quiet, ſave onely that part of it which is adjacent to the rocks of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean</hi> Mountains, and lies upon the hither Ocean. Here were two moſt valiant Nations, the <hi>Cantabrians</hi> and the <hi>Aſturians,</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:45539:118"/>
The <hi>Cantabrians</hi> were the firſt, the more inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and more obſtinate in the revolt; nay not content to maintain their own liberty, they attempted to rule over their neighbours, and harraſſed the <hi>Vaccaeans,</hi> the <hi>Curgonians,</hi> and the <hi>Autrigonians</hi> with their frequent incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Againſt theſe therefore, as ſuch as were reported to be the moſt daring, <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not put the expedition upon another, but went in perſon. Being come to <hi>Segiſama,</hi> he encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; afterwards dividing his Army, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the whole Country of <hi>Cantabria,</hi> and ſubdu'd that ſavage Nation, like wild beaſts taken in a toyl. Nor had they any quiet at Sea, where our Navy charg'd the enemies in the reare. The firſt engagement with the <hi>Cantabrians</hi> was, under the Walls of <hi>Vellica.</hi> Thence they fled to the moſt ſteepy Mountain <hi>Vindius,</hi> where they thought the Ocean would aſcend ſooner than the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the City <hi>Arracillum</hi> made great reſiſtance; but at laſt was taken, by the Siege of the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Mountain compaſſed with a trench of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles, by which means the <hi>Romans</hi> fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on of all ſides, and the Barbarians being reduc'd to the utmoſt extremities, they antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated their own deaths, ſome by fire, ſome by the ſword, in the midſt of their banquets, and ſome by poiſon, which is there commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:45539:118"/>
out of the Yew-trees, and ſo the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of them prevented that captivity, which they ſaw coming upon them. <hi>Caeſar</hi> wintring at <hi>Tarracon,</hi> a Sea-Town, receiv'd an account of theſe things done by <hi>Antiſtius, Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa,</hi> his Lieutenants. Being come to the Army he forc'd ſome out of the Mountains, engaged others by Hoſtages, and according to martial Law expoſed ſome to ſale as ſlaves. The Senate thought the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition worthy a Lawrel, worthy a triumphal Charriot. But <hi>Caeſar</hi> was already ſo great, as to ſlight Triumphs. The <hi>Aſturians</hi> having about the ſame time got a vaſt Army together were come down out of their Mountains; <note n="*" place="margin">Nec temere ſumptus, ut Barbari, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> nor was their attempt inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as is ordinary with Barbarians; but having encamped at the River <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtura,</hi> they divided their Forces into three bodies, and deſign'd to ſet upon the three Camps of the <hi>Romans</hi> at the ſame time. It had been a hazardous and a bloody bout, (<note n="*" place="margin">Et uticnam mutua clade certamen.</note> I wiſh the loſſe on both ſides had been but equal) we having to do with people ſo valiant, and coming upon us ſo unexpectedly, and with ſo much deliberation, if they had not been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd by the <hi>Brigaecini,</hi> by whom <hi>Cariſius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forewarned came with the Army and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
