            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Honorable Aſſembly of the Commons Houſe of Parliament, and to the Committie for grieuances of the ſame Houſe.</head>
            <head type="sub">The humble Petition of the whole companie of the poore Water-Tankerd-bearers of the Citie of London, and the Suburbs thereof, they and their families being 4000 in number, liuing and releeued thereby. <hi>Robert Tardy</hi> Water-bearer in the name and behalfe of the reſt followes this Petition.</head>
            <p>AMong the great multitude of poore diſtreſſed people of this kingdome, with ioyfull hearts and lifted vp hands to heauen, we your petitioners, haue iuſt cauſe to ſay. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſraell, that moued the heart of his gratious Maieſtie, to call ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable an aſſembly in Parliament, which will not ſuffer <hi>Gehazi,</hi> to take Tallents of Siluer, nor change of rayments, but that euery one, may ſit vnder his owne Oliue-tree, and annoint himſelfe with the fat thereof. Wee poore miſerable people labouring hardly for a poore liuing, vnder great burthens, haue the bread taken out of our childrens mouthes, and our one, both contrary to good lawes eſtabliſhed and all equity and good conſcience.</p>
            <p>For, moſt honourable aſſembly, to make this their grieuance plaine, that they are matters of truth, and no ſuggeſtions or inforcements. There was in the Parliament, holden in the 35. yeare of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, an Act made and prouided, concerning the repayring, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and amending, of the Conduits, in London, and that ſweete holſome running waters, and freſh ſprings, might be conueyed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, and fountaines, to the ſaid Conduits in London, and whereof the ſaid City, had bin before time well furniſhed, and abundantly ſerued.</p>
            <p>In the ſaid Act there was a carefull prouiſo, that it ſhould not be lawfull, for the ſaid Lord Maior nor commonaltie, nor to their ſucceſſors, or miniſters, to take away any water, or ſpring now brought, or hereafter to be brought, or conueyed, by Pypes or Trenches, to the manſion of any perſon or perſons, nor for any perſon or perſons, by any way, deceipt, meane, or any other craftie conueiance, ſhall vndermine, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, withdraw, or abate any Spring, or ſprings, found or hereafter to be found, now brought or conueyed, ſtopped, abated, or otherwiſe altered, from his dew courſe, and conueyance to the Conduits in London.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid water brought to the ſaid City, by vertue of the ſaid Act, is the moſt wholſome, pureſt, and ſweeteſt water, comming to the ſaid City, is not to be doubted or diſputable; and ſufficient ſtore thereof, at the ſpring heads. And yet notwithſtanding the ſaid former Act; moſt of the ſaid water is taken, and kept from the ſaid Conduits in London, by many priuate branches and Cockes, cut and taken out of the Pipes, which are layed to conuey the ſame, to the ſaid Conduits; and laid into priuate houſes and dwellings, both without and within the City; whereby it is drawne out of the wayes, and many times ſuffered to runne at waſte, to the generall grieuance of all good Citizens, and all others; repayring to the ſame, hauing their meat dreſſed with other waters, neither ſo pure nor holſome, as the Conduit water is, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience teacheth; contrary to the true intent of the ſame ſtatute.</p>
            <p>There are, as was confeſſed by the Cities Plumber, one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Randoll,</hi> fifteene branches or Cockes, laid into priuate houſes, and drawen from the Conduits, contrary to the prouiſo in the ſame Act: and three branches or Cocks, laid by himſelfe without warrant, only for his owne priuate gaine; by what warrant the other were granted to particular perſons, and taken from the common Conduits, we humbly deſire that firſt the ſaid <hi>Randoll,</hi> may be ſent for and examined, and afterwards ſuch other perſons as we ſhall produce, beſides many others, who may priuately take in water out of our maine pipes, and as yet vnknowne to the Petitioners.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the water granted vnto Newgate, for vſe of that houſe only, is caried forth daily by fiue men to many places, which Tankerd-bearers keepe no houres, but worke continually, and ſo exhauſt and draw away the water from the other Conduits.</p>
            <p>The Lady <hi>Swinnerton</hi> is allowed, but 2. gallons euery houre, (an ill preſident, and againſt the prouiſo, of the ſaid ſtatute of 35. <hi>Henry.</hi> 8. but that branch is ſo great, as it yeeldeth thirteene gallons and better euery houre as it hath beene tried, which many times runneth at waſte, if this one branch or Cocke, within this City doth or may draw away aboue a thouſand gallons extraordinarily from the Conduits in a weeke, what wrong ſo many branches without the City, where leſſe care is had, is to be taken into your Honourable conſideration.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the water that now ſerueth Alderman-bury Conduit, doth belong to the pipes of Cheapſide, and was lately cut out of the ſame, and that water which ſhould or would ſerue that Conduit of Alderman-bury, is wholy ſtopt or giuen to priuate houſes by the way.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Cornehill and Gracious-ſtreet men, complayning for want of water in their Conduits, there was three houres in a day abated by the Chamberlaine of the City, at the requeſt of the Plumber, from the Conduits <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Cheapſide, thereby to furniſh them with the more ſtore, being ill ſerued, by the ſame pipes, but yet Cornehill and Gracious-ſtreet Conduits haue neuer a whit more water, nor the houres yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the Conduits in Cheapſide.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, one of the maine and chiefeſt pipes runneth vnder part of Saint Martins Lane, and the Couen garden, in which places there are lately erected many new buildings and dwellings of Bricke; and it is ſuppoſed that digging deeper for the foundations, and finding the Pipes, they may take ſome priuate branches, out of their due courſe.</p>
            <div type="petition_proper">
               <p>Your Petitioners doe humbly deſire, for that there is great defect of water, in the ſaid conduits: and that it is a generall grieuance, to the whole City; and that diuers complaints, haue beene made by your Petitioners for redreſſe, but no reliefe can be procured, and are vtterly remedileſſe, but by this Honourable aſſembly, that wee the Petitioners, may be permitted to preferre our Bill into this Honourable houſe: For remedy of this grieuance, and as in duty we are bounden; ſo we will daily pray, that God may bleſſe all your counſels, to the benefit of all ſucceeding ages.</p>
