            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SERMON PREACHED At the Second general Meeting of the Gentlemen and others in and near <hi>London,</hi> who were Born within the County of <hi>York.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLES. iii. 10.</bibl>
               <q>I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoyce and to do good in his life.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> gives us an account of the several Experiments that <hi>Solomon</hi> had made in order to the finding out wherein the Happiness of Man in this World doth consist; and these Words are one of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions he drew from those Experiments.</p>
            <p>No man had ever greater Opportunities of Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the ways wherein men generally seek for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63169:4"/>
Contentment than he had; and no man did ever more industriously apply himself to, or took a greater liberty in enjoying those good things that are commonly most admired than he did: And yet after all his Labor and all his Enjoyments he found nothing but Emptiness and Dissatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>He thought to become Happy by Philosophy, <hi>giving his heart,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>to seek and search out</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 1. 13.</note> 
               <hi>all the things that come to pass under the Sun:</hi> Yet upon Tryal, he found all this to be <hi>Vanity and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He applyed his mind to Political Wisdom and other sorts of Knowledge, and his Attainments in that kind were greater than of any that were before him; yet he experienced at last that <hi>in Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 18.</note> 
               <hi>was much grief, and he that increaseth Knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth Sorrow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He <hi>proved his heart</hi> (as he tells us) <hi>with Mirth and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cap. 2. ver. 1, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Wine</hi> and all sorts of Sensual Pleasures to find if these were good for the Sons of men: and yet so far was he from his desired satisfaction in these things, that he was forced to <hi>say of Laughter that it was mad, and of Mirth what good doth it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He turned himself to works of Pomp and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, he built him stately <hi>Houses,</hi> and made him <hi>Gardens,</hi> and <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and <hi>Orchards,</hi> and<note place="margin">ver 4.</note> 
               <hi>Fountains.</hi> He increased his Possessions, and <hi>gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63169:4"/>
               <hi>Silver and Gold and the precious Treasures of Kings and</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 8.</note> 
               <hi>of the Provinces.</hi> He got him a vast Retinue, and kept the most splendid Court that ever any Prince of that Countrey did: yet (as he tells us) when he came to <hi>look upon all the works that his hands had</hi>
               <note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> 
               <hi>wrought, and on the labour that he had laboured to do, behold all was vanity and vexation of Spirit, and there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit under the Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But wherein then is there any Profit if not in these things? What is that good that the sons of men are to apply themselves to in order to their living as comfortably as the state of things here will allow? This question (after an intimation of the uncertainty and perplexedness of all humane events, but withal of the exactness of the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God <hi>who hath made every thing beautiful in its season,</hi> He thus resolves in the words of the Text, <hi>I know</hi> (saith he) <hi>that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoyce and do good in his life,</hi> that is to say,</p>
            <p>I have found by long experience that all the Happiness that is to be had in the good things of this life doth arise from these two things, <hi>Rejoycing</hi> in the enjoyment of them, and <hi>doing Good</hi> to others with them while we live. Take away these two Uses and there is no good in them.</p>
            <p>Or if you please we may Interpret the first part of his Proposition not of <hi>things</hi> but of <hi>men</hi> thus: I <hi>I know there is no good in them, i. e.</hi> I am convinced that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63169:5"/>
there is nothing so good for the sons of men; or, nothing that more contributes to their happiness in this world, than that every <hi>man should rejoyce and do good in his life.</hi> And to this purpose the words are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by several Interpreters, but it is no matter which of the sences we pitch upon, since in effect they come both to one thing.</p>
            <p>Two things then, <hi>Solomon</hi> here recommends to every one that would live comfortably in this world, <hi>Rejoycing</hi> and <hi>doing Good:</hi> and I do not know what can be more proper and seasonable to be recommended and insisted on to you at this time and on this occasion, than these two things; for the putting <hi>them</hi> in practice makes up the whole design of this Meeting.</p>
            <p>We are here so many Brethren met together to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> and to <hi>do Good.</hi> To <hi>Rejoyce</hi> together in the sense and acknowledgment of Gods mercies and Blessings to us, and in the enjoyment of Society one with another: And to <hi>do Good</hi> not only by encreasing our Friendship and Mutual Correspondence, but by joyning together in a chearful Contribution to those our Country-men that need our Charity. To entertain you therefore upon these Two Points seems to be my Proper Business.</p>
            <p>But in treating of them I shall make bold to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the order in which they are put in the Text, and shall first speak of <hi>doing Good</hi> though it be last
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63169:5"/>
named, and shall afterwards treat of <hi>Rejoycing.</hi> The truth is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>doing good</hi> in the order of nature goes before <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> for it is the Foundation of it. There can be no true joy in the Possession or use of any worldly blessings, unless we can satisfie our selves we have done some <hi>good</hi> with them. It is the <hi>doing good</hi> that sanctifies our other enjoyments and makes them matter of Rejoycing.</p>
            <p>Now in treating of this Argument I shall briefly endeavour these Three things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, I shall earnestly recommend to you the Practice of <hi>doing good</hi> upon several Considerations.</item>
               <item>Secondly, I shall represent the Practicableness of it, by shewing the several ways which every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (though in the meanest Circumstances) is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing good.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, I shall make two or three Inferences by way of Application.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the First thing, seriously to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the practice of <hi>doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where shall I begin to speak, either of the Obligations that lye upon us, or of the Benefits and Advantages that do accrue to us by <hi>doing good in our lives?</hi> or having begun, where shall I make an end? the subject is so copious that the study of a whole life cannot exhaust it. The more we consider it, still the more and the weightier Arguments will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63169:6"/>
present themselves to us to ingage us in the practice of it: and the more we practise it, still the more shall we <hi>desire</hi> so to do, and the more happy and Blessed shall we find our selves to be.</p>
            <p>For, to <hi>do good</hi> is nothing else but to act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the frame and make of our Beings. It is to gratifie those Inclinations and Appetites that are most strongly rooted in our Natures; such as Love and Natural Affection, Pity and Compassion, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of Friends and a Propensity to knot our selves into Companies and Societies: what are all these but so many <hi>stimuli,</hi> so many powerful incitements of nature to put us upon doing good offices one to another?</p>
            <p>To <hi>do good</hi> is the end of all those Acquisitions, of all those Talents, of all those Favours and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that God has blest us with, it is the proper use we are to put them to. If we do not employ them this way, we are so far from being <hi>better</hi> for them that we are much <hi>worse.</hi> What will signifie our Wit and good Humour, our Strength of Reason and Memory, our Wisdom and Knowledge, our Skill in Arts, and Dexterity in managing Business, our Wealth and Greatness, our Reputation and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in the world, I say what will all these signifie if they do not render us more Useful and Beneficial to others? That which sets the price and value upon every worldly blessing, is the Opportunity it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us of <hi>doing good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63169:6"/>To <hi>do good</hi> seems to be the foundation of all the Laws of Nature, the supreme Universal Law; it is that by which the World is supported, and take that away, all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would presently fall into confusion, And perhaps if it were particularly examin'd, it would be found that all the other Natural Laws may be reduced to this and are ultimately to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd into it. It is a question whether there be any natural Standard whereby we can measure the Virtue or the Viciousness of any Action, but the Influence that it hath to promote or hinder the <hi>doing of good.</hi> This is that that seems to stamp Virtue and Vice.</p>
            <p>To <hi>do good</hi> is the great Work for the sake of which we were sent into the world, and no man lives farther to any purpose than as he is an Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of doing good. Be our lives otherwise never so busie and full of action, yet if others receive no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them, we cannot give our selves any tolerable account of our time, we have in effect liv'd idly and done nothing.</p>
            <p>To <hi>do good</hi> is that which of all other services is most acceptable to God, it is that which he hath laid the greatest stress upon in the Scripture, it is that which he hath with the most earnest and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate perswasives, with the strongest Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the greatest promises and with the most dreadful threatnings enforc'd upon us. It is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63169:7"/>
that which he hath chosen before all Sacrifices and all Religious worship strictly so called to be serv'd with. It is that which he hath appointed for the great Expression both of our Thankfulness for his Benefits, and of our Love and Devotion to him. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it that which <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets make the Sum of the Old Law, and Christ and his Apostles the Sum of the New.</p>
            <p>And very great Reason there is for it; for to <hi>do good</hi> is to become most like to God. It is that which of all other Qualities gives us the greatest resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of his Nature and Perfections, for perfect<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 8.</note> Love and Goodness is the very Nature of God, and the Root of all his other Attributes; and there was never any Action done, any work wrought by him throughout the vast Tracts of infinite space, from the Beginning of time to this Moment, but was an Expression of his Love, and an instance of <hi>doing good,</hi> (nay I doubt not to say, the most severe acts of his Justice and Vengeance have all been such) And therefore with great reason hath our blessed Lord<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44, 45.</note> told us, that the way to become the Children of our Heavenly Father is to do good to all, with the same Freedom and Unreservedness that God makes his Sun to shine upon the World.</p>
            <p>And of this our Blessed Saviour himself was the most illustrious Example that ever appeared in the world, so that to <hi>do good</hi> is that which doth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63169:7"/>
most truly and perfectly render us the Disciples and Followers of Jesus, makes us really be what we pretend we are. His whole life (as the Gospel tells us) was but a continual going about doing good. The great Design of his Coming from Heaven, and of all that he spoke, and of all that he did, and of all that he suffer'd upon Earth, was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefiting of others. And he hath left it as the great distinguishing Badge and Character, whereby his Disciples should be known from other men, that they should <hi>love one another even as he had lov'd them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 34, 35.</note> that is (as his Apostle expounds him) they should love and do good to that degree as <hi>to lay down</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>their lives for the brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to <hi>do good</hi> is not only our greatest Duty but our greatest Interest and Advantage, which is that that <hi>Solomon</hi> chiefly refers to in the Text. It is certain that no man can take a more Effectual way to render his Being in the world Happy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to him (according to the ordinary course and event of things) in what Condition or Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances soever he is placed, than to do all the good he can in his life; so that though a man that lays out himself in this way, seems only to respect the good of other people, yet in true reckoning he most consults his own profit.</p>
            <p>For to <hi>do good</hi> in the natural way to raise us friends, who shall be oblig'd to contribute their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63169:8"/>
Endeavours to the furthering our honest designs; to the upholding and securing us in our Prosperity, and to the succouring and relieving us when we are in any evil Circumstances, such is the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and the Constitution of this World, that no man can subsist of himself, but stands in continual need of others both for their comfortable Society and their necessary Assistance in his Affairs. Now of all men living the Good man who maketh it his Business to oblige all about him, is most likely to be the best befriended.</p>
            <p>To <hi>do good</hi> is the truest way to procure to a mans self a Good name and Reputation in the World, which as it is a thing desirable upon many accounts, so it is a singular Advantage to a man for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on his secular designs. Nay to <hi>do good</hi> is to Embalm a mans name and to transmit it with a grateful Odour to posterity. <hi>The memory of a good</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 10. 7</note> 
               <hi>man shall be blessed.</hi> And the sence of mankind has always been, that too much honour could not be given to the name of those that have done good in their generation.</p>
            <p>But which is a great deal more than all this, to <hi>do good</hi> is the most certain effectual means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the blessing of God upon our endeavours, and to entitle our selves to his more especial care and providence and Protection: So that let what will come; in all circumstances and conditions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63169:8"/>
the good man has the greatest assurance that all things shall at least be tolerably well with him, and that he shall never be miserable. <hi>Trust in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 37. ver. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Lord</hi> (saith <hi>David) and be doing good,</hi> so <hi>shalt thou dwell in the Land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay further, to <hi>do good</hi> is to entail a blessing upon our Children after us. <hi>I have been young and</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. v. 25.</note> 
               <hi>now am old</hi> (saith the same Psalmist) <hi>yet saw I never the Righteous</hi> (that is the merciful and good man, for that is the Notion of the word in that place and in most others) such an one saw I never <hi>forsaken nor his seed begging their bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly to conclude this point, To <hi>do good</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all these advantages that attend it) is most to consult our own peace, and to make the best provision possible for our pleasure and delight. Charity (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> used to say) is really a piece of Sensuality. And <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself the great Master of Voluptuousness would confess that it was not only more Brave but more Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to do kindnesses than to receive them. And certainly every good man will find it so, for as the exercise of Charity and Beneficence is as truly a gratification of our Natural Inclinations and Appetites as any other action or thing that causeth pleasure to us: So is it also a gratification of those Appetites which are the highest and the noblest
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63169:9"/>
we have. Now by how much the appetite that is gratifi'd is more noble and divine; by so much must the delight that ariseth from that gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be more exquisite. So that it was no very great Hyperbole of our Divine Poet when he said that</p>
            <lg>
               <l>—————All joys go less</l>
               <l>Than that one joy of doing kindnesses.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And which is further to be considered, it is not with this pleasure as it is with most others that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish with the enjoyment, nay often leave bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and melancholy upon the mind after they are gone off. For to <hi>do good</hi> is a permanent pleasure, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that will last as long as our lives. The memory of our good actions will always be accompanied with Delight and Satisfaction; when all our other pass'd Enjoyments prove matters of anguish and torment to us upon our reflections on them, these will be a refreshment; and the nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> still the more comfort we shall find in them. Would we therefore treasure up to our selves a stock of lasting peace and joy to support us in all conditions of our life and so make our passage easie at our death, let us do all the good we can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63169:9"/>I think I have said enough to convince any one of the truth of <hi>Solomons</hi> Proposition that <hi>there is nothing better for a man,</hi> nothing that more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him either in point of duty or happiness <hi>than to do good in his life.</hi> Much more might be said, and what hath been said might have been said with more advantage, and greater evidence if it had been fit to insist upon every particular: but I will pursue this argument no further, but proceed to the second general point I propos'd, which is to set before you the practicableness of this great duty, by shewing the several wayes which every person though in the meanest Circumstances is capable of doing good.</p>
            <p>A great many there are that are as strongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced as may be that 'tis both their Interest and duty to be doing good in their lives, but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that it is not in their power, they have not any Means or Opportunities for it, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan themselves sadly upon this account, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives useless because they have not those visible Capacities of being serviceable to the world that others have.</p>
            <p>To such as these let me say this in the general: There is no condition in the world so mean and despicable, but yields us Opportunities of doing good. There is neither Old nor Young, Man nor
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63169:10"/>
Woman, Rich nor Poor, High nor Low, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nor Unlearned, but in their Sphere, by a good husbandry of those Talents that God has intrusted to their care and management they may be very useful to others, and prove instruments of much good to their generations.</p>
            <p>This truth St. <hi>Paul</hi> most elegantly sets forth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where he compares the Society of Christians to a Natural body. There he shews that as in the Natural body there are many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all those members have not the same dignity and honour, nor the same use or office: and yet every member (even the meanest) hath its particular use by which it doth real service to the body; nay so useful it is that the body cannot be without it: so it is with the Church of Christ and with every body politick. There is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both in the Church and in the State, that there should be variety of functions and callings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and conditions. There must be some to govern and some to be governed; there must be some more conspicuous, some more obscure; some whose gifts and endowments lay this way, and some whose Talents lay in another way; and yet there is not one of these but in his degree and station, either is or may be as useful as any that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Society. <hi>So that the eye cannot say to the hand</hi> (as our Apostle there expresseth it) <hi>I have no</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:63169:10"/>
               <hi>need of thee.</hi> Nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you, nay more, <hi>those members of the body</hi> (as he continues) <hi>that seem to be most feeble are yet very necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To reduce the Apostles notion to its particulars, or to shew in how many respects every individual person that is a Member of a Society is necessary to the publick, and either doth or may serve the Weal of it, and so do good in his life, is a task too great for me to undertake at this time, let it suffice at the present to propose to you these general heads.</p>
            <p>First of all none can want opportunities of doing good that is in a capacity of performing any acts of mercy or charity strictly so called whether that charity be shew'd to the bodies or souls of men. Now the instances and expressions of this way of doing good are infinite, as infinite as are the wants and necessities of mankind.</p>
            <p>To the bodies of men we do good when ever we contribute to the relieving and easing them of the outward pressures and wants, and necessities they lie under: Such as Sickness, Pain, Poverty, Hunger, Nakedness, Debts, Imprisonment, or any other outward affliction that falls upon them; whether that ease and relief be effected by our purse, or by our counsel and advice, or by our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:63169:11"/>And sure some one of these three things there is none so mean or inconsiderable in the world, but it is in his power to benefit his poor Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with.</p>
            <p>To the Souls of men we do good, whenever by our discourses or other endeavours we make men better or wiser; when we instruct the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, when we satisfie the doubtful, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce those that are misled by error, when we esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the weak, when we reprove those that do amiss, in a word, all our attempts and endeavours in what way soever to reclaim men from vice, and to bring them to wisdom and sobriety is a Charity to their Souls; and whether our designs succeed or not we shall be rewarded as those that have done good in the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, All the acts of Beneficence and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nay even of Civility and good Nature, are to be accounted among the instances of doing good. A man doth good not only by acts of Charity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly so called, but by every courtesie that he doth to another; He doth good by shewing his respect and good will to all about him, by reconciling dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among neighbours, and promoting peace, friendship and society as much as he can; by being Generous and Liberal and Hospitable according to his ability; by forgiving injuries, and if it be possible making friends of those that did them; by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63169:11"/>
being easie of access, and sweet and obliging in his carriage; by complying with the infirmities of those he converseth with, and in a word, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any way to make the lives of others more easie and comfortable to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, A man also doth good when he makes use of that acquaintance or friendship or interest, that he hath with others to stir them up to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that good which he by reason of the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness of his condition, or for want of Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity cannot do himself. This is a very conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable instance of doing good how slight soever it may seem; the man that exercises himself this way is doubly a benefactor; for he is not only an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good to the person or persons for whom he beg'd the kindness or the charity; but he does also a real kindness to the man himself whom he puts upon the benefaction, for God will not less reward his good will for being excited by another.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Another way to do good is to be careful and diligent, and conscientious in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of all those Publick Offices which we are call'd upon to execute in the place where we live. How burthensome soever these be, and how much soever of our time they rob us of, yet God by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to them, hath put a <hi>prize into our hands,</hi> (as the Wise man speaks) to do much good <hi>if we have hearts to make use thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63169:12"/>Fifthly, We do good when being in a private Capacity we so carry our selves in all the Relations in which we stand as the nature of the Relation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth. As for instance, when being Subjects we conscientiously obey the Laws of the Kingdom and submit to our Governours, and promote what we can the publick Peace both of Church and State. When being Masters of Families we take care of those under our Charge, making sufficient provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both for their Souls and bodies: When being Husbands or Wives we discharge faithfully all the Conjugal duties: When being Parents we love our children, and <hi>bring them up in the fear and nurture of the Lord.</hi> When being children <hi>we obey our Parents in all things.</hi> When being servants <hi>we do our work in singleness of heart, not as men-pleasers but as those that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they have a Master in Heaven.</hi> When having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted friendships we are secret and faithful, and prudent in the maintaining and preserving of them; and so proportionably in all the other relations that we stand in. All these things though they appear little, yet are they in their degree a real good and benefit to mankind, and so necessary that there is no living tolerably without them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, We also do good by an honest and a diligent pursuit of our calling and employment. There is no Art or Trade that we are bred to, but if it be a lawful one, it may be of great use to the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63169:12"/>
publick, and by well minding it, and fairly manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it we may render our selves very profitable members of the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and Lastly, We may do a great deal of good by our good Examples, by being to others Patterns of Piety and Prudence, of Diligence and Industry, of Peaceableness and Loyalty, of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Meekness and Temperance. In a word, every man that will make himself Eminent in any Virtue will be a Light to the world, his life will be a constant Sermon, and he will often prove as effectual a Benefactor to those about him by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample as others are by their Counsels and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>And now all these things considered, who is there among us in such deplorable Circumstances that he can reasonably pretend to want ability or opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to <hi>do good in his life?</hi> Sure I am he must live in a desart, and have no Communication with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that cannot some or other of these ways be useful and beneficial to them. And thus much of our Second Head of Discourse.</p>
            <p>I now come in the Third and last place to make some Application of what hath been spoken.</p>
            <p>And First, Since every man is so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd as we have seen, to do good in his life, let us all be perswaded seriously and heartily to apply our minds hereunto. Let us look upon it, not as a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63169:13"/>
a thing to be done now and then as there is occasion after our own turns are served: But let us lay out our selves upon it, let us propose it to our selves as the great Business of our lives. Let us take all opportunities for it, let us contrive and manage all our affairs so that they may some way or other be subservient to the carrying on this great work.</p>
            <p>Let this be the end of our gathering riches, and the measure of our expending them. To heap up riches that we may be rich, or to throw them away upon our lusts are both equally intolerable, it is the doing good with them that sanctifies both the getting and the spending them.</p>
            <p>Let this be the compass to steer and direct us in our pursuit after knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in our learning Arts and Sciences, in the managery of our Trades and employments; in a word, in the choice and in the prosecution of every design that is proposed to us. In all these things, the great enquiry is to be, what good will they tend to? How shall we be rendred more useful to the world, if our designs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours as to these matters do take effect?</p>
            <p>Let this be the great rule by which we proceed in the Education of our Children and Relations, and the provisions we make for them in the world. Let it be our first care to possess them with a deep sense of the duty they owe to the Publick, and to furnish them with such qualities as will render them profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble members of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to put them into such professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63169:13"/>
and employments as may afford them fair scope for the exercise of those qualities. If we thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, though we otherwise leave them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so small an Estate, yet with the Blessing of God they have a good Portion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, let this design of doing good influence our very Offices of Religion. When we make our appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the Throne of Grace, let us be sure to have the Publick always in mind; and even when we pray for our selves let it be with this design and resolution, that as God in mercy bestows upon us the Blessings and the Grace we pray for, we will employ them for the good of others.</p>
            <p>O that we would thus seriously concern our selves in doing good! O that we would once lay a side all our little selfish designs, and that narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and penuriousness of Spirit with which most of us are bound up; and with ardent Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity set our selves <hi>not to seek his own but every man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 24.</note> 
               <hi>good,</hi> as the Apostle exhorteth.</p>
            <p>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the doing good be so necessary a duty as hath been represented, what must we say of those men that frame to themselves Models of Christianity without putting this duty into its notion? There is a sort of Christianity which hath obtained in the world, that is made up of Faith and knowledge of the Gospel Mysteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any respect to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good works. Nay have we not heard of a sort of Christianity, the very perfection of which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63169:14"/>
seems to consist in the disparaging this duty of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good as much as is possible; crying it down as a heathen virtue, a poor blind piece of Morality, a thing that will no way further our salvation; nay, so far from that, that it often proves a hindrance to it, by taking us off from that full relyance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbency that we ought to have on the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Jesus Christ only, in order to our Salvation.</p>
            <p>But O how contrary are these Doctrines to the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles! How widely different a thing do they make Christianity to be from what it will appear if we take our notions of it from their Sermons and Practices! Is it possible that he that went about doing good himself; made it his meat and drink, the business and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life, should set so light by it in us that are his followers?</p>
            <p>Is it possible that they that so often call upon us <hi>to do good, to be rich in good works, above all things to have</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 18. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>servant charity among our selves,</hi> telling us that all <hi>faith is nothing, all knowledge of Mysteries</hi> is nothing, all gifts of <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> are nothing, but that <hi>Charity</hi> is all in all, I say is it possible that they should think doing good so insignificant, so unprofitable, nay so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a thing as these I spoke of do represent it?</p>
            <p>But I need not further reprove these Opinions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I hope they find but few Patrons; but this seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously ought to be reproved among us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we do not generally lay that stress upon this duty we are speaking of that we ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:63169:14"/>Many are ready enough to acknowledge their Obligations to do good, and count it a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable thing, and a work that God will bless them the better for, yet they are loth to make it an essential ingredient of their Religion, they think they may be Religious and serve God without it. If they be but sober in their lives, and just in their dealings and come to Church at the usual times, they have Religion enough to carry them to Heaven, though in the mean time they continue covetous and hard and uncharitable, without bowels of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and make no use of their wealth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or their power and interest, or their Parts and industry, or their other Talents committed to them, for the doing good in the world.</p>
            <p>Far be it from any man to pretend to determine what vertues or degrees of them are precisely neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, and what Vertues or degrees of them a man may safely be without: But this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that charity and doing good are none of those that can be spared. The Scripture hath every where declared these qualities to be as necessary in order to our Salvation as any condition of the Gospel. Nay if we will consult St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where the Process of the General Judgment is described, we shall find these to be the great points that at the last day men shall be examined upon, and upon which the whole case of their eternal state will turn. So that if we take the Scripture for our Guide, these men at last
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63169:15"/>
will be found to be much mistaken, and to have made a very false judgment both of Religion and of their own condition.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From what hath been said about doing good, we may gather wherein that Perfection of Christianity which we are to aspire after, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist. It has been much disputed which is the most Perfect life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to live in the world as other men do, and to serve God in following our employments, and taking care of our families and doing good offices to our neighbors, and discharging all other duties that our relation to the publick requires of us; or to retire from the world, and to quit all our secular concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and wholly to give up our selves to Prayer and Meditation, and those other exercises of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion properly so called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>This latter kind of life is so magnified by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> in comparison of the other, that it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossed to it self the name of Religious. None among them are thought worthy to be styled Religious persons but those that Cloyster up themselves in a Monastery. But whatever excellence may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in this course of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it certainly falls much short of that which is led in a publick way. He serves God best that is most serviceable to his Generation. And no Prayers or Fasts or Mortifications are near so acceptable a Sacrifice to our Heavenly Father as to <hi>do good in our lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true, to keep within doors and to attend our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:63169:15"/>
devotions (though those that are in appearance most abstracted from the world, are not always the most devout persons) I say this kind of life is the most easie and the safer. A man is not then exposed so much to temptations; he may with less difficulty preserve his innocence; but where is the praise of such a vertue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Vertue is then most glorious and shall be most rewarded, when it meets with most tryals and oppositions.</p>
            <p>And as for the bravery of contemning the world and all the Pomps of it, which they so magnifie in this kind of life, alas it is rather an effect of pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and love of our ease, and a desire to be free from cares and burdens, than of any true nobleness of mind. If we would live to excellent purpose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; if we would shew true bravery of spirit and true piety towards God, let us live as our blessed Lord and his Apostles did. Let us not fly Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but overcome them; let us not sit at home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musing our selves with our pleasing contemplations, when we may be useful and beneficial abroad. Let us so order our devotions towards God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they may be a means of promoting our worldly business and affairs, and doing good among men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us take our fit times of retirement and abstraction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we may the more freely converse with God and pour out our souls before him; but let this be only to the end that we may appear abroad again more brisk and lively in vanquishing the Temptations that come in our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63169:16"/>
way, and more prompt and readily disposed to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work: This is to imitate our Lord Jesus, to walk as we have him for an example. This is a life most sutable to the contrivance and the genius of his Religion, which is more accommodated to Cities and publick Societies, than to Cloysters and Deserts. And lastly this is to walk in a conformity to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand who hath bid us <hi>make our light so to shine before</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>men that they may see our good works and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Fourthly and lastly, If it be a thing so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that every man should do good in his life as hath been represented, then how much to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved are they that do no good till their death! That live scrapingly and uncharitably and uselesly to the world all their lives long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then when they come to dye, think to Atone for their sins and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of this kind, by shewing some extraordinary Bounty to the poor, or devoting some part of their estates to publick or pious uses.</p>
            <p>I must confess this kind of proceeding doth to me seem just like the business of putting off a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his death-bed. It is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that a man should repent though it be never so late; and so it is that he should do good: if he have done little good in his life, he is bound as he loves his soul to shew some extraordinary uncommon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Charity and a Publick spirit, when he comes to die. But then it is here as it is with the long
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63169:16"/>
delaying of Repentance, the deferring it so long has robbed the man of the greatest part of the praise and the comfort he might have expected from it. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in heaven will be much less though his good deeds should be accepted, but he is infinitely uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether they will or no. It must be a very great act of Generosity and Charity that can obtain a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for a whole life of uncharitableness.</p>
            <p>Let us all therefore labour and study <hi>to do good in our lives,</hi> let us be daily giving evidences to the world of our kind and charitable disposition, and let not that be the first which is discovered in our last Will and testament. If God hath blessed us with worldly goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us distribute them as we see occasion in our life time, when every one may see we do it voluntarily; and not stay till we must be forced to part with them whether we will or no, for that will blast the credit of our good deeds both with God and man.</p>
            <p>I have said enough concerning the first point re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in the Text, <hi>viz. doing Good.</hi> I now come briefly to Treat of the other, that is, <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> which is equally a part of the business of this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is no good</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>in any earthly thing;</hi> or <hi>there is nothing better for any man than to rejoyce and to do good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Rejoycing</hi> here recommended, is capable of two sences, the first more general and more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us as Christians, the other more particular and which more immediately concerns us as we are here met upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:63169:17"/>In the first place by <hi>Rejoycing</hi> we may take to be meant, a constant habit of joy and chearfulness, so that we are always contented and well pleased, always free from those anxieties and disquiets and uncomfortable reflections that make the lives of mankind miserable. This now is the Perfection of <hi>Rejoycing</hi> and it is the utmost degree of Happiness that we are here capable of. It must be granted indeed that not many do arrive to this state, but yet I doubt not but that it is a state that may be attained at least in a great measure in this world. Otherwise the Holy men in Scripture, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Apostles of our Lord would never have recommended it to us so often as they have done. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce ever more,</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and to the<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 16. Phil. 4. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Philippians, Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I say rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The way to attain to this happy condition doth consist chiefly in these three things: First a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and virtue, a behaving our selves so in the world that our Consciences shall not reproach us. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays as the Foundation of <hi>Rejoycing, This</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> (saith he) <hi>is our rejoycing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Testimony of our Conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity I have had my conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this world.</hi> It is in vain to think of any true solid Joy or Peace or Contentment without a hearty pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all the duties of our Religion, so that we can sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our selves of our own sincerity before God.</p>
            <p>And then secondly to make us capable of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Rejoycing besides the innocence of our lives there must go a firm and hearty perswasion of Gods
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63169:17"/>
particular Providence; a belief that he not only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penseth all events that come to pass in the world, even the most inconsiderable; but that the measure of the Dispensations of his Providence is infinite Wisdom and Goodness and nothing else: so that nothing doth or ever can happen to us in particular, or to the world in general but what is for the best. Now when we firmly believe this and frequently attend to it, how can we be either solicitous for the future or discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the present events of things, let them fall out ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so cross to our desires and expectations? This is the best Antidote in the world (and an effectual one it is) against all trouble and vexation and uneasiness that can happen to us upon any occasion whatsoever, to wit, the consideration that all things are managed by an infinitely Wise and good God, and will at last prove for the best, how unaccountable soever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us at present. And this is that which the wise man insinuates in the verse before the Text when he saith that <hi>God hath made every thing beautiful in his season.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Another requisite both for the procuring and preserving this continual chearfulness and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, is a frequent and fixed attention to the great rewards of the other world, which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to all that truly love him and endeavour to please him. This consideration will extreamly add to our comfort and contribute to our Rejoycing under all the miseries and afflictions that we can possibly fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, namely, that whatsoever condition we are in here
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63169:18"/>
we shall certainly in a little time be in a most happy and glorious one, and the worse our circumstances are in this life, the greater (if we be good) shall be our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the next, for <hi>these light afflictions</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> us) <hi>which indure but for a moment, do work for us a far more exceeding weight of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the joy that we are to endeavour after in the first place, to be constantly well pleas'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with our present condition, whatever it be, and these are the ways to attain to it.</p>
            <p>But secondly, there is another more particular No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> and which I conceive <hi>Solomon</hi> doth chiefly intend in the words of the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that is the free and comfortable enjoyment of the good things of this life that God hath blessed us with, in opposition to a pinching and penurious way of living. This I say seems to be the notion of <hi>Rejoycing</hi> that the Text speaks of, as appears by the following verse. <hi>Solomon</hi> having told us in the text, that there is nothing better for a man than to <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>do good,</hi> he adds by way of explication of what he meant by <hi>rejoycing,</hi> these words, <hi>that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labours, for it is the gift of God.</hi> And frequently in this Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> doth he perswade to this kind of rejoycing. Thus in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>there is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour, this also I saw it was from the hand of God.</hi> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>Behold that which I have seen, it is good and comely for one to eat and</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:63169:18"/>
               <hi>drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labours that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life which God giveth him, for it is his portion.</hi> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. he represents it as a <hi>great evil that he hath seen under the sun, and yet such an evil as is common among men, that a man to whom God hath given riches, and wealth, and honour, so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger eateth it, this</hi> (saith he) <hi>is vanity and an evil disease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is certainly great reason in what he saith. For to have a plentiful portion of the good things of this life, and not to have the heart to make use of them for the enjoyment of our selves and friends; for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing us under the toyl that this life doth expose us to; for the promoting Acquaintance and Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the rendering our condition as easie as may be, is as unaccountable a folly as we can be guilty of, and makes us really as poor and necessitous as those that want bread, but only not so pitiable.</p>
            <p>Taking now this to be the sence of <hi>rejoycing</hi> in the Text, (as I believe it is) we have from hence a good warrant for this days Meeting, for we come together to <hi>rejoyce</hi> in <hi>Solomons</hi> sence, that is, <hi>to eat and drink and to enjoy the good of our labours,</hi> it being <hi>the gift of God</hi> so to do.</p>
            <p>And this practice of ours is not only reasonable in it self, but is commended to us by the example of Gods people both under the Law and the Gospel. The <hi>Jews</hi> by the appointment of God himself were to meet every year three times at <hi>Jerusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Capital
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63169:19"/>
City of the Nation <hi>to feast and to rejoyce before the Lord,</hi> as<note place="margin">See Deut. 16.</note> we have it in the express words of <hi>Moses.</hi> And the Christians for near two hundred years after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had their <hi>Agapae,</hi> their Feasts of charity wherein they met together both poor and rich to enjoy and make merry one with another. It is true these Feasts were at length left off by common consent, because there grew abuses in them; they became occasions of Luxury and excess, and so matters of scandal to our Religion. But this was not an ill reflection upon the thing itself, which was innocent and commendable, but upon the <hi>abuse</hi> of the thing. A good and laudable institution was perverted to evil purposes. However this very consideration ought to make us very careful of our carriage and behaviour in these our Meetings, lest we fall under the same inconveniencies, which that we may prevent, Two things are especially need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to be taken care of by us.</p>
            <p>First, That we do not exceed the bounds of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi> prescribed to Christians, that is, that we avoid all excess, and use the Creatures of God, soberly and temperately, so as to give offence to none, nor to <hi>make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And secondly, That we take care to perform and make good the ends and designs of these <hi>Feasts</hi> of <hi>rejoyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> which ends, if we will take our measures from those Laws that God gave to his own People in the Old Testament, and which the modern <hi>Jews</hi> themselves in their Commentaries take notice of; and which are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63169:19"/>
so reasonable in themselves that without any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they do recommend themselves to us, are these four following.</p>
            <p>First, That we Rejoyce before the Lord, that is, that we make our humble acknowledgments and return our due praises and thanks to him for all the good things he hath blessed us with in our lives, confessing that all we have is from his free bounty and goodness, and that our Meeting together is to praise his name upon that account. And this was the thing that was meant by those solemn Sacrifices that the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to offer at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> at their Annual Feasts.</p>
            <p>The second end of these Feasts is to take occasion from hence to learn our duty, to be instructed in all the branches of that obedience we owe unto God. For as <hi>Maimonides</hi> observes, that was one of the principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Gods calling together all the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> to appear at the Feast of Tabernacles, to wit, that they might hear the Law read unto them; and this design is I suppose pursued by us in our chusing this Place to Assemble in.</p>
            <p>A third end of these Feasts (as the same <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us) &amp; is manifest from Scripture is to promote acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; Friendship, and brotherly love one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this is a very noble end, and serves many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent purposes, and nothing can be beyond it except</p>
            <p>The fourth and last end of these Meetings, which is to <hi>do good;</hi> to exercise our Charity towards our poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent Brethren. No man at the Solemn Feasts of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63169:20"/>
               <hi>Jews, was to appear before the Lord empty.</hi> He was to bring<note place="margin">Exod. 23. 15.</note> his offering not only to God by way of recognition and acknowledgment to him: but for the poor also that they might rejoyce as well as he. This is well observed by <hi>Maimonides</hi> from <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 14. where it is thus said, <hi>Thou shalt rejoyce in thy feast, thou and thy son, and thy daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy man-servant and thy maid-servant, the Levite and the stranger, the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then is the great end of our Assembly, that not only we, but the Fatherless and the widow; all of our Countrey, that need our Charity, may <hi>rejoyce</hi> with us and for us. And this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> joyns with <hi>rejoycing</hi> in the Text, <hi>There is no good in them but for a man to rejoyce and do good:</hi> and what that man who by the sentence of God was declared the wisest of all men hath thus joyned together, let none of us presume to put asunder. These are the Rules, and these are the ends that we are to observe in this our Feast; and let us all for the Honour of Christs Religion, and for the credit of our particular Countrey, charge the observation of them upon our selves: which if we can all resolve to do, I can safely apply to every one of you, that saying of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>9th</hi> Chapter of this book of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> and the <hi>7th</hi> verse, with which I shall conclude: <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy work.</hi>
