         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as we sate in an open and goodly Gallerie at dinner,
a young <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, who desirous to trauaile,
had beene in <hi>Italy,</hi> and many other places, fortuned
to come to his house; and (not so well furnished for

(quoth <hi>Monsieur de Ligny,</hi> for so was his name)
how your Gentry of <hi>England</hi> are bred: that when
they are distressed, or want means in a strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
they are brought vp neither to any qualitie to
preferre them, nor haue they so much as the Latine
tongue to helpe themselues withall. I knew it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

excused it as I could; yet he was receiued, and after
returned to his friends in good fashion. Hereby I

none any more miserable then one of them, if
he fall into miserie in a strange Country. Which I can
impute to no other thing, then the remisnesse of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and negligence of Masters in their youth.

our Flowers at twenty pounds the roote or slip: and not
regard or make difference of linage, nor be carefull into
what Stocke we match our selues, or of what Parents we
choose a Seruant?</p>
            <p>Surely, to beleeue that Nature (rather the God of

and in the genuine sence, <hi>Nobilitie</hi> is the Honour of

one or more of that Family, either by the Prince, the

Priscus, <hi>a stranger, and a banished man: and of later
times,</hi> Cosmo di Medici <hi>in</hi> Florence, <hi>vpon whose vertues,
as vpon a faire prospect, or some princely Palace, giue
me leaue a little, as a traueller to breathe my selfe, and
shew you afarre off the faire Tutrets of his more then
royall Magnificence, being but a priuate man, as I finde
it recorded in his Historie by</hi> Machiauell. This <hi>Cosmo
(saith he)</hi> was the most esteemed, and most famous Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

(being no man of warre) that euer had beene in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
of man, either in <hi>Florence,</hi> or any other Citie; because
he did not onely excell all others (of his time) in Authoritis
and Riches, but also in Liberalitie and Wisedoms. For among
other qualities which aduanced him to be chiefe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
he was more then other men liberall and magnificent,
which liberalitie appeared much more after his death then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For his sonne <hi>Piero</hi> found by his Fathers Records,
that there was not any Citizen of estimation, to whom <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo</hi>
had not lent great summes of Money: and many times
also he did lend to those Gentlemen, whom he knew to haue
need. His magnificence appeared by diuers his building: For
within the Citie of <hi>Florence</hi> hee builded the Abbaits and
Temples of S. <hi>Marco,</hi> S. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and the Monastery of S.
<hi>Verdiana,</hi> &amp; in the mountains of <hi>Fiesole,</hi> S. <hi>Girolamo,</hi> with
the Abbey thereto belonging. Also in <hi>Mugello</hi> he did not only
repaire the Church for the Friers, but tooke it downe, and
built it anew. Besides those magnificent buildings in S. <hi>Croce,</hi>
in S. <hi>Agnoli,</hi> and S. <hi>Miniato,</hi> he made Altars, and sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

the buildings of them, were by him paued, and furnished
throughly with all things necessarie. With these publique
buildings, wee may number his priuate houses, whereof one

and at <hi>Trebio,</hi> all Palaces fitter for Princes, then priuate
persons. And because his magnificent houses in <hi>Italy,</hi> did
not in his opinion make him famous enough, he builded in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
an Hospitall to receiue poore and diseased Pilgrims.
In which worke he consumed great summes of Money. And
albeit these buildings, and euery other his actions were prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and that in <hi>Florence</hi> he liued like a Prince; yet so gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

The most (and without cause) lay the fault vpon bad

of capacitie, and most apprehensiue, others of as dull;
some of a strong memorie, others of as weake; yet may
that dullard, or bad memorie, (if he be obserued) proue
as good, yea (in <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion) better then of
the other. But we see on the contrary, out of the Masters

go stumbling from the right as if they went blindfold for

Master to Master, who poore boy (like a hound among

For I know nothing that benefiteth a Scholler more

which laid by for some time, let him translate out of

<hi>Suetonius,</hi> was disputation in the fore-noone, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in the after-noone; but this I leaue to the discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

her first growth and beginning. For as no glorie crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

the value and esteeme of a Gentleman all his life after,
more then that procured by <hi>Sloath</hi> and <hi>Error</hi> in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities;
yea, though in those yeares whose innocencie

correction of manners.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, your first care, euen with pulling off
your Boots, let be the choice of your acquaintance and
company. For as infection in Cities in a time of sicknesse,
is taken by concourse, and negligent running abroad,
when those that keepe within, and are warie of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
escape with more safetie: So it falleth out here in

themselues, and so plyable to good fellowship abroad;
that in mind and manners (the tokens plainly appearing)
they are past recouerie ere any friend could heare they

            <p>Now in respect of heauen, it is so small a point, that
the least starre is not darkened with the shaddow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
for if the smallest starre, albeit in iudgement of our

the bodie of the Earth in greatnesse, it followeth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

Astronomers finde the same bignesse and eleuation

differ no whit at all; whereby we may see if that distance
of place which is on the Earth (in respect of the Heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

(poore little point as it is) seemes the like, if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

rather of feare, then of challenging the glorie. And
whereas he bringeth in <hi>Camilla,</hi> a couragious Lady, and

Noble men in the schooles, and altogether forbidden to
be taught to seruants or slaues.</p>
            <p>In no lesse honour and esteeme was it held among the
Romanes, as we finde in <hi>Plinie</hi> and many others who
euery where advance the professors; and the dignity of
the practise thereof nothing base or seruile, since one of
the most Noble families in <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Fabij</hi> thought

<hi>Pictor.</hi> For the first of that name, although he was
most honourably descended, honoured with many Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
Consulships and Triumphs, excellently learned in
the lawes, and beside accounted in the number of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators
of his time; yet he thought his skill in painting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to these Honors, and his memory would heare the
better of posteritie, for that he was endued with so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

square, triangle, cylinder, &amp;c. for these are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all other proportions. As for example, your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall

on the thumbe of your left hand, &amp; pencills for euery
colour, in the same lay your colours vpon your pallet
thus: first, your white Lead, then Lake, Iuorie, blacke,
Seacoale blacke (as you see the complexion) lampe
blacke, vmber for the haire, red lead, yealow oaker, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digreace;
then your blewes, Masticot and Pinke, the rest
at your pleasure, mixing them on the other side of the
pallet at your pleasure.</p>
            <p>To begin a picture, first drawe the Eye, the white
thereof make of white lead with as little char-coale black;
hauing finished it, leaue from the other Eye the distance
of an Eye, then draw the proportion of the nose, the
compasse of the face, after that make the mouth, the
eare, the haire, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>After you haue made the white of the eyes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion

ouer the face, casting in here and there some sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

Your flesh colour is commonly compounded of white
lead, lake, and vermilion, but you may heighthen or dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

            <p>Then shadow the face all ouer as you see cause, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
the nose, compassing the tippe of it with some darke
or light reddish shadow.</p>
            <p>The shaddowes for your face are compounded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
of Iuory, blacke, white lead, vermilion, lake, Sea-coale
blacke, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Then shaddow your cheekes and lippes (with the
mouth stroke, which make of lake onely) with vermilion
and lake as you list mixed together.</p>
            <p>Now make the Circles of the Eyes. For the gray eye,
take charcoale blacke and white lead heighthened or
deepened at your pleasure.</p>
            <p>For the blacke Circle of the Eye, take Vmber, Sea-cole-blacke,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14713:63"/>

            <p>For the round ball in the eye take lampe-blacke and

            <p>For the hands and the shaddowes betweene the fingers
vse the same flesh-colours and shaddowes as in the face
for heighthening or deepening.</p>
            <p>If you would make a flesh-colour of a swarthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,

hot, I would giue ouer Painting for a while; whereunto
<hi>Giotto</hi> replyed, Indeed Sir, if I were as you, I would let

Hall of the Court, the King merily requested him, to

the Diuell next vnto God hated none more then
painters, for that, said <hi>Buffalmacco,</hi> we make him odious
in the peoples eyes by painting him terrible and in the

paint nothing but Saints in Churches to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

the diuels are very angry with vs, and hauing more power
by night then by day, they play these prankes, and I

it to be true, and with great reasons perswaded
<hi>Taffi</hi> euer after to keepe his bed; which beeing published

hee was acquainted, the Nunnes of <hi>Sancta Margarita</hi>
procured him to make their high Altar-table, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at worke, hee espied a beautifull virgin, a Citizens
daughter of <hi>Florence,</hi> whose name was <hi>Francisco Bati:</hi>
This maid was there kept to be made a Nunne; she was
most beautifull, her name was <hi>Lucretia,</hi> &amp; so he wrought
with the Nunnes, that he obtained leaue to draw her Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture;
but by continuall gazing vpon her countenance,
he became so enamoured of her, that what by close mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
and other meanes, he got her out of the Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
he got her away and married her, and by her he had
a sonne, named also <hi>Phillip,</hi> who became an excellent
Painter. This Frier <hi>Phillips</hi> workes are to bee seene at
<hi>Prato.</hi> And amongst other S. <hi>Bernard</hi> layed out dead, his
brethren mourning about him, and many Cripples and
diseased persons, which (as it was said) with touching
the Herse and his body, were healed. Then hee most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
wrought the Martyrdome of S. <hi>Stephen,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
of <hi>S. Iohn Baptist,</hi> with many others. He died

            <head type="sub">Of Armorie, or Blazon of Armes, with the Antiquity and Dignitie of Heralds.</head>
            <p>IT is meete that a Noble or Gentleman who beareth
Armes, and is well descended, bee not onely able to
blazon his owne proper Coate; deriue by pedegree
the descent of his family from the originall, know such
matches and allies as are ioyned to him in blood: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
of his Prince, the Nobilitie, and Gentry where he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
which is not of meere ornament, as the most sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
but diuersly necessary and of great consequence:
as had I fortuned to haue liued in those times, when that
fatall difference of either ROSE was to be decided by
the sword; with which partie in aequitie and conscience
could I haue sided, had I beene ignorant of the descent
and pedegree Royall, and where the right had beene by
inheritance of Blood, Match, or Alliance.</p>
            <p>How should we giue Nobilitie her true value, respect,
and title, without notice of her Merit: and how may we
guesse her merit, without these outward ensignes and
badges of Vertue, which anciently haue beene accounted
sacred and precious; withall, discerne and know an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
vpstart, shot vp with the last nights Mushrome,
from an ancient descended and deseruing Gentleman,
whose Grandsires haue had their share in euery foughten
field by the English since <hi>Edward</hi> the first? or my selfe a
Gentleman know mine owne ranke; there being at this
instant the world ouer, such a medley (I had almost said
Motley) of Coates, such intrusion by adding or dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
into ancient families and houses; that had there not
beene within these few yeares, a iust and commendable
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14713:75"/>
course taken by the Right Honorable the Earles <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals,</hi>
for the redresse of this generall and vnsufferable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse,
we should I feare me within these few yeares, see
Yeomen as rare in <hi>England,</hi> as they are in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, it is a contemplation full of pleasing varietie,
and for the most part, sympathizing with euery Noble
and generous disposition, in substance the most refined
part of Naturall Philosophie, while it taketh the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
from Geometry, making vse almost of euery seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
square and angle. For these and other reasons, I desire
that you would bestow some houres in the studie of the
same: for a Gentleman Honorably descended, to be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
ignorant herein, argueth in him either a disregard
of his owne worth, a weaknesse of conceipt, or indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Armes and Honorable Action; sometime meere
Ideotisme, as <hi>Signeur Gaulart,</hi> a great man of <hi>France</hi> (and
none of the wisest) inuiting on a time many great perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
and honourable friends to his Table, at the last
seruice a March-pane was brought in, which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
quite eaten, hee bethought himselfe, and said; It
was told mee, that mine Armes were brauely set out in
Gold and Colours vpon this March-pane, but I haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

(said one of his men) eate them vp your selfe but now.

            <p>Armes or Ensignes at the first had their chiefe vse for
distinction of Tribe from Tribe, armie from armie being
composed of two or moe colours, whereof one was euer
white or yealow, which we now tearme Mettals, and that
of necessitie; for without the mixture of one of these, the
other as too darke of themselues, could not bee discerned

too much of the light. Hence they say (though not

it is false armorie.</p>

yellow and white: yellow beeing an effect of the fire.
and all heate (as we may see in gold) begotten by the
heate of the Sunne, by the mixture of the clearest and
most pure quicke-siluer, and the finest red brimstone, in
fruite and corne ripened by the heate of the same, in
choller, vrine, lie boyled, the bellies of hot venemous
Serpents and the like. The white is proper to the water

            <p>The same <hi>Nicetas</hi> reporteth of a solemne Iustes or
Torneaments which the saide <hi>Manuel Comnenus</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vnto the <hi>Latines</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> what time they went to
make warre in the holy land: for the Latines making a
braue shew in their rich Armour well horsed, with their
Lances, and presenting themselues before the Emperor;
the Emperour to shew them that the Graecians were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
inferiour vnto them in brauery or courage, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a day when they and the Latines (for the glory

saith <hi>Nicetas,</hi> so brauely carryed himselfe, that he vnhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
two Latine Commanders, casting them from the
saddle to the ground.</p>
            <p>In our launces now adayes (of what wood soeuer they
are made of) there is nothing so much danger as hath
beene in times past: neyther in our moderno practise
of warre haue they almost any vse at all. The Prince of
<hi>Orange</hi> hath abandoned them, hauing not a Launce in
his whole Armie, but hath Carbines in their roome.
<hi>Spinola</hi> hath some troopes of them, yet not many, as I
obserued. Those of <hi>Shertogen-bosch</hi> vnder <hi>Grobbendonckse,</hi>
are esteemed the best horse <hi>Spinola</hi> hath.</p>
            <p>For throwing and wrestling, I hold them exercises not
so well beseeming Nobilitie,<note place="margin">Of throwing, leaping, and wrestling.</note> but rather Souldiers in a
Campe, or a Princes guard: neither haue I read or
heard of any Prince or Generall commended for
wrestling, saue <hi>Epaminondas Achmat</hi> the last Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neur
and Emperor of <hi>Turkie,</hi> who tooke great delight in

            <p>Running and Agility of Body haue beene esteemed

that euer liued;<note place="margin">Of running.</note> and the old <hi>Romanes</hi> (next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <hi>Alexander</hi> we reade excelled all his Court in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
<hi>Sertorius</hi> a braue commander vnder <hi>Caesar,</hi> could
nimbly runne vp the most steepe Mountaines, leape bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and vnpasseable Rockes, and like inuious places;
insomuch as <hi>Metellus</hi> beeing sent with a powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
against him, he knew neither where to finde him,
nor how to come by him, by reason of his nimble foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship.
Thereupon he sent his Colleague <hi>Pompey,</hi> who
beeing by <hi>Sextorius</hi> ouerthrowne at the first encounter,
escaped very narrowly; for beeing vnhorsed, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
receiued a great wound, while the souldiers were
busied in striuing, some for his horse, others for the
most rich furniture (his caparison, bridle, saddle, stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rops,
being in a manner all of gold, and shining with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
stones of inestimable valew) watching his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
by swiftnes of foot escaped from them all, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
safe to his quarter.</p>
            <p>Leaping is an exercise very commendable,<note place="margin">Of leaping.</note> and health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for the body, especially if you vse it in the morning,
as we reade <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Epimanondas</hi> did. Vpon a full
stomacke or to bedward, it is very dangerous, and in no
wise to be exercised.</p>
            <p>The skill and art of swimming<note place="margin">Of swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</note> is also very requisite in
euery Noble and Gentleman, especially if he looketh for
emploiment in the warres; for hereby (besides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
of his owne life vpon infinite occasions,) he may
many waies annoy his enemie. <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> onely by
the benefit of swimming saued his country, for when
himselfe alone had long defended, and made good the
bridge ouer <hi>Tyber</hi> against the <hi>Hetruscans,</hi> the <hi>Romanes</hi>
brake it downe behind him,<note place="margin">Liv. lib. 2. Decad. 1.</note> wherewith, in his armour, he
casthimselfe into the Riuer, &amp; (notwithstanding a shower
of darts &amp; arrowes were sent after him) swam with safety
into the city, which rewarded him with a statue erected
in the market place, and as much land as he could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compasse
with a plough in a day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:14713:99"/>And as desperate was the attempt of a number of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Gentlemen in the first <hi>Carthaginian</hi> warre, who
leaping in a night from the hatches of their ships into
the Sea, by maine force thrust and drew the <hi>Carthaginian</hi>
shippes into the hauen, and deliuered them to <hi>Luctatius</hi>
their Generall.</p>
            <p>And as resolute was that attempt (no whit inferiour
to the former) of <hi>Gerrard</hi> and <hi>Haruey,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The resolute aduenture of <hi>Gerrard</hi> and <hi>Haruey</hi> in 88.</note> two Gentlemen
of our owne Nation, who in eightie eight in the fight at

or such like Instruments, the sides of the Spanish Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and returned backe safe to the fleete.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scauola,</hi> a man of inestimable courage, and who came

with double Armes and an heauy shield, cast himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the deepe, and swam safe to <hi>Caesar</hi> and his fleete.</p>
            <p>Neither is it to be wondred at, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> were
so skilfull in swimming: for they were daily exercised in
the same after their other exercises, and had a place in the
Riuer of <hi>Tyber</hi> appointed vnto them for the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
adioyning to the field of <hi>Mars;</hi> and another of
great depth, rough and full of whirlpits on purpose, to
exercise their horses in.</p>
            <p>Shooting also is a very healthfull and commendable
recreation for a Gentleman;<note place="margin">Of shooting.</note> neither doe I know any
other comparable vnto it for stirring euery part of the
body: for it openeth the breast and pipes, exerciseth the
armes and feet, with lesse violence, then running, leaping,
&amp;c. Herein was the Emperour <hi>Domitian</hi> so cunning, that
let a Boy a good distance off hold vp his hand, &amp; stretch
his fingers abroad, he would shoote through the spaces
without touching the Boyes hand, or any finger.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Commodus</hi> (saith <hi>Herodian</hi>) had so good an aime,
that he would fixe on the brow of a Deere two shafts as
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:14713:100"/>
euenly, and spreading in distance, as if they had beene
his owne hornes.</p>
            <p>But for the further excellence and vse of this exercise,
I referre you to that excellent booke of M. <hi>Aschams,</hi>
intituled <hi>Toxophilus,</hi> wherein you shall finde whatsoeuer
is requisite to be knowne of a compleate Archer.</p>
            <p>Hawking and Hunting are recreations very commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
and befitting a Noble or Gentleman to exercise;
Hunting especially, which <hi>Xenophon</hi> commendeth to his
<hi>Cyrus,</hi> calling it a gift of the Gods, bestowed first vpon
<hi>Chiron</hi> for his vprightnesse in doing Iustice, and by him
taught vnto the old Heroës and Princes; by whose vertue
and prowesse (as enabled by this exercise) their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
were defended, their subiects and innocents preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
Iustice maintained. For there is no one exercise
that enableth the body more for the warre, then Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
by teaching you to endure heate, cold, hunger,
thirst; to rise early, watch late, lie and fare hardly: and
<hi>Eusebius</hi> is of opinion, that wilde beasts were of purpose
created by God, that men by chasing and encountring
them, might be fitted and enabled for warlike exercises.
Heereupon <hi>Alexander, Cyrus,</hi> and the old Kings of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi>
employed themselues exceeding much herein, not to
purchase Venison and purucy for the belly, but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their strength, and preserue their health, by encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and stirring vp the naturall heate within, which sloth
and sitting still wasts and decaies: To harden the bodies
by labour against the enemy; and withall, to search out
the Natures of wilde beasts, which knowne, they might

            <p>The old Lord <hi>Gray</hi> (our English <hi>Achilles</hi>) when hee
was Deputie of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to inure his sonnes for the war,
would vsually in the depth of Winter, in frost, snow,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14713:100"/>
raine, and what weather soeuer fell, cause them at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
to be raised out of their beds, and carried abroad
on hunting till the next morning; then perhaps come wet
and cold home, hauing for a breakfast a browne loase,
and a mouldie Cheese, or (which is ten times worse) a
dish of Irish Butter: and in this manner the <hi>Spartans</hi> and

in sweet Springs, Riuers, and all sorts of fruites. Pasture
there is little or none in respect of the great heat, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely

Corne sufficient saue onely in the skirts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
which are mountainous, hilly and barren, yet aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in Goates and other Cattell.</p>
            <p>For victuals you shall finde it very scarce, not that the
Counttey affordeth not a sufficiency, but that the people
beingby co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitution, hot &amp; dry, are not able to digest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
and more solid meat, like vnto ours; but rather chuse
Fruits, Sallets and sweet meates, as Mermalade, by them

The people are by nature generally proud and
haughty, but withall very ciuill, faithfull to their friend,
and aboue all to their Prince, for seldome or neuer haue
any of that Nation bin known to haue bin Traitors: their
souldiers are infatigable, resolute, and obedient vnto their
Commanders, but withall lasciuiously giuen, and too
cruell in victory.</p>
            <p>The Gentry affect not the Countrey, but desire to liue
in walled Townes altogether, where they dedicate

of Warre, saue such who are of the better sort, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated

third part.</p>
            <p>Their habite in apparell is all one for colour and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which hardly makes a distinction of parties; onely
they are discerned by their seruants (in whom they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

and horselitters.</p>
            <p>The women are blacke, and little, but very well fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and for discourse admirable: these haue a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
distinction of habit, and are all discerned by their
apparell of what qualitie they are, they affect strangers
much, and are liberall in their conuerse with them.</p>
            <p>The heart of the Countrey is very scarce of fish, that
which they haue, are either Tons or Pilchards, brought
salted from <hi>Biscay,</hi> on the one side, and from <hi>Valencia</hi> on
the other: Yea, the Church for want of fish is faine to
giue a licence to cate the entrailes of beasts vpon fasting
dayes.</p>
            <p>All their meate, fruits and bred are sold by the pound,
and not except before an Officer which they call <hi>Alcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>

in respect of lodging and dyet, except when you
come into the walled Townes, where you shall according
to their manner be accommodated well enough.</p>
            <p>They trauaile all on Mules, keeping their Horses for
beautie and shew, putting them to no vse, saue onely to
be led vp and downe.</p>
