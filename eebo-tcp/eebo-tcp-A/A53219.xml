            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>O Rara Show, A Rara Shight! A Strange Monſter, (the like not in EUROPE) To be ſeen near <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> a few doors beyond the Lions Den.</head>
            <p>IT hath the ſhape of a Man, but in its Nature is a meer Savage Beaſt; looks as fierce as a Tyger, but has ſcarce the Courage of a Mouſe. It has vaſt Lungs, but no Heart; has wild gogling Eyes, but they are very ſhort-ſighted: It has a huge ravenous Mouth, but that being an <hi>open Sepulchre of Religion and Law,</hi> and having the <hi>Poiſon of Malice under its Lips,</hi> ſends forth a Breath very offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. It hates all other Creatures, and delights much in their Blood, but is very fearful of ſeeing its own. It has fed ſo much for five Years laſt paſt upon <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Corruption,</hi> that it looks as ghaſtly as <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Deſpair without,</hi> and is as black as <hi>Hell within.</hi>

            <div type="part">
               <head>An Account of the Birth and Growth of this Monſter.</head>
               <p>IT was whelp'd and bred in <hi>Wales,</hi> where it ate ſo much Goats Milk, that it has been very ſubject of late Years to have Horns ſprout forth of its Head. It gave early Proofs of a hardy ſubſtantial Impudence, and was never known to bluſh, tho ſometimes to look pale. Its peculiar Talent appear'd to be <hi>Yelling</hi> aloud; and that by a wealthy Citizens means, preferr'd it to be the <hi>Common Barker of Guild-hall,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be the <hi>Foul Mouth of the City,</hi> in which place it continu'd, till having confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with ſome <hi>Wolves,</hi> and prey'd upon ſome <hi>Sheep Skins</hi> that contain'd the <hi>City Charter,</hi> three or four hundred Men from <hi>Weſtminiſter</hi> hunted it from thence. But this Vertue of Falſhood to its Truſt ſoon advanc'd it to be chief <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> of the Nation, and then <hi>it</hi> and its <hi>Confederate Wolves</hi> fell upon the old <hi>Sheep Skins</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and devour'd <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> And now it rang'd into the <hi>Weſtern Foreſt,</hi> attended with <hi>Jack-calls</hi> to hunt down its Game, and was ſo ravenous, that if great quantities of Gold and Silver had not been chuck'd into its Mouth, to blunt the Edg of its Teeth, and fill its Maw, it was thought it would have ſuck'd up the Blood of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. At its return, this <hi>Monſter</hi> was dignified with a fine <hi>Collar</hi> and a <hi>Pouch,</hi> to the great Diſhonour and Scandal of both; and was truſted with the Cuſtody of a certain <hi>large Conſcience,</hi> for which it was a proper <hi>Keeper,</hi> and had room enough, having none of its own. It expoſed this Conſcience to Sale for three Years together, and to ſuch as would give its own luſty Price, it retail'd it pretty civilly; but at ſuch as begg'd any, or offer'd an under-rate, it roar'd hideouſly, even to the diſturbance of the whole Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Brave Monſter-Hunter</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> being arriv'd in <hi>England</hi> to hunt here, our Monſter drop'd its gay Trappings, and cteeping into poor Weeds, reſolved (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its fearful Temper) to take the Water, in hope to eſcape; but Nature recoyling at the danger, it firſt ſneaked into a little Ale-houſe to fortify it ſelf with a Noggin of <hi>Brandy,</hi> whither it was trac'd by its ſtrorng Scent of <hi>Mans Blood,</hi> and of its Poſteriors, and deliver'd to the <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Game</hi> to be kept for the Chaſe.</p>
               <p>It is agreed to give this Monſter <hi>fair Law,</hi> tho it never gave any to other Creatures; but it is fear'd the weight of its Paunch will diſable it for leaping over the Toils, and that it will run its Head into a <hi>Nooſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Price is two Pence for each <hi>Spectator</hi>; but they are deſired not to delay time, for it will not be to be ſeen in this place above a Month or ſix Weeks longer.</p>
