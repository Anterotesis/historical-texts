            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY your leave Gentlemen. When Seriouſneſſe takes not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, perhaps Trifling may. Every man hath ſome toyes in his head, and I (God help me) a great many; One wil now diſcover it ſelf, which hath itched in it ever ſince laſt night. <hi>Mars</hi> had lately tyred me with long Marches and Skirmiſhes; <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> caſt ſo ill aſpects on me, that I could not be joviall; The <hi>Moone</hi> was in the Waine; <hi>Venus</hi> retrogade; and becauſe <hi>Apollo</hi> would not lend me his Fiddle, that the Influences of <hi>Saturne</hi> might not oppreſſe me with Melancholie, I complide with <hi>Mercurie;</hi> with whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a Ruſtick Progreſſe, and underſtanding that you love varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Newes, I am bold to preſent you with ſuch Gleanings as I have gathered in the Countrey.</p>
            <p>And though I am not ſo wittie as my friend <hi>Britannicus,</hi> nor bring Relations ſo worthy the Whetſtone as Monſieur <hi>Aulicus,</hi> nor come ſo furniſhed as Maſter <hi>Civicus,</hi> nor ſo ſupplide with Paſſages as the <hi>Weekly Intelligencer,</hi> nor ſo at leiſure to ſumme up all Occurrences as the <hi>Accomptant,</hi> nor ſo large in promiſes as the <hi>Scout,</hi> the <hi>Informer,</hi> and thereſt of your diligent Mercuries, nor ſo impudent as to aver that I preſent you with nothing but truth; yet I have brought that which perhaps you may be, for once, as well contented to heare, though they be but ſuch gatherings as I had from the Mill, the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the Smiths-ſhop, or the Barbers: for, theſe are our Countrey-Exchanges, wherein we talk of as many things with little good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe as they doe at <hi>Weſtminſter;</hi> and other-while alſo, to as ill, and to as good-purpoſes.</p>
            <p>I hope you will not be ſo ſevere to expect Truth in every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for all Mercuries having the Planet <hi>Mercurie</hi> predominant
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54250:2"/>
at their Nativities, cannot but retaine a twang of Lying; Yet this I will aſſure you, that (though it be not all exact literall truth which I preſent) here are no ſuch down-right Lies as my other <hi>Couſin-Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curies</hi> make no bones of; but onely Rhetoricall, Metaphoricall, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall, or Poeticall Lies, inſinuating that which may prevent deceit, without purpoſe of deceiving any to their dammage:</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>And theſe (if well conſider'd) are no</hi> Lies,</l>

                  <hi>But</hi> Truths-eſſential <hi>cloth'd in ſome diſguize.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>Out upon't, that Rime ſlipt from me before I was aware, and may diſcredit all my Relations to ſome Readers, who know not, that Rime, Reaſon, and Truth too are ſometimes found together: But, leſt like one or two of the fore-mentioned <hi>News-mongers</hi> I tire you with Prefaces and Preambles, trifling out more time then my Intelligence will be worth, I proceed to the matter.</p>
            <p>As I was ſetting pen to paper to proſecute my purpoſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was caſt into me, giving me very good aſſurance that the <hi>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Informations</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> which come weekly and daily abroad (except ſome few publiſhed by Authority) are for the moſt part ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lies, Miſtakes, Vanities, or Impertinencies multiplyed &amp; patcht up out of each other, but to employ the Printer leſt he ſhould elſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get his Trade in this long Vacation from ſelling ſerious books. And thereupon it hath been (or may be) voted that they miſ-lead more then they rightly informe; And permiſſion is, for that cauſe, granted to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reader <hi>(Ex officio)</hi> ſtrictly to examine them that they may be cenſured as they deſerve; and even this <hi>Mercurie</hi> is by the ſame Vote left liable to the like examination.</p>
            <p>My firſt Intelligence ſhall be of that which hath moſt need to be taken into preſent conſideration. It is aſſured me that ſeeing the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vees</hi> (which is the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> title for <hi>Cavalleers)</hi> are newly flutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Bedforeſhire</hi> and toward <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that they may divert the Parliament Forces from purſuing their late Victories at <hi>Hull</hi> and <hi>Horne-Caſtle;</hi> It will be good diſcretion for them both to prevent that diverſion, and the miſchiefes which thoſe Locuſts and Caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers may doe in the Aſſociated Counties (if they ſhould commence in that Univerſitie as they have done in the other) by ſending ſpeedily a ſtrong partie thither, and withall to have an eye to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the back-way to <hi>London,</hi> leſt while they have drawn us to look Northward, they wheel about Southward, to attempt the obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Eaſterne-water-paſſage to this Citie; which if my <hi>Mercurie</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54250:2"/>
deceive me not, is the maine deſigne of our Adverſaries, what way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſeeme to take.</p>
            <p>It is reported out of Hamp-ſhire (and it may be beleeved) that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-houſe</hi> hath been ſo long permitted to be a receptacle for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants of <hi>Kent, Surrey,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> and a means for their ſecure paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to and from <hi>Abingdon, Wallingford,</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> that it is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Garriſon of Papiſticall Cavees daily ſtrengthned more and more with Ammunition, men and victuals. Thence we heare like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that <hi>Denington</hi> Caſtle neere <hi>Newburie,</hi> and not far from <hi>Baſing,</hi> is now fortifying to be a ſtrengthning thereunto; That <hi>Andover</hi> is poſſeſſed by the Kings Forces to inlarge their Contributions; That a Taxe of nineſcore pounds the week is impoſed upon every Hundred neere thoſe places, to the inriching of the Parliament Adverſaries, to the diſadvantage of our chiefe City, and to the impoveriſhing of thoſe parts of <hi>Hamp-ſhire, Bark-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Wilt-ſhire,</hi> who now begin to cry out by reaſon of their oppreſſions, and to curſe the Malignancie and Neutrality of thoſe who allured them to take ſuch ſerpents into their boſomes: yea ſome among them proteſt with teares (where they dare complaine) that if now the Parliament would ſend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them, they ſhould find many hands to help forward the work; which their neighbours alſo would be glad to further before they come under the ſame laſh: and it is much wondred that a place ſo neere <hi>London</hi> upon a paſſage thither ſo convenient, and ſo eaſie to have been cleered, ſhould have been left ſo long obſtructed to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments great diſadvantage, unleſſe it had been unheeded and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for the nonce.</p>
            <p>I have heard from his own ſervants that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> a very dangerous Papiſt, (becauſe once a Proteſtant, and perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a woman) and who is owner of <hi>Baſing-houſe,</hi> and now reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therein; hath a Commiſſion to be General of the Forces raiſed and to be raiſed in thoſe South-parts; and when his Ladies Fathers Country men are come thither from <hi>Briſtol</hi> and <hi>Weſtcheſter</hi> to aſſiſt him, you ſhall ſee how needfull it would have been to have ſetled ere this time the Aſſociation of <hi>Kent, Surrey, Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> which I heare ſay is now againe revived, and as my Mercurie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades me may yet be undertaken with good ſucceſſe, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the miſchiefe deſign'd, if it be proceeded in with ſpeed and courage, and be not by them made fruitleſſe, who were no good friends to it heretofore. But it is probably ſuſpected that ſome will directly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54250:3"/>
hinder it if they can; or, by pretending the promotion of it take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to diminiſh our ſtrength ſome other way, under colour of ſaving charges, which (conſidering the chances of War are uncertain) may ſo fall out, that it may be the breaking of the Aſſociated Forces, the loſſe of ſome part of the Countrey for the time, or the indangering of all; and therefore it is deſired by the well-affected in thoſe Counties; that deluding Propoſitions tending to ſuch purpoſes may be well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Aſſociaters in their meetings and diſcreetly prevented.</p>
            <p>And now I think on it, the mention of this Aſſociation brings to mind ſomewhat which a ſouldier in one of thoſe Counties made me acquainted withall of his opinion touching the ſame, which I will here inſert, becauſe perchance ſome may adviſe worſe. If it be not worth heeding, it ſhall coſt but the reading; If it be conſiderable, the benefit of it may by this meanes be taken, though he ſhould not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to counſell in that Aſſociation, His opinion was briefly thus, and theſe are his own words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt, that conſidering the preſent neceſſity, there ſhould be no delay in eſtabliſhing that Aſſociation, leſt they who diligently meet, and talk much that nothing may be concluded, loſe that opportunity which is yet remaining, and muſt be ſuddenly caught. Secondly, before the main work ſhall be compleatly reſolved on, (which will require more time) he would that thoſe Forces which are in readineſſe in thoſe foure Counties (reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſmall power to watch over the Malignants in</hi> Kent <hi>and</hi> Suffex) <hi>ſhould immediately march to</hi> Farnham Caſtle, <hi>making that their Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz and place of refuge to retreat unto when any unequall power ſhould march againſt them, as alſo to be a refreſhing place for the weak and tired, and a Nurſerie out of which the Aſſociation ſhould be ſtill ſupplyed with diſciplin'd men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Farnham</hi> he would not have them ſtay longer then for a dayes reſt, or ſo long as the ordering of other pertinent affaires might require and that then they ſhould remove to <hi>Odiham</hi> or <hi>Alton</hi> in <hi>Hamſheire</hi> (the furtheſt not being much above two houres march) there to ſetle or move up and down to live upon thoſe that muſt maintaine the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies gariſon at <hi>Baſing;</hi> and to gather from them their impoſitions ſo far into the country as they may adventure till the aſſotiated body is compleated, that (as uſually we have done) we put not the State to as much charge during the time of preparations, as would with good husbandry beare the expences of the whole expedition. As they grew ſtronger he would have them dayly march farther even to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54250:3"/>
walls of the adverſaries garriſons, labouring continually by their ſcouts, or by hiring the country people, or inſinuating with them, to gaine intelligence of ſuch things as might conduce to their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and the diſadvantage of the foe, every day ſo viſiting ſome or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the neighbouring villages that their adverſaries might be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with no conſiderable aids or ſupplies. By which means, &amp; by that time the body of the aſſotiated forces were compleated, the foxes of thoſe burroughes would be much ſtreightned, and the ſoutherne parts of <hi>Hamſhire</hi> (ſeeing their inmates awed ſhall be won by fear or love to haſten their aſſent and contributions to the ſaid aſſotiation: &amp; perhaps before the ſaid aſſotiation is fully ſetled (&amp; during which interim many diſadvantages may elſe befall us) the enemies quarters being ſome and ſome gained, their garriſon may be taken, or well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for taking without a winter ſeige, which may elſe loſe us more men, money and time then we would willingly ſpare.</p>
            <p>When the aſſociated brigade is made up, he would not have it (as ſome have proiected) kept in one or in ſeveral bodies in the ſeveral aſſociated counties; for that (as experience hath taught us) would prove rather an oppreſſion then a defence unto them. But he rather adviſeth that they ſhould march into thoſe parts of <hi>Hamſhire</hi> which either will not or dare not aſſociate, leaving behinde them <hi>Kont, Surry,</hi> and <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> as ſecured ſufficiently by <hi>Farnham:</hi> gariſon, by the watch afore mentioned to be ſet over them, and by that readines which the aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted counties will be alwayes in, to returne upon any emergent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>By this courſe they ſhall not grieve or burthen their friends by being continually billeted upon them, nor diſcourage or diſable them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to their pay. Beſides, they ſhall by makeing the ſeat of war without the aſſociation, give the plough peaceable paſſage at home, diſturbe their adverſaries reicevers and confederates abrode, and dayly inlarge their own quarters. Yea by thus proceeding, the aſſociators ſhall have means to augment their forces (if there be cauſe) with leſſe charge: for God aſſiſting theſe endeavours, the next bordering ſheire wil ſhortly petition to unite it ſelfe to them to prevent being the ſeat of war, and ſo the next, and the next, till all come in.</p>
            <p>For that expedition he would have ſcouts, intelligencers, and ſpies choſen out by good adviſe from among the ſtouteſt and moſt witty of the well-affected, who are of quality for ſuch an employment, and would have them puniſhed and diſgraced for their falſhood, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54250:4"/>

For theſe are the nimble and ſure hinges upon which their forces muſt move forward and backward, ſhut and open, as there is cauſe: And it is through want of theſe that we have been ſo lame in our late execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. None of theſe ſhould be a common Trooper or Dragoneer, but men ſet apart meerly for that ſervice, becauſe we can neither confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently rely on men caſually ſet forth; neither can they or their horſes performe ſuch ſervices as they ought to do, who are tired with other duties, and brought off and on, at adventure upon a ſuddaine.</p>
            <p>And were he to ſelect a Brigade of ſuch a number as the aſſociators have reſolved on, which (as he hears) ſhall be 1200 horſe, and 800 dragoneers, he ſhould chuſe rather 800 horſe, and 1200 dragoners, for that ſervice, becauſe horſe are not onely a greater charge and more hardly raiſed but leſſe ſerviceable, and in ſome places and caſes not ſerviceable at all, yea perhaps 800 horſe, 800 dragoneers, and 400 musketiers may do better ſervice then they, if in lieu of charge ſaved by that change, ſo much might be added in engines to ſecure a paſſage in galtrapes, ſwedes feathers, ſhovels, ſpades and pilteaxes, which three laſt mentioned (though now ſlighted) are the ſecurity of Armies and ſuch as the moſt famous. Souldiers of the world made great uſe of.</p>
            <p>He mentioned ſomewhat alſo of having a certaine number of fire locks in ſteed of muskets for night ſervices, Ambuſcadoes and other ſuch like occaſions pertinent to the ſame deſigne, and of many other things, of which ſome are not to be revealed untill there be opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put them in execution, and the reſt are over-many to be recited here. Of this or of ſome other good courſe to be ſeriouſly proſecuted for the ſtrengthning of our hands the Country people deſire to heare, for though an evil ſpirit hath long deluded them, now their eyes begin to be opened, and they do ſee that the King, by the contribution and perſonall ayde of Papiſts from abroade, by arming Papiſts, Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, oppreſſors of the people, and the moſt vitious of his Subjects at home (and by calling hither the barbarous Iriſh Bapiſts after their murthering of nigh an hundred and fifty thouſand of his loyall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland)</hi> and by ſome other ſuch proceedings) will be both his own deſtruction and theirs if they come not in ſpeedily to help the Lord againſt the mighty oppoſitions and machinations of thoſe inſtruments of Antichriſt.</p>

There is a petition exhibited ſome-where, by many Free-holders to deſire both houſes ſeriouſly to confider the dangerouſnes of ſuch men and their practiſes, and to take order concerning them; or if they cannot, ſire that God would.</p>
            <p>I have heard lately from every part of the kingdome a generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of his Excellence the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> as well for many other virtues, as for his valiant and diſcreet managing of the late expedition to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and the battails at <hi>Alborne</hi> and neere <hi>Newberie,</hi> and am apt to beleeve the truth of it, in regard I have been an eye-witneſſe &amp; an obſerver of his worth in thoſe and many other evidences of the ſame, yet I have no aſſurance either from Citie, Court, or) Countrey, that an honourable opinion ſhall be long continued of his or any other mans Heroick Virtues among the Vulgar, for they will be ready to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice him to morrow, to whom they ſacrificed yeſterday; and be ready to vilifie him upon one improbable ſuſpition; of whoſe worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they have had a thouſand undenyable proofes.</p>
            <p>We heare from every quarter of the Countrey that the Kingdome is crucified between the two Armies, like Chriſt between two theeves; for though one of them be good in reſpect of the other, yet ſure I am they are both theeves. Some are diſcontented that the Armie is quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſo neere to the City, and feare they will be more weakned by idleneſſe, then they were by action; and verily beleeve that it would be more both for their health and Accommodation, if they were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, and where they might more ſtraiten the enemies quarters, and inlarge the limits of Contribution to their own maintenance, which (no doubt) our prudent Generall will take care of when oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſerves.</p>
            <p>We are certified from <hi>Reading</hi> that it is re-poſſeſt by the Cavees, and that they make haſte to fortifie the ſame, whereupon the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Countrey is this, that when places of ſuch conſequence are gotten with much expence of mony and blood, it were good diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for preventing further loſſe and charge to ſecure them better when we have them; and it is thought that many citizens and others will be ſhortly of the ſame opinion; yet <hi>Mercurie</hi> holds it a point of good diſcretion alſo not to cenſure harſhly of what was left undone, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54250:5"/>
might have been better ordered in their judgements; for they that are Actors find more difficulties then the lookers on, and many times for our ſins, the Divine Providence doth permit (to humble us) many failings and overſights in our actions, which elſe our underſtanding might have fore-ſeen and prevented.</p>
            <p>It is voiced from the North, that the Scots have entred <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> with a very great Armie, and that the Cavees doubting their ability to reſiſt, have projected by ſlanderous detractions, and by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to raiſe jelouſies, and beget diviſions between the Nations, to weaken their hands, and make void, if it be poſſible, the intended ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their Expedition: And therefore it was adviſed by a plain Country-fellow, that to make ſuch malicious plots and indeavours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſſefull, we ſhould beleeve of them as we find, and hope of their ſincere dealing with us according to their Chriſtian profeſſion, and their noble and honeſt demeanour in their laſt Expedition, at which time their Armie was an Exemplarie Patterne both to us and other Nations of that Civility and Juſtice which ought to be in Soldiers and Commanders profeſſing Chriſt. He is liable to a ſevere judgement that miſ-judgeth his brother; but doubtleſſe he expoſeth himſelfe to a greater condemnation that judgeth ſcandalouſly of a whole Nation, and the honeſty and faithfulneſſe of ſuch a one is juſtly to be ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>Now to prevent the murmurings of thoſe ſeeming to be on the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſide, who grumble at the mony which they are to receive from us towards their Expedition to <hi>New-eaſtle,</hi> the honeſt countrey people hold it good counſel to put theſe murmurers in mind, Firſt, how cold this winter may prove, and perhaps the next alſo, if the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieries there be not ſet open to us, before a paſſage be made thither by Forces from this place. Secondly, how much it concerns us to have the Scots ingaged with us in our Cauſe, as now they are: And laſtly, that the money wherewith by Gods help they may finiſh that work is not probably ſo much as would be required to raiſe, carry thither, &amp; bring back an Armie ſent from us to that purpoſe, though it ſhould coſt nothing during their abode there.</p>
            <p>There is cauſe of hope that by means of the New-great-ſoale which is now comming forth, Juſtice will have her courſe more freely then of late, and many miſchievous deſigns of the Kings ill Counſellors wil be prevented. If it had power alſo to conjure down the ſpirit of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignancie which is raiſed in theſe I lands, and take away Faction, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, ſelf-love, and diſcord from among us, it were a qualification
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54250:6"/>
which I feare it hath not; yet perhaps it may be a means to further thoſe proceedings which will much hinder their evill effects for the preſent, and abate, at leaſt, the predominancie of thoſe vices ere long.</p>
            <p>We are incredibly informed from <hi>Oxford,</hi> that the King had no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loſle at the skirmiſh by <hi>Alborne,</hi> or at the battell neere <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie,</hi> as we have been made beleeve. It is true indeed, that he loſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Subjects;</hi> but they are but trifles, and it is almoſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed (though hoped otherwiſe by me) things which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards not. He loſt alſo many good horſes, as his own partie doth confeſſe; but he had them onely for taking up, and hath takers enough to recrute them: He loſt Lords, and a great Officer, &amp;c. but that is a loſſe the leaſt worth notice of all the reſt, for they are toyes, which if he pleaſe he can make of the veryeſt raſcals in his Army; they did wel therefore to give God thanks that their loſſes were no greater: But had they been ſo great on our ſide, we ſhould rather have addreſſed our ſelves unto him by way of humiliation, then have mocked him with a counterfet Thankſgiving, as they have often done, and may now doe againe for their late overthrows in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi> and at <hi>Hull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is further certified from <hi>Oxford,</hi> or elſe <hi>Mercurie</hi> deviz'd it, (which is very probable) that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterburie</hi> (ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hourable in nothing but in this, that he will be the occaſion of rooting out the Prelacie from this Kingdom) hath made a motion that Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> (who was there Incorporated and made Maſter of Arts, when that little good Biſhop (then dreaming not of ſuch a change) enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him and His Majeſtie) might proceed Doctor, to make him the more capable of a Biſhoprick, which it is preſumed the Papiſts will procure the Popes Holineſſe to confer upon him for his good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in their Cauſe at his return, I know not-whither; for habitation he hath none, and that makes him ſo miſchievous to thoſe that have.</p>
            <p>It is, there, thought alſo by ſome of His Majeſties ſervants (as our <hi>Mercurie</hi> verily beleeveth) that the Queen will not have ſo many Masks at Chriſtmas and Shrovetide this yeare as ſhe was wont to have other yeeres heretofore; becauſe <hi>Inigo Iones</hi> cannot convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make ſuch-Heavens and Paradiſes at <hi>Oxford</hi> as he did at <hi>White-hall;</hi> &amp; becauſe the Poets are dead, beggered, or run away, who were wont in their Masks to make Gods and Goddeſſes of them, and ſhamefully to flatter them with Attributes neither fitting to be aſcribed or accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of; and ſome are of opinion, that this is one of the innumerable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities which hath made them and us become ſo miſerable at this day.

And we hear of as many preached in other places to as ill purpoſes another way: Inſomuch that the well-affected Countrey people are perſwaded, that if God had not by the Parliaments wiſdom and their exemplarie loyaltie cauſed thoſe falſe Prophets to diſſemble their ſecret deſires, many of them (if they have not done it already) would have preached Treaſon, and animated to that Rebellion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are falſly accuſed, by the promoters of Tyrannie, becauſe we wil not deſert the reality of Allegeance to profeſſe and practice the bare complements thereof to the deſtruction both of our Liege Lord, His Kingdoms, and our ſelves. Other Doctrines are alſo vented among us by ſome pretending to Reformation, which all the Reformed Churches would be loth to owne; and which will prolong our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, if the Parliament and Synode (with whom they in ſome things comply for their preſent ſecurity) do not (as we hope they wil) time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover and prevent their increaſing Hereſies and falſe Maximes.</p>
            <p>There was lately a meeting at one of our Countrey Exchanges, where <hi>Mercurie</hi> being in the Chaire, many particulars pertinent to the preſent affaires of the time were put to the Queſtion, but what is fit to be reſolved or voted thereupon, it is referred to your conſcience who now ſhall read them. The Queſtions put are theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether the King being yet conſtant in the Proteſtant Religion, and reall according to all his Proteſtations made before God and Man touching this Church and State, the prevalencie of his Queen may not make him (contrarie to his preſent purpoſe) doe for a womans ſake as much as</hi> Solomon; <hi>and the flatteries and importunies of his young and evill counſellors bring him to as great a loſſe as</hi> Rhehoboams: <hi>whether alſo he may not be permitted to ſlip into ſome failings for our ſins (which drew down theſe judgements for our chaſtiſement) as it befell the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites for</hi> Davids <hi>ſin: And whether he may not repent alſo as well as</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>and be at laſt reconciled to God and us, to the publique advantage,</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:54250:7"/>
               <hi>and his encreaſe of honour, when we have repented our tranſgreſſions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>The Queen having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o many yeers after her firſt comming enjoy'd the love even of thoſe of this Nation who are of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, might not then haue been won to become a Daughter (nay a nurſing Mother) of this Church, if ſhe had not been left to their deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who (if it were poſſible) would deceive the very Elect; If thoſe who had place and opportunities to have endeavoured it and (as we heare) had inducements to hope it might have been effected, had according to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty attempted the ſame; And whether it is not likely that the Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and the whole Prelacie are now come to this ſhame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they complyed with her ſeducers, and rather confirmed her in an Idolatrous worſhip, then aſſayed to inform her in the right way?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether it be poſſible that a King, many yeers honoured with evidences of Piety and Morality, could poſſibly proceed as he hath done, if the falſhood and impiety of his evill counſellors were not vailed over with ſome diſguiſes: And whether (though he make uſe of them for the preſent neceſſities) he can eſteem them in his private judgement bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tep then Traitors or baſe Paraſites, who having been at firſt Zelots for the Parliament, afterward left it for the wages of Ambition: Or whether he can eſteeme of thoſe, more then of a dog deſerving the halter, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt raiſed by His Royall favour, (and long maintained by Projects and Monopolies obtained by abuſing that Royall Power) could deſert their Advancer, and comply with the Parliament to avoid their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and afterward againe, when they ſaw the Parliament eclipſed, could baſely creep and inſinuate back into his Boſome whom they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Proteſtants and Papiſts being ſo exaſperated againſt each other, and the Papiſts having begun a bloody Maſſacre in</hi> Ireland, <hi>which the Tenets of their Religion bind them to proſecute upon all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages) whether can they ever be ſo reconciled as to live ſecurely together again in theſe</hi> Ilands <hi>ſo long as they continue of different Religions? And whether they will think the King out of their debt untill he hath given them leave to prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, <hi>Whether his Majeſty be not, by reaſon, diſcharged from all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to the Papiſts for perſonall ſervices and contributions to this war, and bound in juſtice to puniſh rather then reward them for the ſame,</hi>

               <hi>ſeeing he cannot but know, both by their tenets, and by thoſe motives whereby the Queene incouraged them in her letters, that they aided him for n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> reſpect to himſelf (if he be not totally theirs) but meerly for their own ends; and to continue that barbarous and murtherous project which they long ſince begun here; lately revived in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and do now proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute throughout his Majeſties dominions, for the accompliſhment of our generall premeditated deſtruction, under the falſe colour of ſerving his Majeſty, and promoting his Priviledges?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Queſtion of theirs which I will trouble you withall is, <hi>If we ſuffer the policies of Antichriſt, for the continuation of his miſtery of iniquity thus to divide the body from the head, the King from the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Court from the City, the City from the Country, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from the Commons, the Commons from themſelves; yea to divide the Church, the State, every Province, every County, every City, every Village, every Family, and many individuall perſons in their own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whether this be not or will not be ſhortly ſuch a divided kingdome as cannot long ſtand without Gods miraculous aid and our more ſerious working with him? And whether will not the children of Babel ſeek to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire again her decayes by the ruines of our Britiſh Churches? And whether it be not required of us, (and high time for us) to be reconciled to God and to each other, that we may haſten the fullfilling of his decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the where, the malignant City, the falſe Prophet, the Beaſt; and do that to them which they purpoſe to us (and have already begun to doe in Ireland with unexampled cruelty) even to beat or baniſh them, who will not forſake their abominations, out of theſe Iſlands; that</hi> Babylon <hi>may vaniſh, and the new</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>come down amongſt us?</hi> How theſe queſtions are to be voted upon, let every one conſider and reſolve by himſelf according to his diſcretion.</p>
            <p>Perchance there be ſome who are deſirous to here what opinion we have in the Country touching the nationall covenant lately tendred, and perhaps alſo the knowledge thereof may be to ſome purpoſe. You ſhall hereby underſtand therefore, that not onely all men well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Parliament, but every other reaſonable man alſo in theſe Counties, where this <hi>Mercurie</hi> hath been, thus conceives of the ſaid Covenant.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it tends to the ſtrengthning of that nationall union which is now made betwixt us and the Scots, and the want of which was an occaſion of much blood-ſhed in this Iſland many ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:54250:8"/>
Secondly, That it conduceth to that unity and conformity through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the reformed Churches, which may by Gods bleſſing, ſettle Chriſtian peace, prevent the future increaſe of hereſies and ſchiſmes hitherto multiplied amongſt us, help to preſerve truth in purity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the incroachments of popery and ſuperſtition, and further the overthrowes of Antichriſt. Fourthly, That it will help ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us our juſt rights and priviledges, with the preſervation of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties perſon, honour and lawfull prerogatives, againſt Traitors, Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, Tirants and Oppreſſors. Fiftly, That it ingageth us to a ſpeedy repentance of thoſe ſins which have brought on us the preſent plagues; and to the amendment of our lives alſo for the time to come. 6. They hold it agreeable to the practiſe of the ancient Churches of God, who when ſuch occaſions were, made covenants to the like effect by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine approbation, as their covenants recorded in holy writ may teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie. And the opinion of thoſe among them whoſe judgement is not to be deſpiſed, is this; that whoſoever willfully refuſes this covenant, deſerveth to be reputed an enemy to all that is good, to be chaſtiſed by all the miſeries attending diviſion and diſcord; and to be deprived of every good effect which it may produce hereafter; for the preſent, to be denied the vſe of thoſe good things which they poſſeſſe among us, and to be judged unworthy to continue in this land, or to partake of this ayre, any longer.</p>
            <p>Of the like opinion is this <hi>Mercurie,</hi> who among many other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in his ruſtick preambulations had theſe two, which I thought not impertinently divulged at this time: One is, that they who would ſeeme to have the tendereſt conſciences in this cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and Parliament, and who uſually colour their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Parliament by pretending a conſcionable obedience to all the Kings commands, are they (if we may judge them by their former converſation and preſent courſe of life) who make little conſcience of that, or of any ſin elſe. As if for making no conſcience of breaking ſuch lawes as were once written in their hearts, God had now juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infatuated their underſtanding, and left them onely ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as might bring deſerved chaſtiſement on us, and confuſion on themſelves.</p>
            <p>His other obſervation is, that the moſt violent pleaders againſt the Parliament, and the moſt active malignants among us are onely ſuch as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

their dependants, tapſters, hoſtlers, chamberlains and drawers: Needy Popiſh or debauched Schollers, ſeeking or poſſeſſing preferment by complying with ſuperſtion or prophanenes; Luxurious Gallants and Gameſters; Fencers, Fidlers and Players; Silly people led according to the capacity, folly, or frenzie of their Kindred, Familiars, Maſters, Land-lords, or of the neighbouring Juſtices, or unſound Parliament members malignantly affected; Good-fellowes and pot compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who confirme each other in their malignancy on the ale-bench, and wonderfully ſtrengthen their cauſe by drinking healths to Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> and confuſion to the Parliament, while horrible oathes and imprecations are ſhot off, Libertines that feare the change of Church diſcipline will abridge their pleaſures; Projecters, and Monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers whoſe lively-hood is taken away, if injuſtice and oppreſſion may not continue; Papiſts, Atheiſts, Prelates and their, &amp;c. yea it is obſerved (though I would be loth to be author of it) that among thoſe women which are zelots of the Cavallerro way (which many of them favour for divers carnall reſpects) none are ſuch pert and violent Oratreſſes for it, as they who are either known, or juſtly ſuſpected, to be little whoriſh. To theſe if you adde a wandring Prince or two, ſome Lords (and ſuch Commanders as become theſe Regiments) you have that maſſe, out of which you may marſhall up that Army which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth our King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>We are certified that ſome are much troubled to perceive ſo many men, who are learned, ſeemingly honeſt, wiſe, religious and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable of the right way, and of thoſe things which tend to the glory of God, the peace of their country, and the prevention of Antichriſtian deſignes, ſhould now be queſtioned as Apoſtatizers and fallers away from their firſt love and profeſſion, in this time of triall, and of our great need of their aſſiſtance, &amp; exemplary conſtancy. Therefore to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, &amp; ſtrengthen their faiths, we do here give notice of two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations that a Country man (who hath heretofore rightly conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red things pertinent to theſe times) hath lately made: one is an aſſurance that this falling away of men, Starlike for their eminency, is no ſtrange or unexpected novelty, but a fulfilling in part of that myſtical predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by which we were long ſince forewarned, that the Dragons taile ſhould draw down ſtarres from Heaven; For there is nothing now left of that Beaſt (in compariſon of what he was) but the <hi>Taile.</hi> And (as Serpents uſually do when a mortall wound is received) the taile wriggles about ſo furiouſly that it ſtrikes down thoſe from their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54250:9"/>
ſphears, who, being but Meteors, eemed ſtarres in this lower heaven, the military kingdom of Chriſt on earth.</p>
            <p>The other note is this; He hath obſerved that all the marks by which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> marked out his enemies, and the malitious enemies of God and his Church from other ſinners, are undoubtedly now found upon the adverſaries of this Church and State, confederat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in theſe kingdomes; whether you have reſpect to their practiſes, their qual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ties, their purpoſes, or their languages as would appeare if I ſhould here inſert the ſeverall texts expreſſing their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies, their impudent wickednes, their haughtines, their skoffes, their ſcornes, their inſolencies, their blood-thirſtines, their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, their trechery, their blaſphemy, their lyings, their curſings, their ſlanders, their prepartions for warre and hoſtile attempts when they are in Treaties of Peace, their drunken ſongs, their impious and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorie Intergatories concerning our God, his promiſes, our truſt, our hopes in him, our faſtings, our prayers, and other Chriſtian duties, and ſuch like. And I was moved here to divulge this for glad tidings, That though for our chaſtiſement theſe may perſecute and exerciſe our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for a while, yet they ſhall at laſt receive the portion, and come to the deſtruction prepared for ſuch offenders.</p>
            <p>More of theſe things I could tell you out of the Countrey, but I have other buſineſſe. Here is more then I firſt intended, and more, I feare, then ſome of you will either thank me for, or make a right uſe of. If ever you heare of me in this kind again, (which I wil not promiſe) it ſhall be but once more, as occaſion is offered; and, I will be <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Sublimatus,</hi> at leaſt above the clouds; and then farewell.</p>
