         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This ſecond Part of the Proteſtant <hi>Priuate Spirit,</hi> like a nevv-borne Infant, is at length, after long trauaile, come to light. I may iuſtly terme it an <hi>Agrippa,</hi> becauſe it vvas hardly brought forth. It cauſed many great, and long gripings in the Mothers vvombe, in the <hi>Conception</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:17745:3"/>
               <hi>Framing,</hi> but paſſed difficulties, both greater and longer, in the <hi>Byrth</hi> &amp; <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> (ſo hard it is for an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> among the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to conceaue &amp; beare ſuch Infants.) It vvas in danger to haue byn ſtifled vnder Midvviues hands: one vvas long ſought for, hardly obteyned, and farre fetched; and yet as a ſtranger, not ſo skillfull, but that many errours are committed. If therefore it come to thy vievv maimed &amp; imperfect, blame not the <hi>Authour,</hi> excuſe the <hi>Printer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou vvilt meruaile hovv this ſecond Part gets birth and breath, and comes to light before the firſt. The reaſon is this: like to tvvo <hi>Tvvins</hi> they ſtrugled in the birth, and paſſing the hands of diuers Midvviues, this fell to the lott of one more ready and skillfull, and ſo got the precedence of <hi>Birth-right</hi>; vvhich yet in part vvas its due, as being firſt formed &amp; compoſed, and that before the other vvas
<pb facs="tcp:17745:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intended. For ſuppoſing the Aduerſary as common &amp; knovvne, to vvit the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Spirit,</hi> vvithout diſcuſſing the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, it aſſaulted him at the firſt, and ſo aymed to vvound Hereſy in the head.</p>
            <p>But vvherfore then is this called the ſecond, the other the firſt Part? Becauſe the matter or ſubiect ſo requires, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Confutation of the <hi>Priuate Spirit,</hi> the ground of all Proteſtancy; the other a Proofe, or declaration, that the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſuch a Ground to the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: vvhich at the firſt ſuppoſed, vvas after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard thought fit to be at large proued; that therby it may appeare, that this <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Spirit</hi> is by the ſayd Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, made not only a Ground, but a ſole and vvhole Ground of their <hi>Fayth</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>; yea that all other true <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unds</hi> are for that end by them neglected, and reiected. Which proofe of being a Ground (the order of Doctrine ſo requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring)
<pb facs="tcp:17745:4"/>
becauſe it is precedent to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of the ſame; there fore the other Part, though later compoſed and diuul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, claimes the title of the firſt &amp; this, of the ſecond Part.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, if this, thus hardly brought forth, and thus ſvvadled in the cloutes of many imperfections both of pen and print, may giue thee Content; &amp; thy Content giue Vente; and the Vente help on to the birth of the other; my hope shalbe, that as this Part may ſatisfy thee in the diſproofe of this ſuppoſed falſe Ground: ſo the other vvill more ſatisfy, firſt in the proofe of the true <hi>Grounds</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Catholikes; next in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the ſame <hi>Grounds</hi> vſed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and that for the eſtablishing of their falſe <hi>Ground,</hi> vvhich in the firſt Part is fully performed.</p>

                  <hi>Not for thy ſaying O woman, do we belieue, for our ſelues haue heard, and do know, that this is the Sauiour of the world indeed.</hi> So all Chriſtians are firſt prepared by credible teſtimonies, &amp; directed by Church authority, to the knowledge and certainty of that truth: but afterwards when the diuine reuelation it ſelfe, as the word of our Sauiour, is made knowne to them, then do they now (formally and finally) not for the teſtimonies of credibility, or Church propoſition, but for the diuine reuelation it ſelf, giue firme and infallible aſſent, and beliefe to the verityes or articles of fayth.</p>
               <p>And thus Catholike fayth is that, which is for probable teſtimonies accepted as credible, by Church propoſed as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, by an infuſed habit effected as ſupernaturall, by diuine verity reuealed as truth infallible, and neceſſary to be belieued.

Who, and what ſort of perſons, are to make it, and apply the rule.

And what ſpirit of whomeſoeuer is contrary to it, diuided from it, or ſeparated from communion or ſociety of it, is certainly not the ſpirit of God, but of man, the world, or the Diuell. And this is a way certaine to try ſpirits, and diſcerne which is true, or falſe; good, or bad; of God, or the

enemy. For ſith the ſpirit of God is (as God is) one and not diuided, <note n="(1)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 4.11.13.</note>

                  <hi>You are the body of Chriſt, and members of member</hi>; muſt haue their ſpirit vnited with it, ordered by it, and ſubordinate to it.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Inferences.</note>Out of which it doth follow, firſt; that the guift of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of holy Scripture, and explicating of high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteryes of fayth, is a guift, not generall and common to all the faythfull, as depending and following neceſſary vpon Fayth, or grace, but ſpeciall and particuler to ſome, as <hi>gratis</hi> giuen, to whome it pleaſeth God to giue it. Secondly, that all faythfull, and iuſt perſons, cannot be directed by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary guifte, in their iudgement of fayth, deciſion of controuerſies, and interpretation of ſcripture, becauſe it is not giuen to euery iuſt man, as is proued: not yet only to the iuſt,<note place="margin">

               <p>To interprete Scripture, and decide Controuerſies of Fayth, is a guift, not giuen generally to all the iuſt or faithfull, by vertue of their iuſtification: but extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſtowed vpon ſome only, as a grace, <hi>gratis data</hi>: but the priuate ſpirit, according to the Proteſtant doctrine, is a guift giuen to all, and euery faithfull, by vertue of their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, not <hi>gratia gratis data:</hi> to ſome therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant priuate ſpirit cannot be a guift, giuen to interprete, in euery one, the holy Scripture, and iudge of all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies of fayth.

Surely ſuch is the difficulty in all theſe, and many more doubts, that let any one ſpirit of one man, or many ſpirits of

                  <p>Secondly, that it moues only to matter of piety,<note place="margin">Piety.</note> and ſanctity, and to nothing contrary to good life and manners, or to the law of God, or naturall reaſon. Therefore what is ſinne, &amp; impiety by commiſſion, or omiſſion, againſt reaſon or grace, is from the bad, not the good ſpirit.

                  <p>Fourthly, that when it moues in particuler to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary works, as for example, of pennance &amp; faſting, as it did <hi>S. Antony,</hi>

did ſome Virgins, and Martyrs to caſt themſelues into the water or fire, to preuent tentation, or confound the Tyrants; al which it did for the fuller triall of the perſons, the greater honour of God, or more edification of others: When I ſay, God moues or inſpires to theſe extraordinary workes, then ordinarily he doth it with that ſenſe of certainty, that he leaues no doubt of it in the ſoule; with that vehemency of motion, that the ſoule preſently proceeds to execution; with that ſubtility of attention, that in the operation, the ſoule can hardly attend to any thing els, but that which is good, and of God.</p>
                  <p>The rules and markes drawne from the manner of proceeding of the ſpirit, are. Firſt,<note place="margin">In the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour part of the ſoule.</note> That when the ſpirit doth worke any good motion immediately in the ſuperiour part of the ſoule (as in the Vnderſtanding, reuelations and illuminations of truth; In the wil, inſpirations, and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and ardent deſires of good; In the Memory, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adheſion to God in the ſame manner as it doth the habits of faith, hope, charity, and the reſt) all, without any mediatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or miniſtery of any ſpecies in the outward ſenſes, or of phantaſies in the interiour imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (to which the power of the bad ſpirit is limited;) that then it is the ſpirit of God, which ſomtimes enters in, knocking at the dore of the ſoule by holy vocations and admonitions to call it from ſinne to grace, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vice to vertue: ſomtimes hauing got en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance doth worke &amp; labour in the ſoule, either inlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the darkeneſſe, or inflaming the coldneſſe, or moiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the dryneſſe, or righting the crookedneſſe, or mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hardeneſſe, or awaking the drowſineſſe, or curing the ſickneſſe, &amp; reuiuing the ſenſleſnes, which it finds in the ſame. Somtims it proceeds ſo far, as now to infuſe a copious light of knowledge, reuealing ſecret ſenſes of ſcripture, deep myſteries of faith, high points of contemplation; now to inſtill a pleaſant dew of conſolations, and comforts in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall practiſe, and of content and ſweetnes, in enduring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; now to perfume it with a fragrant odour, either of the incenſe of Deuotion, or of the myrrhe of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of the ſweet ſent of all heroicall vertues and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17745:52"/>
wherewith the ſoule is rapt, as it were, out of the ſenſe of bodily feeling, vp to a glimpſe, to a taſte, to a ſweetnes, to an vnion with God, ſo farre, that it is no more where it liues but where it loues, now wholy abſorpt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed, and inflamed, and transformed into God, and God into it. All which are a ſigne of the ſpirit of God,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">With pure intention.</note>Secondly, that the ſpirit of God thus ſetled in the ſoule, doth as it were with two eyes looke out, &amp; abroad, into all things. That is, with the one of pure intention, which ſeeks, not our owne honour, profit, pleaſure, and content in any thing but God, and his honour, glory, and praiſe in all our words, actions, viſitations, conſolations, or deſolations: The other of diſcretion,<note place="margin">With diſcre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note> which proceeds in meaſure, not going further in any practiſe, then our ability will extend: In weight, valewing things of neceſſity, before things vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, of iuſtice before charity, of obligation before ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation: In degree, firſt mouing, then walking, then running, and laſtly flying, and that by ſtep to ſtep, from the botome to the top, imbracing firſt the feet, next the knees, then the hands, &amp; ſo to the face, and preſence of our Sauiour: In order, contenting our ſelues with wayes ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, plaine, facill, vſuall and commodious to our ſelues &amp; others, not aſpiring to works &amp; effects extraordinary high, prodigious, miraculous, beyond reach of our reaſon, and without benefit to any. And in all, it perſeuers, &amp; proceeds with vigilancy, and diligence, without ſtop, interruption, or retiring in the courſe of vertue and perfection.</p>
                  <p>The rules, and ſignes drawne from the effects and operations of this Spirit,<note place="margin">With a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall taſt.</note> are: That the ſpirit of God, for the moſt part, hath, and doth cauſe ſuch a ſpirituall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and taſte in the ſoule where it is, that as a man is knowne by his voice and viſage, as hony is diſcerned by the taſte &amp; ſweetnes: So the motions, illuſtrations, and the voice, and ſpeach of God are diſcerned, and knowne by a certaine proper, diuine, and ſpirituall taſte and ſweetnes, which, men accuſtomed to them, and practiſed in them, can by a ſupernaturall inſtinct of grace (as a child doth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a naturall inſtinct of nature) better diſcerne in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17745:52"/>
then expreſſe to others; and fullier ſatisfy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues with them, then giue any reaſon of them; ſaying with the Prophet <note n="(1)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Dauid,</hi> that they taſte, and ſee, that <hi>our Lord is ſweet</hi>; &amp; with the Apoſtle, that they <note n="(2)" place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, that the ſpirit of God doth worke in the heart a true and ſolid humility,<note place="margin">Humility.</note> whoſe acts and effects are, 1. To feare, refuſe, or at the leaſt vnwillingly accept theſe extraordinary viſitations being offered, preferring the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny of mount Caluary, before the glory of mount Thabor. 2. To conceale, and hide, not relate and ſpeake of theſe gifts being receaued: but diſcouering them only in confeſſion for counſell, and that leſſe willingly then ſinnes. 3. To deſire, to be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned in matters not only honorable of the world, but ſpiritual, as to be reputed wicked by perſons not wicked but good, ſo long as no ſcandall is thereby likely to enſue. 4. To wonder that ſo worthy guifts ſhould be in ſo vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a perſon, &amp; that God ſhould beſtow ſo much good vpon one ſo bad. 5. To feele rather a ſhame and confuſion for the deformity of ſinne, then a ioy &amp; conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the dignity of the gift. 6. Not to deſire theſe great and extraordinary viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but more ordinary acts of loue, purity, and humility. 7. Not to eſteeme of ones ſelfe better for them, but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count others more holy without them. 8. Not to preſume vpon any ſecurity or fauour for hauing them, but rather to feare greater obligation, vnworthineſſe, and ingratitude for not well vſing them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that the ſpirit of God doth worke a perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience:<note place="margin">Obedience.</note> firſt of the will, againſt ſelfe loue; ſecondly of the vnderſtanding, againſt ſelfe conceit; both of them, firſt to the will of God, to <hi>runne the way of his commandements</hi>; ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly, to the will of man, that is ſuperiour vnder God, to be ruled by him. Thus did the holy Hermites accept it as a ſigne of Gods ſpirit in Simeon Stelites, when being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come to them, and giue an account of his auſtere
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17745:53"/>
life, he preſently obeyed, and prepared to deſcend from his rocke to them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, that the ſpirit of God doth worke vpon this reſignation,<note place="margin">Reſignation</note> a true mortification. Firſt exteriour of the body, to tame the pride of the fleſh. Next, and chiefly, interiour of the mind, to aſſwage the rage of paſſion and affection; &amp; both for that end to attaine to purity, not only of mind, but alſo of body,<note place="margin">Bonauentur. proceſſu <hi>7.</hi> relig. cap. <hi>18.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe viſions and apparitions (much more motions and inſpirations) though they come, ſaith one, in the likeneſſe of Saints, of our Lady, or of Chriſt, are alwayes ſuſpitious, if they bring impurity of ſenſuall motions.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, that the good ſpirit of God doth bring with it peace,<note place="margin">Peace.</note> and tranquillity, ioy and gladneſſe, comfort and conſolation of the mind, expelling feare, bridling paſſions, ſupreſſing affections, and ſubiecting all manner of perturbations, to reaſon and grace. And though it cauſe ſome terrour, deſolation or perturbation, yet it is at the firſt entrance when it begins, and that in ſinners, in whom it finds reſiſtance, whom yet in the end it leaues in comfort and conſolation. And though it be ſhort, and for the moſt, not of long continuance, yet it is not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, often coming and often going, and alwayes leauing a good reliſh after it; but alſo effectual, in euery one according to his ſtate, as in an incipient in the purgatiue way, rooting out vices; in a proficient in the illuminatiue way, planting of vertues: in a perfect man, in the perfect way, exerciſing perfection of action and contemplation. And theſe and ſuch like be the rules and ſignes they giue to diſcerne good ſpirits.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. 5. In tyme,<note place="margin">Tyme.</note> that good appeare ordinarily in the light, as Angels of light: but the bad in darkeneſſe, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of darkneſſe. 6. For perſons,<note place="margin">Perſons.</note> that the good appeare to good men, to encourage them in goodneſſe: the bad, to bad men, to draw them to more badneſſe. 7. For holy thinges,<note place="margin">Holy things</note> that good do affect and deſire: but the bad do fly &amp; abhorre thinges holy and conſecrated,<note place="margin">Thyraeus de apparit. lib. <hi>1.</hi> theſ. <hi>411.</hi> Delr. de mag. diſquiſit. l. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>2.</hi> q. <hi>3.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, for the internall motions of the good and bad ſpirit, they aſſigne theſe kindes of differences:<note place="margin">Differences betweene inſpirations and ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</note> That the good ſpirit obſerues an order, and conueniency of age and ſtate in perſons; of tymes and ſeaſons in affaires; communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating wiſedome, grace, and guifts agreable. 1.

flyes in his owne conceit, aboue all both meaſure, reaſon, &amp; diſcretion.</p>
                  <p>That the good ſpirit keepes in all, a tranquility of the mind,<note place="margin">In peace &amp; tranquility.</note> with a conformity in all thinges to the will of God, whether it be the rooting out of vices, the planting of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the exerciſe of mortification, and deuotion, all conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a pure iniention of not ſeeking ones owne, but Gods honour; and with a diſcreet moderation, in being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too credulous, in belieuing all, nor too obdurate, in belieuing nothing, but with aduice, and temper, to examin all, and not raſhly to receaue, or reiect any. The bad ſpirit runs in all, the contrary race; in ſome thinges it is troubled and diſquieted with feares and ſcruples; in others looſe, &amp; diſſolute without care, or conſcience; at ſometymes feruent and headlong in deuotion beyond meaſure; at others, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pide and dull, without ſenſe, or feeling; in ſome practiſes of ſmall importance, violent, vehement, and impatient without reaſon; in others of moment, negligent, careleſſe and heedleſſe without any eſteeme or regard; in purpoſes of good, wauering, and inconſtant; in iudgment of others, credulous, and temerarious. All which (omitting much which might be ſayd more) may ſuffice to diſcerne the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of ſignes of good ſpirits, and the difference of them from bad. It remaynes to ſhew, that neither theſe rules to diſcerne good ſpirits from bad, nor the difference betweene good ſpirits and bad, are ſo certaine, nor the applying them to euery particuler euent ſo eaſy, that the ſpirit of euery pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, can of it ſelfe proceed in it, and ſecurely reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon it.</p>

Of which neceſſity of Fayth, prerequired to the vnderſtanding of Scripture, ſee <hi>Stapleton de principijs Doctrinalibus,</hi> where the ſame is further proued out of the ancient Fathers teſtimonyes, to wit, <hi>S.

                  <p>Out of which may be inferred, how vntruly and frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulently the Proteſtants do generally auerre, that in the ſcripture the ſpirit of God is, and is to be ſought and found; and that by induſtry and reading of the words and text the ſpirit is to be found. Whereupon they make the words of ſcripture, as they are heard or read, not only the organ or inſtrument of faith, as much as wee make the Sacrament inſtrument of grace; but alſo the ſole inſtrument, which with diligence read or heard, they preſcribe as the only mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to receiue faith and ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, as a man conſiſts of body and ſoule, and the body of it ſelfe being ſenſleſſe &amp; dead, is the inferiour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17745:70"/>
and ſubſtance of the ſcripture. Now the words, as they are written or ſpoken, conſiſting of letters, ſyllables, &amp; words, are dead without life, and common to Gentils, Iewes, and hereticks, with the faithfull: yea in the ſame manner as the law is called a law of ſinne; ſo are they by S. Paul,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7</note> ſaid to <hi>Kill, &amp; to be ministration of death.</hi> Becauſe according to S.

The ſenſe and meaning, as it is truly vnderſtood &amp; belieued (which is properly the word of God) is an effectuall meanes <hi>more piercing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any two-edged ſword,</hi> &amp; an operatiue vertue <hi>to ſaluation,</hi> but to whome?<note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly. As the bare letter, words,<note place="margin">The Holy Ghoſt is not inherent in the letter of ſcripture.</note> and text of ſcripture without true ſenſe are not the word of God, ſo they do not containe the ſpirit of God or the holy ghoſt in them, neither is the holy ghoſt thus inherent, reſident, or to be ſought &amp; found in the ſcripture, but in the hart and ſoule of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſcripture, that is, the Prophets or Apoſtles, in whom as it did remaine, and dictate to them what they writ, ſo did it reueale and manifeſt to them the true ſenſe &amp; meaning of the ſame, though perhaps not alwayes the whole &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete meaning, and all ſenſes of the ſcripture (for by reaſon of the fecundity of ſenſes in Gods word, many,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. <hi>12.</hi> Confeſs. c. <hi>18</hi> &amp; de Geneſ. ad literam.</note> or al of them were not, according to S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> alwayes reuealed to the ſame Apoſtles or prophets, but ſome reſerued to the authour of it the holy ghoſt it ſelfe.) And as the ſpirit of God is not inherent or reſident in the bare words, ſillables, or text of ſcripture; ſo the ſpirit or ſpiritual true ſenſe of ſcripture is not to be ſought or found only in, or out of the bare words,<note place="margin">The ſenſe of ſcripture to be found by the rule of Fayth.</note> and their grammaticall ſignification, but out of the rule of faith expounded according to the Eccleſiaſticall and Catholike doctrine of beliefe. Not by humane labour and induſtry of ſtudy, but by the meane of faith and diuine reuelation. For the words are tranſlated into other languages different from
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17745:71"/>
that in which they were originally written, and haue diuers and various ſignifications and ſenſes, as litterall, moral, alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall, and anagogicall; and are by ſeuerall expoſitions drawne to ſuport diuers ſeuerall, yea contrary faithes, and religions. Alſo great labour, diligence and ſtudy haue beene vſed by many men of great wit, learning, and knowledge in the expounding &amp; ſeeking out the true ſenſe of ſcripture, who yet haue beene ſo far from finding it, as that they haue inuented many falſe and heretical meanings, and therupon grounded many wicked and damned hereſies.</p>
                  <p>Out of al which it doth follow, that the words of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the diligent and frequent reading or hearing of it, are ſo far from being a neceſſary meanes of faith, much leſſe the ſole &amp; whole meanes to it, that faith is a meanes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary &amp; preſuppoſed to the vnderſtanding of ſcripture. For if the ſcripture conſiſt not in the words and letter only, but in the ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding principally; and if the ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not vpon the bare words, but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eccleſiaſtical &amp; catholicke rule, &amp; tradition of faith, as is proued; then muſt faith be prerequired, as a help and meanes to find out the true ſenſe of ſcripture. And they who will read ſcripture muſt bring faith with them, as a help and meanes to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſcripture, and not ground their faith vpon their reading of ſcripture; which being diligently read, though it may ſerue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme and nouriſh faith in ones ſelfe, or to illuſtrate and defend it to others, and in both being, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rule of faith interpreted, a light to direct them in the way of piety, and to enflame them with the heat of Charity: yet it can neither be a firſt, and firme ground to cauſe and produce firſt and certaine faith in any (for a man muſt bring faith to belieue it) nor a ſufficient meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue all points of faith neceſſary to ſaluation, as beſids other reaſons, the practiſe of ſo many hereſies, diuided, &amp; preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be grounded all vpon it, doth conuince; and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience made (for example) of three perſons, Iews, Turks, or Pagans, all ignorant of Chriſtian religion, all turned to a bare text of the bible, all willed to ſeeke out, and reſolue in particular articles, formerly or preſently controuerted in
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17745:71"/>
Chriſtian religion, will no doubt, by their ſeuerall &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary reſolutions, confirme the ſame. And thus much of the rule of faith as a neceſſary meanes of expounding ſcripture.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond meanes of expounding the holy ſcriprure,<note place="margin">2. The pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the Church a meanes to interprete ſcripture.</note> is the generall practiſe or obſeruation, the publike Cuſtome or tradition of the whole Church, in the exerciſe of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſeruice or worſhip, or in the practiſe of any ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, ſacrament, or ceremony, in which as the Church it ſelfe cannot erre, ſo it may be a guide in expounding the ſcripture to keep others from errour, that where the doctrine of the Church is not euident, there the practiſe and obſeruation of the ſame may ſerue. This practiſe we will proue by the practiſe of the chiefe Doctours in Gods Church, for by this did the ancient Fathers expound many places and conuince many Heretikes.

It is vncertaine whether that ſenſe it ſuggeſts be the certaine meaning of the holy Ghoſt, or the inuention of ones owne braine. It is vncertaine whether thoſe interpreters of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which follow it, and others who follow them, as <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uin, Luther, Oſiander, Beza,</hi> or others, do expound the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, or of their owne.

                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:17745:79"/>Sixtly, Becauſe all the partes and properties of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Iudge are wanting in this ſpirit, as ſhall appeare in the next Chapter. And thus much againſt the priuat ſpirits authority of expounding ſcriptures, by reaſons drawne from the obſcurity, fecundity, and profundity of ſcripture, and from the falſity, fallibility, and vncertainty of this ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Inferences.</note>Out of which it doth follow, firſt; that ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants build their ſaluation only vpon faith, and their faith only vpon the ſcripture, and the ſcripture and the ſenſe of it only vpon the ſpirit,<note place="margin">That the Proteſtant faith is doubtfull.</note> which is ſo vncertaine, fallible, and doubtfull, therefore their whole faith, and ſtate of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very vncertaine, fallible, and doubtfull, as builded vpon a ground ſo vncertaine, fallible, and doubtfull. 2. It followes,<note place="margin">That they rely not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> that they who in ſhew rely ſo much vpon ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who extoll it ſo much, read it ſo diligently, &amp; ſeeme to be ſo cunning in it, and to build ſo much on it; do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rely, &amp; build vpon the ſcripture, but vpon their owne ſpirit or conceit, by which they ſet vpon the ſcripture what ſenſe they pleaſe, and draw the ſenſe to what doctrine they pleaſe, and make the doctrine to ſerue to what times and turns,<note place="margin">That Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes do more ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely depend on ſcripture then Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</note> to what ends and vſes they pleaſe. 3. It followes, that the Catholikes, whom the Proteſtantes ſo much accuſe of neglect of ſcripture, do more ſolidly &amp; ſafely rely on it then the Proteſtants do, and do with more ſecurity and certainty ground their faith vpon it then they do: for the Catholikes receiue the ſcripture as the word of God, as much as they, &amp; more parts of it then they; they reuerence it as much as they, and haue kept it from corruption longer then they. They ground their faith and beliefe vpon it as ſtrongly as they, &amp; did the ſame before it was knowne to them, yea deliuered it to them, and to many mo beſides them. For the true ſenſe and right vnderſtanding of it, they do not rely vpon euery mans priuate ſpirit or conceit as they do, but vpon the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of the Church, infallibly aſſiſted by the holy ghoſt; vpon the teſtimony of the catholike and apoſtolicke rule of faith; vpon the conformity of the auncient practiſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Church; vpon the generall conſent of the holy and learned Fathers and doctors of auncient time; vpon
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:17745:79"/>
the infallible decrees of general and oecumenicall Councels; all of impartiall and authenticall authority, which they do not. And by this, Catholiques are more ſecure of the true ſenſe of ſcripture, then they; haue their faith better groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the ſcripture, then they; and haue their ſpirit bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warranted by God, more ſecured that it is from God, and ſurer combined with the ſpirit of the auncient Catholicke and Apoſtolicke Church, with the ſpirit of the holy and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arned Doctours and Saintes of God, with the ſpirit of the generall and receiued Councels of Gods Church; none of which they haue. And by this we haue our beliefe groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon a certaine, infallible, &amp; authenticall ſenſe of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which they haue not.

In which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17745:80"/>
we may note, for this iudiciary power and authority. 1. What it is, and what properties, and conditions it requires. 2. In whome it is, and who are to exerciſe this authority. 3. How it is to be ordered, and what rules are to be followed in the exerciſe of it: which being diſtinctly and fully conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the inability, and inſufficiency of this ſpirit, to make a Iudge of faith, will more clearly appeare.</p>
               <p>Firſt therfore, we may note, that as in a temporall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth (where contentions ariſe,<note place="margin">A iudge of fayth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</note> offences are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and tittles are queſtionable) that beſides the lawes eſtabliſhed, there are neceſſary alſo Iudges to determine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to decide titles, and to puniſh offences: ſo alſo in the ſpirituall Common-wealth of the Church, where contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies are of a higher nature, queſtions no fewer in number, and the offences more grieuous in quality, ſome perſonall Iudge, or iudges are no leſſe, yea more neceſſary to diſcerne verity in all doubts, to eſtabliſh vnity in all contentions, and to puniſh obſtinacy in perſons who offend. Some Iudge therfore is neceſſary, as well in ſpirituall cauſes, as in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall; as well for matters of doctrine, as of iuſtice; and as well in pointes of faith, as of manners. This Iudge, becauſe all faithfull belieuers are obliged to belieue,<note place="margin">How farre the iudge of fayth is to be obeyed.</note> and obey his ſentence as true and iuſt, though not in conſequences, &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendixes of faith, yet in materiall and ſubſtantiall foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of faith; though not in ſchoole queſtions, &amp; pulpit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceites which infringe not the ſolidity of faith, yet in maine articles and principall myſteries of faith, vpon which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a complet edifice of true religion; though not in proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and allegations for the proofe of pointes of faith, yet in the determinations, and concluſions of the points, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles themſelues; though not in caſe, when is intended only to confirme the weake, to ſatisfy the curious, or to confound the proud, yet in caſe when is intended to condemne any doctrine as hereſy vnder anathema, and to declare and define expreſly, for the common and publicke good of the whole Church, any verity of doctrine, formerly by the practiſe of the Church receaued, or by the aſſent of the faithfull at the leaſt, virtually belieued. Becauſe, I ſay, all faithfull are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:17745:81"/>
obliged to belieue and obey this Iudge, and his ſentence <hi>in pointes, and articles ſubstantiall, defined, and concluded by ſentence definitiue against hereſy, for the good of the whole Church</hi>; therfore it is neceſſary that this Iudge (vpon whome depends the verity of beliefe, and the ſaluation, or damnation of ſo many who by a true, or falſe faith are ſaued, or damned) haue theſe properties or conditions in him, &amp; in his authority. 1. That he be viſible, and manifeſt in perſon, ſo that he may know, and be knowne, heare and be heard, ſpeake and be ſpoken vnto, and therby haue a publicke Court, giue publick audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, examine publicke cauſes, &amp; pronounce publicke ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence betweene parties who contend, and in contentions which are debated. 2. That he haue power, and authority, warrant, and commiſſion, to giue Iudgment, pronounce ſentence, and to compell parties to obedience, and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. 3. That he haue warrant of infallibility in this his ſentence, that he cannot erre, or determine errour, deceaue, or be deceaued in this his verdit, corrupt, or be corrupted by partiality in his iudgment. All which, are as it were eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary for this iudge; for if he be not publicke &amp; knowne in perſon, others cannot haue acceſſe to him, nor he vnderſtand the cauſes of others; if he be not certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible in his ſentence, he cannot determine matters of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, nor can others be ſecured by him; if he want autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and power to oblige, and compell, he cannot end the controuerſy, and eſtabliſh peace, and vnity in the Church, which is the end of his iudgment.</p>
               <p>Further, becauſe this Iudge is to haue this infallible au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a rule to iudge by.</note> and that all are obliged to rely vpon him, and his iudgment, that he may the more ſecurly proceed in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dgment, and others more confidently rely vpon it; therfore he muſt haue ſome Rule likwiſe infallible, and certaine, by which he may be directed in his iudgment; and ſome ſolid foundation, vpon which he may build his definitiue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. This rule, or foundation, becauſe it is to be a rule &amp; ground of iudgment, and that for perſons in number ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit, and for cauſes in ſubſtance ſo important, therfore it can require no leſſe then theſe and ſuch like properties, for the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17745:81"/>
ſolidity of it, and the ſecurity of iudgment by it. In reſpect of it ſelfe. 1. That it be ſo certaine &amp; infallible that it can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deceaue, or be deceaued. 2. That it be ſo continued, and not interrupted, that it cannot decay, or periſh. 3. That it be ſo firme, and immutable, that it cannot be changed, or corrupted. In reſpect of the perſons whom it is to direct. 4. That it be ſo knowne and viſible, that it may be diſcerned by all ſortes who haue need of it. 5. So markable, &amp; notable that it may be a ſigne diſtinctiue, to diſtinguiſh true, from falſe beleeuers. 6. So neceſſary and important that without it, no certainty can be had. 7. So vniuerſal &amp; general, that it may ſatisfy all ſortes of people, Iewes, or Infidels, Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, or Catholikes, yong, or old, vnlearned, or learned. In reſpect of the matter or myſteries which are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. 8. That it be ſo fundamentall, that it be contained among the chief articles of the Creed, or plainly expreſſed in ſcripture. 9. So ſufficient, that it be able to explicate &amp; determine all articles and doubtes in religion. 10. So com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet, that it containe virtually, &amp; be able to reſolue plainly all queſtions, and concluſions of Faith which may at any time vpon any occaſion ariſe. All which are neceſſary for ſuch a rule, and foundation, vpon which ſo important a matter, as faith and religion, is grounded. And this is the firſt thing to be obſerued for the properties, and conditions both of the Iudge, and his rule of faith.</p>

All which may appeare by an example in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, where while the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in iudging in matters of faith was in the Prelats, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion continued 900. yeares the ſame, from <hi>Ethelbert</hi> till <hi>Henry</hi> the eight; but after that power of iudging was aſſumed to the ſcepter by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. the ſupremacy by one &amp; the ſame King, was in three yeares thrice changed, from the Pope to the Clergy, from the Clergy to the Archbiſhop, from the Archbiſhop to the King, and afterwards as many religions were a new broght in as Kings were a new crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to wit, one by King <hi>Henry,</hi> another by King <hi>Edward,</hi> a third by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> a fourth by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; &amp; a fifth of Puritans would haue been vnder the ſame Queen, if po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer had not preuented it; and what may be, yet lies in the power of the King and Parlament.

Becauſe the ſcripture is mute, dumbe, &amp; vnable to ſpeake, heare or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce ſentence, and is apt, not only to be loſt, alteted, and corrupted, as <hi>de facto</hi> it hath beene; but alſo to be drawne, wreſted, and interpreted to contrary ſenſes and opinions, by any ſort of interpreters, in any cauſe, and queſtion; as the lamentable practiſe of ſo many hundred of hereſies, &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in all ages doth witneſſe. 4.

               <p>Laſtly, the ſame is proued by the analogy of a temporal Iudge in cauſes ciuill, with an Eccleſiaſticall Iudge in cauſes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17745:88"/>
ſpirituall; for as Controuerſies aryſe in ciuill cauſes, &amp; the common-wealth: ſo do they ariſe alſo in matters ſpirituall, and the Church. As therfore there are cuſtomes, lawes, &amp; Iudges to decide cauſes ciuill: ſo there is Tradition, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and a Iudge to decide cauſes ſpirituall: and as cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and lawes are a rule, not a Iudge, to decide the one; ſo alſo are tradition, &amp; Scripture, a rule, not a Iudge to decide the other. As well therefore is requiſite, beſides Scripture, ſome other liuing and ſpeaking Iudge in matters of fayth &amp; religion, to iudge and end the Controuerſies among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as is neceſſary, beſids Law, ſome other perſonal iudge in affaires of the Common-wealth, to debate and decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions among Neighbours. The neceſſity of both which chiefly appeares, when either the parties are contentious and not willing to yield, or that the law is obſcure, and wantes explication, or ſeemes contradictory, and requires reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, or is penned in tearms generall, and ſtands need of ſome reſtriction in cauſes particuler. All which ſith they fall out as well in Scripture, as in common, or ciuill lawes, ſome iudge or iudges are as well neceſſary to expound Scripture, as they are to interprete Lawes, and thereby to end Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies. And thus is ſufficiently proued, that neither Scripture, and the word of God, nor Princes, and Kinges, Gouernours of the Common-wealth, nor the Lay &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people among the Faythfull, nor yet the whole body and congregation of the Church of God, can be a fit iudge to pronounce ſentence, and determine matters of fayth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

By which is declared how farre the Prieſts iudiciary power before Chriſt did extend it ſelfe, how long it did endure, in what manner by degrees it did ceaſe and end; &amp; out of all is conuinced, that neither Prince, people, or priuate perſon, but the Prieſt in that tyme had power to decide, and iudge all Controuerſies of the law, &amp; of fayth.</p>

               <p>IT remaynes to proue, that this infallible and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authority to iudge of controuerſies of Fayth, neither doth,<note place="margin">That the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uate ſpirit cannot be a Iudge of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of faith.</note> nor can reſide in euery particuler faythfull perſon, nor that the priuate ſpirit of euery one (which is heer intended) can be a competent Iudge of all controuerſies of Religion.

               <p>The third proofe, is drawne from the eſſentiall partes of an authenticall, and infallible Iudge, becauſe in this ſpirit are to be found neither ability to know perſons, nor authority to iudge cauſes, nor infallibility to pronounce a certaine ſentence, and iudgment. Firſt therefore, this ſpirit cannot know, and examine the ſtate and diſpoſition,<note place="margin">The priuate ſpirit wants ability to know &amp; be knowne.</note> the cauſe, and queſtion of the perſon who is to be iudged, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the perſon who is to be iudged, know that this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit remaynes in him, who is to iudge, or that authority by it is giuen to iudge.

               <p>Thirdly, this priuate ſpirit cannot giue any certainty,<note place="margin">3.

It cannot aſſure &amp; ſecure any, that his iudgment, for example, of predeſtination, iuſtification, certainty of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of only fayth, is not a preſumption, and illuſion, and rather hereticall, then Catholike doctrine. It cannot aſſure and ſecure others either that the ſpirit is true, or that the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement of it, is vpright, or that the doctrine of it is true; all ſectes, and hereſies, whether Caluiniſt or Lutheran, rigid or milder, whether Proteſtant or Puritan, whether Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt or Familiſt, whether Anabaptiſt or Arian, whether Swenkfeldian or Libertine, challeng it for the certainty of their doctrine as true, are taught, and directed by it as true; and yet ſome, or all of them muſt needes be falſe, as being contrary euery one to another, euery one condemning ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and all condemned by the authority of Gods Church, and by the ſpirit of God, inſtructing and aſſiſting it. By all which it is apparent that the priuate ſpirit wanting viſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be knowne, authority to iudge, and infallibility to ſecure, cannot be an authenticall iudge of controuerſies of Fayth.</p>

               <p>But that no ſuch certainty can be in this priuate ſpirit, I proue (beſides that which is in the former Chapter ſhewed) by theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe no certaine and infallible rule, or ground can be giuen, certainly and infallibly to know that this ſpirit, in any man, is a ſpirit of truth, not of errour; of light, not of darknes; of God, not of Sathan, or not humane; therfore there is no reaſon why any ſhould build vpon it as certaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe that they who admit a certainty of it, admit it only in the perſons who haue it,<note place="margin">The priuate ſpirit moſt vncertaine.</note> not in others who follow them who haue it; wherupon all who follow
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17745:101"/>
the ſpirit, and doctrine of any other whoſoeuer (as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, both people, and preachers do) follow that which to them is fallible and vncertaine, and ſo build vpon a ground fallible and vncertaine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe experience conuinces that this ſpirit hath deceaued, &amp; doth daily deceaue many; for whatſoeuer either ſenſe of Scripture, or doctrine of faith, or certainty of ſaluation the ſpirit of one man doth certainly aſſure him as true, the ſpirit of another man doth as certainly aſſure him that the ſame is falſe: as for example, the ſpirit of <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius, Oecolampadius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Caluin,</hi> and other <hi>Sacramentaries</hi> aſſures them, that the ſenſe of <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> is figuratiue, that the body of Chriſt is not really, and corporally preſent in the Sacrament, and that they in this faith are infallibly ſure of their ſaluation: but the ſpirit of <hi>Luther</hi> aſſures him, that the ſenſe of the words is literall, that Chriſts ſubſtance is really and corporally preſent with the ſubſtance of bread, and that the Sacramentaries are heretiks, and damned who hould the contrary. The like doth the ſpirit of the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, Libertines,</hi> and others aſſure them of other ſuch places againſt both <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Caluiniſts.</hi> And the ſpirit of the <hi>Arians</hi> aſſures them of the like, againſt all the former. And all this is wrought by this ſpirit, all conceauing a certainty in it, &amp; yet all oppoſit and condemning one another by it. What certainty therfore can there be in any of theſe ſpirits, what infallibility more in <hi>Luther</hi> then in <hi>Caluin,</hi> what in <hi>Caluin</hi> more then in <hi>Rotman,</hi> what in <hi>Rotman</hi> more then in <hi>Seruetus,</hi> or what in any one of them more then in any other Sectary? What can any one claime, or challenge for the certainty of his ſpirit, which the other cannot as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly claime, and challenge for the certainty of his? Euery one of theſe aſſure themſelues that their ſpirit is of God. Euery one of them, &amp; all are certaine of their ſenſe of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of their faith, and of their ſaluation by it, &amp; yet euery one defends a contrary faith, inuents a contrary ſenſe of ſcripture, condemns the contrary part of hereſy, &amp; is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine by his ſpirit of the others damnation; as the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue themſelues certaine of their owne ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

For as euery one receaues a new part, or portion of this new ſpirit, he chooſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a new opinion of doctrine, labours to erect and ſet vp a new Conuenticle of new belieuers, and makes himſelfe the head or follower of a new ſect, or hereſy; and ſo all ſect-maiſters or Heretikes, who in all ages from Chriſt downewardes, haue ſeparated themſelues from his Church and erected a new fayth and Synagogue, haue had their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen and beginning from this ſpirit, haue made their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe and proceeding by this ſpirit, and haue ended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and their dolefull and deſperate preſumption in the obſtinacy of this ſpirit. In all which the ſcope and marke they aymed at, was thereby to free themſelues from all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſubiection, thereby to arrogate to themſelues all authority, and dominion; thereby to exerciſe what liberty they beſt affected, and to belieue and teach what doctrine they moſt fancied, and beſt fitted their conceit &amp; humour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe this ſpirit is inuiſible, inſenſible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible, and vnable to be knowne, or vnderſtood (as they graunt) by others, or any, ſaue only they who imagine they are poſſeſſed with it. And as it is inuiſible and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, ſo it is compoſed of an inuiſible and vnknowne company, meeting in inuiſible and vnknowne congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, miniſtring inuiſible and vnknowne Sacraments, making an inuiſible and vnknowne Church, conſiſting of inuiſible and vnknowne both Paſtors who preached, and people who heard the doctrine of it for many ages togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which they can aſſigne neither tyme when, nor place where, nor people who were taught by them; can produce no acts, or monuments, no recordes, or regiſters either of people who belieued, &amp; profeſſed this their faith, or of Princes who did honour and defend it, or of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours who did oppoſe and perſecute it, or of any men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or children who were baptized, and liued, or dyed in

They can nominate no Citty, or Country, no Prieſt, or Prelate, no Prince or Potentate, no Confeſſour or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, who belieued, profeſſed, honoured, and defended in paper, or pulpit, by word, or ſword, the fayth of this ſpirit: and why? Becauſe the directour is a ſpirit inuiſible, which compaſſeth a Church of perſons inſenſible, who preach a doctrine incredible, and performe actions not memorable. All which is nothing els, but an inuinſible argument of an impoſſible fiction, inuented in the idle braines of braine-ſicke ſpirits to diſguiſe the nouelty of a new, &amp; new deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Religion.

For firſt, it alone without any diſpoſition of hearing, without any propoſition, or preaching of Church Paſtours, without any authority of apoſtolicall miſſion, and ordination, teaches and directs, in particuler, euery one, man, woman, or child, which is true Scripture, which is true ſenſe of it, and which is true doctrine collected out of it, therfore euery one thus made faithfull by this ſpirit, ſtands need neither of diſpoſition to heare what is to be belieued, nor of preaching to belieue what they heare, nor of miſſion, and ordination to ſecure them of what is preached; becauſe this ſpirit ſupplies the effect of all both ordination, propoſition, and diſpoſition of hearing, therfore all order and diſcipline, all ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſubiection, all ſacraments, or preaching, are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, yea fruitleſſe in Gods Church. As this ſpirit ſecures alone; ſo without Sacraments it ſanctifies alone.

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:17745:107"/>
it be true, or becauſe it is true. As (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle) Si A eſt, B eſt; ſi B est, A est; ergo, ſi A est, A est.</hi> In which as <hi>A</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be <hi>A,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>A</hi>; ſo the concluſion is proued to be true, becauſe it is true. Whereupon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> concludes, that euery <hi>Circular</hi> proofe and demonſtration which is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus ab eodem ad omnino idem,</hi> that is, when we returne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one thing to the ſame thing againe, and from one proofe to the ſame proofe againe, is vitious and vnlawfull in <hi>Logicke.</hi> And thus much of the nature of a Circle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the difference betweene a proper Circle,<note place="margin">Difference betweene a Circle law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</note> which is bad, and an improper which is good and lawfull, we may note alſo, that euery kind of <hi>Circular</hi> and <hi>reciprocall</hi> proofe is not vnlawfull; for ſome is reciprocall betweene the cauſe and the effect, as betweene <hi>rationale</hi> and <hi>riſibile,</hi> betweene the Sunne &amp; the Day. And thus may be proued the effect by the cauſe <hi>à priori,</hi> as <hi>Eſt riſibile quia eſt rationale: eſt dies quia Sol lucet</hi>; or on the contrary, the cauſe by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> as <hi>Eſt rationale quia eſt riſibile</hi>: or <hi>Sol lucet quia eſt dies.</hi> Other proofes are reciprocall betweene two cauſes of diuers kindes, as betweene the efficient cauſe and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, in which ſenſe we proue Phiſicke to be good becauſe, as the efficient cauſe, it cauſeth and worketh health; and health to be good, becauſe as the finall cauſe, or end it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to take Phiſicke. Or betweene the efficient and mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall cauſe, as when we proue the entrance of the wind to be the cauſe, that is efficient of opening the window, and the opening of the window to be the cauſe that is materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the entrance of the wind. Or when we proue the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of raine by the aboundance of vapours, as by the materiall cauſe; and the aboundance of vapours, by the aboundance of raine, as by the effect. All which kind of <hi>reciprocall</hi> or <hi>Circular</hi> proofe, of the cauſe by the effect, and the effect by the cauſe, or of one cauſe by another, is good and allowed in Logicke, as being improperly a Circle. Only that which is diſallowed, and by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> &amp; all condemned, is that proper manner of <hi>Circle,</hi> which is, 1. when in the ſame kind of cauſe one thing is proued by another, and this againe by the former, which is either
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17745:108"/>
                  <hi>idem per idem,</hi> or <hi>ignotum per ignotius.</hi> 2. When this reciprocall proofe is made by one and the ſame cauſe, in one and the ſame manner of proofe. 3. When to one, and the ſelfe ſame perſon this one thing is thus proued by another, and this againe by the former, the one mutually prouing the other: as when the premiſes demonſtrate the concluſion, and the concluſion againe the premiſes, both being otherwiſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. As when the maiſter proues the ſeruant to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and the ſeruant the maiſter, both being before ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected as guilty. In which the ſame thing is <hi>notius</hi> &amp; <hi>ignotius, prius &amp; posterius,</hi> that is, more knowne and leſſe knowne, firſt knowne and after knowne, both in one and the ſame reſpect, and in reſpect of one and the ſame perſon, and ſo a thing vnknowne is proued by another more vnknowne, which is that vnlawfull <hi>Circle</hi> or <hi>Circular</hi> manner of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration diſallowed and condemned by <hi>Aristotle.</hi> By which is manifeſt what a <hi>Circular</hi> proofe is, and of <hi>Circular</hi> manners of proofes, which is improper &amp; lawfull, and which proper and vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Both Catholicks and Proteſtantes, do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually accuſe one another of this vicious and <hi>Circular</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and manner of proofe. The Proteſtants accuſe the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks becauſe they proue the authority of the ſcripture by the authority of the Church, and the authority of the Church by the authority of ſcripture. For aske a Catholicke how he knowes the Scripture to be infallible and true, he will anſwer, becauſe the Church tels him it is ſo: aske him how he proues the Church to be infallible and true, he wil anſwer becauſe the ſcripture ſayes it is ſo; and ſo he proues the Scripture by the Church, and the Church by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The Catholicks accuſe the Proteſtants becauſe they proue the ſcripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: for aske a Proteſtant how he knowes the ſcripture to be true, and the true ſenſe of it, he anſwers becauſe the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſo tels and aſſures him: aske him how he knowes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that it is of God, and ſpeakes truth, he anſwers becauſe the ſcripture tels and aſſures him ſo; and ſo he knowes the Scripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit by the Scripture.</p>

               <p>For which we may note, that the Catholikes require to Fayth (for ſo much as is for our purpoſe) two thinges.<note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to Fayth.</note> Firſt, a preparation, to prepare vs to accept the thinges belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as credible, and in prudence worthy to be belieued, which is wrought by credible teſtimonyes, ſuch as are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, conſent, ſanctity, antiquity, and the reſt before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, by which our vnderſtanding is euidently conuinced to iudge and accept of the Chriſtian Religion, as more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or credit then any other. Secondly, they require a firme aſſent or beliefe to the articles of fayth, propoſed as true, and of infallible verity, which is wrought by the habit of fayth, and dependes vpon the diuine reuelation of God, declaring in Scripture, or Tradition, and propoſing by holy Church, what, and why we are to belieue: vpon which reuelation thus propoſed, we ſettle our laſt reſolution of fayth, and the certainty of it, as vpon the former credible motiues, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fayth we ſetled our preparation, or acceptation of fayth, and the credibility of it. Now, if we compare or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply theſe togeather, it will euidently appeare, that in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is committed any Circle, becauſe the former, that is, the acceptation depends vpon credible motiues which are as the <hi>Samaritan</hi> womans word, making it ſeeme probable that Chriſt was the Meſſias; and the later, that is the aſſent to Fayth, dependes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the actuall aſſent and beliefe it ſelfe, whereby we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly belieue the myſteries reuealed, though we belieue the verity of Scripture reuelations by the authority of Church propoſition, and Church propoſition for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture reuelation, whereby Scripture reuelation doth giue vs teſtimony of Church propoſition, and againe Church propoſition of Scripture reuelation; Yet that this reciprocall teſtimony and proofe, is not any proper and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Circle, is proued. Firſt, becauſe it is <hi>in diuerſo genere cauſa,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The mutual proofe of the ſcripture &amp; Church.</note> in diuers kinds of cauſes (which before out of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is admitted for good and lawfull:) for the teſtimonyes of Scripture reuelation to the infallibility of Church propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is <hi>cauſall</hi> as a cauſe,<note place="margin">1. In a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe kind of cauſe.</note> and that formall, why we belieue and aſſent to Church propoſition. But Church propoſition is only <hi>conditionall,</hi> as <hi>conditio ſine quae non,</hi> to know Scripture reuelation; and ſo they are reciprocall in a different manner of proofe, the one, that is Scripture, <hi>à priori,</hi> as including di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine reuelation; the other, that is Church, <hi>à posteriori,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired only as a condition. The former, as a formall prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cauſe; the latter, as a ſubſequent annexed condition. Both of them not much vnlike to our Sauiours teſtimony of <hi>S. Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and to <hi>S. Iohns</hi> teſtimony of our Sauiour: the one as of God and infallible, the other as of an holy man, &amp; credible: or to the teſtimony of our B. Sauiour, &amp; the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to the <hi>Samaritans</hi>: the one as giuing certainty, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as propoſing credibility of his being the <hi>Meſsias</hi>: Or to the former example of <hi>rationale</hi> and <hi>riſibile,</hi> of the Sun-ſhine and the Day, of the Vapours and Raine, of the opening the Window and the entring of the Wind. All which recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally proue one another, as the cauſe and the effect, or as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall cauſes. And all which doe much reſemble the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Scripture to the Church, and of the Church to the Scripture, which is likewiſe in a ſeuerall kind of cauſality,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17745:109"/>
and a different manner of probation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe this reciprocall proofe is not <hi>ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino idem,</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires to a proper Circle, that is,<note place="margin">2. Is partial and not wholy, and ſolely of the ſame.</note> the one is not the totall and ſole cauſe of knowing the other. For Church propoſition is not knowne only by Scripture reuelation, and no other way; but alſo by other proofes, ſignes, and credible teſtimonies, conuincing that Church authority is neceſſary and infallible to diſtinguiſh true ſenſe of Scripture from falſe, and to end Controuerſies about Scripture. And therefore as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> admits, that though the premiſes haue proued the concluſion, yet the concluſion may againe proue the premiſes, &amp; that <hi>in eodem genere cauſae,</hi> ſo that the concluſion be proued by another <hi>medium</hi> then by the premiſes. So, though the Scripture reuelation proue Church propoſition, yet Church propoſition may againe reciprocally proue Scripture reuelation, ſo it be knowne by another meanes (as we ſee it is) then only by Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation; for this, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> is only an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Circle, and not a bad, and vnlawfull Circle.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe this reciprocall proofe is not to one &amp; the ſame perſon who is ignorant or doubtful of both: but to diuers perſons, and ſuch as ſuppoſe the one. For to a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like who admits, as belieued, Church propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we proue by it Scripture-ſenſe, or reuelation, and ſo an vnknowne thing to him, by another thing ſuppoſed and knowne to him: but to a Proteſtant who admits, as by him belieued, Scripture reuelation, we proue by it Church propoſition, &amp; ſo to him a thing vnknowne by another more knowne. But to a Pagan who admits neither Scripture reuelation, nor Church propoſition, we proue neither of them one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but both the one and the other by other probable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues and credible teſtimonies, more agreeable to his natural capacity, and by them perſuade him, firſt to accept as credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Church propoſition, and by it Scripture reuelation: by which Scripture and Church, or ſcripture expounded by Church, we perſuade him to aſſent, and belieue the articles reuealed. In all which we proue <hi>ignotum per notius,</hi> the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne by the more knowne to him, and ſo preparing him
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:17745:110"/>
to giue credit to one, do by that induce him to belieue the other. By which meanes, we ſtill proceed from a thing knowne, to an vnknowne to that perſon, and ſo auoyd the Circle, and begging of the queſtion, into which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants runne, and there ſticke faſt. In which, note the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them and vs, for they proue reciprocally and circularly the Scripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by ſcripture in the ſame kind of proofe, to wit formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as ſhalbe ſhewed: We proue ſcripture by Church, and Church by ſcripture, in diuers kindes of cauſe, to wit, the one <hi>cauſall,</hi> and the other <hi>conditionall,</hi> as is ſhewed. 2. They proue the one by the other, no otherwiſe knowne then by the other, as the ſcripture by the ſpirit, which ſpirit is only, and by no other meanes, knowne then by ſcripture, and <hi>é contra,</hi> as ſhalbe ſhewed: But we haue more means to know the Church then by ſcripture, as is ſhewed. 3. They proue one by the other to the ſame perſon, to wit the Proteſtant, doubtfull of both: we to diuers perſons who ſuppoſe &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the one, &amp; ſo (<hi>ad hominem</hi>) by that we proue the other. Al which as it is true as preſently ſhalbe ſhewed, ſo it ſhewes an apparent difference between the Proteſtant circular ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proofe of ſcripture by ſpirit, and of ſpirit by ſcripture; and of our Catholike improper Circle, and lawfull manner of proofe of ſcripture by Church, and of Church by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And thus much to cleare the imputation layd vpon Catholikes for their circular manner of proceeding in their proofe of ſcripture by the Church, and of Church by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17745:110"/>
for which we may note, how the Proteſtants for their doctrine of fayth, iuſtification, and ſaluation,<note place="margin">The Prota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts diuers Circles.</note> do make this gradation &amp; concatenation of one point with another.

To theſe elect, and only to them, God giues true fayth, and certaine aſſurance of their ſaluation. 3. To theſe fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; only to them, he giues the infallible aſſiſtance of this his priuate ſpirit. 4. To this ſpirit, and only to it, he giues the true and certaine vnderſtanding of the holy Scipture, &amp; the ſenſe of it. So that 1. Election, 2. Fayth, 3. The ſpirit, 4. Vnderſtanding of Scripture, is as a chaine of many lincks, whereof all are ſo connected, euery one with another, as he that hath one, hath all; and he that wantes one, wantes all. For (ſay they) the vnderſtanding of ſcripture is giuen only to them, and to all them who haue the ſpirit; the ſpirit is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen only to them, and to all them, who haue fayth; Fayth is giuen only to them, and to all them, who are elect; and ſo all, and only the elect, are faithfull; all, and only the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, haue the ſpirit; all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and only they that haue the ſpirit, vnderſtand Scripture. And ſo <hi>à primo ad vltimum,</hi> all, &amp; o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly the elect, muſt haue true fayth, ſpirit, and vnderſtanding of Scripture. In which, election is the mother and foundation; the vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of Scripture, the fruit &amp; top of al their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. This is the connexion of their doctrine concerning their faith and ſaluation. Now as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the knowledge &amp; infallible aſſurance of all theſe, which (according to their groundes) euery one of them muſt haue of himſelfe, to wit, that he is elect, faithfull, and hath the true ſpirit of God, &amp; the right vnderſtanding of ſcripture: As concerning (I ſay) the aſſurance of all theſe, and the meanes of this aſſurance, whereupon depends their ſaluation; if any ſhall demand of them, whereupon they ground this their certainty, and aſſurance of all theſe, that is, their election, fayth, ſpirit, &amp; ſcripture-ſenſe (which are inſeparable, and infallibly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them, enſuing one vpon another) it will appeare by their anſwere, that they haue no groundes at all; but that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17745:111"/>
they runne in a round, and Circle, rowling and wheeling from one ground or principle to another, and from that to the former backe againe, without any firme or ſetled grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and reſolution whereon to ſtay themſelues, and their fayth; whereupon they skip forward and backward, from one to another, that is, from the ſcripture to the ſpirit, and from the ſpirit to the ſcripture againe; from the ſpirit to fayth, &amp; from faith to the ſpirit againe; from faith to election, and from election to fayth againe; and ſo from election to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture againe, and from ſcripture to election backe againe. For aske a Proteſtant, how, and by what meanes he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Scripture? He anſwers; by the ſpirit. And aske him, how, and by what meanes he knowes that he hath the true ſpirit? He anſwers by Scripture. And ſo knowes the ſcripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit by ſcripture. Againe, aske him how, and by what meanes he is aſſured of his faith? He anſwers by his ſpirit, and ſcripture: but how is he ſure of his ſpirit and ſcripture? by his fayth backe againe. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, aske him how, and by what meanes he is aſſured of his election? He anſwers by his fayth, his ſpirit, or the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and yet his election is the ground of his fayth, ſpirit, and vnderſtanding of ſcripture. So that, 1. The ſcripture proues the ſpirit, and the ſpirit the ſcripture. 2. The ſpirit proues his fayth, and his fayth the ſpirit. 3. His faith proues his election, and his election is the ground of his fayth, &amp; with it, of his ſpirit, and knowledge of ſcripture alſo. So that as many linckes as are in their chaine, ſo many Circles and circular proofes are made by them, and all in vaine, and to no purpoſe at all, as ſhall be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>And firſt of their firſt circular proofe, betweene the ſcripture and the ſpirit, it ſhalbe plainely proued, that they fall directly and headlong into <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> proper,<note place="margin">The firſt Proteſtant Circle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſcripture &amp; ſpirit.</note> and ſo much condemned <hi>Circle,</hi> prouing the ſcripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit by the ſcripture againe, in one and the ſame kind of cauſe, to one and the ſame perſon, and by one ſole and whole manner of proofe. In all which we haue before clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our ſelues, and our doctrine from the obiected Circle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. For which we may obſerue two principles of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:17745:111"/>
Proteſtant doctrine: the one, that the ſcripture only is the rule and meanes to come to the knowledge of the certainty of all thinges to be belieued; wherupon they reiect all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition &amp; vnwritten word of God, and rely only vpon the written word for the ſole and complete rule of fayth. The other, that this written word is to be interpreted, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood only by the ſpirit of the Lord, which, as it is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer and priuate in euery man, ſo euery man muſt be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his priuate ſpirit in the vnderſtanding and interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the ſcripture, and in the collecting out of it what he is to belieue; wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they reiect all authority of Church, Councels, or Fathers, and make only the priuate ſpirit the Rule and Iudge of interpreting ſcripture, as in the firſt part is at large proued.</p>
                  <p>Which being ſuppoſed, it will euidently appeare, how the Proteſtants runne this <hi>Circle,</hi> betweene this priuate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſcripture. For aske a Proteſtant, how he knowes infallibly which is ſcripture, and which is true ſenſe of it? He anſweres, by the internal teſtimony of the priuate ſpirit aſſuring him it is ſo. Aske him, how he infallibly knowes this his internall teſtimony of his ſpirit, is the teſtimony of the holy Ghoſt? He anſwers, by the ſcripture aſſuring him it is ſo; <hi>for my sheep heare my voice.</hi> Aske him againe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioan.</hi> 10.27.</note> how he knowes infallibly this is ſcripture, and this the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this ſcripture? He runnes backe to the teſtimony of his ſpirit. And againe, how he knowes that this his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his ſpirit is the ſpirit of God? He returnes to the ſcripture againe. Thus he wheeles in a round betweene ſcripture and ſpirit, prouing the ſcripture by the ſpirit, and the ſpirit by the ſcripture; an vnknowne ſpirit by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne ſcripture, and an vnknowne ſcripture by an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne ſpirit, one vnknowne, by another as vnknowne. And if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did hould it an abſurd demonſtration &amp; proof to proue the Concluſion by the premiſes, and the premiſes againe by the concluſion in the ſame manner of proofe, which was, as he reaſons, as much as to proue <hi>A</hi> by <hi>B,</hi> and againe <hi>B</hi> by <hi>A.</hi> which is either <hi>idem per ſeipſum,</hi> or <hi>ignotum per aequè ig notum</hi>; And if S. <hi>Augustine</hi> did count it abſurd for the

                     <hi>Manichees</hi> to proue their Fundamental Epiſtle to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, becauſe <hi>Manes</hi> held it to be ſo, and <hi>Manes</hi> to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or Apoſtle, becauſe his Fundame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall Epiſtle did affirme him to be ſo, wherein he himſelfe gaue teſtimony to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and his Epiſtle to him; as the maiſter giues to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and the ſeruant to the maiſter, when both are in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; And if it were abſurd for any to belieue <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and <hi>Selena,</hi> or <hi>Hellena,</hi> or <hi>Montanus</hi> and his <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximilla</hi> Propheteſſes, or <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his <hi>Sergius</hi> the Arian to be true Prophets, becauſe one did affirme and proue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his companion to be a Prophet, both being ſuſpected and vnknowne, and both wanting other kind of proofe, then mutuall and <hi>Circular</hi> affection one of another: Then in like manner, it is as great abſurdity and folly for one to belieue the ſcripture and ſenſe of it, becauſe the priuate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit affirmes it to be the true ſenſe; and againe the priuate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be the true ſpirit of God, becauſe the Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by that priuate ſpirit, affirmes it to be ſo. In which manner of proofe, all the conditions do concurre, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> requires to a proper and vnlawfull <hi>Circle,</hi> or circular demonſtration. For 1. They proue circularly and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally one another, as the ſpirit proues the ſcripture, and the ſcripture againe the ſpirit, in which is <hi>regreſſus ab eodem ad i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</hi> 2. They proue circularly one another <hi>in eodem genere cauſae,</hi> for the ſpirit is the formall cauſe, why they belieue the ſenſe of the ſcripture, and that ſenſe of ſcripture is the formall cauſe, why they belieue that to be the ſpirit of God. 3. They proue one another totally and wholy, that is, the ſole and whole reaſon why they belieue that is the ſenſe of ſcripture, is the ſpirit; and the ſole &amp; whole reaſon why they belieue this is the ſpirit, is that ſenſe of Scripture fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by that ſpirit. 4. They proue one another not only cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, wholy, and in the ſame manner of cauſes, but alſo to one and the ſame perſon. For as this ſpirit can aſſure only him who hath it, not another, that this is true ſenſe of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and this true ſenſe of ſcripture can aſſure only him, not another, that this is the true ſpirit (for according to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine no man can be aſſured of anothers ſpirit, that it is of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17745:112"/>
God, but only himſelfe who hath it;) ſo doth this priuate ſpirit, and this ſcripture both aſſure one perſon, to wit, him that hath it, and that circularly, that this ſpirit is of God, &amp; that this ſcripture is truly vnderſtood by this ſpirit, which is moſt proper to that Circle, condemned by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> for vnlawfull. And thus much of the firſt proofe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſame abſurdities which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> infers v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a circular demonſtration betweene the premiſes and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion do follow vpon this Circle betweene the ſcripture and the ſpirit. For, 1. The ſame thing doth proue it ſelfe. For if by <hi>A,</hi> I proue <hi>B,</hi> and againe by <hi>B,</hi> I proue <hi>A,</hi> then I proue <hi>A</hi> by <hi>A</hi>: or if I proue the concluſion by the premiſes, and the premiſes againe by the concluſion, then I proue the concluſion by it ſelfe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> reaſons. So, if I proue the ſpirit by the ſcripture, and the ſcripture againe by the ſpirit, then I proue the ſpirit by the ſpirit it ſelfe: for the ſpirit which proues that the ſcripture is true, by the ſame ſcripture proues that it ſelfe is the true ſpirit; therefore the ſame is proued by the ſame. 2. The ſame thing is <hi>prius notum &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterius notum</hi> in reſpect of the ſame thing. For as the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is knowne after the premiſes, as it is proued by them, and therefore the premiſes as it proues them; ſo the ſpirit is knowne after the ſcripture as it is proued by ſcripture to be the ſpirit, and knowne alſo before the ſame ſcripture as it proues it to be ſcripture; and ſo it is <hi>poſterius &amp; prius cognitum reſpectu eiuſdem,</hi> firſt knowne and after knowne in reſpect of the ſame. 3. The ſame thing vnknowne is proued by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnknowne. For as, when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> vnknowne to be a Prophet, is proued to be a Prophet by his <hi>Selena</hi> as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne: Or when <hi>Montanus</hi> is ſo proued by his <hi>Maximilla</hi>: Or <hi>Manes</hi> by his Epiſtle, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> by his <hi>Sergius,</hi> the one vnknowne Prophet is proued by another vnknowne: So when this ſcripture and ſenſe of it is knowne by a ſpirit as vnknowne &amp; doubtfull, as is the ſcripture and ſenſe it ſelfe, then one vnknowne is proued by another as vnknowne; which is againſt all manner of lawfull proofe, where one <hi>ignotum</hi> vnknowne, muſt be proued by another <hi>notius</hi> more knowne. Whereupon follow theſe abſurdities. 1. That the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17745:113"/>
ſpirit doth proue it ſelfe. 2. That it doth proue <hi>ignotum por ignotum,</hi> that is, the vnknowne ſenſe of ſcripture by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vnknowne. 3. That this ſpirit is <hi>prius &amp; posterius notum</hi> in reſpect of the ſame ſcripture. By which abſurdities as <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> did diſproue the Philoſophers circular demonſtration of the concluſion by the premiſes, and of the premiſes againe by the concluſion; ſo we diſproue the Proteſtants circular proofe of the ſpirit by the ſcripture, and of the ſcripture by the ſpirit. And as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did reiect the <hi>Manichees</hi> proofe, who by <hi>Manes</hi> did proue their Fundamentall Epiſtle, and by their Epiſtle <hi>Manes</hi>: And as the Fathers reiected the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>anists</hi> proofe, who by <hi>Montanus</hi> proued <hi>Maximilla</hi> to be a Propheteſſe, and by <hi>Maximilla Montanus</hi> to be an Apoſtle: So do we reiect the Proteſtants proofe, who by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will proue their ſpirit to be of God, and by the ſpirit the ſenſe of ſcripture to be true. And as a Iudge ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and vnwiſe who ſhould admit the Maiſter to cleare the ſeruant, and the ſeruant to cleare the maiſter, when both are accuſed as guilty of the ſame crime; ſo ſhould we be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall and vnwiſe, if we ſhould admit their ſpirit to proue their ſenſe of ſcripture, and their true ſenſe of ſcripture to proue their ſpirit, when both are in the ſame Circle, and both vnknowne and doubtfull. By which we ſee that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants walke in a circle, and performe that which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth,<note place="margin">

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17745:113"/>
which they can neuer proue any thing to be true, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth. And thus much of the firſt kind of Circle made by the Proteſtants betweene the ſpirit and the ſcripture: let vs proceed to the ſecond, betweene the ſpirit and fayth.</p>

                  <p>SECONDLY, that they commit another the like Circle betweene their ſpirit and fayth,<note place="margin">The ſecond Circle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſpirit and fayth.</note> is likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, if firſt we conſider and compare two of their pointes of doctrine generally receaued. The one, that they are iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied only by fayth, and that vpon it doth depend their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which they interprete ſcripture; ſo that fayth is the root and origen of the ſpirit, and preſuppoſed to it. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the ſcripture interpreted by the ſpirit of God, or the ſpirit of God interpreting ſcripture is the only &amp; whole meanes to attaine to fayth; and ſo is the ground and meanes of fayth, and therefore preſuppoſed to faith. Which ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: aske a Proteſtant how, and by what meanes he aſſures himſelfe that he hath true and certaine fayth? He anſwers, by his ſpirit interpreting the ſcripture, or by the ſcipture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by his ſpirit, which is all one, for ſo they anſwere: but I reply, that that cannot be, becauſe his fayth, and the knowledge of it, as the mother and origen of his ſpirit which interprets ſcripture, is, according to the former prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, precedent and preſuppoſed before the ſpirit and the knowledge of it, therefore the ſpirit cannot be a ground &amp; meanes of fayth, which is precedent and preſuppoſed as the cauſe of this ſpirit. Againe, aske him how, and by what meanes he aſſures himſelfe that his ſpirit thus interpreting ſcripture is the true ſpirit of God? He anſwers, by his faith: but I reply that cannot be, becauſe the ſcripture interpreted by this ſpirit, or this ſpirit interpreting ſcripture, is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the latter principle, the ſole and whole meanes of fayth; therefore it cannot be knowne by fayth, ſith it is the meanes of fayth, &amp; preſuppoſed to it. Either therefore muſt
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17745:114"/>
their principles be falſe, that <hi>a man is iustifyed by Fayth,</hi> which is the origen of the ſpirit, and that the ſcripture is the ſole meanes of Fayth, or els if they ſtand to this their doctrine, this Circle and abſurdity muſt follow, that fayth is firſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, and knowne before the ſpirit, as the cauſe of it, &amp; the ſpirit is likewiſe firſt preſuppoſed and knowne before faith, as the meanes to it, and ſo fayth is before the ſpirit, and the ſpirit before fayth; and fayth is knowne before the ſpirit, and the ſpirit knowne before fayth. And ſo both fayth and ſpirit are <hi>prius &amp; posterius,</hi> ech of them, both firſt and laſt knowne in reſpect of the other, which is to incurre the former Circle, and alſo the abſurdities by which <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> confutes it.</p>

                  <p>THIRDLY, that a third Circle is committed (to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fourth betweene Election and Fayth, of which the ſame may be inferred as was betweene faith and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) betweene the firſt and laſt lincke of this chaine,<note place="margin">A third Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle between election &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Scripture.</note> that is, betweene <hi>Election,</hi> and the certainty of it, and the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the vnderſtanding of it, ſhal out of two other principles compared appeare. The firſt, that only the elect and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate are endewed with fayth, and all the reprobate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it. Wherupon alſo followes that only the elect haue the true ſpirit of God and right vnderſtanding of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which according to them are the effects and fruit of fayth, and that election is the ground of all fayth, ſpirit and vnderſtanding of ſcripture. The ſecond, that they haue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty by fayth of their election, and that by the word of God, which doth aſſure and ſecure them that they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate; ſo the word of the Lord is the meanes of their knowledge, and certainty of their election. Out of which two poſitions, I reaſon thus: <hi>Election</hi> is the ground of fayth, of the ſpirit, and of the vnderſtanding of ſcripture, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the former principle, becauſe only the Elect haue
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17745:114"/>
fayth, the ſpirit, and true ſenſe of Scripture; therefore it is preſuppoſed as knowne before fayth, the ſpirit, and ſenſe of ſcripture, and is the ground of them all, which once ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the reſt do neceſſarily follow vpon it; and fayling, the reſt muſt alſo faile with it. On the contrary, ſcripture, and the true vnderſtanding of it, is their meanes and only meanes to know the ſpirit, fayth, and election, according to the latter principle, becauſe all their fayth and aſſurance both of fayth and election is grounded vpon ſcripture, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true vnderſtanding of ſcripture muſt be precedent and preſuppoſed as foreknowne before the knowledge and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Election,</hi> which is to be knowne only by ſcripture, as the only meanes to know it. Now, according to theſe principles, aske a Proteſtant, how he knowes his election? He muſt, and doth anſwere, by ſcripture, which is his only meanes to ſecure him of his fayth and election; therefore the true meaning of ſcripture muſt be firſt knowne before either ſpirit, fayth, or election can be knowne and aſſured, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the only meanes to know them, and the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution whereon to ſetle them. On the contrary, aske him how, he comes to know, and be certaine of his true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſcripture? He muſt returne backe againe, &amp; doth anſwere, by the ſpirit, which aſſures him which is ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and true ſenſe of it. Aske further, how he is certaine of his hauing the true ſpirit? He anſwers by fayth, by which he belieues, that he hath the true ſpirit. Aske yet laſtly, how he knowes, and is certaine of his fayth? He anſwers, becauſe he is elect and choſen, and therefore muſt needes haue faith: Heere then is <hi>Election,</hi> which was before the thing in queſtion, now made the laſt ground of reſolution, vpon which all the reſt, as fayth, ſpirit, and ſcripture, are to be grounded, &amp; by which they are reſolued &amp; knowne, as before ſcripture was made the firſt meanes, and laſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution vpon which ſpirit, faith, and election are grounded, and by which they are knowne. Hence then appeares the <hi>Circle</hi> betweene election and ſcripture; whether ſhalbe firſt knowne, and be as the meanes to know the other. Shall <hi>Election?</hi> That cannot be, becauſe it muſt be knowne by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17745:115"/>
fayth; fayth by the ſpirit; and the ſpirit by ſcripture; then ſcripture ſhould be firſt knowne. Shall ſcripture be firſt knowne? That it cannot be, becauſe the vnderſtanding of ſcripture depends vpon the ſpirit, the ſpirit vpon fayth, and fayth vpon election; therfore election muſt be firſt known. Scripture therefore muſt be firſt knowne, as the meanes to know the ſpirit, fayth, and election; and election muſt be firſt knowne as the ground of all fayth, ſpirit, and ſcripture. Scripture therefore muſt proue election, as the meanes to know it; and election muſt proue ſcripture, as the ground of the true vnderſtanding of it: as the premiſſes muſt proue the concluſion, and the concluſion the premiſſes; as <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi> did proue <hi>Montanus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Montanus Maximilla</hi> to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; as <hi>Manes</hi> did proue his fundamentall Epiſtle to be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall, and the Epiſtle him to be an Apoſtle. Scripture therefore muſt be firſt knowne before election, and election muſt be firſt knowne before ſcripture, both firſt knowne, and both meanes to know firſt ech other. If both be firſt, which ſhal be laſt? If both go before, which ſhall follow after? Let any Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by his ſpirit vnfold this ridle, ſolue the argument, &amp; ſo leaue leape out of the Circle. And thus much of the third <hi>Circle,</hi> and circular manner of proceeding betweene election and ſcripture.</p>

To which damnation that he might bring them, he did for that end create them, and ordained that firſt Adam, then all his poſterity ſhould ſinne, that for this ſinne he might execute his ſentence of damnation; for which end he did cauſe Sathan to tempt them to ſinne, to moue and force them to ſinne, yea did himſelfe take from them all liberty not to ſinne, and worke in them immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly by his operation all their ſinne, and obdurate them in that ſinne; and for that end that they ſhould haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or help againſt ſinne, he denyed them the benefit of the death of Chriſt, and his merits, the benefit of vocation to grace, of ſufficiency of grace, of iuſtification by grace, or of glorification by the meanes of grace, to all thoſe whome he had thus appointed to damnation, and to ſinne.

of theſe principles &amp; poſitions. And firſt to begin with their firſt principle,<note place="margin">Abſurdities which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vpon contempt of Church-authority.</note> and the iſſue following from it, which is their contempt of Church-authority, their condemning the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, as Antichriſtian, and theit bold affirming the true Church of Chriſt, for ſo many ages, to haue decayed, &amp; periſhed, and to haue beene inuiſible not knowne, &amp; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ouerwhelmed with errours of ſuperſtition, idolatry, &amp; Antichriſtianity,<note place="margin">1. The want of a true Church, fayth, and ſaluation.</note> 1. It followes that for ſo many ages, that is, 8.10.12. or 14. as before, was neither true Church or congregation, neither lawfull Paſtours and Preachers, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther right Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts or Sacrifice, neither any diuine ſeruice or worſhip of God among any viſible company of people in any part of the Chriſtian world. 2. It followes, that in all thoſe ages, all the Fathers and Doctours, all the Biſhops &amp; Prelates, all the Confeſſours, Virgins, and Martyrs, and all the Councels generall or prouinciall: that all the foure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours of the Latin Church, and the reſt with them, al the Doctours of the Eaſt Church, &amp; all the learned among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all ancient Biſhops of the Primitiue church, &amp; al the Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy vnder them, all the foure firſt generall Councels, and the other twelue after them, with the prouinciall Councels confirmed by them,<note place="margin">2.

Into what heart of any Chriſtian can it enter, that for ſo many ages, no Doctour with his penne, no Prelate out of the pulpit, no Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſour in priſon, no Martyr at his death, no Councell by their decrees, no Emperour with his ſword, no people, or Paſtour in any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh ſhould haue publikly profeſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maintayned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed

               <p>Fourthly it followes, that Turkes, Iewes, and Gentils haue had a more flouriſhing ſtate of a Church, Kingdome, and Profeſſours, as hauing beene more viſible, potent, and

               <p>SECONDLY, Out of the ſecond principle, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine depending on it (which is that a man is iuſtified by only faith,<note place="margin">Abſurdities which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vpon only fayth.</note> which is a faith, ſpeciall of euery ones owne predeſtination, iuſtification, and glorification; ſo certaine, and ſo ſure as that there is a God, or that Chriſt is ſaued; ſo perpetuall, that it can neuer be loſt, and peculiar only to the elect, depending vpon their priuat ſpirit, and the reſt before mentioned) it followes, Firſt. That a man is not only

without all doubt, or ſo much as any feare, certaine of his predeſtination paſt, iuſtification preſent,<note place="margin">1.

Trinity,</hi> of the <hi>Incarnation, Paſsion, Reſurrection, aſcenſion, and coming of Christ</hi>; which he belieues only by a faith not ſupernaturall, and diuine, but hiſtoricall, generall, and common, as they ſay, to the reprobate and diuels; yea more certaine, then Ieſus-Chriſt was of his ſaluation, whom they affirme to haue feared, doubted, diſtruſted, and deſpaired, before his death of his ſaluation, as is afterward ſhewed. Yea as certaine muſt they be, as certaine they are that God is one God, or that Ieſus Chriſt is in heauen or, as if Ieſus Chriſt were preſent, and ſo told them; which are their owne words, and compariſons, which is both abſurd and impious: abſurd, becauſe they haue ſcripture to auouch the being of one God, and the ſaluation of Chriſt; but which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouches to euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this his ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in particular they haue neither ſcripture nor reaſon: Impious, becauſe what greater impiety, and blaſphemy can be conceaued, then to make Chriſt, God and man, doubtfull of his ſaluation, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſinfull and wicked wretches, certaine of theirs?</p>
               <p>Secondly it followes, that euery Proteſtant may, and muſt by faith belieue as certaine, that, of which neither au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of ſcripture, teſtimony of Church,<note place="margin">2. That their fayth is not grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

That the Sacraments, and chiefly Baptiſme, are ſeales or ſignes of fayth, and ſo are to be miniſtred only to the faithfull, and the children of the faythfull; for which <hi>Farellus</hi> at <hi>Geneua</hi> refuſed to baptize a child, whoſe parents were Papiſts, and <hi>Caluin</hi> approued the fact. 4.

If al this ſhould be true,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17745:126"/>
it would follow that, becauſe the couenant and promiſe of fayth and ſaluation was made, for example, to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, &amp; that becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> had fayth, was ſealed with the ſigne of fayth, was iuſt by Fayth, muſt continue in fayth, and was ſaued by fayth, that therefore his ſeed <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi>; and as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ſo his ſeed <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi>; and as <hi>Iacob,</hi> ſo all his ſeed, all the twelue Patriarches his ſonnes, were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe included in the couenant, were all borne of fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full parents, all ſanctifyed in their Mothers wombe, all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as faythfull with the Circumciſion, the ſigne of faith, all made iuſt by fayth, all continued in the ſame fayth, and ſo all ſaued in heauen by vertue of that fayth. And as they, ſo their ſeed, and children, and their childrens children, from generation to generation muſt be likewiſe included in the Couenant; be likewiſe ſanctifyed in their Mothers wombe, be likewiſe ſealed with the ſigne of the Couenant, or Circumciſion; be likewiſe iuſt by fayth, continue iuſt in fayth, and be likewiſe ſaued by fayth. And the ſame which it inferred of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and his children, and childrens children vnto the worldes end, may alſo be inferred and auouched truly either more generally of <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſterity, or more particulerly of any one faythfull, and his poſterity for euer. For if <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> or this particular faythfull perſon were faythfull, iuſt, and ſaued, then their children after them, and their childrens children for euer were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe faythfull, iuſt and ſaued, becauſe as the Parents had the promiſe of fayth made to themſelues, and their children; ſo their children were borne ſanctifyed of theſe faythfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, were ſealed with the ſigne of fayth, Circumciſion or Baptiſme; were made iuſt, continued iuſt by fayth, &amp; were ſaued as iuſt by fayth; and as theſe children, ſo alſo all their children and childrens children by the ſame reaſon were all included in the couenant or promiſe of Fayth, were al born ſanctifyed by fayth, were all to be ſealed with the ſigne of fayth, were all made iuſt by fayth, all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued iuſt by fayth, &amp; ſo are all ſaued by fayth; and ſo all the poſterity of <hi>Adam, Nati natorum, &amp; quotquot naſcentur abillis,</hi> as they were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the promiſe of fayth made to their parents and them,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17745:126"/>
and therby were all faithfull, and continued and ended all faythfull, ſo were they all ſaued. By which it ſhould follow alſo not only, that all the whole world ſhould be ſaued and none damned; but alſo that fayth, iuſtification and ſaluation ſhould deſcend by inheritance from generation to generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Landes ſhould by entayle, which cannot by any fine or recouery be cut off, ſold, or loſt. And as they are all thus faythfull, &amp; iuſt by fayth apprehending the iuſtice of Chriſt, and had the iuſtice of Chriſt equally imputed to them for their iuſtice: ſo are they all equally iuſt, as iuſtifyed by the ſame iuſtice of Chriſt, and all equally iuſt with Chriſt, as hauing the ſame iuſtice theirs which was Chriſts; and ſo are all iuſt and perfect as any Saint, or Chriſt, are all as certaine of ſaluation as any Saint, or Chriſt, and ſhalbe all as bleſſed in heauen as is any Saint or Chriſt, with whome as they had the ſame iuſtice in earth, ſo for the ſame they ſhall haue the like glory in heauen. Which abſurdity as of all abſurdities it is moſt abſurd, ſo doth it follow out of the ſame abſurd do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the ſame abſurdity is inferred out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Proteſtants vſually receaued poſition of doctrine,<note place="margin">The ſame proued out of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by ſpeciall and only fayth.</note> which is, <hi>That euery man shallbe ſaued by only Fayth,</hi> and that by a <hi>ſpeciall Fayth,</hi> by which he is bound infallibly to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> belieue that he ſhalbe ſaued if he wilbe ſaued: out of which their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued doctrine I reaſon thus.

The <hi>Maior</hi> propoſition is true, and not deniable in any diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, becauſe all articles or points of Fayth, which all are bound to belieue as neceſſary to ſaluation, and vnder paine of damnation, are moſt certainly true, &amp; <hi>aeternae veritatis ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedenter,</hi>

and before they be actually belieued, whether they be belieued or not by them, who ought to belieue them. For ſo, that there is a bleſſed Trinity of three perſons &amp; one God, an Incarnation of the Sonne of God, a Reſurrection of the body and the like, is certainely true in it ſelfe, though the <hi>Arians, Nestorians,</hi> and other Heretikes doe not belieue it, which yet they are bound to belieue as neceſſary to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore if euery man be bound in like manner to belieue his owne ſaluation as certainly, and as necceſſarily as he is bound to belieue the B.

For if the certainty of his owne ſaluation be the obiect of euery mans fayth which he ought to belieue, then the ſame certainty or obiect is true before it be belieued; and ſo it is true that he ſhalbe ſaued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he do belieue, and true it is whether he ſo belieue or no.</p>

                  </note> Confeſſion of Auſpurge, of Saxony, Luther, Lobecius, Pareus, Whitaker, Reynoldes, Perkins, <hi>That a man is iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by belieuing, and that without wauering or feare of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, that his ſinnes ere forgiuen, that he is iuſt, and shal be ſaued. Yea</hi> (ſayth Iewell) <hi>he muſt be ſo certaine, as if Christ was preſent and ſo told him</hi>; ſayth Pareus, <hi>as certaine as that Chriſt dyed for the remiſsion of our ſinnes</hi>; ſayth Luther, and Zuinglius, <hi>as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as he is of Chriſts ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea ſo certaine, that except Chriſt be damned, he cannot be damned.</hi> Whereupon they all hould that the obiect of <hi>Iuſtifying Fayth,</hi> is not to belieue that Chriſt is God and Man, was borne, dyed, and roſe for vs, nor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the Scripture and the word of God in it, which is a <hi>generall</hi> or <hi>historicall Fayth,</hi> and common to the reprobate, &amp; the Diuells; but to belieue that himſelfe hath his ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, is iuſt and ſhalbe ſaued, and that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him, doth account him iuſt, and will ſaue him, the certainty &amp; aſſurance of which doth iuſtify him before God. All which may be ſeene in the Authors owne wordes in D. <hi>Smiths</hi> Collation. This is that ſpeciall Fayth by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone Proteſtants hould that euery man is iuſtifyed &amp; ſaued, and without which euery one is damned. Therefore this Faith is neceſſary to ſaluation <hi>neceſsitate medij,</hi> and as a thing ſo neceſsary, doth oblige euery one in particuler vnder pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of damnation to haue it, becauſe by it all are ſaued, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:17745:128"/>
without it, all are damned. Therefore true is the <hi>Minor</hi> Propoſition, that as according to the Proteſtants, this faith alone is neceſſary for euery one to ſaluation, ſo euery one is bound to haue, and ſo to beleeue it vpon paine of the loſſe of his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Vpon which premiſes, which in the firſt moode and figure inferre the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> followes, that according to this proteſtant poſition of <hi>Iuſtification</hi> &amp; <hi>Saluation,</hi> by only &amp; <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Faith,</hi> that euery one whetherſoeuer he belieue or no, whether he be faithful or infidel, elect or reprobate, muſt be ſaued. Which abſurdityas it is moſt abſurd, ſo is the ſame more fully illuſtrated and deduced out of the ſame principle after this manner:<note place="margin">As well the reprobat as the elect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to belieue all articles of Fayth.</note> 
                  <hi>Speciall Faith,</hi> or infallible aſſurance of ſaluation is neceſſary to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as well to <hi>Iudas</hi> a reprobat, as to <hi>Iames</hi> an elect; and as <hi>Iames</hi> is ſaued by it, ſo is <hi>Iudas</hi> damned for want of it, according to the Proteſtants: therefore vnder paine of his damnation <hi>Iudas</hi> is as well bound to haue it, as <hi>Iames</hi> is; becauſe it being a neceſſary meane to ſaluation, the want of it is <hi>Iudas</hi> damnation, as the hauing of it is <hi>Iames</hi> his ſauation. <hi>Iudas</hi> therfore (and that which I ſay of <hi>Iudas,</hi> I ſay of all the reprobate) is as much obliged vnder paine of his damnation, to belieue as an article of his faith, that he ſhalbe ſaued, as <hi>Iames,</hi> or any elect is? But whatſoeuer <hi>Iudas</hi> and all the reprobate or infidels are bound to belieue as an article of faith neceſſary to their ſaluation, as wel as <hi>Iames</hi> and the elect, muſt needs be true, and that certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly true, whetherſoeuer they do belieue it or no: The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore it muſt needs be true, that as well <hi>Iudas</hi> and all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſhalbe ſaued,<note place="margin">Particuler ſaluation an obiect of Proteſtants fayth reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> as <hi>Iames</hi> and the elect. The fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reaſon of which is this: All diuine Faith (of which kind, and that the moſt chiefe the Proteſtants will haue this their <hi>Speciall Faith</hi> to be) depends vpon diuine reuelation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, this reuelation ſuppoſeth truth in the obiect or thing reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the obiect of truth or thing reuealed, is <hi>aeterna veritatis</hi> and true in it ſelfe before it be belieued, and ſo true whether it be belieued or no. The obiect therefore of this ſpeciall faith, which euery one as well reprobate as elect, is bound vnder paine of his damnation to belieue, and which is the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:17745:128"/>
remiſſion of his owne ſinnes, his <hi>Iustification</hi> and ſaluation; is, and muſt be <hi>aeternae veritatis,</hi> is, and muſt be true before it be belieued, is, and muſt be true whether it be belieued or no; and ſo it is and muſt be true, that euery man, as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate as elect, hath remiſſion of ſins, iuſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; it is, &amp; was eternally true before it was belieued, and ſo is true whether it be belieued or no, and ſo, that his ſinnes are remitted, he iuſtified and ſaued, whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue or no. And as there cannot be giuen an inſtance in any other article of faith neceſſary to ſaluation, in which this reaſon (which indeed is the ground of all faith) doth not conuince that the article is true whetherſoeuer it be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or no; ſo no reaſon, nor anſwer in any reaſon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame ground of true faith, can be giuen why it ſhould not hold good alſo in this act and obiect of this <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Faith,</hi> which if it be diuine faith muſt participat of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; eſſence of all diuine faith. Therefore it muſt follow that either this ſpeciall faith is no diuine faith, but an illuſion and phantaſy, or if it be diuine, that this abſurd abſurdity muſt follow vpon it, that man may be ſaued without any faith, and that all ſhalbe ſaued whether they haue any faith or none.</p>
               <p>Which is yet confirmed further by theſe two parities, the one diuine, the other humane: the former thus:<note place="margin">As the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection ſo the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one an article of fayth.</note> As the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> of euery man being an article of faith which euery one is bound to belieue, is true, that is, euery man ſhall ryſe againe whetherſoeuer he do beleeue it or no: ſo the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſaluation of euery man being likewiſe an article which euery one is bound to belieue or elſe is damned, is likewiſe true, that is, he is iuſtified or ſaued whetherſoeuer he do belieue or no. The reaſon of both is, becauſe <hi>remiſsion of ſins, iuſtification,</hi> or <hi>ſaluation</hi> of euery one, being as well an obiect &amp; article of ones faith, as the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of euery one is, they are both preſupoſed as true to faith, not compoſed and made true by faith, &amp; ſo both alike eternally true, both alike true antecedent and before the act of faith, and ſo both true whether they be belieued or no.

               <p>The ſame abſurdity may be inferred, and is ſeconded by other like abſurd poſitions of ſome particuler Proteſtants, as by that poſition of <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> who maintained that <hi>Theſeus, Hercules, Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> all Pagans, are equally with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> in heauen; by that of ſome of <hi>M.

Firſt, becauſe a true fayth is of thinges reuealed by God in ſcripture or tradition, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the Church in practiſe or definition, but that either ſo many of ſo contrary religions as <hi>Lutherans, Caluinists, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, Familiſts, Arians,</hi> or, that any one, in any one of theſe profeſſions is predeſtinated, iuſtified, &amp; glorified, as they all belieue, is neither reuealed in any Scripture, or Tradition from God, nor confirmed in any practiſe or declaration of holy Church, therefore not a true but a falſe fayth. 2. A true Fayth cannot perſwade and propoſe beliefes &amp; doctrines which are contrary, and condemne one another: but this ſpeciall fayth perſuades a beliefe, doctrine, and certainty of ſaluation which is contrary, and condemneth one another, as the fayth and ſaluation of the <hi>Lutherans, Caluiniſts, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> and the reſt in number aboue 100. which are all oppoſit in fayth, all condemne one another, and yet are all ſure of their ſaluation by this fayth: <hi>Ergo</hi> it cannot be true.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">That a man is iuſtified by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory fayth.</note> that this fayth is contrary or contradictory in it ſelfe, is proued thus; That certainty of Fayth is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory which belieueth a fayth and doctrine contrary or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory; but by this certainty of Fayth the <hi>Lutherans, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts, Libertines, Anabaptiſts, Trinitarians,</hi> and the reſt, do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue fayth and religions contrary and contradictory, as is manifeſt by the former inſtances, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againe, that fayth is contradictory which doth make the ſame man belieue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories; but this ſpeciall fayth makes men belieue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictories, as that it doth make him iuſt, and doth not mak him iuſt, <hi>Ergo.</hi> That it maks a man iuſt they affirme, becauſe by it a man is iuſtified; that it makes not a man iuſt, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, becauſe by it he belieues that he is iuſt, therefore he is iuſt before he belieues it, in the ſame manner, as God is God before he is belieued to be God. Or thus: A man is iuſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he belieue, becauſe his iuſtice is the obiect of his fayth, and ſo preſuppoſed to fayth, and yet he is not iuſt before he
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17745:130"/>
belieue, becauſe this iuſtice is the effect of his fayth, by which he is iuſtified, and ſo is after fayth: but to be iuſt and not iuſt both, before he belieue, is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictory, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againe, that is contradictory which is good, and not good, which doth make a man iuſt and not iuſt; but this ſpeciall fayth is good, becauſe it iuſtifyes, and not good, becauſe it is a ſin, and that mortall, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againe, it makes a man iuſt, becauſe by it he is iuſtified, &amp; not iuſt, becauſe by it he is made ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it being a ſinne as euery good worke is in their grounds. Againe, this fayth doth alone iuſtify, and doth not alone iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify; alone iuſtify, becauſe <hi>Caluin</hi> and all Proteſtants affirme it, &amp; it alone doth not iuſtify becauſe the ſame <hi>Caluin</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, that Baptiſme is a ſigne of remiſſion of ſinnes paſt and to come, which remiſſion of ſinnes to come, dependes vpon the memory of Baptiſme paſt, and ſo not vpon fayth only. Againe, this fayth according to them being a worke of man wholy infected with original ſinne, is a ſinne, and ſo maketh a man ſinnefull, &amp; this fayth doth iuſtify, and ſo is a good worke: but to make a man ſinnefull and iuſt, are contrary, or contradictory, <hi>Ergo.</hi> Againe, it affirmes that euery good worke, euen the leaſt of the beſt perſon, is a ſinne; &amp; ſo there are no good workes but all ſinnes; and it affirmes that fayth cannot be without good workes, and ſo there are good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes; but to affirme that there are good works, and that there are no good workes, are contradictory, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, that this faith is a ſinne, and makes a man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is proued thus. Euery good worke, euen the beſt worke of the beſt man, according to them, is a ſinne, becauſe it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a fountaine corrupted with ſinne: but this faith which iuſtifieth is ſuch a good worke which conſequently is a ſinne, therfore it maketh a man ſinne, and ſo a man is ſaued from ſinne by a worke which is ſinne; made iuſt by an act which is iniuſt, adopted the ſonne of God by a worke which offendes God, and is made partaker of heauen by an act which deſerues hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">That a man is iuſtified by a rash Fayth.</note>Fourthly, That this faith is temerarious, is proued thus. That is raſhly and lightly belieued which is belieued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any authority of ſcripture, which according to them is
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17745:130"/>
the only meanes of beliefe: but there is no Scripture that aſſures, for example, that either <hi>Caluin, Knox,</hi> or <hi>Tindall</hi> is predeſtinated, hath his ſinnes forgiuen him, and ſhalbe glorified in heauen, which yet they belieue, ſay they, more certainly by this ſpeciall faith, then they do the diuinity birth, death, reſurrection, or aſcenſion of Chriſt, which they belieue onely by an hiſtorical faith, therfore they raſhly and without ground do belieue it. Which is confirmed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to belieue things they ſee men haue ſenſe, to belieue morall or mathematicall concluſions, they haue reaſon and demonſtration, and to belieue articles of faith they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation of God in ſcripture: but to belieue euery one that his predeſtination, iuſtification, &amp; glorification is certaine to him, is made knowne neither by experience of ſenſe, nor by euidence of reaſon, nor by reuelation of ſcripture, or any way elſe; therefore it is raſhly without ground belieued.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, That this only ſpeciall faith is preſumptuous,<note place="margin">That a man is iuſtified by a preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuous faith.</note> is proued thus: As that is deſperation which will not hope for ſaluation by grace; ſo that is preſumption (both the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of hope) which will hope for it without good works, good life, obſeruance of the Commandements, and merits, to which life eternall is promiſed: but only and ſpeciall faith excludes all good works, all merit,<note place="margin">

And all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the practiſe of all ſaints, who haue vſed ſuch continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and feruour of prayer, ſuch rigour, and auſterity of penance, ſuch retirement and forſaking of the world, all to obtaine and purchaſe it at Gods hands. Which yet this ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall faith will obtaine by only aſſuring and ſecuring a man, moſt certainly of it, without either condition of works, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17745:131"/>
good life, without any works of penance or ſatisfaction, or without any doubt or feare of looſing it, or failing in it.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, That this only faith deſtroyes all hope, Charity, prayer, and good works, is proued thus. No man can hope for that which he hath; no man prayes, and makes ſuit for that which he hath,<note place="margin">That a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is iuſtifyed by a fayth, deſtroyes hope and Charity.</note> and cannot looſe; no man labours to practiſe that which he deems impoſſible to performe. But this faith aſſures them of their predeſtination, that they are predeſtinate, and cannot be damned; aſſures them of Gods fauour that they haue remiſſion of ſinnes, and iuſtification, and cannot looſe it: and aſſures them of glorification, that they ſhall enioy heauen, and ſaluation, which is as due to them as to Chriſt, and can no more faile them then it can faile Chriſt; where is then any place for hope? It aſſures the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that good works, and the keeping of the law is impoſſible; that pennance, and ſatisfaction is fruitleſſe, yea derogating from the merit of Chriſt; that all merit by grace, or hope of reward for our good deeds is excluded. That ſuch a loue of God is required (to wit, an intenſiue loue with all the force of our ſoule, and an only loue which admits no kind of loue of any thing elſe) as is poſſible only in the next life, not facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this life: therefore by this faith is excluded all hope of reward for good works, all neceſſity of prayer for obteining the Kingdome of heauen, all vſe of ſaying the Lords prayer for remiſſion of ſinnes, all fruit of penance, or ſatisfaction for the puniſhment of ſinne, all poſſibility of doing good, liuing well, and louing of God aboue all things, and withall is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a neceſſity of breaking Gods Commandements, of ſinning mortally, &amp; offending in all actions, euen in the beſt actions of the beſt men, as <hi>Caluin</hi> expreſly affirmes; and yet withall this infallible aſſurance of the Kingdome of heauen is by this faith obteined and confirmed. Who will therfore, or needs, (according to theſe principles) to pray, to faſt, to do pennance, to forbeare ſinne, to bridle his concupiſcence, to do good works, to loue God, and liue piouſly, ſince all are needleſſe, fruitleſſe, or impoſſible by this doctrine?

do, or do practiſe in their life, and conuerſation the ſame, as many well intending Proteſtants do, they cannot do it either out of the principles and grounds of their religion, which we ſee require no ſuch thing, as all oppoſit to it; but either out of the engrafted light of natural reaſon, which doth teach it; or out of the good inclination of their natural diſpoſition, which doth moue them to it; or out of the principles or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertues which morall Philoſophers haue layd for it; or out of the doctrine, or example, &amp; imitation or others who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> practiſe it, and for the practiſe to deſerue a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comendation and worthy eſteeme among men by it.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, that this doctrine makes Chriſt a bad Phiſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes Chriſt no good Phiſitian of ſoules.</note> &amp; worſe Chirurgeon of ſoules, to cure them of their ſinnes, is proued: Becauſe he infuſes neither grace into our ſoares to cure them, nor giues ſtrength to our infirmityes to enable vs, nor extinguiſhes the poyſon of originall ſinne which ſtill infects our actions; but only couers our ſoares, and wounds with a faire cloake of his owne iuſtice, preſents vs thus co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered before God as iuſt, and imputes no ſinnes vnto vs; though inwardly indeed we remaine vniuſt, and wicked, in ſoule, in hart, and in all cogitations, wordes, or actions.

               <p>Fiftly, That this faith doth take from Chriſt all authority either of iudging at all, or of iudging vprightly, &amp; ſo makes

him either no iudge, or an vniuſt iudge, is proued; Becauſe in a iudge is requiſite, 1. That he vnpartially diſcuſſe, and examine the cauſe. 2. That he duely reward the iuſt. 3. That he iuſtly puniſh the offender. But this doctrine leaues no place for diſcuſſion of ſinnes, becauſe, according to it, all works are ſinnes, as proceeding from originall ſinne, and infected with originall ſinne, and all ſinnes are a like great as equally forbid by the law of ſinne, which forbids as well, and vnder as great penalty (at leaſt in generall) of death &amp; damnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the theft of a pin as of a pound: therfore all diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this difference is needleſſe where no difference among them in greatneſſe is admitted. 2. It leaues no place for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of God workes, in that it admits neither any workes to bee before God good, nor any perſons to be inwardly iuſt, nor any merit to be poſſible by any worke, or perſon, nor any reward to be due to any merit; but where neither worke is good, nor perſon iuſt, nor merit deſeruing, there can be no iuſtice of remuneration in rewarding either good works, or iuſt perſons. 3.

But ſo it is according to the former Proteſtant doctrine. Therfore, according to the ſame, Chriſt cannot at the day of iudgment iudge any, or at the leaſt not iuſtly; and cannot be either a iudge, or at leaſt not a iuſt iudge, according to euery mans works.</p>
               <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">VVhich ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes Chriſt no Prieſt.</note> That this doctrine doth bereaue Chriſt of his prieſthood, and power of ſacrificing, and offering for ſinnes,

is proued thus: As in all ſtates of nature cerimonall, or grace, ſinnes were committed; ſo in all ſtates were ſacrifices ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for remiſſion of ſinnes, and prieſts appointed to offer for the ſame. In the law of nature the ſacrifice was voluntary, &amp; the prieſt was the eldeſt of the family.

They offered often, and many times, as wanting one full price able to make a full redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at once; he offered once for all, and that a full price &amp; ſatisfaction ſufficient for all. They were annointed with materiall oyle of oliues; he with internall oyle of Deity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue his companions. They offered ſacrifices many in kind, and meane in quality, all inferiour to themſelues; he offered one and that moſt iuſt euen himſelfe, and his owne body &amp; bloud: of which ſacrifice himſelfe was, 1.

               <p>Secondly, it followes that any faythfull, iuſt, and regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Proteſtant may (in reſpect of any pitt of damnation) as

As both the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are damnable in the reprobate, and he for both ſhallbe puniſhed in hell, ſo neither the one nor the other are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the elect, nor he for either can be hindred from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As in both the elect, and reprobate, workes are not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the obiect, but by the perſon, being all mortall ſinnes in themſelues; ſo in the reprobate all are mortall; in the elect all veniall, all pardoned, none imputed, none pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. And as the good workes in the elect do not merit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reward of glory, nor ſatisfy for any puniſhment of ſinne; ſo the bad workes in the ſame elect ſhall not receaue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of puniſhment, neither depriue him of any benefit of iuſtification; both therefore the good &amp; the bad are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues great ſinnes, as proceeding from concupiſcence, which is ſinne, and as violating the law, but both are by fayth not imputed, both by the iuſtice of Chriſt couered, and ſo both in a ſort indifferent to be committed or omitted, as both deſeruing, and neither receauing puniſhment; both being ſinnes in themſelues, and neither imputed for ſinnes by God. Vpon what motiue or ground therefore of religion, either of diſpleaſing God, or of hope of reward, or of feare of hell, can a regenerate Proteſtant be induced to auoid ſinnes, rather then good workes,<note place="margin">3. That the grounds of Proteſtant Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit great ſinners to be perfect Proteſtants.</note> or to liue vertuouſly rather then vitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſith both are mortall ſinnes, both mortally offend God, and both equally are not imputed, neither puniſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it followes, that any faythfull and regenerate Proteſtant may according to the groundes of his fayth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any, or all the former ſinnes, yea all the ſinnes which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reprobate doth commit, and yet remaine a iuſt, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,

All which are lawfull, and warrantable, according to theſe grounds of their Fayth, that no lawes are poſſible, or oblige in conſcience, that no bad workes are imputed, or hinder ſaluation, that the liberty of the Ghoſpell makes all actions free and voluntary, that only fayth doth iuſtify, and cannot be loſt, that no man hath freewill, nor can do otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath decreed.

               <p>Out of all which former abſurdities, we may obſerue theſe differences betweene a Proteſtant and a Catholike, &amp; a iuſt man of the one,<note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce between a iuſt Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>like, and a iuſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</note> and a iuſt man of the other; that, 1. A Proteſtant belieues a fayth which neuer any Prince, Prelate, or people, neuer any Doctour, Confeſſour, or Martyr, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any Councell prouinciall, or generall belieued for 1500. and more yeares before <hi>Luther.</hi> The Catholike belieues the ſame which all Princes Chriſtian, all Prelates and people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted true Chriſtians, all Confeſſours, Martyrs, and Saints,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:17745:141"/>
all Councels generall no fewer then eighten, and all prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall aboue 100. haue euer ſince Chriſt profeſſed and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Secondly, a Proteſtant belieues a fayth which falſify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and fruſtrateth the predictions of the Prophets, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt, the preaching of the Apoſtles, the miſſion of Paſtours, the ſucceſſion of Prelates, the ordination of Prieſts the vertue of miracles, the conſtancy of Confeſſours, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Virgins, the bloud of Martyrs, and the vnity, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, antiquity, and vniuerſality of the Catholicke Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Catholike belieues and profeſſes a fayth which verifies, and confirmes all the former, and in which they agree in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and profeſſion with them all. Thirdly, the Proteſtants belieue a fayth which hath leſſe authority, credibility, and motiues of perſuaſion, ſuch as are miracles, vnity, vniuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and others to perſuade, and make it credible, then hath the fayth of Iewes, Turkes, or Pagans: the Catholikes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that which hath vnity, viſibility, vniuerſality, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſanctity, prophecies, miracles, monuments of piety, charity, bounty, and all reaſons of probability to perſuade, and make it credible. Fourthly the Proteſtant is made iuſt by a ſpeciall fayth, of which is no mention either in any Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Tradition, Councell, or Father, and which neither Doctour, Father, Prelate, Prince, Prouince, people or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the world before them belieued, and profeſſed as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and iuſtifying fayth: the Catholicke is made iuſt by a Catholike fayth which hath beene generall, vniuerſall, &amp; wholy by all people, Prelates, and Princes, in all tymes and places acknowledged, and profeſſed. Fifthly, the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is made iuſt by a fayth, by which all the ſeed and poſterity of <hi>Abraham, Noe,</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> yea all Iewes, Gentils, Turks, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, &amp; wicked blaſphemers, idolaters, murtherers, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious and inceſtuous perſons which haue beene, or ſhalbe till the worlds end, may as well be ſaued and aſſured of their ſaluation, as they themſelues: the Catholike is made iuſt by a fayth, by which only they who belieue truly, and liue pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, or repent and amend faithfully, can be iuſtified and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Sixthly, the Proteſtant is made iuſt by a ſpeciall fayth, which is falſe, as belieuing many pointes for true which yet
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:17745:142"/>
are contrary one to another; which is contradictory, as houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding poſitions contradicting one another; which is ſinneful, as being a ſinne and that mortall, as all their good works are; which is preſumptuous, preſuming without grace to be made holy, without merit to attaine a reward, without ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s owne labour, and concurrence to be crowned with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of heauen; which is iniurious to hope which it deſtroies by certainty; to charity which it maks impoſſible to do good workes, all which it turnes into ſinnes, and that mortall: The Catholikes are iuſtifyed by a fayth which admits none of the former abſurdities, but is true, humble, vniforme, pious, and a foundation for hope, charity, and good life. Seauenthly, the Proteſtant is iuſtifyed by a fayth which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the redemption of Chriſt, making it neither v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall for all, nor perfect for any, nor able to cure one ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but is only an apprehenſion of iuſtice, only a couer for ſinne, only a conceit that a man is iuſt, when he is aſſured he is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt; which makes Chriſt neither vpright lawyer, for that he makes lawes impoſſible to be kept; nor iuſt Iudge for that he giues neither reward, or puniſhment according to deedes and deſerts; nor perpetuall Prieſt, for that he offers no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice at all, or but only that one of the Croſſe; which makes Chriſt ignorant, getting by degrees knowledge as other men; impotent not able to ſatisfy ſinne but with ſuffering all the paines euen thoſe of hell due to ſinne; inconſiderate, as making prayers &amp; vowes vnaduiſed, and not premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſinnefull in ſtaggering between prayſing, and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming God, betweene hope and feare of ſaluation, doubting and deſpairing of his owne ſaluation, and laſtly damned in hell, and ſuffering all the paines therein which any damned do: The Catholike is iuſtifyed by a fayth which makes Chriſt a perfect Redeemer (of his part) of all men from all ſinnes, &amp; from all both guilte, and paine of ſinne; a iuſt law giuer in his lawes, which are eaſy, and in his iudgments which are according to euery mans workes; a potent Sauiour, who by one action of his diuine perſon is able to ſatisfy for all ſinne; a perſon alwayes perfect in all knowledge, alwayes imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate without any the leaſt ſpot of ſinne, and alwayes bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:17745:142"/>
and glorified with the viſion and fruition of God euen from his conception. And thus much a Proteſtant and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike differ in the points of a iuſtifying fayth.</p>
               <p>Looke further yet into the ſoule, and perſons of the one and the other. 8. A iuſt Proteſtant hath originall ſinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning in him; a iuſt Catholike hath it taken away from him. 9. The one is inwardly infected, corrupted, and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſinne; the other is inwardly pure, ſound, beautifull, &amp; adorned with grace. 10. The one hath all his actions ſtained polluted, and made damnable by the infection of his original ſinne; the other hath many of his actions gracious, liuely, and made meritorious by grace. 11. The one in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons euen the beſt doth offend and diſpleaſe God; the other in all his actions which are not bad doth honour &amp; pleaſe God. 12. The one by his good actions deſerues nothing but eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation; the other by his good deedes deſerues eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation. 13. The one is iuſt only before man, and by God eſteemed iuſt, though he be internally and indeed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt; the other is iuſt before God, and internally, and really indeed iuſt. 14. The one hath no deformity, or guilt of ſinne waſhed, cured, or taken away, but only not imputed; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath all guilt waſhed, cleanſed, &amp; aboliſhed by inherent iuſtice &amp; grace. 15. The one hath neither power, nor liberty to do any good worke; the other aſſiſted by grace, hath free-to do good. 16. The one cannot performe any one comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; the other by grace can performe them all. 17. The one cannot reſiſt but yield to euery motion of concupiſcence; the other can, and doth by grace reſiſt ill motions. 18. The one cannot loue God, praiſe him, feare, or honour him in any action; the other can do it, by Gods grace in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 19. The one cannot increaſe in iuſtice or grace, but is as iuſt at the firſt inſtant of his iuſtification, as euer; the other can, and doth become more iuſt, patient, humble, and charitable. 20. The one may commit any ſinne, though of murder, adultery, blaſphemy, hereſy, or idolatry, and yet remaine iuſt, and not looſe his iuſtice, nor the fauour of God; the other may, and muſt auoid all the ſame, or the like ſinnes leaſt he looſe grace, and be damned. 21. The one, let
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:17745:143"/>
him do what he will, is ſure he ſhalbe ſaued, and cannot by any ſinne be damned, except Chriſt be damned; the other with feare and trembling doth labour to make his election and ſaluation, by good works ſure. 22. The one needs to make no conſcience of breaking any law of God, or man; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neither oblige in conſcience, and both are impoſſible to be performed: the other thinks himſelfe tyed in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to performe both. 23. The one, though he ſinne, needs no more but only by faith to aſſure himſelfe his ſinne is coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the iuſtice of Chriſt, and not imputed to him: the other, if he ſinne, muſt haue hope, charity, contrition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and ſatisfaction, penance, and purpoſe of amendment to ſinne no more. 24. The one laies all the burthen of his ſinnes vpon Chriſt, and his ſatisfaction, and himſelfe reſts idle and ſecure: the other by the vertue of the ſame merit of Chriſt labours with all auſterity to ſatisfy himſelfe, as far as by grace he can, and to do his endeauour to pacify God. Now whether of theſe two eſtates, the former of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, or the later of the Catholick be more honourable to God, more agreable to piety, more worthy to be eſteeme in themſelues, and ſo more to be preferred by man, let the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader iudge, and make choice.</p>

you muſt dye, if not, you need not my help.</hi> Vpon which the <hi>Landſgraue</hi> yet preſſing him for help of phiſicke, he further inferred: <hi>If you can preſerue your life by phiſicke, though your day be appointed, why can you not ſaue your ſoule by Contrition, though your end be predeſtinate?</hi> By which reaſon the <hi>Landſgraue</hi> ſaw his errour, and was brought to Contrition, and confeſſion, and that perhaps with better ſucceſſe then if he had anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a Diuine might, and ſhould, thus: <hi>That if you be prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate to ſaluation by meanes appointed by God, then certainly you shall be ſaued if you vſe and apply thoſe meanes, as by Gods grace you may; and if you be reprobate, and appointed to be damned it is for your ſins freely committed, &amp; then certainly you shalbe damned if you commit theſe ſinnes which you may auoid if you will.</hi> By which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as a iuſt man cannot preſume; ſo a ſinner needes not deſpaire, but both, with fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome either in things naturall, as to ſpeake, or to be ſilent, to walke or ſtand: or in things morall, as to giue or not giue almes; or in things ſupernaturall as by grace to loue God, or not loue him, to ſinne or not ſinne againſt God. No freedome either of contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> by which he may do or not do any action, as to moue, or not moue: or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety, and <hi>quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> by which he may proſecute any obiect good, as to loue his neighbour; or bad, as to hate him. It followes, I ſay, that a man hath no freedome or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty either of contradiction, or of contrariety, either in things naturall morall, or ſupernaturall. And as man hath no freewill at all in any action (which both followes from their poſitions and they grant;) ſo it followes, that in vaine
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:17745:145"/>
is all labour in man, either to exerciſe vertue, or to auoide vice. In vaine is all penance or mortification to bridle his concupiſcence, or paſſion. In vaine are all exhortations to piety, and deuotion, and all diſſwaſions from ſinne and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, becauſe man hath no freedome of will, nor power &amp; ability to do either the one or the other, or the one, rather then the other: but all neceſſarily muſt be done as God hath appointed, and doth worke it. It followes, that no lawes or precepts of God or man to bid or forbid, can be iuſt. No tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals of Princes or Prelates to puniſh offenders, and reward well-doers, can be vpright; becauſe they are impoſed on them who haue no liberty to do, or not do them; and leaue neither poſſibility nor obligation to be performed by man. It followes that there can be no vertue in doing well, or vice in doing ill, no iuſt iugment in rewarding of good, or in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of bad, no crowne of glory in heauen for iuſt actions, or torment of paine in hell for vniuſt; becauſe in man is no indifferency, liberty, or freedome to do the one rather then the other; but is neceſſitated by the will of God to do that to which he is ordeined. It followes, that no contracts of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which require a free conſent without feare or force, can be valid. No temptation to ſinne, againſt which is no power or liberty, can be auoided. No lawes againſt male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours for any crimes, becauſe they are not in their power not to do them, can be executed. That no difference remaines betweene a man and a beaſt, for where is no free election there is no will, where is no will there is no reaſon, where no reaſon, there is no difference betweene a man &amp; a beaſt; why therfore are ſins prohibited, lawes eſtabliſhed, ſermons preached more to men then to beaſts, ſith men haue no more liberty to do or not do, to obey or not obey them, then beaſts? Why are actions of luſt, killing, and murdering puniſhed in men, not in beaſts, ſith men haue no more freedome to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteine from them, then beaſts? Why is man rather comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to abſteine from concupiſcence, then the fier is from bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?

Why not to ſinne rather then not to be ſicke, ſith to the one he hath no more power, or ability, liberty, or freedome, then to the other?

Out of which doctrine it followes, 1. That thoſe actions which we eſteeme ſinnes, as idolatry, periury, adultery, murder, theft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pride, malice, and the reſt, are no offences againſt God, becauſe he wils, commands, and works them himſelfe. 2. That they are no ſinnes, becauſe ſinne is againſt the will and law of God, but theſe are according to the will, decree, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, which is the rule according to which all actions are to be ſquared. 3. That ſinne is nothing but, as the Libertins confuted by <hi>Caluin</hi> do hould, an opinion of men, becauſe it is not contrary, but conformable to the will, decree, and commandement of God. 4. That God in words forbidding ſinne, and theſe actions as ſinne, doth either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, as inwardly willing and working that which exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly he prohibits, or els is contrary to himſele, as willing, and not willing the ſame ſinnes. 5. That if there be any ſins at all, then God who is the principall authour, &amp; agent, and not man who is the inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t only, is the ſinner &amp; offender. 6. That men are excuſable in committing any or all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd actions, becauſe they do that which God wils &amp; works, and which themſelues cannot but worke. 7. That no credit can be giuen to the word of God in Scripture, becauſe God may as well lye in it, as he doth in other bookes of Pagans or Heretikes, of both which he is equally the principal authour and dictatour.

This certainly is ſuch a cruelty, that if it were true, it would follow that this good God was more cruell then the former tyrants euer were; for they put men to a temporall death, God to an eternal. They kild men whom they found in their kingdome, God created and made men that he might damne them eternally.

That neuer any doctrine of Atheiſt, Pagan, Iew, or Heretike was ſo wickedly pernicious, and abominable as this of <hi>Caluin,</hi> and his followers is; for though ſome made God idle, as <hi>Epicurus,</hi> others impotent, as <hi>Lucianus,</hi> others the authour of euill, as the <hi>Cerdoniſts, Marcionists,</hi> and <hi>Manichees</hi>; others miſerable, afflicting himſelfe, as the <hi>Thalmudiſts,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers no God at all, as the <hi>Atheiſts</hi>: Yet all theſe are more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe <hi>Caluinists</hi>; for it is not ſo ill to be idle, as to be doing ill; better to make God do nothing then to make him the worker of all wickedneſſe. It is more tollerable to make God vnable to do good, then to make him the authour and actour of doing ill; to make him vnable to requit good, then vniuſt to puniſh where is no deſert of ill. It is leſſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to make two Gods, the one authour of good, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the authour of euill, then to make one God, and yet to make him the authour and worker of euill, and of all euill; to call him iuſt, and yet to make him the puniſher of that in others, which he wills, commandes, and workes by himſelfe; to account him mercifull, and yet vpon his meere will, and pleaſure without any cauſe or deſert, to ordaine, &amp; create millions of men to eternall torments, and damnation. It was not ſo great impiety in the Iewes to make God mourn &amp; ſorrowfull for the puniſhment he wrought on <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Caluiniſts</hi> to make him well pleaſed with the vnreaſonable tormenting of ſoules in hell, &amp; to make it one of the chiefeſt attributes of Gods iuſtice, to appoint men to ſinne, and then for that ſinne to puniſh and damne them. It is not ſo fooliſh to ſay with the foole, <hi>there is no God at all,</hi> as it is to ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 13.1.</note> 
                     <hi>God is the Authour and worker of all wickedneſſe,</hi> and yet
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:17745:154"/>
                     <hi>the punisher, and reuenger of the ſame</hi>; for they by the light of reaſon will condemne and auoid thefts, murders, periuries, iniuſtice as lying in their power to auoid; but theſe will, &amp; may by their owne principles practiſe, and exerciſe them al, as being by God forced, and neceſſitated to them, as wanting freedome to auoid them, and as fearing no puniſhment for them. Though therefore moſt wicked, yet leſſe wicked were the former opinions of Iewes, Heretikes, and Atheiſts, then theſe of the Caluiniſts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it may be obſerued, that no Caluiniſt can be certaine, and aſſured either of any verity of Scripture, or of any article of his Faith, or of any aſſurance of his ſaluation by his priuate ſpirit; for though he may imagine himſelfe to be certaine of the ſenſe of Scripture, of the articles of his fayth, and of the infallibility of his ſaluation, that they are reuealed from God, yet he may with all according to his principles of fayth, imagine that God who reueales theſe, may reueale &amp; tell him, which is falſe; for as God, according to them, is he who effectually procures the ſinner to ſin, who as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe vſes the ſinner as an inſtrument to commit ſinne, who incites, compels, and neceſſitates the ſinner to ſinne, &amp; who phiſically, and effectually workes, and cauſes the act of ſinne; ſo the ſame God, according to them may procure, and incite the Apoſtles, and Prophets as his inſtruments, compel, and neceſſitate them as the chiefe authour, and worker, and produce in them as the principall agent, lyes and vntruthes, and ſo may by them in Scripture reueale an vntruth, either of the beliefe of the myſteries of their fayth, or of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their ſaluation. What certainty therefore can they haue from God of reuelations they receaue from him, or of any thing ſuggeſted by their ſuppoſed ſpirit, as from him? Agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, God, according to <hi>Caluin,</hi> hath <hi>one will exteriour, another interiour; doth call exteriourly whome he withouldes interiourly, ſpeakes to them, but to make them more deafe, giues them light but the more to blind them, doth teach them but to make them more dull, doth apply to them a remedy, but not to cure them</hi>; for ſo are <hi>Caluins</hi> wordes. If ſo, then how can any be ſure that the calling,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calu.</hi> 3. <hi>Inst.</hi> 24.13.</note> the ſpeaking, the light, the doctrine, and the motion of their
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:17745:155"/>
ſpirit (as they ſuppoſe of God) is not rather to detaine then draw them, rather to darken then lighten them, rather to dull them then teach them, rather to increaſe then cure their diſeaſes? Surely, if the ſpirit of God may worke, and doth more ordinarily worke the bad then the good, doth more vſually make ſhew to call when he intends they ſhall not come, doth more generally make blind then enlighten, make obdurate, then mollify, make dull, then teach, and wound then cure: And if God do more often intend bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good, obduration then illumination, damnation then ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of moſt whome he cals, inuites, and makes ſhew of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending their good: And if the greateſt part of the world be thus by God deluded and deceaued; then why may not, or rather ſhould not euery Proteſtant iuſtly ſuſpect the ſame of himſelfe? Why may he not rightly feare that God intends one thing by his inward will, and pretends another by his outward will? that God doth worke errour, and deceit in him, rather then truth, and verity? That he is a lying ſpirit, rather then a true in him? Surely if God hath deceaued more then he hath taught truth, darkened more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, obdurated more then he hath mollifyed, wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded more then he hath cured, and damned more then he hath ſaued; iuſtly may euery one both ſuſpect and feare, that God may do the like to him, ſith no ground, reaſon, or motiue he hath of the one rather then of the other, and no more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his ſaluation among the leſſer number, then of his damnation with the greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, it may be obſerued, that the God of theſe Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts, and preciſe Proteſtants is not the ſame with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians and preſent Catholikes, but the one doth ſo farre differ from the other;<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Proteſtant God from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke God.</note> that the one of the Caluiniſts doth, will, decree, and predeſtinate all ſinnes which are committed by men, and ſo makes man ſinne by the will, decree, and predeſtination of God; the other of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes doth will, decree, and predeſtinate only good works, and all good workes, and ſo doth make man to doe good workes according to the will of God,<note place="margin">In ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſinne.</note> and doth ſuffer him to do euill according to the man his owne will.

The one vpon his meere will, becauſe it is his pleaſure, without any demerit, or ſinne in man, did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, predeſtinate and create moſt men to damnation, and ordained and predeſtinated only ſome few to ſaluation: The other created all men to ſaluation, and had a will and deſire that all ſhould attaine to it and be ſaued, and ordained none to damnation, but vpon his foreſight of their ſinne by which they would deſerue damnation. The one did will, appoint,<note place="margin">In ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the end of ſinne</note> and decree the ſinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of all mankind, for that end only, that in puniſhing the moſt for it he might ſhew his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, &amp; in freeing other ſome few from it, he might ſhew his mercy: The other did only forſee, permit &amp; ſuffer the fal of <hi>Adam,</hi> &amp; the ſin of all his poſterity, &amp; that for the more illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. 1. Of his own goodnes, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating himſelf to man. 2. Of his power, by exalting man to be God. 3. Of his mercy, by making himſelfe a Redeemer of his enemies. 4.

               <p>I Haue at large ſhewed (and that more largely then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the fecundity of matter ſtill drawing me on) that
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:17745:156"/>
as <hi>Idolatry,</hi> of God made many Gods, and that theſe Gods ſtill begat new Gods till the number of Gods was infinit, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and abſurd; ſo <hi>Hereſy</hi> by one priuate ſpirit got ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny priuate ſpirits, &amp; ſtill euery priuate ſpirit begat a new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and doctrine, till both the ſpirits and the doctrine or opinions grew ſo many and ſo abſurd, that ſo many horrible and foule abſurdities haue iſſued from them, as neither piety, reaſon, nor common ſenſe can endure to heare them. One only obſeruation (of which I would deſire the readers pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) and that, to my iudgment, not vnworthy the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, occurs; that is, to compile and bundell vp, as into one view, certaine maine and principal opinions of theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants generally receaued (which indeed are the chief points controuerted betweene vs and them) and to propoſe to the eye of euery indifferent Reader how ſmoothly they plaine the way to the downefall of ſaluation, by taking away <hi>Fayth, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For whereas God created man for himſelfe, as his end to honour him; and all thinges for man, as meanes to help him to this end: ſo he gaue him three helpes or meanes; one,<note place="margin">Proteſtant poſitions which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Fayth, Hope, and Charity.</note> to know him; another to deſire him; and a third to attaine him. Man hath the meanes to know God by <hi>Fayth,</hi> to deſire him by <hi>Hope,</hi> and to attaine him by <hi>Charity</hi>: thoſe are three Theologicall vertues which haue God their immediate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, and are as three meanes to prepare man for his iourney to heauen. <hi>Fayth,</hi> as the beginning, <hi>Hope,</hi> as the progreſſe, <hi>Charity,</hi> as the end and conſummation of iuſtification: and as three partes of our ſpirituall building; <hi>Fayth</hi> as the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Hope</hi> as the walls; and <hi>Charity</hi> as the roofe of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Proteſtant Doctours by their poſitions, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine do oppugne, and ouerthrow all theſe three, as in a briefe ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me they are compiled, and propoſed to vs; <hi>Fayth,</hi> as it is deliuered in the <hi>Creed</hi> which in twelue articles ſhewes vs what we are to belieue. <hi>Hope,</hi> as it is contained in the <hi>Pater noster,</hi> which in ſeauen petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s directs what we are to hope, and pray for. <hi>Charity,</hi> as it is comprehended in the <hi>Decalogue,</hi> which by ten Commandements inſtructs vs what to do, &amp; what to auoid. In this, and after enſuing Sections therefore
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:17745:157"/>
we will ſhew how this doctrine doth oppugne, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all fayth in the articles of the <hi>Creed</hi>; al hope in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of the <hi>Pater noster</hi>; and all charity in the ten <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> and thereby doth prepare the way, and looſe the reines to all errour in beliefe, to all deſpaire or preſumption againſt Hope, and to all liberty of ſinnes, and looſenes of life and manners againſt Charity. And firſt we will lay downe briefly the chiefe points and poſitions of the Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and next, out of them inferre the reſt.</p>

The poſitiue bleſſings we craue are either ſpirituall or corporall; the ſpirituall are, 1. <hi>the ſanctification of Gods name</hi> in the firſt petition, that is, either true knowledge of him, or right honour to him, or conſtant perſeuerance in him. 2. The <hi>coming of his kingdome</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that is, the dilatation of his Church on earth, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his grace in our harts, &amp; the obteining of his glory in heauen. 3. <hi>The obedience to his will in earth, as it is in heauen</hi> in the third, that is, as Gods will is done by Angells, ſo it may be done by man, as it is done by the iuſt, ſo it may by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as it is wrought in the ſpirit, ſo it may be in the fleſh. The corporall bleſſings we craue, are <hi>our dayly bread</hi> in the fourth, that is, either temporall food for the body, or doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for knowledge of the vnderſtanding, or ſacramentall of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and whatſoeuer is conuenient for both ſoule &amp; body, &amp; theſe are the four firſt petitions of poſitiue bleſſings.

                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:17745:165"/>It remaines to ſhew, that the former poſitions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do: make all theſe petitions needleſſe,<note place="margin">All prayer made need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and fruitleſſe by this doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> or fruitleſſe; needleſſe, as of thinges certaine, which need to be asked; fruitleſſe, as of thinges impoſſible which cannot be obtained: which is ſhewed two wayes, firſt in generall of all prayer; ſecondly in particuler, of theſe petitions. In generall thus, 1. That prayer is needleſſe which prayes for that which is certaine &amp; cannot faile vs, as either already paſt, or aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſt, or to come; as for example, that Chriſt ſhould be borne or crucifyed which is paſt, or that I ſhould be a man, or an Engliſh man, which I am ſure I am, or that to morrow the Sunne ſhould ryſe, or that men ſhould riſe at the day of iudgment, which they are ſure to do. Againe, that prayer is fruitles which prayes for that which is impoſſible to be had, as for a mother to pray that ſhe were a Maid, and Virgin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or for that an old man to pray that he were young a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and might neuer dye, both which are impoſſible, though not both equally. But, according to the Proteſtant grounds, ſuch are generally all their prayers, for if they pray for remiſſion of ſins, for the fauour of God, for perſeuerance in Fayth, or for the glory of heauen, their prayer is as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as to pray for the birth of Chriſt paſt, or for the day of iudgment to come, becauſe euery one by his ſpeciall faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieues as certainly that his ſinnes are forgiuen him, as by his generall fayth, that Chriſt was crucified for him; as aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he ſhall perſeuer in fayth and come to heauen, as that there ſhalbe a day of iudgment and reſurrection of his body; therefore prayer for the one is as needleſſe as for the other. Againe, if they pray for Gods grace to waſh them from ſin, to keep Gods commandements, to auoid concupiſcence and luſt, and to loue God aboue all, and not to offend him, their prayer is as fruitleſſe, as to pray for Gods grace to keep them euer being ſicke or euer dying, or to leape ouer the ſea, or fly to the ſtarres, becauſe according to them, the one is as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible as the other, therefore as hopeleſſe to be obtained by prayer as the other. 2. To pray for the preuenting of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil, whether it be <hi>malum culpae,</hi> as ſinne, or <hi>malum poenae,</hi> as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and whether it be puniſhment temporall as loſſe
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17745:165"/>
of goods, affliction of body, or death of friends; or ſpirituall as loſſe of fayth, of Gods fauour, and of the ioyes of heauen, or to pray for the obtayning of any good either temporal, as riches, health, or the life of friends; or ſpirituall, as the good of Gods Church, the remiſſion of our ſinnes, and our perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in ſtate of grace, or obtaining the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is both needleſſe and fruitleſſe, becauſe all as well euill as good ſhall infallibly fall out as God hath, according to his owne irreſpectiue, immutable, &amp; ineuitable will &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, decreed and appointed it; therefore needleſſe it is to pray for the obtaining of good, and fruitleſſe to pray for the preuenting of euill, becauſe both muſt fall certainly as God hath ordained &amp; decreed. What end or vſe therfore is there of prayer, ſince the euent and the effect will be the ſame as well without prayer as with prayer, all as God, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpect or foreſeene conſideration of vs, or our deſerts, or prayers, or other works, hath according to his owne abſolute will decreed and appointed to happen to vs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, willingly to do any act which is belieued and ſuppoſed to be a ſinne,<note place="margin">All prayers are ſinnes.</note> and that mortall deſeruing eternall damnation is vnlawfull, ſinnefull, and damnable, and ſo not to be done with a good conſcience: but ſuch is all prayer, euen the beſt and deuouteſt we can vſe, according to their principles, becauſe euery worke, euen the good workes of the beſt perſons, according to <hi>Luther, Illyricus, Caluin, Beza, Paraeus, VVhitaker, Tindall,</hi> and others, are ſinnes,<note place="margin">See aboue in the first ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiſion.</note> mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnes, damnable ſinnes, and nothing but ſinne, euen in the iuſt and elect, though no more imputed to them, then their bad workes of adultery, murder &amp;c. which they ſay are not at al imputed to them. Therefore all prayer, how good or deuout ſoeuer, is a ſinne, and that mortall and damnable, &amp; ſo is vnlawfull, ſinnefull, and damnable, and not to be vſed more then ſwearing, lying, drinking, both being ſinnes and neither imputed &amp; puniſhed as ſinnes in the elect, in whome they are couered, and both imputed and puniſhed as ſinne in the reprobate in whome they are neuer forgiuen. All which is confirmed diuers wayes by the expreſſe wordes, firſt of <hi>Luther,</hi> who affirmes, 1. <hi>That no man obtaines any thing

                     <note place="margin">The Pater noſter oppu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gned by the Proteſtant doctrine.</note> how can they call or eſteeme him a louing Father, whome they belieue to be a cruell and vniuſt iudge, who decreed and created them to ſinne, that, for that he might damne them? Or what confidence can they haue in the mercy of this Father, who is thus rigorous to them in his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and more then iuſtice? How can they call or eſteeme themſelues his children by adoption from whome they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:17745:166"/>
no inward grace of iuſtification? How can they call him <hi>our Father,</hi> or the Father of all, whome they belieue as a Father to haue predeſtinated, called, and giuen meanes only to a few, and as a cruell Iudge to haue excluded all the reſt, and the greateſt part (of which euery one may iuſtly feare himſelfe to be one) from any poſſibility of vocation, grace, or ſaluation? How can they expect from him a crowne of glory in heauen, of whome they belieue they cannot merit any reward in earth? Why ſhould they not feare a heauy hand of iuſtice, yea deſpaire of any kind of mercy from him, who beyond iuſtice, hath proceeded ſo terribly as to prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſo many to ſo great paines as are the paines of hell, who had deſerued or giuen no cauſe of any paines at all? Who can imagine that God dwelleth in the iuſt and elect as in the heauens, who are ſo fowly ſtayned in euery part of their ſoule with the deformity of all ſinne and iniquity, that no one part, or action of them is cleare and vnſtained from ſinne? Surely they who belieue this of God, and his cruelty, and of man and his deformity cannot confidently ſay neither <hi>Our Father</hi> which imports Gods mercy to man, &amp; mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, or <hi>VVhich art in heauen</hi>

Surely to pray that by actions which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, we may ſanctify Gods name; that by workes which are offences to God, we may pleaſe God; that by deedes which are damnable and deſerue hell, we may prayſe God, and deſerue heauen; is a prayer not only ſo hopleſſe, as it is not poſſible, but alſo ſenſleſſe, that no reaſonable man can be imagined to make it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, how can they wih confidence ſay, <hi>Thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">The ſecond petition.</note> that Chriſt may raigne as a King either in his Church by fayth, or in the faythfull by grace, or in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="318" facs="tcp:17745:167"/>

Surely weake is that King, &amp; poore is that Kingdome, where neither the King hath power to protect his ſubiects from the inuaſion of the enemy, nor the ſubiect hath ability to performe any action which may tend to the honour and ſeruice of the King. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine what needes any man to pray that either Chriſt may raigne in him by grace preſent, or that he may raigne with Chriſt in glory to come, who is certaine and ſure by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fayth (as all Proteſtants ſay they are) that both he is for the preſent in ſtate of Gods fauour, and alſo ſhalbe for the future in ſtate of glory in heauen?

Of the former ſorts are all faythfull Chriſtians who hauing vnderſtanding ſufficient and a pious intention, do with humility beginne, and according to the rule of fayth proceed in ſeeking out the right ſenſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſo none, who are thus able, and thus proceed, are barred from either reading, or expounding to their own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the Holy Scripture, as our aduerſaries do falſely calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate vs. Of the later ſort, are the Paſtours and Prelates of the Church, who hauing lawfull ordination and ſucceſſion,<note place="margin">In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who haue autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> and continuing in vnity and ſubordination, do either deliuer the ſenſe of Scripture, as it is taught by holy Church, or els confirme and explicate any doctrine of fayth when they are collected in a generall Councell.

The Proteſtants doe giue not only liberty, but alſo authority to all, not only Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours and Prelates, but alſo Artificers and common people, as well vnlearned as learned, to frame to themſelues ſuch a firme aſſent to this or that (ſeeming to them infallibly true) ſenſe of holy Scripture (euery one according to his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudicate conceit or priuate ſpirit) that thereupon they dare aduenture the certainty of their Fayth, and the hope of their ſaluation.</p>

                  <pb n="377" facs="tcp:17745:196"/>Thirdly, the Spirit of a Catholike will not preſume to expound any text of ſcripture contrary to that ſenſe which either the rule of fayth, or the practiſe of the Church,<note place="margin">In the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by which it is expounded.</note> or the decree of a Councell, or the conſent of Fathers hath recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as true and authenticall, but in al will receaue &amp; follow that which is determined and decreed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

This tryall and iudgment is to be made, not of queſtions &amp; doctrine already decided and determined by the authority of the Church, but of ſuch as are yet doubtfull and vndecided. For that which is once determined by the generall conſent of the Church or Councell, is not againe to be examined and iudged by any priuate mans ſpirit; for ſo the Decrees of Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

nothing for this priuate ſpirit, which will both try what is before by any Councell iudged, and will by euery ſimple &amp; vnlearned perſon try, and iudge it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, to that of 1. Cor. 2.15. <hi>The ſpirituall man iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth all thinges, and himſelfe is iudged of none</hi>: It is anſwered, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> to confound the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who ſtanding vpon their humane &amp; worldly wiſedome,<note place="margin">How ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall men iudge of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things</note> contemned his vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned manner of inſtruction, affirmes that they being men ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall can iudge only of ſenſuall thinges: but he being ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and perfect in diuine wiſedome can iudge both of things ſenſuall and ſpirituall; and ſo a ſpirituall man iudges of all thinges in generall, that is, both of ſpirituall thinges which are diuine and myſticall, and alſo of humane thinges which are terrene and ſenſuall; but a ſenſuall man iudges only of temporall thinges of the world, and not of ſpirituall which are of God. The reaſon therfore is <hi>de generibus ſingulorum,</hi> that a ſpirituall man iudges of all ſortes of thinges both diuine &amp; humane, but not <hi>de ſingulis generunt,</hi> that he can iudge in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler of all kindes or ſpirituall thinges, as when a man is ſayd to eat of all thinges, it is meant that he eates of all kinds of meat, both fleſh and fiſh, not of euery particuler peece of both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Euery ſpirituall man doth iudge ſpirituall thinges, but according to ſuch rules and directions as euery thing is to be iudged, that is, thinges manifeſt and certaine he iudges according as they are iudged already and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, thinges vncertaine and obſcure, according to the rule of Fayth, and the authority and teſtimony of Councels, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Tradition, and Church, as before is explicated; not according to his owne ſelfe-ſeeming ſpirit and conceit, in which his ſpirit is ſtill ſubordinate to the ſpirit of Gods Church, and directed by it.</p>

And therefore though ſpirituall men iudge all things ſpirituall and temporall, yet euery ſpirituall man doth not infallibly iudge and diſcerne euery ſpirituall thing, no more then euery faculty of the ſoule as ſenſitiue, vegitatiue or rationall, doth performe all and euery function of feeling growing, and reaſoning; but euery one his proper function. And as the function of the eye is only to ſee, and of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds to worke, and the feet to walke, ſo they who will giue the function of ſeeing and iudging of the ſenſe of ſcripture and miſteries of faith to euery perſon in the body of the Church, do as much as if one ſhould attribut the function of ſeeing to the handes and feet: for as in a body naturall, ſo in the body myſticall, (which is <hi>S. Pauls</hi> compariſon) ſome are principal members, ſome inferiour, ſo euery one hath his proper fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Church, as the biſhops are eyes to diſcerne truth, the princes are armes to defend the body, and the people are the reſt of the parts of the body to be directed. The function therfore of one is not to be attributed to another, but euery
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:17745:202"/>
one in his place and degree is to exerciſe his owne function in his proper office and worke. By which is apparent, that thoſe and ſuch like places of ſcripture do make nothing for the authority and power of this priuate ſpirit in euery one to diſcerne and iudge of all places of ſcripture and miſteries of faith; except the Proteſtants, as they attribut to euery ſpirit power to do euery thing, ſo they will out of euery place of ſcripture inferre any thing, &amp; ſo <hi>ex quolibet</hi> proue <hi>quodlibet,</hi> as their ſpirit doth direct and teach them.

Which anſwere doth not only cleare the Scripture for hauing any priuate ſpirit as Iudge ouer it: but alſo declares how the Church is built vpon the doctrine of the Apoſtles, or Prophets (taking the Prophets, eyther for the writings of the Prophets in the old Teſtament, or for the Interpreters of the Apoſtles writing in the new) and alſo how the Church in the ſenſe before declared, is the ground of the Apoſtolical and propheticall doctrine reuealed to the Church, and the firſt Paſtours of it, and by them left to vs, who receaue it from them, and their authority, and ſo from the Church. 5.
