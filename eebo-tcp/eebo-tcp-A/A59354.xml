         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN this Dedication to the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Sr. <hi>John Houblon,</hi> One of the
<hi>Lordſ</hi> of the ADMIRALTY,
Governour of the <hi>Royal</hi> BANK of
<hi>England,</hi> and now the great <hi>Lieutenant Royal</hi>
of this <hi>Metropolitan City;</hi> methinks, I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd
into ſo ſpacious a Field, with ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
attracting Proſpects before me, as even di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
my Veneration. The Homage is on all
<pb facs="tcp:110697:3"/>
Sides ſo equally Due, that I know not Where
to Kneel firſt. For Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> by an
<hi>Accumulation</hi> of <hi>Glories,</hi> has, perhaps, ſo far
out-run the Common Race of <hi>Honour;</hi> that
in Your Acceſſion to the <hi>CHAIR,</hi> as
conſiderable a Triumph as it gives you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of being Your Higheſt <hi>Aſcendant</hi> of
<hi>Renown,</hi> is only an <hi>Addition</hi> to Your more
ample Pile of <hi>Trophies;</hi> whilſt You have ſo
far out-ſtript the <hi>Candidateſ</hi> of <hi>Dignity</hi> before
You, that You <hi>bring</hi> the <hi>Right Honourable</hi>
to Your <hi>Praetorian Seate,</hi> not come to <hi>find</hi> it
there.</p>
            <p>Not that this publick Addreſs, I now make
Your <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> is intended for any Piece, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Panegyrick,</hi> or <hi>Herauldry,</hi> to Illuſtrate
or Blazon the High Promotions to which
Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> has ſo eminently Arrived: No,
my <hi>Lord,</hi> I have a fairer Theme, a Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
above them. For 'tis not <hi>Preferment,
Titles,</hi> or <hi>State:</hi> 'Tis the <hi>Virtue,</hi> the <hi>Merit,
Principle</hi> and <hi>Integrity,</hi> that both mount and
<pb facs="tcp:110697:3"/>
fill the Seats of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Truſt,</hi> are the <hi>embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed
Maſs;</hi> when the others are but the meer
<hi>Drapery</hi> of HONOUR.</p>
            <p>'Tis in this laſt Capacity, (not the <hi>Pomp</hi> and
<hi>Splendour</hi> of Advancement,) but Your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipſ</hi>
Double Qualifications of <hi>Fidelity</hi> and
<hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>Execute</hi> in thoſe Exalted Poſts, that
render You the Subject of an Univerſal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
And though my preſent Addreſs is
chiefly to Congratulate Your <hi>Lordſhip's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration</hi>
into this <hi>Auguſt Magiſtracy,</hi> in which
both the Pride and Gratitude of the <hi>Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Company</hi> of GROCERS make their
profoundeſt Tenders of Reſpect to ſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
a Member and Ornament to their
<hi>Society:</hi> Yet all this is but an inconſiderable
Tribute, compared to what the World has
yet to Pay You; For, Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> has
taken Care for a more laſting <hi>Triumph;</hi> ſo
vaſt is the Difference betwixt Glittering for a
Day, and Shining for a Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:110697:4"/>
I ſhould dwell longer upon this inviting
Theme, were I not not ſenſible that, to all
Your other Accompliſhments, Your <hi>Lordſhip</hi>
has that innate <hi>Modeſty,</hi> that You rather ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

<hi>VIRTUE</hi> ſpring up apace amongſt You, when you

            <p>Your <hi>Griffonſ</hi> are truly a Bird of Wing, when they

Your whole <hi>Renown:</hi> And whilſt You ſtand

(Worth is known by the Company it Keepſ.)
Was a Celebrated True Adage of Old, which you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
have amply Veryfied: For it is ſufficient for
the truly Honourable <hi>G R O C E R S,</hi> to their Nobleſt
Reputation, to tell the World, that the Darling of

And the particular Inclination of the <hi>Albion CAESAR</hi>

is an ample Demonſtration, that His Encouragement
