            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the Beginning of this Chapter we find St. <hi>Paul</hi> brought to his Tryal before <hi>Felix</hi> the <hi>Roman Governour,</hi> wherein (if we only except the unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Judge) all other things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100318:5"/>
which could make such an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on considerable, <hi>viz.</hi> the greatness of the <hi>cause,</hi> the quality of the <hi>persons,</hi> and the <hi>skill</hi> which was shewed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of it. The cause was not common and ordinary, such as were wont to be tryed before the <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces,</hi> but of an unusual and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick nature;<note place="margin">Act 18.15.</note> not <hi>a question of words and names,</hi> as <hi>Gallio</hi> thought it, but a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the highest importance to the World: which being managed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> with that zeal and industry, which was agreeable to it, gave occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his malicious Countreymen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him before the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, as one guilty of Faction and Sedition. Under this colour, they hoped easily to gain the <hi>Governour's</hi> good will to their design; being a person that more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded the quiet of his <hi>Province,</hi> than all the concernments of Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But that this design might be carried on with the greater pomp and shew of Justice and Piety, they do not commit the care of it to the rage of the People, or some furious Zealots; but the <hi>High Priest</hi> and some members of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> go down on purpose from <hi>Hierusalem</hi> to <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 1.</note> and carry with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100318:5"/>
them one of their most eloquent <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates</hi> called <hi>Tertullus</hi> to manage the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation against <hi>Paul.</hi> Who was no sooner called forth, but the Orator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to shew his art, by a flattering insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, which is most apt to prevail with men of mean and corrupt minds; <hi>Seeing that by thee,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Ver. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this Nation by thy providence; we accept it always and in all places, most noble</hi> Felix, <hi>with all thankfulness:</hi> Having thus prepared his Judge, he presently falls upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Ver. 5, 6.</note> and charges St. <hi>Paul</hi> with being a pestilent and seditious person, a distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Nation in all parts, a propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Temple; but the main point of all, and in which the rest were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, was, that <hi>he was a ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the Sect of the Nazarenes.</hi> (So the Christians were then called among the Jews, from our Saviour's abode in the Town of <hi>Nazareth.</hi>) But although the Writer of this History gives us only the short heads of his accusation; yet we may easily suppose by St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that he insisted more largely on this, than on any of the rest: represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Felix,</hi>
               <q>That when the Jewish
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100318:6"/>
Church had been at first established by God himself under Laws of his own making, when he had so settled the several orders and degrees of men among them,<note place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100318:6"/>
his death carried on the same design, pretending that <hi>the time of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was come;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9 10.</note> and accordingly have formed themselves into a Sect, v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And among all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of this <hi>new Sect,</hi> there is none more factious and busie than this <hi>Paul</hi> whom <hi>we</hi> here accuse; and <hi>whom some of our Nation found in the Temple prophaning of it,</hi> and there we would presently, out of meer zeal to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have taken and destroyed; but he was violently rescued out of our hands, and sent hither to be tryed; and these things, which I have spoken,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100318:7"/>
is the sense of all those who are come down as witnesses;</q> for so we read, v. 9.
<hi>And the Jews also assented, and said, that these things were so.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> being thus accused, and having leave given him to answer for himself, was so far from being daunted by the greatness of his enemies,<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> or the vehemency of their accusation, that he tells the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, that he did <hi>with all chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> undertake his defence: and there being two parts of his accusation, 1. His tumultuous and profane carriage in the Temple; this he utterly denies, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>. and plainly tells them, they can never prove it against him. 2. But as to the other and main part of the Charge, his being a <hi>ringleader of the Sect of the Nazarenes</hi>; although he would not, out of his great modesty, take upon himself to be one of the Heads or Chiefs among them, yet as to the owning of that way, notwithstanding all the imputations they had cast upon it, he doth it with the greatest freedom and courage in the presence of his Judge and Accusers; and not only so, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends himself therein, that he had done nothing contrary to the Laws of God, or the most ancient Religion of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100318:7"/>
Countrey: all which particulars are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the words of the Text; <hi>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call heresie, so worship I the God of my Fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi>

            <p>Wherein we have these three things considerable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Imputation which Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty suffered under in its first appearance: <hi>After the way, which they call heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Way taken by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this false Imputation; <hi>viz.</hi> by appeal to Scripture and Antiquity; <hi>So worship I the God of my Fathers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all things that are written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Courage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in so freely owning his Religion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of his greatest enemies, and when they were in hopes to destroy him for it: <hi>This I confess unto thee, that after the way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with the false Imputation which Christianity suffered under at its first appearance; <hi>After the way, which is called heresie</hi>; the same Word which is translated <hi>Sect, v.</hi> 5. and although the Word be indifferent in it self, yet where
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100318:8"/>
it is taken for a combination of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against an established Religion and lawful Authority (as it was by the Jews when they charged the Christians under this name) then it implies in it a twofold accusation: 1. Of Novelty and Singularity. 2. Of Faction and Sedition.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Novelty. A Sect or Heresie in this sence implies in it, mens setting up with a new Doctrine which was not heard of before; and making that the Foundation of a new Society separate and distinct from the established Church, and consequently they must charge the Church they are divided from with er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and corruptions, or they make themselves guilty of Schism, <hi>i. e.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary separation. Now upon these two grounds the Jews laid the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>New Sect</hi> upon the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> or <hi>Christians,</hi> 1. Because they could not shew a visible succession in all Ages: 2. Because they could not prove the Jewish Church to be guilty of such er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and corruptions as to need a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They could not shew a Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Ages of such persons who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in all things with them.
<q>For
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100318:8"/>
where (say they) were the men to be found in former Ages, that taxed the Jewish Church with such errors and corruptions as <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> did? that bid men <hi>beware of the leven of the Scribes and Pharisees, i. e.</hi> of the most learned and holy men? Had not God always a Visible Church among them? they could produce the names of their High Priests in every Age, and shew them all the marks of a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church? For <hi>in</hi> Judah <hi>was God known,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 76.1. Deut. 12 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and his Name was great in</hi> Israel. <hi>Hath not God said, that in his House at</hi> Hierusalem <hi>he would put his Name for ever;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 21.7. 2 Chron. 7.16.</note> 
                  <hi>and his eyes and his heart should be there perpetually</hi>? How is it then possible but there must be a constant and visible Succession in all Ages? since God would always have a people to dwell among; and that might be known to be his people by the outward marks and signs of a true Church. But if the Christians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences held good, God must for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages have wanted a Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them. For none of those things which they charged the Jews with, were newly crept in among them, but had been delivered down
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100318:9"/>
to them by the Tradition of their Fore-fathers, in an uninterrupted man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as they thought, from the very time of <hi>Moses.</hi> This was their Rule whereby they guided themselves in their actions of Religion, and in the sense of obscure places of the Law and the Prophets; and in that time after the cessation of Prophecy, when the Christians supposed these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to have come in among them, they could draw down a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Succession from <hi>the men of the great Synagogue,</hi> of persons eminent for Learning and Piety that never charged them with any such corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> and his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples did. Would God ever suffer such dangerous errors, hypocrisie, and superstitions to prevail in his own Church, and raise up no Persons to discover these things, till these new Teachers and Reformers arose? Were not <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai</hi> that so accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately discussed all the niceties of the Law, able to find out such gross and open corruptions, if any such had been among us? Might not we say, <hi>that not only the Teachers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>V. Bell. de not. Eccles. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. Â§. <hi>praeterea.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had slept all that time,</hi> if he raised
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100318:9"/>
up no one Person to discover the coming in of such errors and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Where had God then any true Church in the world, if not among his people of the Jews? And would he suffer that to be overspread with such a Leprosie, and send none of his Priests to discover it? And even by the confession of the Christians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they were once the beloved and chosen people of God, how or when was it that they ceased to be so? Do not themselves acknowledge, that they receive the Law and the Prophets from our hands?<note place="margin">Rom. 3.2.</note> And that <hi>to us were committed the Oracles of God, and to us pertained the adoption,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9.4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of God and the promises, and that ours are the Fathers?</hi> How is it then possible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all these privileges, to suppose this Church to fall into such a degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, as at last to be cast off by God, and a new Church to arise out of the ashes of it?</q>
Thus we may reasonably suppose the Jews to have argued for themselves; and on the other side, they trampled upon and despised this new Sect of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi>
               <q>That had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100318:10"/>
of the Pomp and Splendour of their Church: they had only a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of mean and illiterate persons at first to joyn with them; the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Master were a sort of poor Fishermen and inconsiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, men of no Authority, or repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for extraordinary Sanctity or Learning: even their Master himself was one of no great severity of life, that did not retire from the world, and lead an abstracted life, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with Publicans and Sinners, and put not his Disciples upon Fasting and long Prayers; whereas the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees were men of great austerity and mortification, much exercised in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, making frequent and long prayers, at certain hours; and in whatever place those hours took them. Now how is it possible to believe, that such devout persons as these are mistaken, and the Sect of the <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes</hi> only in the right? But besides all this, Where was their Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth?</hi> We offer to produce a personal succession on our side, that joyned in constant commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with us at the Temple at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>; let the Christians shew any
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100318:10"/>
number of men before themselves, that joyned with them in believing what they do, and rejecting the abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which they tax among us. If they cannot do this, let them then suffer under the just imputation of Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2.
<q>But supposing they do not think it necessary to assign a number of men distinct from our Society, but say <hi>it is enough that though they joyned with them in the worship of God, yet they did not in their corruptions:</hi> yet to vindicate themselves, they must shew how it was possible for such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions to come in, and no more notice be taken of them: Such things could not be introduced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some notable alteration; and in such a one, the author, the time, the place, the manner may be assigned: We can tell, say they, all these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the Idolatries of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Manasseh</hi>; if so great alterations have happened in the state of our Church, that there is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of reforming it; name us the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the time, the place, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how all these corruptions came in. When came men first to forsake
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100318:11"/>
the letter of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and adhere to <hi>Tradition</hi>? Who first brought in the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Superstitions? What was his name, where was his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, who first opposed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him? Were all men asleep then to suffer such alterations, and to say nothing at all against them? What, could one Generation conspire to deceive the next? and if not, how could such changes happen in matters of Religion, and no one take care to discover it and prevent the infecting of posterity by it? Had no persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regard to God and the purity of Religion then? If they had, would they suffer strange fire to come upon God's Altar, and take no notice at all of it? Why did not <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> when he so frequently and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declaimed against the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> hypocrisie and superstitions, and false Doctrines, shew to the people, when, and where, and how these things came into the Church of God? He on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemns them, and speaks sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against them, but he saith not one word to satisfie the <hi>Scientifical</hi> men among them, how it was possible for corruptions to come in, and prevail
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100318:11"/>
to such a degree, and yet no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of time or place be assignable of it.</q>
Thus the Jews still believed themselves to be the only <hi>true, ancient, visible, Catholick</hi> and <hi>infallible Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and despised the poor <hi>Christians,</hi> as a novel and upstart <hi>Sect</hi> of <hi>Nazarenes</hi>; which is the first imputation the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians suffered under.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They suffered under the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi>; which is the second thing implyed in the name of <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Heresie</hi> here mentioned; and that they charged upon them two ways. 1. For not submitting to the Churches Authority. 2. For disturbing the peace and quiet of the People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For <hi>not submitting to the Churches Authority:</hi> not, that the Disciples of our Lord did out of humour, or fancy, or only to make a party, break with the Jews in matters meerly of order and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency: no, on the contrary we find them extreamly cautious of giving any offence in such matters, which temper they learnt of their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> who complyed with many things, that others might not take advantage by his omission of them, to slight and contemn them;<note place="margin">Mat. 3.15.</note> thus when others were baptized
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100318:12"/>
of <hi>John,</hi> he would be so too; not, that he had any need of washing away of sin: but he would not make use of a particular privilege to bring any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance upon a general duty. Thus we see, he went up at the solemn <hi>Feasts</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> as others did; and not only was present in the <hi>Temple,</hi> but vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by a Miracle the order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, by <hi>driving out the buyers and sellers</hi> from the outward parts of it, although they had a fair pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready at hand to serve the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of such as were to sacrifice to God in the Temple;<note place="margin">Mat. 21.12.</note> nay, St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>that he would not suffer any vessel to be carried through the Temple:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar. 11.16.</note> and this he did not upon any reason peculiar to the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> but because it was <hi>a House of Prayer.</hi> And this example his Apostles followed, who after they had the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> poured upon them, yet they attended the Temple at the hours of prayer.<note place="margin">Acts 3.1.</note> But most remarkable to this purpose, is the instance of St. <hi>Paul</hi> at that very time when he was seized upon, and like to be destroyed by the fury of the Jews. For understanding at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> from St. <hi>James,</hi>

               <hi>that there were many thousands of believing Jews
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100318:12"/>
that were still zealous of the Law,</hi> and were informed that St. <hi>Paul</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles</hi> slighted <hi>Circumcision and the Levitical Customs</hi>; he, to give them all reasonable satisfaction that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make no unnecessary breach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them about indifferent matters, submits himself to a legal purification in the Temple for seven days together;<note place="margin">Ver. 7</note> before the end of which, the Jews made a tumult and seized upon him, and so he was brought to answer the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against him in this Chapter. Thus carefull St. <hi>Paul</hi> was to give no ground for suspicion that he delighted in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and separations; this example he did leave to all prudent Christians, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to submit to things which they have no great value for (as no doubt at this time St. <hi>Paul</hi> had very little for the <hi>Levitical Customs</hi>) than to hazard the breaking the peace of the Church for such matters. But notwithstanding all this care of the first Christians, they could not avoid the imputation of <hi>Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; because they would not entirely submit their judgments to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Jewish Church. For this was the great pretence they stood upon, that they were the <hi>Governours</hi> of the Church
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100318:13"/>
by <hi>God's own institution,</hi> that they were to explain and interpret <hi>the Law and the Prophets</hi>; and this was expressed in the beginning of their Law, <hi>That in all cases of difficulty they were to go up to the place which the Lord their God should chuse;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17.8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and to go to the Priests, and the Levites, and to the Judge, and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment. And thou shalt do according to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which they of that place (which the Lord shall chuse) shall shew thee, and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee; and the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken to the Priest, (that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God) or unto the Judge, even that man shall die, and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.</hi> Upon this place, they might certainly much better establish the infallibility of their own Church, than others draw an argument for Infallibility in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church from it. However, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience would serve their turn, to charge the Christians with <hi>Faction,</hi> in not submitting to their Authority.
<q>For, was not this a matter of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether the Messias were to be a temporal Prince or not? concerning
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100318:13"/>
what time, and place, and person the Prophecies were to be understood? Who were the competent Judges in this case, but those whom God had established by his Law? If the Scribes and Pharisees were charged with false glosses, and corrupting the Law by their Traditions, the Christians were not to take upon themselves to judge of them; but to appeal to the High Priest and the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> who were the only lawfull Judges in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: Their duty was submission and patience; but by no means ought they upon their own Authority to begin a new Church, and to broach new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines directly contrary to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the High Priest and <hi>Sanhedrin</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> yea, after they had pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and condemned him to death; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated his followers, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as many as they could get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their power; what could it (in their opinion) be but the Spirit of Faction and Disobedience thus to oppose the Authority of their Church, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving contrary to its decrees, and reforming without any power deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from it?</q>
We see in our Saviour's
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100318:14"/>
time how severely they check'd any of the people who spake favourably of Christ and his Doctrine; as though the poor ignorant people were fit to judge of these matters! to understand Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, and to know the true Messias, when he should appear! And therefore when some of their Officers that had been sent to apprehend him, came back with admiration of him, and said, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man spake like this man</hi>; they take them up short and tell them, <hi>They must believe as the Church believes</hi>; what, they take upon them to judge of such matters! No, they must submit to their Governours.<note place="margin">Joh. 7.46, 47, 48, 49.</note> 
               <hi>Have any of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, or Pharisees believed on him? but this people which know not the Law are cursed.</hi> i. e. When they set up their own judgment in opposition to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Church. And after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's death at a solemn Council at <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erusalem,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were summoned before them; the first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion they ask'd was, <hi>By what power, or by what name have ye done this?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 4.7.</note> They never enquired, whether the Miracle were wrought or no, or whether their Doctrine were true; all their Question was about their Mission, whether it were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100318:14"/>
ordinary or extraordinary; or what authority they could pretend to, that were not sent by themselves; but let the things be never so true, which they said, if they could find any flaw in their Mission according to their own Rules and Laws, this they thought sufficient ground to forbid them to preach any more, and to charge them with Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if they disobeyed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They charged the Christians with <hi>Faction</hi> in being <hi>so active and busie</hi> to promote Christianity to the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of the Jews in all parts. This <hi>Tertullus</hi> accused St. <hi>Paul</hi> of,<note place="margin">Ver 5.</note> 
               <hi>that he was a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world;</hi> and accordingly the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Thessalonica</hi> take the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans by force and carry them to the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of the City, crying,<note place="margin">Acts 17.6.</note> 
               <hi>Those that have turned the world upside down are come hither also.</hi> This they knew was the most effectual course to render them odious to all Governours, who are apt to suspect all new things as dangerous, and think no truth can compensate the hazard of alterations. Thus it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially among the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours, who had learnt from the counsel given to <hi>Augustus,</hi> to be particularly jealous
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100318:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of all innovations in Religion; and had much rather the people should continue quiet under an old error, than have the peace disturbed for the greatest Truth. This was really the greatest difficulty in the way of Christianity; it came no where, but people were possessed before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with quite other apprehensions of Religion, than the Christians brought among them. The Jewish and Pagan Religions were in possession in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the people were at ease in the practice of them. What then must the Christians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o? Must they let them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>one and not endeavour to convince them of the truth of their own Doctrine? If so, they are unfaithfull to their trust, betrayers of truth, and false to the Souls of men: if they go about to perswade men out of their Religion, they know, such is the fondness most men have for their own opinions, especially in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that where they might hope to convince <hi>one,</hi> they might be sure to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>many</hi>; especially of those whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest lay in upholding the old Religion. How little doth Reason signifie with most men, where Interest is against it! Truth and Falshood are odd kind of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical things to them, which they do
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100318:15"/>
not care to trouble their heads with; but what makes for or against their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, is thought easie and substantial. All other matters are, as <hi>Gallio</hi> said, <hi>questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of names and words,</hi> which they care not for; but no men will sooner offer to demonstrate a thing to be false, than they who know it to be against their interest to believe it to be true. This was the case of these great men of the Jews that came down to accuse <hi>Paul;</hi> they easily saw whither this new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion tended, and if it prevailed among their people, farewell then to all the <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Splendor</hi> of the <hi>High-Priesthood</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem</hi>; farewell then to the <hi>Glory</hi> of the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>City</hi> whither all the Tribes came up to worship thrice a year; farewell then to all the riches, and ease, and pleasure which they enjoyed: And what was the greatest Truth and best Religion in the World to them, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with these? These were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reasons to them to accuse Truth it self of deceiving men, and the most peaceable Doctrine of laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faction and Sedition. Thus we have consider'd the false imputations which were cast upon Christianity at first, implyed in these words, <hi>After
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100318:16"/>
the way which is called Heresie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I now come to the way taken by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to remove these false imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he doth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By an appeal to Scripture, as the ground and rule of his faith, <hi>Believing all things which are written in the law and the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By an appeal to the best and purest Antiquity, as to the object of Worship; <hi>So worship I the God of my Fathers,</hi> not bringing in any new Religion, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing it to its primitive purity.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By an appeal to Scripture as the ground and rule of his faith.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> pleaded <hi>Possession, Tradition, Authority</hi> of the <hi>present Church</hi>: against all these, St. <hi>Paul</hi> fixes upon a certain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Foundation, <hi>the Law and the Prophets.</hi> He doth not here insist upon any particular revelation made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but offers the whole matter in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to be tryed by a common Rule that was allowed on both sides. And his meaning is, if they could prove that he either asserted, or did any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>the Law and the Prophets,</hi> then they had some reason to accuse him of innovation, or beginning of a <hi>new Sect</hi>; but if the foundation of his doctrine

and practice lay in what themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be from God, then they had no cause to charge him with intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a <hi>new Sect</hi> among them.</p>
            <p>But the great Question here is,
<q>What ground St. <hi>Paul</hi> had to decline the <hi>Authority of the present Church?</hi> Since God himself had appointed the Priests to be the Interpreters of the Law; and therefore in doubtfull ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses resort was to be made to them; and not the judgment left to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons about the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</q>
And yet in this case it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent St. <hi>Paul</hi> declined all Authority of the present Church; for at that very time the <hi>High-Priests and Elders</hi> came down to accuse him, and he takes not the least notice of their judgment in this matter. I shall therefore now shew that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had very great reason so to do, and to appeal only to <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Because the Authority of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church was more liable to error and mistake, than the Rule of Scripture was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because it was liable to more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, than that was.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because it was more liable to <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and mistake,</hi> than the Rule of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100318:17"/>
was. It was agreed on both sides, that the Law was from God, and that <hi>the Prophets spake by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost</hi>; all that was now left was only to find out the true meaning of them, and to compare Prophecies with events. As in the case of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> if the circumstances foretold by the <hi>Prophets</hi> had their exact accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Christ, as might appear to those who carefully compared them; <hi>If he were born at</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>of the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>when the Scepter was departed from it, and during the second Temple,</hi> and all other circumstances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing; then though the ordinary judgment concerning <hi>true Prophets</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> yet it was far more reasonable to believe that they were mistaken, than that all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies should be accomplished in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that was not the true <hi>Messias.</hi> For those Prophecies were not intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Rulers,</hi> but for directions to the People, that they might be able to judge of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of them: otherwise when the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned our <hi>Saviour,</hi> the People could have no reason to believe him to be
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100318:17"/>
the <hi>Messias</hi>; if they were bound in the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> to submit their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wholly to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hurches Authority. It is plain then, that the sense of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture may be so evident to private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, that they are not to submit in it to the <hi>present Authority of a Church.</hi> For notwithstanding all the promises made to the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> and the command of submitting to the sentence of their <hi>Priests and Rulers,</hi> in a matter of the highest concernment, <hi>viz.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true <hi>Messias,</hi> men were bound to believe directly contrary to the present Authority in the Church. For the people were bound to believe <hi>Christ</hi> to be the <hi>true Messias</hi>; although the <hi>High Priests and Elders</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him for a <hi>deceiver and malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor.</hi> But besides this particular case, there may be several others wherein men may lawfully reject <hi>the authority of the present Church</hi>; and those are, when that Authority shall go about to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw those things which must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed antecedent to the belief of any such Authority: as, 1. The common sense of mankind. 2. The force of a divine Law. 3. The liberty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning truth and falshood. All
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100318:18"/>
these must necessarily be supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Authority of a Church; but if any Church goes about to overthrow these, it thereby forfeits its own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If it requires things contrary to common sense; as in that instance wherein some of the <hi>Jewish Rabbies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired submission to their Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> in believing the right hand to be the left, or the left to be the right, if they determined so; or supposing the Jews to have required the people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they ever saw any Miracle wrought by Christ; or in the Miracle of the Loaves, that what they saw and handled, and tasted, to be bread was true bread; or to say, that the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual body might be in a thousand places at once, or that things whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is to be in another, can subsist without their proper subject; what Church soever requires such things as these from its members to be believed, gives them just reason to reject its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it requires things contrary to the force and reason of a divine Law: as the Jews themselves would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, if any Authority among
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100318:18"/>
them had gone about either to have left out the second Commandment, or made it lawfull to give Religious worship to Images, under any distinctions whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: or if the Priests had taken away from the people their share in the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, under pretence of the <hi>unsanctified teeth,</hi> or the <hi>long beards</hi> of the Laity, which were not fit to touch what had been offered in sacrifice to God. But we need not put cases among them, for our Saviour therefore bids men <hi>have a care of the leaven of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 15.6.16.6.</note> because <hi>by their traditions they made the Commandment of God of none effect:</hi> as in their <hi>Corban,</hi> if they made a vow to God they thought themselves excused from relieving their Parents; and in this way our Saviour generally deals with them, shewing that though they pretended to keep the letter of the Law, yet by their corrupt additions and false glosses they overthrew the scope and design of it: which he thought suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason to reject their Authority; and therefore when he bids his Disciples, <hi>observe and do whatsoever the Scribes and Pharisees bid them</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 23.3.</note> it must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be only while they keep to the letter and reason of the Law; for
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100318:19"/>
if he had intended an absolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he would never elsewhere have bid his Disciples <hi>beware of their Doctrine.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.12.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If it takes away all liberty of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning truth and falshood in Religion. For this is a natural right which every man hath to judge for himself: and they that take this away, may as well command all men to put out their eyes, that they may better follow their Guides. But the other is so much worse, because it is an assault upon our understandings, it is a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing us of the greatest talent God hath committed to our management, it is a rape upon our best faculties, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituting them to the lusts of Spiritual Tyrants; it is not <hi>captivating our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings to the obedience of faith,</hi> but enslaving them to the proud and domineering usurpations of men; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they would do by us as the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines</hi> did by <hi>Sampson</hi>; they would put out our eyes, that we might grind in their prison, and make them sport. I would not be mistaken, it is the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgment I plead for, and not of practice; that may be justly restrained by the Laws of the Church, where the other is allowed; because the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100318:19"/>
to peace and unity are different from those to faith and inward assent. And that no absolute submission of judgment could be required by the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> notwithstanding the command of outward obedience in the cases men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, because that Law makes provision for a <hi>sin-offering in case the whole Congregation of</hi> Israel <hi>sin through ignorance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 4.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>and the thing be hid from the eyes of the Assembly,</hi> or Supream Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, <hi>and they have done something against the commandment of the Lord:</hi> which had been a Law made to no purpose, if it had been impossible for their chief Authority to have erred or been mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their judgment. From hence we see St. <hi>Paul</hi> had great reason to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the <hi>High Priest and Elders to the Law and the Prophets,</hi> because they were subject to error and mistake, but these are not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because <hi>the Law and the Prophets</hi> are less liable to <hi>partiality,</hi> than a living Judge, or the Authority of the present Church. I have oft-times wondered to hear men speak so advantageously of a <hi>living Judge,</hi> before an <hi>infallible Rule,</hi> in order to the end of Controversies. If
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100318:20"/>
all they mean be only that <hi>an end be put to them</hi> no matter <hi>how,</hi> I confess a <hi>living Judge</hi> in that case hath much the advantage, but so would any other way that persons would agree upon, as the judgment of the next person we met with, or Lottery, or any such thing; but if we would have things fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined and heard, and a judgment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according to the merits of the cause, the case will be found very different here from what it is in civil causes. For here the Judge must be a party concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when his own Authority and Interest is questioned; and liable to all those passions which men are subject to in their own cases. Which will be notoriously evident in the case before us, between the <hi>High Priest and Elders</hi> on one side, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> on the other: They plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if any difficulty arose about the sense of the Law, it belonged to them to judge of it; St. <hi>Paul</hi> declines their judgment, and appeals only <hi>to the Law and the Prophets:</hi> had it been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable in this case for <hi>Felix</hi> to have referred the judgment to them who were the parties so deeply concerned? A li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judge may have a great advantage over a bare Rule to put an end to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100318:20"/>
but then we must suppose impartiality in him, freedom from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, an excellent judgment, diligence and patience in hearing all the evidence, and at last delivering sentence according to the sense of the Law; if any of these be wanting, the controversie may soon be ended, but on the wrong side. I suppose none of those who would have controversies in Religion ended by a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Judge, will for shame say, they would have them ended right or wrong; but if they would have Truth determined, they must give us assurance, that these Judges shall lay aside all partiality to their own interests, all prejudice against their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, shall diligently search, and examine, and weigh the evidence on both sides, and then shall determine according to the true sense of the Law. How likely this is, will appear by the living Judges in our Saviour's time; Was there ever greater partiality seen than was in them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or more obstinate prejudice, or more wilfull errors, or a more malicious sentence than came from them in the cause of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our? They would not believe his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, though told them by those that saw them; when they saw them, they
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100318:21"/>
would not believe they came from God, but attributed them to the Devil; they would not so much as enquire the true place of his Nativity, but ran on still with that wilfull mistake, <hi>that he was born in Galilee</hi>; and by this they thought to confound <hi>Nicodemus</hi> presently, <hi>Search and look,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 7.52.</note> 
               <hi>for out of</hi> Galilee <hi>ariseth no Prophet.</hi> If they had searched and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves, they would have found, that Christ was born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and not in <hi>Galilee.</hi> But where men are strongly prejudiced, any thing serves for evidence and demonstration; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all the arguments on the other side shall be despised and contemned. How captious were they on all occasions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Saviour, lying in wait to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him with questions, to pervert his words, and draw blasphemy out of the most innocent expressions? And when none of all these things could do, they use all the ways of fraud, malice, and injustice to destroy the Saviour of the world as a Malefactor and Blasphemer. Was not here now a mighty advantage, which the Authority of the present Church among the Jews of that time had, above the guidance of the Law and the Prophets? And the knowledge St.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100318:21"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> had of the same temper being in them still might justly make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline their judgment, and appeal only <hi>to the Law and the Prophets,</hi> for the <hi>ground and rule</hi> of his Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For the object of his worship,</hi> he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the <hi>best Antiquity, I worship the God of my Fathers. i. e.</hi> I bring no new Religion among you, but the very same in substance with that which all the Jews have owned; so some render <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>Deo Patrio,</hi> the God whom all my Brethren acknowledge, but he rather understands it of the same <hi>God</hi> that was worshipped <hi>by</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac, <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>quem majores nostri coluerunt</hi>; so St. <hi>Peter</hi> in his preaching to the people concerning the resurecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ, to avoid the imputation of Novelty, saith, <hi>The God of</hi> Abraham,<note place="margin">Acts 3.13.</note> 
               <hi>and of</hi> Isaac, <hi>and of</hi> Jacob, <hi>the God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son Jesus</hi>; and again to the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">5.30.</note> 
               <hi>The God of our Fathers raised up Jesus</hi>; and St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22.14.</note> 
               <hi>The God of our Fathers hath chosen thee</hi>; in the use of which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions they purposely declare, that they had no thoughts of bringing in any <hi>new Religion</hi> among them, contrary to what God had of old declared to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100318:22"/>
The main things in which the Jews objected innovation to them, did either concern the bringing in some new doctrine, or the reformation of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions among them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For their doctrine; that either concerned the <hi>Messias,</hi> or a <hi>future State.</hi> For the doctrine of the <hi>Messias</hi> it was as ancient as the records of any revelation from God were. It was the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; and even <hi>Moses</hi> himself speaks of him,<note place="margin">Acts 7.37.</note> as St. <hi>Steven</hi> proves to them; and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Isai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Micah,</hi> and <hi>Malachi,</hi> as the Apostles at large prove in their writings. Why should this then be accounted any new doctrine which they all believed and received? If the Question be only whether Christ were that <hi>Messias</hi> or no; for that, they desire nothing more than the testimony of the <hi>Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>the Miracles</hi> wrought by him; but they had no reason to quarrel with them upon their belief, for such an alteration of the state of things which themselves believed must be when the <hi>Messias</hi> came; for in him not only the Nation of the Jews, but <hi>all the Nations
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100318:22"/>
of the earth were to be blessed</hi>; which was inconsistent with supposing the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law to continue in its force and obligation; being particularly suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one people lying within such a compass as <hi>they might</hi> three times a year attend upon the service in the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> If their quarrel was, concerning <hi>a future state,</hi> as though that were a new doctrine, St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds in the next Verse, <hi>That themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and the unjust.</hi> And in his defence before <hi>Agrippa,</hi> he saith, <hi>And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our Fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 26.6<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 7.</note> 
               <hi>unto which promise our twelve Tribes instantly serving God day and night hope to come.</hi> So that the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces <hi>Antiquity, Vniversality</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> in these Fundamental Articles of the Christian Religion; only a late bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and Politick Faction of the <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees</hi> opposed this doctrine; but why should their opposition signifie any thing against so full a stream running down from the first and purest Antiquity? Thus much for the positive part of their faith and doctrine.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:100318:23"/>2. For the negative part, or <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of abuses and corruptions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; this was St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s plea; Let them shew where <hi>the God of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> imposed any of those heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens which the Scribes and Pharisees place so much of their Religion in. What ground is there <hi>in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> for the Pharisaical Superstitions, and Vows, and Severities to themselves in fetching blood and knocking their heads against the walls, and different garbs and dresses to appear more holy unto men, with many other customs of theirs, the observation of which was made so great a part of the Religion of their devoutest men? And it is a strange thing they should think it impossible such things should come in among them, without great notice being taken of it; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though sudden and violent changes may have all the circumstances known, yet it is not to be expected in more insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and gradual alterations. A man may tell when a violent Fever seiz'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and inflamed his blood, but he cannot do so by a Hectick or a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; must he therefore believe himself well, because he cannot tell the punctual time when he fell sick. We
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100318:23"/>
may easily describe the circumstances of a Landflood which overflows the banks, and bears all before it, but we cannot do so by the coming in of the Tide, which steals in secretly and insensibly, and no man can assign the place where the salt and fresh water first mix toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Superstition is a Hectick Fever to Religion, it by degrees consumes the vitals of it, but comes on insensibly, and is not easily discovered till it be hard to be cured. At first, it may be some devout but indiscreet men made way for it, who love to find out some Modes of devotion different from the rest of the world, which are greedily embraced by such who admire and follow them; this example taking, another begins and sets up for a more refined way than the former; and so the design spreads, till at last true piety and goodness be swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by superstitious fopperies. Which is the most probable account of all the Pharisaical corruptions; some of whose observations might be begun at first with a good mind, and by the devout persons of that time; but afterwards, every one that had a sowrer look and a worse nature than ordinary, thought it not enough to follow the example of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100318:24"/>
others, but like a great <hi>Physician</hi> he must have his <hi>Nostrum's,</hi> something of his own finding out, a new garb, or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, or posture of devotion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be taken notice of, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired for his sanctity. Thus that far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of superstitious rites was gathered up among the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s time, whom he most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely upon all occasions rebukes for their hypocrisie, in placing so much of their Religion in them. And thus much for the way taken by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Christianity from the imputations of being a <hi>new Sect</hi> or <hi>Heresie,</hi> by an appeal to <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>best Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There remains only, the <hi>freedom and courage</hi> expressed by him in owning his Religion, notwithstanding these false imputations. <hi>But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which is called heresie, &amp;c.</hi> He abhorred that mean and base<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> spirited principle, which makes it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for men to deny their Religion when it brings them into danger; he studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no secret arts of complyance with his Adversaries to secure himself; he did not decline appearing, though to the hazard of his life in so just a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100318:24"/>
cause. He valued his Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his own safety, and regarded not all the calumnies and reproaches of his enemies, as long as he made this his constant <hi>exercise, to keep a conscience void of offence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 16</note> 
               <hi>both towards God and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men.</hi> And this he elsewhere saith, afforded him more inward comfort and satisfaction, than all the crafts and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy in the world could give him.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12</note> 
               <hi>For our rejoycing is this,</hi> saith he, <hi>the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world.</hi> There is nothing inspires men with so much courage, as integrity and uprightness of mind doth; and such persons who have the comfort of that, have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly better hopes as to another world, but oftentimes escape better as to this, than others do; for even their enemies cannot but esteem them: whereas the fawning, sneaking and flattering hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that will do or be any thing for his own advantage, is despised by those he courts, hated by good men, and at last tormented by his own conscience, for being false to God and Religion. But we may see here in St. <hi>Paul</hi> a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100318:25"/>
of true <hi>Christian magnanimity</hi>; he was sensible how great both the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and quality of his enemies were; he knew he was to answer before a Judge, that regarded nothing either of Justice or Religion; yet he neither flatters his Judge, nor betrays any distrust of him: he doth not bespatter his enemies, nor discover any fear of them; but with a modest freedom and manly courage owns the main part of their accusation, and effectually vindicates his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency and his Religion together. For even <hi>Felix</hi> himself, although a man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise very capable of being wrought upon by some ways of address, of which we read, <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. yet the <hi>High Priest</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> with their eloquent <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> were forced to return as they came, and leave St. <hi>Paul</hi> under the name of a <hi>Prisoner,</hi> but enjoying the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>liberty, ver.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>I have now gone thorough all the parts of the Text, with a respect to St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> which was engaged against him; it may now be justly expected that I make <hi>Application</hi> of what I have said, to our own <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition.</hi> Thanks be to God, we are not brought to such

a tryal as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was, we enjoy the liberty of speaking for our selves and our Religion, and not only speaking for it, but professing and owning it. And may we ever do so! But we have busie and restless Adversaries abroad, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> who have as much spight and malice against us, as ever those of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> had against St. <hi>Paul</hi>; and they have their <hi>Tertullus's</hi> too, men of art and insinuation, and who manage their cause against us, just as he did against St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they charge us with bringing in <hi>new Sects</hi> under the pretence of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>; or with rejecting the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the present Church which we were bound to obey, and thereby lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation of <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi> These are heavy charges, but they are no other than those the <hi>High Priest and the Elders</hi> made against St. <hi>Paul</hi>; and thanks be to God, his <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> is <hi>ours</hi> too, for we appeal to <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi>; and desire to be judged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to these. These three things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I shall speak to before I conclude,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the same reasons which they produce against the <hi>Reformation</hi> would
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100318:26"/>
have held against the spreading of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity at first.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the same <hi>Defence</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> made for Christianity will justifie the <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That we have all reason to follow the courage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in owning and defending our Religion, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the imputations which are cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the same reasons which they produce against the <hi>Reformation</hi> would have held against <hi>Christianity</hi> at first. What have all the clamours of our Adversaries for above a hundred years come to, but the very same which I have already mention'd as the Jews Objections against Christianity, <hi>viz. Novelty,</hi> and <hi>Faction?</hi>
               <q>Where was your Church before the Reformation? produce your successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all Ages of persons who agreed in all things with you. Where were those distinct bodies of men who found fault with those corruptions that you pretend to reform? Our Church hath had a constant and glorious succession of Bishops, and Martyrs, and Confessors, and religious Orders of Men, Virgins and Widows. But supposing such a distinct succession were not necessary,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100318:26"/>
yet shew how it was possible for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny errors and corruptions to come into the Church, and no one take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them and discover them. Where was the watchfull eye of Providence over all the Church all this while? What, all the Pastors asleep at once! or all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring together to deceive their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity! Besides, how can the Protestants ever answer their rejecting the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the present Church which they lived under? and to whom God had promised his infallible Spirit? how can they clear themselves from facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and disturbing the peace of the Christian world, which lived in so great unity and peace before?</q>
This is the summ of their Objections against the <hi>Reformation,</hi> which are the very same we have mention'd before, as produced by the Jews against Christianity. If the arguments are good now, they were so then; if they were good then, for all that I can see the <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> were in the right, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the wrong; if they were not good then, but are now, some remarkable disparity must be shewed between their case and ours; and that must lie in shewing these three things.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100318:27"/>1. That the Christian Church hath greater infallibility promised than the Jewish had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the first Christians had great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reason to reject the Authority of that Church, than the Reformers had, as to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Causes of corruptions in the <hi>Jewish Church,</hi> could not hold in the Christian. But if none of these can be made good, then the case will appear to be the very same.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be proved that the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church</hi> hath greater infallibility promised than the <hi>Jewish</hi> had. Of which we have this plain evidence, that one of the strongest arguments produced for the infallibility of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> is taken from the Promises made to the <hi>Jewish.</hi> How often hath <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8, 9, 10. been made use of to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in the <hi>Christian</hi> Church? If they had any better arguments in the New Testament, would they ever run so far back to a Command that most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently relates to the Jewish constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Where hath ever God promised that he would dwell in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he did, that he would dwell in his Temple at <hi>Hierusalem?</hi> What
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100318:27"/>
boastings and triumphs would there have been, if any such words had been in the <hi>Gospel</hi> concerning <hi>Rome,</hi> as there were of old concerning <hi>Hierusalem</hi>; viz. <hi>that God had sanctified it, that his Name might be there for ever;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 7.16.</note> 
               <hi>and his eyes and his heart should be there perpetually?</hi> What pitifull proofs in comparison of this, are all those brought out of the New Testament for the Authority and Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? What are all the promises of the Spirit made to the Apostles, and remarkably accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in them, to this plain promise of God's particular presence in that place for ever? Suppose St. <hi>Peter</hi> had privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges above the rest of the <hi>Apostles</hi>; how comes the entail to be made to all his successors, and only at <hi>Rome</hi> and no where else? Where are the Deeds kept, that contain this gift? Why are they not produced during all this contest? And yet we see in the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> where such a promise was made to a particular place, no such thing as Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility was implyed in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot be shewed, that the first <hi>Christians</hi> had greater reason to reject the Authority of the Jewish Church, than our <hi>Reformers</hi> had to reject that of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100318:28"/>
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> I know here it will be presently said, <hi>That the Apostles saw the Miracles of Christ, and wrought many themselves, and received an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Commission from Jesus Christ in whom the Churches infallibility was then seated.</hi> All which I grant to be true in it self, but cannot be pleaded by them who contend for absolute obedience to the present Churches Authority as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. My reason is, because upon this principle they could not believe Christ to be the true <hi>Messias</hi>; for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true <hi>Messias</hi> depended upon two things, <hi>viz. the fulfilling of Prophecies,</hi> and <hi>the truth of his Miracles</hi>; now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their principles, no man could be certain of either of these with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of the Church; for the fulfilling of Prophecies depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sense of many obscure places of Scripture, about which they say there is a necessity of an infallible Judge; and for Miracles, they tell us, that there is no certain way of judging true and false, but by the Authority of the Church. Now if these things be so, what ground could the first Christians have to believe Christ to be the true <hi>Messias,</hi> when in both these, they must
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100318:28"/>
oppose the Authority of the present Church?</p>
            <p n="3">3. They can never prove, that the same causes of corruptions do not hold as to the Christian, which did as to the Jewish Church. For the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in those Ages which we charge with introducing the corruptions, was degenerated into greater <hi>Ignorance, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barism, Luxury</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> than the <hi>Jewish Church</hi> in the time of its dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from the cessation of <hi>Prophecy</hi> till the coming of Christ. Our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries themselves confess, that for a long time, there was nothing either of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or Humanity among them; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ease, and luxury, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all manner of Wickedness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the chief Rulers among them; nay, even at <hi>Rome</hi> there was a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of fifty of their <hi>High Priests,</hi> so remarkable for their wickedness, that <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> (setting only aside their condemning Christ) were <hi>Saints</hi> in comparison of them. And is it now any wonder that such errors and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions should come into that Church, as those we charge them with? Nay, rather the greatest Wonder seems to be, that any thing of Christianity should
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100318:29"/>
be preserved among them. But besides the <hi>sottishness</hi> of those times, we have many other causes to assign of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions introduced among them; as a <hi>Complyance with Gentilism</hi> in many of their Customs and Superstitions; <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of new Modes of Devotion,</hi> among indiscreet <hi>Zealots; Ambition</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant endeavour to advance the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Interests of the Priesthood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Secular Power; and when for a long time these had been gathering the rude materials together, then the <hi>Moorish Philosophy</hi> happening to creep in among them, the <hi>Monks</hi> began to busie themselves therein, and by the help of that, a little better to digest that Mass and Heap of corruptions, and to spend the wit they had to defend and improve them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But against all these, we stand upon the same defence that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did: we appeal to <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>best and purest Antiquity.</hi> We pretend to bring in no new Doctrines, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no <hi>Miracles</hi> can be required of us; which the <hi>Apostles</hi> wrought to confirm Christ's being the true <hi>Messias,</hi> who was to alter that <hi>State</hi> which God himself had once appointed: All that we plead
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100318:29"/>
for, is that the Religion establshed by Christ may serve our turn, and that which is recorded by the Apostles and Evangelists; to these we make our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant appeal, and have the same reason to decline the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had as to the <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to <hi>the Law and the Prophets:</hi> Nay, we have somewhat more reason; because God had once appointed the <hi>High Priests</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> among them, but the Supremacy of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> was a meer Usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on begun by Ambition, advanced by Forgery, and defended by Cruelty. But we do not only <hi>believe all that is written in the Law and the Prophets,</hi> but <hi>we worship the God of our Fathers</hi>; of <hi>the Fathers of the first and purest Ages of the Christian Church;</hi> we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly content to make use of their <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in these matters, but we make our appeal to them; and have begged our Adversaries ever since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> to prove the points in difference between us, by the testimony of the first six hundred years; but from that time to this, they are as far from proving any one point, as ever they were.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:100318:30"/>3. What then follows from all this, but that we should imitate St. <hi>Paul</hi>

And since <hi>the Children of this world are in their Generation wiser than the Children of light</hi>; there are some things practised among them, which may deserve our imitation: and those are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A mighty Industry and Zeal in promoting their Cause; they have learn'd of their Predecessors to <hi>compass Sea and Land to gain one Proselite.</hi> They insinuate themselves into all companies, stick at no pains, accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to all humours, and are provided
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100318:31"/>
one way or other to gratifie persons of all inclinations; for they have retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the melancholy, business for the active, idleness for the lazy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the ambitious, splendour for the vain, severities for the sowre and hardy, and a good dose of pleasures for the soft and voluptuous. It is not their <hi>Way,</hi> but their <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Industry</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to our imitation; I know not how it comes to pass, but so it often happens, that they who are most secure of truth on their side, are most apt to be remiss and careless; and to comfort themselves with some good old sayings, as <hi>God will provide,</hi> and <hi>Truth will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,</hi> though they lie still, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards it; but certainly such neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence is inexcusable, where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of so great importance, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries so many, and an account must be given shortly in another world, of what men have done or suffered for their Religion in this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Submission and Obedience to their Spiritual Governours; the greatest strength of that prevailing Faction lies in the close union and cohesion of all the parts together, by a settled subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of one to another; which tho'
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100318:32"/>
not always effectual, yet the contrivance is so laid, as if there were as much Truth and Reason as Policy in it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd to be fit for upholding the interest of a Church. But we plead not for their blind and absolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but sure the Apostles had some meaning when they bid the Christians <hi>obey them that had the rule over them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.17. 2 Thes. 5.13.</note> 
               <hi>and submit themselves, for they watched for their souls; and esteem them very highly in love for their Works sake:</hi> not, be ready on all occasions to reproach and contemn them, and be glad of any idle stories wherewith to bespatter them. If men would once understand and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise the duties of humility, modesty, and submission to the Government which God hath set over us, we might have greater hopes to secure the interest of our Church and Religion, than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it we can ever have. For spiritual pride, conceitedness in Religion, and a Spirit of contradiction to Superiours are to be reckoned among some of the worst Symptoms of a declining Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lessening of differences among themselves; for although with all their care they cannot prevent them, yet they still endeavour to extenuate them, as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100318:32"/>
much as possible, and boast of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among strangers to their Churches affairs. The great wisdom of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> lies in this, that as long as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are true to them in the main points wherein the difference lies, they can let them alone in smaller differences among themselves; and not provoke either of the dissenting parties, unless they are sure to suppress them, lest they give them occasion to withdraw from their communion. They can allow different Rites and Ceremonies in the several Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Religion among them, and grant exemptions and privileges in particular cases; as long as they make them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to their common interest by upholding and strengthning them. Would to God we could at last learn this Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from our enemies, not to widen our own differences by inveterate heats, bitterness and animosities among our selves; but to find out ways whereby even the dissenters in smaller things may be made usefull for the maintaining the common interest of our Church and Religion. And it is a vain thing in any to go about to separate these; or ever to hope that the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> can be preserved among us without up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100318:33"/>
               <hi>the Church of England.</hi> For if once that <hi>Bullwark</hi> be demolished, our Adversaries will despise all the lesser <hi>Sconces</hi> and <hi>Pallisado's</hi>: they will be but like <hi>Romulus</hi> his <hi>Walls,</hi> which they will easily leap over at their pleasure. I pray God then (and I hope you will all joyn with me in it) that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to our Governours the Spirit of Wisdom and Peace, to find out the most proper means for the establishment of our Church and Religion; and I pray God give us all a Spirit of knowledge to <hi>understand the things which belong to our peace,</hi> and of Love and Unity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after them.</p>

in the world, we might have thought the Christian least liable to be abused to such ill purposes; for it was one of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi>'s quarrels against Christianity, that by its precepts of meekness and patience, it rendred men unfit for such great undertakings, which could not be accomplished without something of cruelty and inhumanity, whereas the old Religions by the multitude of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices did inure men to blood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and so made them fitter for any enterprize. And <hi>Machiavel</hi> was certainly in the right, if Religion were intended only to make men <hi>Butchers:</hi> or to instruct them in the use of Swords and Gun-powder. Nay, the Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is in this respect to be very much preferred before the Christian, for that makes it not only lawfull to destroy those of a different Religion, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolls them for Martyrs that die in the Field, and makes the blood of enemies as meritorious, as we do that of the Cross. But that is reserved as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar honour of the Christian Religion, that it commands the subduing all the brutish and savage inclinations of men to acts of revenge and cruelty; that it restores humane nature to it self by its
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100318:35"/>
precepts of meekness, mercy, peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness, and universal charity; that it advances it to a divine nature by the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of God himself, in shewing kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to enemies, and overcoming evil with good. This is the Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by our Lord and Saviour in this excellent Sermon on the Mount, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the scope and design of Christianity is delivered with the greatest plainness and perspicuity; which (if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to judge of his meaning by the clearest expressions) was far enough from being the setting up a Monarchy in the Church to which all the Kings of the Christian world are by their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism bound to vail their Crowns, and lay their Scepters at its feet: or in case they do not, that then this Spiritual Monarch may excommunicate, depose, and deprive Princes of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and dissolve all the obligations between their Subjects and them: and make it lawfull for them to depose them: We find not the least footstep of any thing tending this way, where our Saviour speaks most advantageously concerning the honour of his Disciples; which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he represents by things which set forth their usefulness in common: <hi>Ye
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100318:35"/>
are the Salt of the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>ye are the light of the World</hi>; and not by setting up one above all the rest, <hi>far above all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and Powers,</hi> to whom Kings and Princes, and all People are bound to be subject, if they regard their salvation. If any such thing as this had been so material a part of the Christian Doctrine, as some imagine, if it had been so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, it is somewhat strange, that when our Blessed Saviour gave so many directions in order to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he should give not so much as the least intimation concerning this. And yet he saith, at the end of this Sermon, <hi>Every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 7.24.</note> 
               <hi>is like unto a wise man that built his house upon a rock</hi>; not <hi>super hanc Petram, i. e.</hi> according to the <hi>Roman Gloss,</hi> upon the Pope's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but upon such a firm founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as will never fail him. And what is it which our Saviour endeavours to perswade men to, in order to so firm a settlement of their minds against all the assaults of persecutions? <hi>viz.</hi> to humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, meekness, goodness, universal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, to the love of God and Mankind, to sincerity in devotion, dependence on Providence, prayer, and doing as we
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100318:36"/>
would be done by: this is the substance of the Christian Law delivered by the Son of God; than which nothing can be imagined more contrary to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Faction and disobedience, of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and revenge, and that covered o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with a pretence of zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But he who gave these excellent precepts, did foresee, that there would arise <hi>men who should preach and prophesie in his Name, and in his Name cast out Devils, and do wonderfull works:</hi> that yet for all their fair shews and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the world should be of a temper and disposition directly contrary to the Gospel; and therefore it was necessary for all Christians, as they valued their own welfare, to have an eye to them, lest they should be deceived by them: which is the meaning of our Saviour in these words; <hi>Beware of false Prophets which come to you in Sheeps cloathing, but inwardly they are ravening Wolves: By their fruits ye shall know them.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we have these two things considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Caution given, <hi>Beware of false Prophets,</hi> together with the ground of that Caution, <hi>For they come to you in Sheeps cloathing, but inwardly are raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wolves.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. That nothing is more easie, than for false Teachers to pretend to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit; such whom our Saviour and his Apostles did warn men especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally against, pretended to be <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles,</hi> and to know the mind of Christ better than they who truly had the assistance of the Holy Ghost. Some think <hi>the bare pretence to Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ought in such a divided state of the Christian world to be entertained as the best expedient to end Controversies, and that Church which doth alone challenge it, ought on that account to be submitted to</hi>; as though the most confident pretenders
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100318:39"/>
were to be soonest believed: so they will be, do what we can, by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sort of mankind, but by none who have and use their judgments. If bare pretences were sufficient, <hi>Simon Magus</hi> did bid the fairest to be <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>

Why then did not the Christian Church submit to <hi>Montanus</hi> his <hi>Paraclete,</hi> when no other Christians pretended to such an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inspiration as he did? And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Prisca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla</hi> were better Oracles, than a <hi>Crucifix</hi> was to a late <hi>Pope.</hi> If there be any thing beyond a bare pretence to an infallible Spirit, we desire to see better arguments for it, than the <hi>false Apostles</hi> could produce for theirs; if there be nothing but a bare pretence, we must leave the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> to dispute it out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the pretence to Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration is very dangerous to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. For we see what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it did in the Apostolical times when there was a true infallible Spirit in the Apostles of Christ to discover an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100318:39"/>
care and diligence of the Apostles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were seduced by it. For those who have the least ground, do commonly use the greatest confidence, and denounce <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> the soonest to those who despise and reject them. Which being expressed with a grim countenance and a terrible accent, startles and shakes more persons of weak judgments and timorous dispositions, than all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and arguments they could ever produce. This hath always been the method of deceivers, to pretend to the highest, and then make the sin of those who do not believe them as great, as if the thing were real. Thus the reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens Fanatick Pretences to Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Extasies is cryed out upon, as blaspheming the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to believe upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches pretended Infallibility, is called no less, than denying God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

their initiations, especially those of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thras,</hi> that some died before they could pass through them: and yet for any to be admitted without them, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent death to them.

Some part of these hardships the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> took into their <hi>Philosophy</hi>; and from them the <hi>Colossians</hi> began to be infected with them: but St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>vain deceits, the commandments and doctrines of men, things that made a fair shew,</hi> but he looks upon them as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the doctrine of Christ.

In the mean time we think it most convenient to follow our Saviour's rules, to judge of mens pretences, how great and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty soever, by the <hi>fruits</hi> they produce. Which <hi>Rule</hi> is not to be understood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>particular actions of men</hi> which have no respect to their <hi>doctrines</hi>; for as St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> observes, many Hereticks have been men of excellent lives, and so on the contrary; but we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it of those <hi>fruits</hi> which their doctrines have a direct influence upon.

respect to two things by which we are to examine the fairest pretences: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The <hi>design</hi> they tend to. 2. The <hi>means</hi> made use of for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this design. If therefore the <hi>design</hi> be quite of another nature from that of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; if the <hi>means</hi> be such as are directly contrary to it, we may from thence justly inferr, that how plausible soever the pretences are, how fine and soft soever <hi>the Sheeps cloathing</hi> be, yet inwardly <hi>they are ravening Wolves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin therefore, with the <hi>design</hi> of their doctrines. Nothing is more easie, than for men to understand the design of Christianity, <hi>viz.</hi> the exercise of all Christian vertues to sit men for the Kingdom of Heaven: for our Saviour declares,<note place="margin">Joh 18.36</note> 
               <hi>That his Kingdom is not of this world</hi>; that he came not to meddle with the rights of Princes, or to dispose of Crowns and Dominions; all that he aimed at, was to possess men with a firm belief of another world, and by the most powerfull motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to repentance, and a sober, righteous, and a godly life. And if they did these things, wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100318:51"/>
in that to come. This is the main scope and design of the Christian Religion; and the great art of the <hi>false Prophets</hi> lay in this, that they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed still to own Christianity, (which was their <hi>Sheeps cloathing</hi>) but withal by secret and pernicious mixtures of their own doctrines to undermine and pervert the whole design of it. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of them, not that they did oppose, but that they did <hi>pervert the Gospel of Christ. I marvel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 16.7.</note> saith he, <hi>that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another Gospel: which yet is not another, but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the Gospel of Christ.</hi> Now I desire, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd, whether any thing doth more effectually pervert the design of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, than the setting up a Kingdom in this world under the pretence of it, that should be paramount to all Princes and Potentates, and to which they owe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100318:51"/>
the design came once to be managed by a man of Spirit and courage<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> as it was by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, who in a Council at <hi>Rome</hi> published his famous Dictates, viz. <hi>That there is but one Name in the World,</hi> viz. <hi>that of the Pope:</hi>

                  <hi>Baron. An.</hi> 1076. <hi>Sect.</hi> 31.</note> 
               <hi>that it was in his power to depose Emperors, and absolve Subjects from obedience to their Princes.</hi> Now the grand design break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, all other things were contrived and carried on which were thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to accomplish it: and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two things needfull for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of such a pretended Monarchy, viz. <hi>sufficient numbers</hi> of men, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest should lie in upholding it; and great revenues to support the dignity of it: These two were taken care of with all the art and industry imaginable. For the first it was necessary to dis-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them from all civil interests, and yet to preserve their honour and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the people. The former could not be done while the Clergy gave hostages of their fidelity to the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vil Government by the interests of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and Children, therefore this Pope did most severely forbid all Clergy-mens marrying; that as the old <hi>Roman</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were forbidden marriage while they
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100318:52"/>
received pay, lest their domestick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests should abate their courage: so the <hi>Celibate</hi> of the Clergy was strictly enjoyned, to make them more usefull and hearty for this design. But lest the number of these should not be thought sufficient, great swarms of <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friars</hi> were encouraged and dispersed in all Countries, and to make them more faithfull to this interest (because Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might oblige particular Bishops who might curb and restrain these spiritual <hi>Janizaries</hi>) therefore they were exempt from their jurisdiction, and kept in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dependence on the Pope.

But I would fain understand from whence they derive this profound intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence at such a distance of years. If King <hi>James</hi> may be believed, if the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Historians and Apologists at that time may be credited, there was not the least intimation given, either by the <hi>Actors</hi> or <hi>Sufferers,</hi> from abroad or at home of any such thing. Was not the world sufficiently alarm'd at the news of this dangerous and unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd Conspiracy? Were not men very inquisitive into all the particulars? and those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> especially the <hi>Jesuits,</hi> concerned in point of honour to wipe off the stain from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100318:60"/>
and to cast the <hi>odium</hi> of it on a great <hi>Minister of State?</hi> Were not two of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> who were conscious of the Plot, preferred afterwards at <hi>Rome?</hi> and how many Writings came from thence about it? and yet not one man discovered the least suspicion of any such thing. If they go on in this way without the least shadow of proof to lay the contrivance of this Plot on a <hi>professed Protestant:</hi> for all that I know, by the next age, they may hope to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men, that it was a Plot of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> to blow up a <hi>Popish King</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>

were for the greater good of the <hi>Church.</hi> Upon these two grounds, as <hi>Widdring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> a <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> well observes, <hi>Catesby</hi> laid the foundation of his whole Conspiracy. After this, it's evident by manifest proofs, and <hi>Garnett</hi>'s own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession under his hand, that he and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jesuits</hi> did understand the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Plot; and <hi>Tesmond</hi> another <hi>Jesuit</hi> and he discoursed the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces walking together in <hi>Moor-fields</hi>; and that <hi>not in confession,</hi> as is pretended, for the <hi>Jesuit</hi> did not confess it as a fault, but advised with him about particulars, and asked him, <hi>who should be Protector of the Kingdom after the Plot took effect?</hi> as <hi>Garnett</hi> himself confessed.

There is only this difference, that <hi>Treason</hi> is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against <hi>Secular Princes,</hi> but <hi>Heresie</hi> against the interest of <hi>their Church</hi>; which is dearer to them than all the Princes lives in the World. Yea, so busie were the <hi>Jesuits</hi> in encouraging this Plot, that they not only debated it among themselves; but one of them gave them the Sacrament upon the <hi>Oath
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100318:62"/>
of Secrecy,</hi> and then absolved them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the discovery; another prayed for good success, another comforted them after it was discovered by the examples of good designs that had wanted success. And must we after all this believe, that only <hi>a few discontented Laicks</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in it, and that it was nothing at all to their Church? when the <hi>Jesuits</hi> gave all the encouragement to them in it, in point of conscience: so that it was truly, as well as wittily said of one, That the <hi>Jesuits double garment</hi> might well be called <hi>Charity, because it covered a multitude of sins.</hi>

as of a holy Martyr?</hi> Is this the honour of <hi>Regicides</hi> and <hi>Traitors</hi> in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? When in the late prosperous Rebellion, the prevailing Faction had proceeded to such a height of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as to take away the life of our Gracious Sovereign, how did the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> groan and grow impatient till they could vindicate the honour of our Religion and Country! not only by an execution of Justice on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the <hi>Regicides,</hi> but by declaring in <hi>Parliament</hi> against the principles that led to it. What hath there been done like this in the <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> against the principles or actors of this <hi>Gunpowder Treason?</hi> If it had succeeded, by all that we can see, <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth might have admired <hi>the providence of God in it,</hi> as much as <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth did in the murder of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France:</hi> and we may guess his mind shrewdly by the <hi>Bulls</hi> he published a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> was forced for his own security to impose on the <hi>Papists</hi> after this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy. With what scorn and contempt doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> treat the <hi>King</hi> in his Writings against him, and tells him in plain terms, <hi>if he would be secure, he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100318:63"/>
must give liberty to their Religion?</hi> It seems then, their principles are dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to Princes where they have it not. What mark of dishonour was there set by their own party on any one of the Conspirators? Two of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> upon their arrival at <hi>Rome,</hi> met with such hard usage, that one was made the <hi>Pope's Poenitentiary,</hi> the other a <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s at <hi>Rome.</hi> And is not this the way to let the world see, how detestable such persons and practices are to their Church? To conclude all, I challenge those of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to produce any one solemn Declaration of that Church, (I do not say of Secular Powers or some particular persons, or Councils rejected at <hi>Rome</hi>) whereby they make it unlawfull for the Pope to depose Princes, or to absolve Subjects from their Oaths of Allegiance to them. But instead of that, even in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age of ours, that opinion which makes it unlawfull, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Rome</hi> by three several Popes, <hi>Paul</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Innocent</hi> the Tenth, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh: and which is more considerable, all three have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it with a particular respect to the case of his Majesty's Subjects; and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100318:63"/>
not meerly condemned it as a false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but <hi>as wicked and contrary to faith.</hi> And <hi>is not the world grown wiser now as</hi> to these matters? But if they be not I hope we may be. And after their frequent Treasons and horrible Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, and principles never disowned by their Church, have we not reason to entertain suspicion of them, as to their principles of Civil Government, till they give sufficient security, that these pernicious principles have no influence upon them?</p>
            <p>But blessed be that God, that hath hitherto defeated the malicious purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the inveterate enemies of our Church and Religion: that hath brought to light these works of darkness; and yet continued us in the enjoyment of the benefits of this mighty deliverance to this day.

            <p>WHen the <hi>Jewish Christians</hi> had formed themselves into an established <hi>Church,</hi> and were become considerable for their number, as well as for their zeal and devotion, their obstinate Brethren thought it high time for their own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, at least to weaken and divide them, if they could not wholly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and destroy them. For this end, they made use of different instruments and means, according to the different
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100318:65"/>
seasons, and dispositions of men. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when they had any encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or connivence from the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, they set upon them with rage and fury,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.32, 34.</note> 
               <hi>spoiling their goods,</hi> and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their lives: But this hard usage did only heighten the courage, and unite the affections of the more zealous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. Sometimes they suggested to them the mighty veneration, which their whole Nation always had for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> and what an infinite scandal and dishonour it would be to them all, to have that Law, which was delivered by Angels, confirmed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, established by Prophets, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Gentiles, and had continued among them for so many Ages, now of a sudden to be laid aside for the sake of a new institution, that expressed no more regard to them than to any other Nation in the World. And so great was the love which the <hi>Jews</hi> had to their own Country and Religion, such an opinion was generally received among them of the peculiar favour of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, that they who could not be shocked by persecution, were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being overcome by flattery. From hence the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epistle</hi> makes
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100318:65"/>
it his business to shew the excellency of <hi>Christ</hi> above <hi>Moses,</hi> and of his <hi>institution</hi> above that of the <hi>Law,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>the benefits</hi> which come by them; and that although this <hi>new and living way</hi> were but lately discovered, yet it was that which was always designed by God, foreseen by the Patriarchs, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by the Prophets, and longed for by good men as <hi>the Consolation of Israel</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and it could be no more disparagement to <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> to yield to the <hi>Glories</hi> of the Kingdom of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias,</hi> than it is to the Stars not to be seen when the light of the Sun appears. But besides these, there were some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them capable of being wrought upon by other kind of arguments, such I mean, who out of a sudden transport of zeal, and being convinced by the miraculous operations of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> had declared themselves <hi>Christians,</hi> but yet retained a secret love to their sins, and the pleasures of this World: these were the Persons whom the <hi>Apostle,</hi> not without reason, expresses the greatest jealousie of, as in danger of Apostasie: and therefore in many places of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, he represents to them the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

so, whatever these warping Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians might pretend, as to zeal for the Law, and their ancient Religion, the bottom of all was a principle of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, not arising from want of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reason to convince them, but from a close and secret love of sin which made them willing to quarrel with what ever was so repugnant to it, as the doctrine of Christ.

            <p>Such is the frame and condition of humane nature considered in it self, so great are the advantages of reason and consideration for the government of our actions, so much stronger are the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motives to vertue than to vice, that they who look no farther, would expect to find the world much better than it is. For why should we suppose the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind to betray so much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to act unreasonably and against the common interest of their own kind? as all those do, that yield to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of sin: For if we set aside the consideration of a Divine Law, <hi>to sin</hi> is nothing else but to act foolishly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately. But on the other side, if men first look into the practice of the world, and there observe the strange prevalency of Vice, and how willing men are to defend as well as to commit it; they would be apt to imagine that either there is no such thing as Reason
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100318:68"/>
among men, or that it hath very little influence upon their actions; and that the talk of Vertue was first found out by some great enemy to the Felicity of Mankind. Such different apprehensions would men have from the different ways of beholding the Picture of Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; either as it is in its own frame, or as it is to be seen in the World. They who have with the greatest judgment and care searched into the nature and first principles of humane Societies, have all agreed that the chief end and design of men in joyning together was, for the mutual benefit and advantage of each other; and that in order to this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laws of <hi>Justice, Equity, Mercy, Truth, Gratitude, Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>perance,</hi> as well as of <hi>Subjection</hi> to <hi>Government,</hi> ought to be inviolably observed by men. And since these things have the universal consent of mankind to be for their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good, how comes it to pass, that men being joyned in these Societies for such ends, make so little Conscience of the practice of them? How come so many to live as it were in open defiance to these Fundamental Laws of Nature? How come others, only to make use of the pretence of vertue to deceive,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100318:69"/>
and of honesty and integrity to cover the deepest dissimulation? If they be not good, why are they pretended? If they are good, why are they not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised? So that whether we consider mankind in it self, or in Society; we find the <hi>Motives</hi> to vertue to be much more weighty, and considerable than those to sin; and yet that the practice of men is directly contrary.</p>
            <p>But it may be said, <hi>that all this might happen in the world for want of wit and education to polish and improve the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculties of mens minds, and to direct and encourage the practice of vertue.</hi> I wish the world had not so many instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that men of the greatest wit have not been men of the best Morals; but if wit, and education, and Philosophy had been the most effectual means to reclaim men from sin, where should we have looked more for the flourishing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100318:70"/>
the people had swallowed that pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principle, that Morality was no part of their religion, they had no great regard to the good or evil of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as long as a little charge, and sour looks, and going to their Temples at certain times were thought sufficient to expiate their sins. And they were much more encouraged in Wickedness, when the Gods they worshipped were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented on the stage as acting all manner of villainies: and no doubt they thought it a great comfort to them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, that their Gods were as <hi>good fellows</hi> as themselves. And what could all the precepts of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> or say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of <hi>wise men</hi> signifie to those who were so far from looking on vertue as any necessary part of their Religion, that they thought those fit to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped for Gods, whom they never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to have been good men?</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they had thus render'd ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue unnecessary, by making it no part of their Religion, the next thing was to make it appear <hi>ridiculous</hi>; which was a certain way to make <hi>Fools</hi> out of love with it; who do not consider, what is fit to be laughed at, but what is so. When <hi>Socrates</hi> at <hi>Athens</hi> undertook with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100318:71"/>
many sharp and cutting <hi>Ironies</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the vices of his Age; and with a great deal of Wit and Reason to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to the sober practice of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the licentious people knew not what to do with him, for they were not able to withstand the force of his arguments; at last <hi>Aristophanes</hi> (having a <hi>Comical Wit,</hi> whereby he was able to make any thing seem ridiculous although he knew very well the <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> of <hi>Socrates</hi>; yet) to please and humour the people, he brings him upon the Stage, and represents his grave instructions after such a manner, as turn'd all into a matter of laughter to the people of <hi>Athens:</hi> which did more mischief to the reputation of <hi>Vertue</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, than the taking away his life did. For, his dying convinced the people he was in good earnest, and brought a great veneration to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; whereas the other exposed him only to scorn and contempt; and the people were made judges whether it were with cause or no: who besides their ignorance and want of judgment, were too much Parties to be Judges. This is the method which men take, when they set their <hi>wits</hi> against <hi>Vertue</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:100318:71"/>
and <hi>Goodness</hi>; they know it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to argue men out of it; but it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easie by ridiculous postures, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical gestures, and profane similitudes, to put so grave and modest a thing as <hi>vertue</hi> is out of Countenance, among those who are sure to laugh on the other side. I do not think such things can signifie any thing to wise men; but when was the world made up of such? and therefore it signifies very much to the mischief of those who have not the <hi>courage</hi> to love <hi>despised vertue</hi>; nor to defend a Cause that is <hi>laughed down.</hi> And to these I may now add,</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>bad examples</hi> of others, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of those to whom it belonged to <hi>teach and encourage Vertue</hi> above others, No man will pretend, that it is ground enough for him to do a thing meerly because he sees another do it; yet in all Ages men have seen and complained that the power of examples hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done that of Laws. Some that think themselves more subtle than others, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether those mean what they say, who speak one thing and do ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore they will do what they think the others mean; which were a good plea, if their actions were
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:100318:72"/>
better than their words. Others think, that all discourses of vertue, and hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and true honour, are meer matter of talk for men to entertain some idle hours with, and that men are univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally agreed in nothing but in speaking well and doing ill. These look on ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as a kind of <hi>Phoenix,</hi> a thing often talked of, and believed by some, but never seen by any: but such find all things so very bad at home, that out of charity to themselves, they believe the whole World to be like them. Others have so much natural modesty and sense of shame, that they have not the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to commit a great wickedness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were hardned to it by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of greater sinners before them. But the most common reason of the prevalency of example is, that men find in themselves a strong propensity and inclination to do evil, and are willing to meet with such a pretence for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it, that they do but as others do; and therefore I cannot think that bare example were enough to corrupt the World if there were not some ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent inclination in humane nature to the practice of evil. For since there is less reason to follow bad examples than
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100318:72"/>
good, why should one prevail more than the other in the world, if there were nothing but the bare example to move? But that inclination being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we may easily give an account of the ill consequence which the bad examples of those who are to direct and encourage others in vertue, must needs be of to the rest of mankind <hi>Xenophon</hi> was not without reason so much displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,<note place="margin">

It was this which made the very name of them become so odious at <hi>Rome,</hi> that even vertue it self was hated for their sakes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> so that the very teachers of vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the increase of vice. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when by their endless disputes and wranglings about words and terms of art, they made the people suspect they did but play prizes before them; and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100318:73"/>
only pretended to quarrel, but were well enough agreed to cheat and deceive them. Upon such grounds as these, all the <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>Vertue</hi> contained in the <hi>Writings</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> of <hi>Philosophers</hi> lost their due force and efficacy on the minds of the people, who were rather more <hi>hardned in their sins</hi> by these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages which attended the means that were used to reclaim them from the practice of them.</p>
            <p>But when all other <hi>motives</hi> proved ineffectual by these disadvantages, what could be more reasonably expected, than that the <hi>motives</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> should prevail with men, being of so great weight in themselves, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended with so much advantage to the World, by the examples of those who delivered them? The great arguments of Christianity against the practice of sin are not drawn from any uncertain <hi>Topicks,</hi> or nice and curious speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but from the influence mens good or evil actions in this World will have upon their happiness or misery in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And what concerns another state is revealed with much more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and confirmed by stronger evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and enforced by more moving
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:100318:73"/>
considerations, than ever it was before among the best and wisest of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. The doctrine of Christianity is plain and peremptory in this matter, <hi>that God will render to every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Works:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.6.1.18.</note> and <hi>that the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.</hi> And however prone men <hi>are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with vain words,</hi> yet let them look to themselves,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.7.</note>

To be a Christian then, was not to be versed in the subtilties of the Schools; or to be able to swallow contradictions without chewing them; or to be as fierce and earnest for every doubtfull opinion and uncertain custom, as if the substance of Christianity were like <hi>Epicurus</hi> his World made up of a great number of very small and restless Atoms. To be a Christian, was not to sight for the Faith, but to live by it;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100318:74"/>
not to quarrel for good Works, but to practise them; in short, to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian was <hi>to depart from iniquity and to do good,</hi> to be meek and humble, and patient, and peaceable towards all men; to be charitable and kind; to be sober and <hi>temperate in all things,</hi> to be holy, sincere, and innocent in his actions to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and men.

keep men from the doing of, is to make a severe reflection on the wisdom of them that give them.

hath laid such a mighty obligation on mankind, that rather than part with it, the greater part of men, out of meer gratitude, would be content to suffer for ever with it: or, that it is a thing so absolutely necessary to the comfort of mens lives, that they cannot live one good day without it: Whereas in truth, the whole race of mankind hath suffer'd extreamly and continually by it: and it is so far from being necessary to the comfort of mens lives, that the greatest troubles and vexations of life have risen from it; and men may enjoy far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er satisfaction, and more real content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and more noble, and solid, and lasting pleasures if they did utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce and forsake it. But this still makes the difficulty so much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, how it should so far bewitch and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuate the far greatest part of mankind; and of those who know how dearly they must suffer for it in another World? And yet to assoil this difficulty, we have only two Accounts to give how sin comes to deceive mankind so generally, so fatally; and those are 1. By subtle insinuations; 2. By false reasonings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By subtle insinuations.</hi> The great Masters of pleading in ancient times
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:100318:77"/>
have told us, that there are some Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which are never to be managed by plain and downright reasonings, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are too weak to bear that method of handling) and then they bid men have a care in their beginning, of coming close to the business; but they must fetch a compass about, and by secret arts and degrees insinuate themselves into the good opinion of the Judges before they are aware of it. This is the very method which is made use of <hi>by the deceitfulness of Sin</hi>; i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When it hath done that, it draws men on by degrees to the practice of it. 3. When men are engaged in the practice of sin, then it represents to them how much it is their own interest to defend it, and so brings them from <hi>the counsel of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and the way of sinners, to the seat of the scornfull.</hi>
            </p>

of things. The first precept of insinuation is to remove prejudice; for while that continues, all that can be said will be of no force. While men look on sin as vile, and loathsome; as mean and unworthy of a man; as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the peace and contentment of their minds, so long temptations are easily resisted: all arts must therefore be used to make it appear with all the address and flattery which is most apt to entice a poor deluded sinner. Then, the fetters and shackles which it brings to enslave men with, must be looked on and admired as ornaments; its most sordid and filthy pleasures must be thought great and manly; and a little present honour and advantage appear more valuable than an eternal state of Happiness and Glory. These are things we should think it very hard for men to be deceived with; and yet every day we find they are so; and which is far more, they are ready to take it very ill of those who go about to undeceive them. In other cases, if a man tells another, that he is like to be deceived with a false and counterfeit Jewel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of a true one; or to buy a bad Title to an Estate instead of a good

            <p>Nothing deserves the name of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> with them, but a power of doing what they please. What nonsense and contradiction doth it seem to them for those to be accounted free, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any bonds or restraints? No matter
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100318:78"/>
to them, whether they be from God or Nature, from Reason or Conscience, as long as they are restraints, they look on them as inconsistent with their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of liberty. And next to those who threaten men with punishments in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World for what they do amiss in this, they account those the greatest Fools that first found out the distinction of good and evil, and just and unjust in the actions of men,
<q>What Fools (say they) were they to fasten dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and reproachfull names on some of the most pleasant and beneficial actions of life? For thus a man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred that noble and manly Vice of Drunkenness for fear of losing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Sobriety; and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of Lust, for fear of doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to his Neighbour's Bed; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing a man hath never so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in his hands to enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by defrauding another, yet he must not do it, because although an estate be in the keeping of a Fool, yet another must not be a Knave to get it from him.</q>
Thus do these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Slaves to Vice pity the weakness of those who have so little wit (as they think) not to understand the Liberty
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:100318:79"/>
they enjoy: But thus do mad men pity the dulness of those that are in their wits, that do not sing, and rant, and despise the World, as they do: and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy themselves to be Kings and Princes, while they are tyed fast in their Chains, and lie in Straw. And upon such grounds as these, the most rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>Indians</hi> did better understand the liberty of mankind, than the most ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized Nations. For all civility is a debarring men of some part of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty, <hi>i. e.</hi> of those things which men have a power to do; and upon this ground all ancient Law-givers and Wise men, who by degrees brought se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations to order and government, and to live by Laws, ought to be hated as the greatest Tyrants and Usurpers upon the liberties of mankind: and the natural consequence of this would be the overthrow of all Laws, and Order, and Government in the World. But if there must be some restraints upon men, then we are to consider what restraints are just and reasonable, within whose bounds we are to contain our selves; and whatever tends to the dishonour of God, to the injury of others, or to our own destruction, it is all the reason in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100318:79"/>
the World we should abstain from. And if men would but do this, they would be kept from the practice of sin: And so this imaginary notion of a boundless <hi>liberty</hi> will appear to be only one of the <hi>false colours</hi> that sin puts upon evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, on purpose to tempt men to the commission of them.</p>
            <p>But there is another Poison which more subtilly and dangerously insinuates it self into the hearts of men, and by which sin gets the possession there, and that is the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>pleasure</hi>; I do not mean the pleasure of the mind, or the pleasure of a good conscience, for there is no danger in these; but it is the love of sensual pleasure which is most apt to ensnare men in the practice of sin. It is under this representation chiefly, that sin deceives, betrays, entangles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witches, destroys the souls of men: It is this which fills the imagination, and darkens the understanding with filthy steams and vapours, and hurries a man on with the impetuous violence of passions, without considering the mischievous consequence which attends it, either as to his honour in this World, or his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in another.

            <p>But besides these soft and voluptuous sinners, (who are easily deceived and

hardly drawn out of the snares they fall into) there are others of a more busie, restless, and designing temper, and to these sin appears under another shape to deceive them, with all the advantages of external Splendor and Greatness. And thus they who possibly might escape the baits of pleasure, are carried away by the more plausible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Riches and Honour.

It was indeed somewhat a hard condition the Devil joyned with his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, <hi>to fall down and worship him,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he then designed not only a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but a Triumph; but with others he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100318:81"/>
conceals the condition and draws them on by degrees, still rising higher and higher in his temptations, thereby feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and enlarging their desires; till the love of this World hath gotten such an entire possession of their hearts, that they scarce ever in good earnest think of another till their souls are passing into it. And then it may be, they sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reflect on their own folly, in that they have preferred the deluding scenes and pompous shews of worldly greatness, before the compleat and endless felicity of another life. But it very often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that it is not so long, as till their leaving this World, that men come to understand the restless folly of ambition. For the things of this World are like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picurus</hi> his <hi>Atoms,</hi> always moving and justling one against another; and one man's ambition serves to supplant ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they who cannot raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves may yet help to ruine others; and oftentimes those very designs by which they most hoped to advance themselves, prove the occasion of their fall and destruction. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> have a story to this purpose;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Warn. Prov Persie. p.</hi> 33.</note> 
               <hi>In the time of Jesus, three men in a journey hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to find a Treasure; but being hungry,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100318:81"/>
they sent one of their number to buy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions; he consults how he might get this Treasure to himself, and for that end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to poison their meat; the other two agreed to share it between them, and to kill the third as soon as he returned, which they did, and themselves soon after died of the poisoned meat. Jesus passing by with his disciples, said, This is the condition of this world! see what the love of it hath brought these men to! Wo be to him that looks for any other usage from it.</hi> This is the first way whereby sin doth insinuate into the minds of them; <hi>viz.</hi> by false colours and representations of things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But when sin hath so far insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it self to bring men to a better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it, it doth not presently hurry them on to the greatest height of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness; but leads them gently and by easie steps and degrees, lest they should start back presently with the fright of some dreadfull sin. Which will appear, if we consider how one comes to be corrupted by sin that hath had the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a modest and vertuous edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: if those who design to debauch him speak out at first in plain words what they aim at, a sudden horrour seizes upon him at the apprehension of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100318:82"/>
it, and it may be he hates their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for ever after. But there is so much a sense of shame left in humane nature, that men dare not tempt others to sin, at least at first, in plain terms; and the same temptation which being represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one way would affright, appearing with greater art and dissimulation may easily prevail. And sin is a thing, that men hate to be forced, but too much love to be cheated into the practice of it. How doth a young sinner struggle with himself, and would if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible get out of the noise of his own Conscience, when he hath offered force and violence to it! He is very uneasie to himself, and wisheth a thousand times he had never committed the sin, rather than to feel such horror and disquiet in his mind, upon the sense of it. But if this doth not make him presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and resolve never to be guilty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of the same folly, (as in all reason it ought to do) then by time and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany he wears off the impression of his guilt, and the next occasion of sinning makes him forget the wounds of his Conscience, and the smart he endured before; and the fresh temptation revives the sense of his former pleasure, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100318:82"/>
then he is able to withstand no longer; and thus by repeating the same acts, by degrees he becomes a very hopefull sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and the reports of his Conscience are but like that of sounds at a greater distance; they lessen still more and more, till at last they cannot be heard at all. And when he hath thus master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Conscience, as to any one sin, which at first he was fearfull of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and hath sound such an <hi>Ice</hi> upon his Conscience as will bear him, he goes on still farther and farther, till no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be too hard for him. He that at first started and trembled at the hearing of an horrid oath, now can hear whole volleys of them discharged without shrinking; and can bear his part in that hellish <hi>Concert:</hi> and he that was so hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to be wicked himself, may in a little time (as some men are strange proficients in wickedness) tempt and encourage others to the practice of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And when men are arrived to an habitual continuance in sin, then for their present ease and security, they cast about for any ways to defend it. For whatever is become of Conscience, they may have such a sense of reputation lest, that they would not be thought
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100318:83"/>
               <hi>Fools,</hi> and be contemned and despised by others. But although it be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for such to avoid scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt among all those who have any true regard to Vertue or Honour, yet they will endeavour rather to defend themselves in doing ill than recover their reputation by repentance. And because it would puzzle the wits of the most subtle and concerned persons to find out pretences and excuses for some kinds of sins; therefore the easiest way is to represent all the World as alike bad, although not alike cunning; and although it may be not in the same way, yet in something as ill in it self, but more agreeable to their Age, temper, and condition of life. Thus the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sinners love to herd themselves in a croud, and think it some poor defence for their sins, that they would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believed to be as bad as they: as though a man were in the less danger by the Plague, because it is a general Contagion. But if it happen that some persons in the World should have any reputation for vertue among them, then all the weaknesses, and indiscretions of such, are sure to be enquired after, that so what is accounted vertue, may be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100318:83"/>
thought only natural sourness of temper, or want of wit to be otherwise. But if any such should be found in a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, what Joy and Triumph doth this make? what load of circumstances and aggravations do they lay upon them; as though one single miscarriage of such persons were to weigh down a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand enormities of theirs. And because it is impossible to defend their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant courses by <hi>Reason,</hi> the only way left for them is to make <hi>Satyrical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives</hi> against <hi>Reason</hi>; as though it were the most uncertain, foolish and (I had almost said) <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing in the World: and yet they pretend to shew it in arguing against it: but it is pity such had not their wish, <hi>to have been Beasts rather than men,</hi> (if any men can make such a <hi>wish</hi> that have it not already) that they might have been less capable of doing mischief among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; by representing all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of humane nature, which are <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> but as more grave and solemn fopperies. But how hard are such men put to defend their vices, that cannot do it, without trampling under foot the most noble perfections of their own nature!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:100318:84"/>These however are the more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sort of sinners, that yield <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to be of <hi>Vertue</hi>'s side; but there are others that make use of some shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low pretences of <hi>Reason</hi> to excuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their sins: which is the second way whereby sin deceives men, <hi>viz.</hi>

But all this false way of reasoning ariseth from that gross piece of self-flattery that such do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine God to be like themselves; <hi>i. e.</hi> as cruel and revengefull as they are<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and they presently think, if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did offend them at the rate that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are said to offend God, and they had so much power in their hands to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them as he has, without any fear of revenge upon themselves, they would be sure to dispatch them presently<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but because they see God doth it not,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100318:85"/>
therefore they conclude that all the talk of God's anger and hatred against sin is without ground: and from hence they take encouragement to sin. So the Psalmist saith in God's name, <hi>These things thou didst and I kept silence</hi>;<note place="margin">Ps<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. Men are hardned by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of sin, from the hopes of their <hi>future repentance.</hi> For that is one of the great cheats of sin, that every one thinks he can repent and shake off his sins when he hath a mind to do it. Sin doth not lie like a heavy weight upon their backs, so that they feel the load of it; and therefore they think it is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed, if they would set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to it. Most of those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

a God and a judgment to come, and yet continue in sin, do it upon this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that one time or other, they shall leave their sins, and change the course of their lives before they go out of this world. They have not only thoughts of repentance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut general purposes of doing the acts of it at one time or other; but that time is not come, and God knows whether it ever will or no. For sin entices them and draws them on still; and when any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards repentance come into their minds, that presently suggests, <hi>It is time enough yet; why so much haste? there will be trouble enough in it when you must do it, what need you bring it so fast upon you? Are not you likely to hold out a great many years yet? what pity it is to lose so much of the pleasure of life, while you are capable of enjoying it? There is old Age coming, and when you will be good for nothing else, then will be time enough to grow wise and to repent.</hi> But O foolish sinner, who hath bewitched thee to hearken to such unreasonable suggestions as these are!

deceitfulness of sin.</hi> For to this end, it is not enough to consider of it at one time or other in our lives, but we must be <hi>exhorting one another daily, while it is called to day, lest any of us be hardned through the witchcraft and deceitfulness of sin:</hi> And if it be so much the duty of others to shew that regard to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers souls; how much more doth it become us to do it, who expect to be called to an account at the great day for the discharge of our trust in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? It is a dreadfull passage we read of in the <hi>Prophet Ezekiel,</hi> and enough to make our ears to tingle at the repeating it,<note place="margin">Ezek 33.8.</note> 
               <hi>When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man thou shalt surely die, if thou dost no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> We would fain believe this to have been some particular and extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission given to the Prophet by God himself, which doth not concern us; for what will become of us, if not only our own faults (which God knows are too many) but other mens shall be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon us? when either through neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or flattery, or fear of displeasing, or for any mean and unworthy ends, we
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100318:86"/>
betray our trust, and instead of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prove the occasion of mens being to much <hi>hardned through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin.</hi> But although we neither pretend to be <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Apostles,</hi> yet it is our Office to take care of the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, and can we discharge that, as we ought to do, if we do not with all faithfulness warn men of the danger they run into <hi>through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of sin?</hi> It were happy for us if we could say, <hi>that all the Lord's people are holy</hi>; for then we should have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do, but to praise and commend their Vertues, which were an easie and a delightfull task: but what pleasure is it to rake into the sores, or to reprove the Vices of a degenerate age? to be thought troublesome and impertinent, if we do our duty; and men of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, if we do it not? But our work is neither to libel our Auditors, nor to flatter them; neither to represent them as better, nor worse than they are; nor to charge them with more guilt than their own consciences do charge them with: but our business is, to beseech and exhort them by the mercies of God, by the sufferings of Christ, by the love and tenderness they have for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100318:87"/>
souls, that they <hi>would to day, while it is called to day, take heed lest they be hardned through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi> And that will appear to be very reasonable on these considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That none are out of the danger of it, while they live in this tempting World. What need have we to take care of being deceived by that, which hath been too hard for the <hi>best,</hi> the <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest,</hi> and the <hi>greatest</hi> of men? Man in his best state, even that of Innocency, was deceived by the insinuations of sin<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> when there was no matter within for the temptation to work upon, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suggested that could move a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, no interest or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that could sway him; no other moving cause appears to us of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Apostasie of <hi>Adam,</hi> but either the imagination of some unknown pleasure, or the bare curiosity of trying an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment what the effects would be of tasting the <hi>forbidden fruit.</hi> And ever since so general hath the corruption of mankind been, so successfull have the artifices and deceits of sin been in the World, that the best of men have not wholly escaped them; but have
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100318:87"/>
sometimes fallen in those very Graces which have been most remarkable in them, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in his trust in God, <hi>Moses</hi> in his meekness, <hi>Job</hi> in his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Peter</hi> in his zeal for Christ. What cause then have others to look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves!</p>
            <p>If wisdom and experience would have secured men, we should have thought, of all men in the World, <hi>Solomon</hi> the least in danger of being deceived by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations of sin, who had given such excellent cautions against those very snares he fell into himself; and that to such a degree, that his case is left dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable to this day, whether he ever recovered by repentance or no. What numbers are there upon record of those mighty men, who have made the earth to tremble at the noise of their Armies; who have led Kings in chains after their Triumphal Chariots, and have been served by those whom others have ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; yet have, notwithstanding all this, been enslaved themselves by some mean lust, and destroyed by the power of an effeminate passion? What can be strong enough to resist those charms, which neither innocency, nor wisdom, nor power are sufficient security against?
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100318:88"/>
Nothing, but the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual care of our selves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The less men suspect their danger, the more cause they have to be afraid of it. None are more fatally deceived by sin, than those who apprehend no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it, or think they can escape it when they please. How strangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated are those through <hi>the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of sin,</hi> who think with themselves, that after they have spent their lives in sin, they shall make God amends by a few dying groans, and such a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as can have <hi>no amendment of life?</hi> Most men, who are the greatest slaves to their sins, are so much deceived by them, as to think they have them whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at their command, and can when they please cast them off: and such ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations keep them faster in subjection to them. For if they did apprehend themselves under such slavery, as really they are, they would grow weary and impatient of the yoak; whereas now because they are not forced to commit their sins, they suppose they can with ease forsake them. But none are such incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fools, as they that think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Wise; and none are so miserably deceived, as they that think themselves
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100318:88"/>
too cunning for their sins. If it be so easie to shake off your sins, remember that your condemnation will be so much more just, if you do it not; for God required no hard thing for you to do: and if it be so easie, why is it not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done? Why do you mock God so often, and pretend every year to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and yet are every year as bad, if not worse than other? Why are not <hi>the fruits of repentance</hi> seen in the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life for one year, or a month, or one bare week? Is it not worth while to do so little for him, that hath done so much for you? Methinks, common ingenuity might prevail with men, at least to let God have some part of their lives entire to himself, without interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the Devil. But therein lies a great part of the <hi>deceitfulness of sin,</hi> that it falls out here, as in some malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Diseases, men seldom understand their danger, till they are almost past recovery.</p>
            <p n="3">3. None are so likely to be hardned in sin, as those who delay and put off their repentance. For the very putting it off is a sign that sin hath a greater power, than the convictions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100318:89"/>
for why should men ever intend to repent, if they did not think it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary? and if they think it necessary and yet do it not, it is plain there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within them stronger than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, which keeps them from it. So that he that intends to repent, and yet lives in sin, hath that aggravation of sin above others, that he sins against his Conscience all that time. Tell me then, O thou subtle sinner, that hopest to be too hard for God and for sin too, by enjoying thy sins as long as thou canst, and then repenting at last, to escape the vengeance of God: dost thou in good earnest intend ever to repent or no? If thou dost not, never deceive thy self; God will not accept these pretences and promises instead of real repentance. If thou dost intend it sincerely, what makes thee to intend it? is it not, that thou art convinced it is much better to be done than not, but canst not find it it in thy heart to do it yet? Thou knowest all this while it were much better to leave thy sins, than to live in them, it were far better to be sober, and temperate, and pious, and devout, than to be debauched and profane; and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:100318:89"/>
yet for all this, thou dost not repent, but goest on in the same course. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then, that this very circumstance deeply aggravates every sin that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after it. For it is not a bare neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of repentance. which thou are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, but a contempt of God and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; it is not only not repenting, but it is an obstinate and wilfull resolution of sinning: for there is no <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween living in sin and forsaking of it; and nothing deserves the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that is short of that. And if thou art so wilfull and unreasonable now, as notwithstanding thy resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to repent, to live still in thy sins, how canst thou ever hope to repent at last when thy heart will be so much more hardned by continuance in sin?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Lastly, Consider the sad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those who are hardned through the deceitfulness of sin. They are said in Scripture to be <hi>past feeling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100318:90"/>
other injury but to perswade them to be happy. With what disdain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt do those proud and lofty sinners, who are once arrived at this height of wickedness, look down upon all those, who endeavour by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> to convince them of their sins! As though it were not possible for any thing to make men seem more ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to them, than to see them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to plead the cause of Vertue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<q>To what purpose is all this about Repentance? why should not men be let alone to do as they think fit? for let them preach their hearts out, men will do as they please.</q>
This is the language of those who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy hardned in their sins; but God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, it should be so of any here present; who make it our prayer to God <hi>to be delivered from hardness of heart, and contempt of his word and commandments.</hi> And we have great reason so to do; for there is no judgment short of hell, like to the being given up to a <hi>reprobate sense:</hi> for all the most weighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and most forcible perswasions are to such but like showers falling upon a Rock, that make some noise and slide
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100318:90"/>
off again, but make no impression or entrance into them. <hi>God Almighty</hi> give us all his <hi>Grace</hi> to understand our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and to repent in time, that <hi>none of us be hardned through the deceitfulness of sin.</hi>

               <hi>yet the Counsel of the Lord that shall stand.</hi> We live in an Age not over prone to admire and take notice of any remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Divine Providence either in our preservation from dangers or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances out of them; for so great is the security of some men, that they are unwilling to apprehend any danger till they fall into it, and if they escape will hardly believe they were ever in it; and such is the concernment of others, to bassle all evidences of truth wherein their own guilt is involved, that they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100318:92"/>
all agree in robbing God of the honour of his Mercy, and our selves of the comfort of his Protection. But blessed be that God who hath hitherto defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the secret, and subtle, and cruel designs of his and our Churches ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and hath given us the liberty and opportunity of this day to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to implore the continuance of his favour and mercy towards us in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of his Majesty's person; for in praying for him, we pray for our selves, since our own welfare doth so much depend upon His.</p>
            <p>When we look back upon the <hi>History</hi> of this <hi>Church</hi> ever since the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of it, we may observe such a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull <hi>series</hi> of Divine Providence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with it, that we have the less reason to be discouraged with present difficulties, or disheartned with the fears of future dangers. What strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings did it meet with in the Birth? And although it were therein like <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob who took hold of the heel of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and at last obtained the blessing</hi>; yet the Romish party got the start <hi>like</hi> Esau,<note place="margin">Gen. 25.25.</note>

That God doth exercise a <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence</hi> with a respect to the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>Nations,</hi> i. e. as they are united into several and distinct bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are capable as such of being happy or miserable. For since man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinds entring into <hi>society</hi> is both neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and advantageous to them; and <hi>God</hi> doth not barely permit and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, but dispose and incline men to it; and hath given them <hi>Laws</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themselves by, with respect to <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>; it is but reasonable to suppose that <hi>God</hi> should call men to an account in that capacity; and to distribute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and punishments according to the nature of their actions; which must either be done in this world, or it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done at all; for all those bonds are dissolved by death, and men shall not answer for their sins by <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> in another world, <hi>but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man shall give an account of himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</hi> Either therefore those <hi>societies</hi>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100318:99"/>
as such shall go wholly unpunished, or they must suffer according to them in this world; and therefore here the case is very different from that of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Persons. We say, and with a great deal of reason, that it is no disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Justice of God's Providence for good men to suffer, or for wicked men to escape punishment in this Life, because the great day of recompence is to come, wherein there will be a <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the righteous judgment of God:</hi> But that will not hold as to <hi>Nations,</hi> who shall not suffer in communities then as they have sinned here: and therefore it is more reasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the rewards and punishments of such shall be in this life according to the measure and proportion of their sins.

            <p n="1">(1.) Because the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us of a certain <hi>Measure</hi> to which the <hi>sins</hi> of a Nation do rise before they are ripe for punishment. This was the reason given why <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children must stay to the fourth <hi>Generation</hi> before they come to the possession of the promised <hi>Land, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</hi>

               </note> Where it is plain that <hi>God</hi> doth consider Nations as distinct bodies, the measure of whose sins is taken after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother manner than that of particular persons; but when once that measure is compleated, ruin and destruction is unavoidable; or at least, some signal and extraordinary judgments falling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them as the punishment of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100318:101"/>
Men may ask why the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi> in <hi>Joshua</hi>'s time were dealt with so severely, that nothing but utter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation would satisfie the Justice of God against them? But God prevents that objection by letting <hi>Abraham</hi> know how much patience and long-suffering he used towards them, waiting till the fourth <hi>Generation</hi>; and when their <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities</hi> still encreased, and every Age added to the guilt of the foregoing, the burden grew too heavy for them to bear it any longer, and therefore they must sink under the weight of it. So our Saviour saith to the Jews in his time, <hi>Fill ye up then the measure of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 23.32.</note> Not as though God did punish any Age beyond the desert of its own sins; but when the measure of their sins is filled up, God doth no longer forbear to punish them; and that seldom happens, but when the sins of that time do exceed those of the foregoing <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; as it was in the case of the <hi>Jews</hi> when their <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>

the Prudent, and the resolution of the men of courage, that they all stand amazed and confounded, not knowing how to give or take advice; but they are full of fears, and rather apt to quarrel with one another than to consult the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good.

there was such an obstinate impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that neither God's Laws, nor the Prophet's threatnings, nor the Princes example could prevail upon them; all that his humiliation could obtain, was only a putting it off for his own time; and we have reason to think that their sins did hasten his end too; as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the sins of a people make the best of Princes to be taken away from them: and when the ten Tribes were carried captive, their King <hi>Hoshea</hi> is said,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 17.2.</note>

            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Absolutely,</hi> and that will appear, (1.)

            <p n="2">(2.) From its tendency to maintain <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>tranquillity</hi> at home; prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing private quarrels, by justice, and honesty, and temperance, and chastity; and publick disturbances by avoiding idleness, and debauchery, and bad prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which are the great nurseries of Rebellion; and teaching men quietness,

patience, due government of themselves, and obedience <hi>not only for wrath, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for Conscience sake.</hi> Whereas loose principles, and bad practices, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant desires naturally dispose men to endeavour changes and alterations, in hopes of bettering themselves by them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and the prevalency of Vice doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing Government, and weaken the strength and sinews of it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) From the keeping up the <hi>spirits,</hi> and securing the safety of men. A good Conscience makes a man dare to do his duty; but <hi>the sinners in Zion are afraid,</hi>

the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Assyria,</hi> as believing it as impossible to withstand his force, as <hi>to dwell with everlasting burnings</hi>; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is so far from granting this, that he tells them all their security lay in being just and honest, and doing their duty, and then they would be as safe, as if they had constant provision among the most inaccessible Rocks.

            <p>And upon these terms, we need no other proof of the truth of this assertion, than the instance in the <hi>Text</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi>; which will best appear by comparing the state of both <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> after the <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> was broken into the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah.</hi> The <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> by <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>'s Policy, and for <hi>Reason of State,</hi> fell off from the <hi>Worship</hi> of the true

            <p>Thus I have considered the influence which <hi>doing wickedly</hi> hath upon the <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:100318:116"/>
of a <hi>Nation,</hi> it remains now that I make Application of this to our own case.</p>
            <p>We have been a People that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived wonderfull Mercies and many signal Deliverances from God's hand. He hath placed us in a rich and fruitfull Land; and hath furnished us with so great plenty, that even that hath been thought our burden; hath blessed us with such an increase of Trade, that our Merchants far exceed those of <hi>Tyre</hi> both in Riches and Number. Our Ships of Trade are like a Valley of Cedars when they lie at home; and when they are abroad, they compass the earth, and make the riches of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West-Indies</hi> to meet in our Streets. And since like the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tyre, our seat is in the midst of the Seas,</hi> God hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by secured us from such sudden inroads and invasions of foreign Enemies as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our Neighbour Countries do groan under at this day: where the miseries of War are felt before they are seen; and those who thought themselves at ease and quiet, may be surprised in their Beds, and before they are aware of it may themselves, and Families, and Goods, and Houses, and Country
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100318:116"/>
be all burnt and consumed together. But God hath compassed us about with a deep Sea and a large Channel, and given us such a powerfull Navy as may be both a Defence at home and a Terror abroad.</p>
            <p>As to our civil Constitution, if we consider the admirable Temper of our Government, the Justice and Wisdom of our Laws, and the greatness of our Liberties, we have no reason to envy the condition of any people upon earth. And after all our intestine broils and confusions which our sins had brought upon us, God was pleased in a most surprising manner, without War or bloodshed, to our great satisfaction and the amazement of the World, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store our Sovereign to his Throne, our Church and People to their just Rights and Liberties. And while our Neighbour Nations have lamentably suffer'd under all the dismal effects of a lasting War, he hath enlarged our Trade, continued our Peace, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased our prosperity, after we had smarted under a dreadfull Fire, and a raging Pestilence. Thus far all things tend still to make us a happy Nation, if we did know and value our own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:100318:117"/>But that which above all other things should make us so, hath been the great Occasion of our Trouble, and is still of our Fears, and that is <hi>Religion.</hi> And yet in this respect we have advantages above any other <hi>Nation</hi> in the <hi>Christian World,</hi> having a <hi>Church</hi> reformed with so much <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> as to avoid the dangerous extreams on both sides. But even this hath enraged our <hi>Adversaries</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and made them the more restless to destroy it; and to stick at no means which they thought might tend to its ruin. <hi>O bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Jesus!</hi> that ever thy Holy Name should be assumed by <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi>; or that the promoting thy true <hi>Religion</hi> should be made the <hi>colour</hi> for the most wicked practices!</p>

Matter of <hi>Humiliation</hi> for our <hi>sins.</hi> Which have been many and great, and aggravated by all the <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath vouchsafed to us; and therefore he may be justly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to punish us proportionably to the measures of our ingratitude and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. Let us lay our hands upon our hearts this day, and seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>what requital we have made to the Lord for all the benefits he hath bestowed upon us</hi>? For the Light of his Truth, the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100318:119"/>
Purity of his Worship, the Power of his Grace, the Frequency of his Sacraments, the Influences of his Spirit, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance hitherto of our established Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in spite of all opposition what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. But have we not been guilty of too much sleighting that Truth, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that Worship, resisting that Grace, contemning those Sacraments, quenching that Spirit; and of too great coldness and indifferency about matters of Religion? I do not fear that ever the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should prevail among us by strength of Reason, or force of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, with all its specious colours and pretences, unless it be among those who understand neither one, nor the other Religion; but if men be loose in their principles, and unconcerned about <hi>Religion</hi> in general, there will not be courage and constancy enough to keep it out. I do much more fear <hi>Popery</hi> coming in at the back door of <hi>Atheism</hi> and <hi>Prophaneness</hi>; than under all its false and deceitfull pretences of <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality</hi> and <hi>Infallibility.</hi> And this those have been aware of, who have been so industriously sowing among us the seeds of <hi>Irreligion</hi>; knowing that if men be unconcerned as to all Religion, they will
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100318:120"/>
never have the courage to oppose any; but will be sure to close with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing side. Next to this, I know no greater advantage that they take against us, than from the unnatural heats and unchristian divisions which have been among us. If men were <hi>wise</hi> they would consider, <hi>at least in this our day, the things which do belong to our Peace.</hi> How can men answer it at the great day, if in such a critical time as this is, they stand upon little niceties and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio's of Honour rather than Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or upon keeping up the interests of their several Parties, and do not those things which themselves think they law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully may do towards an <hi>Vnion</hi> with us? I pray God, the continuance of these breaches may not look like an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divine Infatuation upon us. But what can we say to that looseness and debauchery of manners, to that riot and luxury, to that wantonness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, to that fashion of customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry swearing, and <hi>Atheistick Drollery,</hi> which have been so much and so justly complained of among us? I hope there are many thousands at this day in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whose souls abhor the abominations that are committed, and who mourn in
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:100318:120"/>
secret for them,</hi> and therefore our case may not be so desperate as that of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> was. May we all this day so heartily repent of all these follies and impieties, that the Cause of our Fears which our sins give us being removed, we may hearken</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) To the matter of <hi>Advice</hi> here given, <hi>Only to fear the Lord, and to serve him in Truth, and with all our heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As though <hi>Samuel</hi> had said, Your hearts stand trembling still at the fear of God's judgments, when he doth but <hi>lift up his voice in the Thunder,</hi> and shew his Power in the Rain; I will tell you, how your hearts may <hi>be at ease and quiet from the fear of evil</hi>; Be faithfull to God, maintain and practise the true Religion, sincerely, diligently, constantly, universally, and never doubt his protection of you, let your enemies be never so many, or your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers never so great. Nothing exposes men more to the Wrath and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of God, nor provokes him more to leave a People to their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, than false heartedness in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Hypocrisie do. For the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite thinks to put a trick upon
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100318:121"/>
God Almighty; and while he seems to carry it fair towards him, he is deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underhand for his own security a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way: And God is then concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in honour to let the world see <hi>he will not be mocked</hi>; for he knows how <hi>to take the crafty in their own devices</hi>; and very often brings to nought the most politick fetches of self-designing men. For when men seek themselves, and not the honour of God or Religion, but are ready to betray what ought to be dearer than their lives, for some mean and private interests of their own, they are oft-times so far from compassing their ends, that they become the Scorn and Reproach of men. But if men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their integrity, and <hi>hold fast to the thing that is right,</hi> they preserve their honour, even among their enemies, and either escape troubles, or have the comfort of a good Conscience under them, and however things happen to them for a while, <hi>they are sure to have peace at the last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Lastly, Here is matter of <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement. For consider what great things he hath done for you.</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 8.</note> 
               <hi>When Jacob was sent into Egypt, and your Fathers cried unto the Lord, then the Lord sent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100318:121"/>
and Aaron which brought our Fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</hi> When their sins had brought them into great distresses afterwards, <hi>and they cryed unto the Lord and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their sins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 9</note> then <hi>the Lord raised up Jerubbaal and Bedan, and Jepthah,</hi>

               <hi>and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.</hi> Now consider, the same God who did those things, can do as great for you still; for his Power, and Wisdom, and Goodness are the same, and therefore you have the greatest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to put your trust in him at all times,<note place="margin">Psal. 9.10.</note> since <hi>he never forsakes them that seek him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed</hi> be <hi>God</hi> that we have this day a farther argument for us <hi>to fear and serve him in truth, and with all our heart, by considering what great things he hath done for us.</hi> Many deliverances hath he wrought for us time after time, for which we ought still to be thankfull, since we yet enjoy the benefit of them. But the memory of former deliverances was almost worn out with many, and some began to question whether such holy and innocent men as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> could be guilty of such
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100318:122"/>
horrid conspiracies; some were so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> that the Vipers seemed to have changed their natures and to have lost their teeth, and to be a very soft and innocent kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Insomuch, that they were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought to believe there could be a plot among them, especially of so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid a nature as this appears more and more to have been, when such a vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood were suffer'd not only to lie quiet in the Shade, but to sport themselves in the Sun, and to enjoy the freedom of their own retreats. But God doth bring to light the hidden things of darkness by such ways as shew his Providence, more than our prudence and foresight, that while we have the comfort, he alone may have the glory of our deliverance. But yet methinks we stand as it were upon the brink of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Precipice, which is so full of horror that we tremble to look down from it; we are at present held up by a strong hand, but as by one single thread, and can we then think our selves secure from so great a danger?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Blessed</hi> be <hi>God</hi> for that Unanimity, that Zeal, that Courage, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy You have hitherto shewed in the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100318:122"/>
maintenance of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; but there is so much yet to be done for a firm <hi>Establishment</hi> of it to all <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi> (which now by his <hi>Majesty's Gracious</hi> favour is put into your hands) as calls for all our Prayers, and your particular Care, lest if this opportunity be let slip, you never have such another.</p>
            <p>This seems to be an <hi>Honour</hi> reserved for this <hi>Parliament,</hi> as the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of all your endeavours for the <hi>Publick Good.</hi> Go on then, to raise up this <hi>Monument</hi> to your <hi>Eternal Fame.</hi> This will not only make you beloved and esteemed by the present Age, but this will endear your <hi>Memories</hi> to <hi>Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and make <hi>Ages to come rise up</hi> and call this a <hi>Happy Session.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest our sins should yet hinder us from so great a <hi>Blessing,</hi> We have great reason to humble our selves before God this day, to bewail those sins which may yet provoke him to punish us, and by Fasting and Prayer to implore his Mercy; that he would go on to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Majesty's Person from all vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent attempts, our Church and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from all the designs of its enemies, and deliver us all from <hi>Vnreasonable and Wicked Men.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter we read of one of the greatest and most improbable designs that ever was, <hi>viz. Christ</hi>'s sending out his twelve <hi>Apostles</hi> to convert and to reform the World. For although the occasion of
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100318:123"/>
their first <hi>Mission,</hi> was to prepare the Jewish Nation for entertaining the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Messias, and therefore they are commanded <hi>to go to the lost sheep of the House of Israel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 6.</note> 
               <hi>and as they went to preach; saying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 7.</note> 
               <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand</hi>; yet our Saviour in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing discourse mentions several things which cannot be applied to their first going abroad; particularly, that which relates to their hard usage and bad en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment from the world; which we do not find they met with from the Jews upon this general message, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary: for which cause he bids them <hi>to provide nothing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 9, 10, 11.</note> foreseeing that in all places there would be some that would be ready to receive them kindly; and when the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Disciples</hi> were sent upon a like errand, <hi>they returned with joy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 10 17</note> which such young beginners would hardly have done, if they had met with such sharp persecutions then, which Christ here foretells his <hi>Apostles</hi> should suffer for preaching the Gospel. Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must say that St. <hi>Matthew</hi> puts things together by way of common Place, as he seems to do the <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Parables</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> without
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100318:124"/>
pursuing the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> as S. <hi>Luke</hi> doth, and so upon occasion of <hi>Christ's sending out his Apostles</hi> sets down all that relates to their <hi>Mission,</hi> although delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at several times; or else that Christ himself did now at first acquaint them with all the difficulties that should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their imployment in preaching the <hi>Gospel</hi> to the world, and consequently thought it necessary to give them at once their full instructions for their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of so great a trust, and due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour under so hard a service. A trust indeed so great, a service so hard as to require the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of an <hi>Angel,</hi> and the <hi>Innocency</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradise</hi>; so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were the difficulties, so powerfull were the prejudices, so dangerous were the snares and temptations, which in all places did hinder the success of so great a Work. We are apt to admire and applaud the mighty conquests which men do make over some small parts of the world, by the subtilty of their Wit, or by the force of their Arms, or by the vastness of their Treasure; but in all these cases, there is nothing wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; for the causes being supposed, there is at least a great probability the event should follow<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But for twelve inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100318:124"/>
persons, as to all outward circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, without craft, without arms, without money, to undertake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the world, by changing not only mens opinions as to Religion, but which is far more uneasie, the hearts and lives of men; seems at first appearance so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely a thing, that though none but very wise men could hope to manage it, yet none who were thought so would ever undertake it. Yet no less than this was the work which <hi>Christ</hi> sent abroad his <hi>twelve Apostles</hi> upon; and he tells them, very little to their comfort, what hardship they were like to meet with, <hi>to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by friends, persecuted by enemies,</hi>

               <hi>and hated of all men for his names sake:</hi> yea so great would the rage and malice and cruelty of men be against them, that he saith in the beginning of this verse, <hi>Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of Wolves.</hi> What! to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and devoured by them? No, but to turn those very <hi>Wolves</hi> into <hi>sheep.</hi> But what powerfull charms must they use to secure themselves from present danger, and to work such mighty change? no other than those which our Saviour recommends in the words of the Text, <hi>Be ye therefore wise as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100318:125"/>
and harmless as Doves.</hi> Not as though we were to search all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Doves</hi> to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the meaning of these words, and to determine the truth or falshood of all the relations that are made concerning both of them; but as <hi>Solomon</hi> chose the <hi>Ant</hi> for an example of <hi>diligence,</hi> so our Saviour designing to joyn <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi> together proposes the <hi>Serpent</hi> for one and the <hi>Dove</hi> for the other; to let his <hi>Disciples</hi> understand that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them so much <hi>Wisdom</hi> as is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with <hi>innocency,</hi> and perswades them to no more <hi>simplicity</hi> than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with <hi>Wisdom.</hi> For Wisdom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Innocency turns into craft and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and Simplicity without Wisdom is meer folly.</p>
            <p>But the great difficulty lies in the joyning these two together. For as the world goes and is like to do, men will be apt to say, How can those be <hi>as wise as Serpents,</hi> who must be <hi>as harmless as Doves?</hi> If all the world were agreed in the practice of innocency, and men did not fare the worse for it, it might pass for <hi>Wisdom</hi>; but when they have to deal with others who will use all the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> and are so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100318:125"/>
               <hi>harmless as Doves,</hi> that they will take all the advantages that mens inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and simplicity gives them, it seems hard to reconcile these two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To what purpose, may some say, are mens eyes bid to be open, when their hands are tied up? Had they not better be without the Serpent's sagacity and quickness of sight, than espy their dangers, and not use the most likely means to prevent them? What doth the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the <hi>Dove</hi> signifie, but to make them a more easie quarry for the birds of prey? Simplicity, and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and patience, which our Saviour recommends under the phrase of being <hi>harmless as Doves,</hi> are good lessons for another world, but what do they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie in this, which is made up of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but artifice and fraud, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the great art and business of life seems to be over-reaching and deceiving one another? Those only seem to have the true subtilty of the <hi>Serpent</hi> who can turn and wind themselves every way as makes most for their advantage; who by their soft and easie motions, by their artificial glidings and insinuations get an interest great enough to mischief while they watch for an opportunity to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100318:126"/>
do it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.3. <hi>Ramirez de Prado Pentecont. c.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>As the Serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, i. e.</hi> say the <hi>Fathers</hi> by the familiarity and easiness of access which he had, playing, as some fancy, about the Neck and Arms of <hi>Eve</hi> in the state of Innocency. Those have the true subtilty of the <hi>Serpent</hi> who <hi>creep into houses</hi> and understand the secrets of persons and families; and so know how to address, and how to keep in awe: who seem <hi>as harmless as Doves</hi> till they have a fair opportunity of instilling their poison, and do the greater mischief by being thought so innocent. Who have the dangerous teeth and the double tongue, who can deny the Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lying, and forswear themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perjury; who would sanctifie the greatest villainies by their good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and when they are <hi>ravenous</hi> as <hi>Wolves,</hi> and as <hi>cruel</hi> as <hi>Vultures,</hi> would yet be thought <hi>as harmless as Doves,</hi> or as innocent <hi>as a Child new born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What now can simplicity and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and meekness, and patience sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie against all this serpentine subtilty? And if you take away from the Serpent his artificial motion and his poison, you leave him weak and contemptible, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be trampled on by every passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100318:126"/>
having nothing to defend himself but his skin and eye-sight. And if you do allow his most natural properties, the innocency of the Dove is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal match for him if they be opposed, and seem of so different natures that they can hardly be joyned together in the same subject.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding all these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, it was certainly the design of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in these words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To recommend the <hi>conjunction</hi> and <hi>union</hi> of these two to his disciples, <hi>being wise as Serpents, and harmless as Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To do it chiefly upon this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that this would be the best means to promote his Religion against all the arts and designs of men, as well as the best security for themselves.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the prosecuting this subject, I shall endeavour these two things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To shew wherein the <hi>conjunction</hi> of these two doth consist.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this is the best <hi>means</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> against all the mischievous arts and devices of men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Wherein the <hi>conjunction</hi> of these two doth consist. It is no hard matter
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100318:127"/>
to tell men how they may be <hi>wise as Serpents, &amp;c.</hi> By foresight and caution, so as to discern and prevent unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangers; not to run themselves soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly and vainly upon needless troubles, nor to draw persecutions upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when they can decently and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoid them; not to give advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to their enemies by their weakness and indiscretion, nor a just occasion of offence to any; but in all lawfull things to endeavour to gain upon them, and by all acts of kindness and charity to recommend our Religion to them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it hard to tell wherein we must appear to be <hi>harmless as Doves, viz.</hi> by simplicity and integrity of mind, by meekness and patien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, by forgiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, and bearing persecutions as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Christians,</hi> by a holy, innocent, and unblameable conversation: but the difficulty still lies in the <hi>conjunction</hi> and <hi>mixture</hi> of both these; which as S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostom</hi> observes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Chrysost. in loc.</hi>
               </note> is the thing which Christ especially aims at, so as to make one vertue arise from both of them; as <hi>Greg. Nazianzen</hi> said of his Father,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That he neither suffered the Wisdom of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to degenerate into cunning, nor the innocency of the Dove into indiscretion,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100318:127"/>
but made up one compleat kind of vertue from the mixture of both together</hi>; and that I suppose lies in these things, (1.) <hi>Integrity of Mind,</hi> (2.) <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> or fairness of behaviour, (3.) <hi>Meekness and Patience:</hi> and in the due practice of these consists that <hi>prudent Simplicity</hi> which results from these two, <hi>being wise as Serpents, and harmless as Doves.</hi> Which I shall make appear by shewing, that men cannot be <hi>harmless as Doves</hi> without them; and that they are so far from being inconsistent with being <hi>wise as Serpents,</hi> that a great part of <hi>Wisdom</hi> lies in them.</p>

            <p>All this seems a strange Paradox, and to come from such as are not versed in business, nor acquainted with affairs of the world, or from those who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to maintain their hypothesis, though against the common sense of mankind, as the Stoicks of old, who made their Wise man beautifull though never so deformed, rich though ready to starve for poverty, and a Prince though sold for a slave; just thus doth it seem to some men to talk of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency of Wisdom and Simplicity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or to suppose those take the most prudent care of their own interest, who are tied up to the strict rules of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right honesty, and are resolved with <hi>Job to hold fast their integrity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that there is nothing absurd or unreasonable in this supposition, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is true, and may be justified by the common sense and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100318:129"/>
of mankind will appear by these considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That is the truest Wisdom of a man which doth most conduce to the happiness of life. For Wisdom as it referrs to action lies in the proposal of a right end, and the choice of the most proper means to attain it. Which end doth not referr to any one part of a man's life, but to the whole as taken together. He therefore only deserves the name of a Wise Man, not that considers how to be rich and great when he is poor and mean, nor how to be well when he is sick, nor how to escape a present danger, nor how to compass a particular design; but he that considers the whole course of his life together, and what is fit for him to make the end of it, and by what means he may best enjoy the happiness of it. I confess it is one great part of a wise man never to propose too much happiness to himself here; for whoever doth so, is sure to find himself deceiv'd, and consequently is so much more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable as he fails in his greatest expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. But since God did not make men on purpose to be miserable, since there is a great difference as to mens conditions, since that difference de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100318:129"/>
very much on their own choice, there is a great deal of reason to place true wisdom in the choice of those things which tend most to the comfort and happiness of life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which gives a man the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est satisfaction in what he doth, and either prevents or lessens or makes him more easily bear the troubles of life, doth the most conduce to the happiness of it. It was a bold saying of <hi>Epicurus, That it is more desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>eable to be miserable by acting according to reason, than to be happy in going against it</hi>; and I cannot tell how it can well agree with his noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of felicity: but it is a certain truth, that in the consideration of happiness, the satisfaction of a man's own mind doth weigh down all the external acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of life. For, suppose a man to have riches and honours as great as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hashuerus</hi> bestowed on his highest favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <hi>Haman</hi>; yet by his sad instance we find that a small discontent when the mind suffers it to encrease and to spread its venom, doth so weaken the power of reason, disorder the passions, make a man's life so uneasie to him, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate him from the height of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune into the depth of ruin. But on the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100318:130"/>
other side if we suppose a man to be always pleased with his condition, to enjoy an even and quiet mind in every state, being neither lifted up with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity, nor cast down with adversity, he is really happy in comparison with the other. It is a mere speculation to discourse of any compleat happiness in this world; but that which doth either lessen the number, or abate the weight, or take off the malignity of the troubles of life, doth contribute very much to that degree of happiness which may be expected here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The integrity and simplicity of a man's mind doth all this. (1.) It gives the greatest satisfaction to a man's own mind. For although it be impossible for a man not to be liable to error and mistake, yet if he doth mistake with an innocent mind, he hath the comfort of his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, when he thinks himself bound to correct his error. But if a man preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricates with himself and acts against the sense of his own mind, though his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science did not judge aright at that time, yet the goodness of the bare act with respect to the rule, will not prevent the sting that follows the want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward integrity in doing it. <hi>The back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slider
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100318:130"/>
in heart,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14.14.</note> 
               <hi>shall be filled with his own ways, but a good man shall be satisfied from himself.</hi> The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing just and worthy and generous things without any sinister ends and designs, leaves a most agreeable pleasure to the mind, like that of a constant health which is better felt than expressed. When a man applies his mind to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his duty, and when he doth understand it, (as it is not hard for an honest mind to do, for as the <hi>Oracle</hi> answered the Servant who desired to know how he might please his Master,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clem. Alex. Str.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>If you will seek it, you will be sure to find it,</hi>) sets himself with a firm resolution to pursue it, <hi>though the rain falls, and the floods arise, and the winds blow on every side of him,</hi> yet he enjoys peace and quiet within, notwithstanding all the noise and blustring abroad; and is sure to hold out after all, because he is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a rock. But take one that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to blind, or corrupt or master his conscience, to make it serve some mean end or design; what uneasie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections hath he upon himself, what per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexing thoughts, what tormenting fears, what suspicious and jealousies do disturb his imagination and rack his mind? what
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:100318:131"/>
art and pains doth such a one take to be believed honest and sincere? and so much the more, because he doth not believe himself: He fears still he hath not given satisfaction enough, and by overdoing it, is the more suspected. It is a very unsatisfactory imployment that man hath who undertakes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade others of the truth of that which himself at the same time knows to be false; for he is not convinced by his own arguments, and therefore despises those that are, and is afraid of those that seem to be; either he thinks them fools for believing him, or that they only flatter and seem to believe when they do not; and then he thinks his arts are understood and his credit lost, and fears while he goes about to impose upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they may do the same by him. So that unless he could see into the hearts of men, (which would be no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfortable sight to him) all his craft and subtilty must leave him under perplexity and continual fear. But sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that through over officiousness he happens to take some false step, and so fall into the disfavour of those whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all he desired to please; how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable is that man's condition when he
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:100318:131"/>
finds himself forsaken of God, despised by men, and without any peace or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment within? (2.) Because integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth more become a man, and doth really promote his interest in the World. It is the saying of <hi>Dio Chrysostom</hi> an Heathen Orator,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dio Chrys<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> de regn. or.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>that Simplicity and Truth is a great and wise thing; but Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Deceit is foolish and mean; For,</hi> saith he, <hi>observe the beasts, the more courage and spirit they have, the less art and subtilty they use; but the more timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ignoble they are, the more false and deceitfull.</hi> True Wisdom and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind raises a man above the need of using little tricks and devices. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and honesty carries one through many difficulties which all the arts he can invent would never help him through. For nothing doth a man more real mischief in the world than to be suspected for too much craft; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every one stands upon his guard against him, and suspects plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs where there are none intended; insomuch that though he speaks with all the sincerity that is possible, yet nothing he saith can be believed. And is this any part of true wisdom to lose reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon which mens power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100318:132"/>
so much depends? From hence the most artificial men have found it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to put on a guise of simplicity and plainness, and make greatest protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their honesty when they most lie in wait to deceive. If then the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of integrity be so necessary, the main point to be considered as to wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is this, whether such reputation can be sooner gained and longer held by mere pretending to simplicity, or by the practice of it? He that only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to it, must act otherwise than he designs, and yet is concerned to make others believe he doth not: but in this he puts a force and constraint upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self which is uneasie to any man, and he lets the vizard fall off sometimes when it is more observed than he thinks, and then his countenance is taken at the greatest disadvantage, and this is given out for the only true Copy. And while he keeps it on, it is a hard matter to deceive all eyes; for it may be some by-standers have practised the same arts themselves, and they know the make and the fashion, and all the several strings which help to keep it from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling off: and when the suspicion grows strong, the laying aside the disguise
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:100318:132"/>
will not be able to give satisfaction. But <hi>he that walketh uprightly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 15.2.</note> 
               <hi>and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> describeth the practice of integrity, may possibly meet with such as will be ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for hypocrisie at first; but when they find he keeps to a certain rule, and pursues honest designs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great regard to the opinion which others entertain concerning him; then all that know him cannot but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem and value him; his friends love him, and his enemies stand in awe of him. <hi>The path of the just,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 4.18Â·</note> saith the Wise man, <hi>is as the shining light which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> As the day begins with obscurity and a great mixture of darkness, till by quick and silent motions the light overcomes the mists and vapours of the night, and not only spreads its beams upon the tops of the Mountains, but darts them into the deepest and most shady Valleys: thus simplicity and integrity may at first appearing look dark and suspicious, till by degrees it breaks through the clouds of envy and detraction, and then shines with a greater glory. Thus the Christian Simplicity was despised and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100318:133"/>
reproached as folly and obstinacy, and many hard censures and sharp persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did men undergo for the sake of it for a long time, (as the most dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Kingdoms have had the sharpest pangs and been the longest in the birth:) but at last persecuted and despised inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency prevailed over all the craft and power of the World. It was then the great glory of Christians that their enemies could reproach them for nothing but their Religion; that they were in all other things honest and good men, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were Christians: and then true Religion is most like to prevail in the world, when mens other vertues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Religion, and not when zeal for their Religion is their only vertue. When righteousness, and peace, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and charity, and temperance, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and a constant integrity make men enquire after a Religion which produces such fruits as these are, then it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Apostles and preachers of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are then <hi>wise as Serpents</hi> as to the promoting the honour of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, when by the innocency and simplicity of their lives they are <hi>harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:100318:133"/>(3.) But suppose that troubles and persecutions do arise, what becomes of the <hi>harmless Doves</hi> then? they are soon taken and easily destroyed, when those who are only <hi>wise as Serpents</hi> may see many ways to escape danger, which the innocent Doves dare not follow them in; what wisdom then can there be in so much simplicity as makes suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering unavoidable?</p>
            <p>This is the hardest part of the case, but that which our Saviour doth here suppose, when he saith, <hi>Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of Wolves; be ye therefore wise as Serpents,</hi> &amp;c. So that, if we cannot make out this to hold in respect of sufferings, we must yield this counsel or advice of Christ to his Disciples to be defective as to the main occasion of it. To this therefore I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer in these particulars;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Saviour doth allow the <hi>wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of <hi>prevention</hi> as to all unnecessary dangers; for otherwise he would never have bid his Disciples <hi>be wise as Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> but only be <hi>as quiet as Sheep and as harmless as Doves.</hi> God forbid that Christian simplicity should be taken in so ill a sense as to hinder us from a just and necessary care of our own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100318:134"/>
and not only for the preservation of our selves but of our Religion too. When we have liberty and opportunity to do it, it is being stupid as Sheep, and careless as the Ravens of their young ones, and not being only <hi>harmless as Doves,</hi> to neglect the doing it. In such a case it is a violation of the duty we owe to God and to Posterity, if we do not use all lawfull endeavours for the preservation of our selves and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from all the attempts of wicked and unreasonable men. But in case storms do arise after all our care, Christ doth not seem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>But when they persecute you in this City, flee to another.</hi> And some say, the likeness to Doves is recommended in regard that its safety lies chiefly in the quickness of its flight. But our Saviour neither imposes a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of suffering in all cases, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a liberty of flying upon every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of danger, but leaves this matter to be determined according to circumstances, as makes most for God's honour, and his Church's good: <hi>i. e.</hi> herein to be <hi>wise as Serpents and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less as Doves</hi>; by not exposing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

to needless dangers when they may be avoided with a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor declining any necessary duty for the sake of any trouble which may follow upon it. There were some in the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> who thought it unlawfull in any case to avoid persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> pleads their cause with many plausible reasons; saying, <hi>That persecution is designed on purpose for tryal by God himself;</hi>

               <hi>that the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for flying was peculiar to the Apostles case, not to avoid persecution, but for the more speedy propagation of the Gospel</hi>; and some of the Christians were so far from flying that they ran upon persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and seemed ambitious of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

Whereas the other <hi>Apostles</hi> whose chief care was to preserve their innocency as to any wilfull sins, though they had too much of the <hi>fearfulness</hi> as well as the <hi>simplicity</hi> of <hi>Doves,</hi> till the descent of the Holy Ghost upon them; yet they held out in the midst of fears and dangers, and came at last <hi>to rejoyce in their sufferings.</hi>

is this, the testimony of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that in simplicity, and godly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world.</hi> See here, not only what peace and serenity, but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing follows an innocent mind, and the testimony of a good conscience! when all the arts of fleshly Wisdom will be found vain and useless, affording no satisfaction to a man's mind, when he looks back upon all of them, then sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and integrity of heart will give a man the most comfortable reflections, and fill him with the most joyfull expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations. This enables a man to look back without horror, to look about him without shame, to look within without confusion, and to look forward without despondency. So that as the streight line is the shortest of any; so upon greatest consideration it will be found that the upright and sincere man takes the nearest way to his own happiness.</p>

Not that men are bound to declare all they know to every impertinent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, which is <hi>simplicity</hi> without <hi>prudence</hi>; but in all cases wherein men ought to declare their minds, to do it without <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>dissimulation</hi>; and in no case to design to over-reach and deceive others.

When the cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some few grains of incense on the altar, and pouring out wine before the Emperor's statue might have saved their lives, they chose rather to die than to defile their consciences with that impure and idolatrous Worship.<note place="margin">

When
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100318:138"/>
the Christians were summoned before the Heathen Tribunals, they used no <hi>shifting tricks or evasions,</hi> they conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no part in their minds of what was necessary to make what they spake to be true; they did not first peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny what they knew to be true, and then back such a denial with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid oaths and dreadfull imprecations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themselves, and after all think to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the doing so by vertue of some <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reservation</hi> in their own minds.

I think indeed scarce any who went under the name of <hi>honest Heathens</hi> ever did it. For they did not only require constancy and fidelity in oaths and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, but simplicity and sincerity both in the making and keeping of them. They condemned the <hi>Romans</hi> who thought to avoid their oath by a trick,<note place="margin">

to confess any thing to the prejudice of the Catholick Cause; nor to answer according to the intention of the Judge, but in some true sense of his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we not only see the doctrine and practice of equivocation approved by the <hi>Holy See,</hi> but all <hi>legal Authority</hi> among us utterly rejected as having no <hi>jurisdiction</hi> over them. And all who allow this practice do thereby discover that what they call <hi>Heresie</hi> doth take away the civil <hi>Rights and Properties of men.</hi> For if <hi>Heresie</hi> makes our <hi>Judges incompetent,</hi> by necessary consequence it must deprive the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>right</hi> to his <hi>Throne,</hi> it must take away all the <hi>obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of our <hi>Laws,</hi> and the title every man hath to his estate. Such pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consequences do follow the <hi>wisdom of the Serpent,</hi> where it is not joyned with the <hi>innocence and simplicity of the Dove:</hi> and not only <hi>pernicious</hi> to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> but to <hi>themselves</hi> too when these arts are understood and discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for what security can there be from the most solemn oaths, the most deep and serious protestations of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who at the same time believe that none of these things do bind them, but by some secret reserve they may turn
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100318:149"/>
the sense quite another way than we imagined, and when they pretend the greatest <hi>simplicity</hi> and seem to renounce all <hi>equivocation,</hi> may then <hi>equivocate</hi> the most of all? If men had invented ways to fill the world with perpetual jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and suspicions of their practices and intentions, they could never have thought of any more effectual than these two, that <hi>Heresie,</hi> or differing in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from them, deprives them of their civil rights, and that they may deny what is true, and swear to what is false, and promise what they never mean to perform by vertue of some secret reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in their minds. How can they live as fellow-subjects with others who do not own the same Authority, the same Laws, the same Magistrates, who look on all <hi>Hereticks</hi> in a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surpation,</hi> and all judicial proceedings against them as meer force and violence, and parallel the case of answering in our <hi>Courts</hi> with that of <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to <hi>Thieves</hi> and <hi>Robbers?</hi>

they fall heavily upon those that use them. For although frost and fraud may hold for a while, yet according to the true saying, they both have dirty ends.

And that there might be no colour for any such cavil against <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> no Religion that ever was, did so much inforce the duty of obedience as <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> did, and that upon the greatest and most weighty considerations,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>for conscience sake, for the Lord's sake,</hi> for their Religions sake. For, consider I pray, if the Doctrine of Christ had given encouragement to faction and rebellion under pretence of it, if <hi>S. Peter</hi> himself had taken upon him to dispose of Crowns and Scepters, or had <hi>absolved Christians from their Allegiance,</hi> even to their greatest persecutors, what a <hi>blot</hi> this had been upon the whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, such as all the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> could never have washed off. For it would have made the condition of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more precarious, and the duty of Subjects more loose and uncertain, and all Nations that regarded their own peace and safety shy of entertaining a Doctrine which would give so much countenance to Rebellion. And yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the causes alledged for the persecution of <hi>Christians,</hi> this was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once suggested, which would not have been omitted (if any such thing had been owned by the <hi>Christians</hi>) by
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:100318:153"/>
persons so jealous of their Power, as the <hi>Roman Emperours</hi> were. It is an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reproach to Christianity to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute their patient submission to Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>to their weakness and want of force:</hi>

                  <hi>Bell. de Rom. Pont. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> which is all one as to say, they would have resisted if they durst: this is not to make them <hi>harmless as Doves,</hi> but to have too much of the <hi>subtilty</hi> of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> in pretending to be innocent when they only wanted an opportunity to do mischief.</p>
            <p>But the security the <hi>Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> gave to <hi>Government</hi> was from the principles and precepts of it, the design of its Doctrine as well as the practice of its followers. So that if their Religion were true, it did oblige them to all acts of charity and kindness, to meekness and patience, to peaceableness and a quiet and prudent behaviour in all the changes of humane affairs.</p>
            <p>From what hath been already said, it is no hard matter to understand the <hi>Reason</hi> why our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave such dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and made choice of such means to promote his <hi>Religion</hi>; because they would hereby see, that he sent not his <hi>Apostles</hi> upon any ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or secular design, not to disturb
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100318:154"/>
Governments upon pretence of setting up a new <hi>Monarchy</hi> in it either of <hi>Christ</hi> or his pretended <hi>Vicar</hi>; but to prepare men for another World <hi>by the Love of God and our Neighbour,</hi> by subduing our lusts and taking off our affections from present things; and because he knew what persecutions would follow his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, he adviseth his Disciples neither to suffer as <hi>Fools,</hi> nor as <hi>evil-doers,</hi> but <hi>to be wise as Serpents and harmless as Doves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let no man then think our Religion weakens their understanding, or impairs their discretion, or puts men upon do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foolish and imprudent things. As it is founded on the best reason, so it brings men to the best temper, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns their actions by rules of the truest Wisdom; not only as it provides for the most desirable end in another world, but even in this, it secures most the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, interest and safety of men; and if circumstances happen to be hard here, it gives the highest assurance of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and eternal recompence. But if men under a pretence of zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do wicked things, and carry on trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous and malicious designs, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of directing men's Consciences in

            <p>ALthough the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> doth lay the greatest obligations on mankind to <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> by the strictest commands, the highest

               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> than the <hi>Vniversal Peace</hi> of the <hi>Christian World.</hi> Not that there is any impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the thing, or any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable difficulty, if all men were such Christians as they ought to be; but as long as men pursue their several factions and designs under the colour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of zeal for Religion; if they did not find Names and Parties ready fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that were suitable to their ends, the difference of their designs would make them. So that till mens corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions are mortified, and their passions subdued to a greater degree than the world hath yet found them, it is in vain to expect a state of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity in the Church. We need not go far from home for a sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this; for although our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are such as the wiser Protestants abroad not only condemn but wonder at them; yet it hath hitherto puzzled the wisest persons among us to find out ways to compose them; not so much

after the things that make for peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.19.</note> 
               <hi>and things wherewith one may edifie ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; and not such as tend to our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual destruction; as most certainly our divisions and animosities do. Yet all parties pretend to a zeal for Peace, so they may have it in their own way: by which it appears that it is not Peace they aim at, but Victory; nor Unity so much as having their own wills. Those of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> make great boasts of their Unity and the effectual means they have to preserve it; but God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us from such cruel ways of Peace, and such destructive means of Unity as Treachery and Assassinations, and an Inquisition.<note place="margin">Rom. 3.15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Their feet are swift to shed blood; destruction and misery are in their ways; and the way of peace they have not known.</hi> But it were happy for us, if all those who agree in renouncing the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Corruptions of the Roman Church, could as easily joyn together in the great duties of our common Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that is, in our Prayers, and Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and Sacraments, and all solemn acts of Divine Worship. For this would not only take off the reproach of our Adversaries, who continually upbraid us with our Schisms and Separations,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100318:157"/>
but it would mightily tend to abate mens passions, and to remove their prejudices, and to dispose their inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thereby lay a foundation for a blessed Union among our selves, which would frustrate the great design of our enemies upon us, who expect to see that Religion destroyed by our own folly, which they could not otherwise hope to accomplish by their utmost care and endeavour. And we may justly hope for a greater blessing of God upon us, when we offer up our joint Prayers and Devotions to him, <hi>lifting up,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>holy hands without wrath and disputing.</hi> This is therefore a thing of so great consequence to our Peace and Union, that tends so much to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and our common Safety and Preservation; that no person who hath any real concernment for these things, can deny it to be not onely just and sitting, but in our circumstances necessary to be done, if it can be made appear to be lawfull, or that they can do it with a good Conscience.</p>
            <p>And this is the subject I design to speak to at this time; and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose have made choice of these words of the Apostle, <hi>Nevertheless whereto

we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For our better understanding the full scope and meaning of the Apostle in these words, we are to consider, that an unhappy Schism, or wilfull breach of the Churches Unity, had begun in the Apostles times, upon the difference that arose concerning the necessity of keeping the Law of <hi>Moses.</hi> And that which made the <hi>Schism</hi> the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, was, that the first beginners of it pretended a Commission from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselves at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and were extremely busie and industrious to gain and keep up a party to themselves in the most flourishing Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Apostles.<note place="margin">Act 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>and not only other Jews, but Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</hi> Insomuch that had it not been for the courage and resolution of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> all the Gentile Christians had been either forced to a compliance with the Jews, or to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Schism, (of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> had been in probability the <hi>Head,</hi> and not of the <hi>Churches Vnity,</hi> if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had

But finding so good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in his endeavours at <hi>Antioch,</hi> he pursues those false Apostles, who made it their business to divide and separate the Christians from each others Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, through all the Churches where they had, or were like to make any great impression.

            <p n="1">1. He exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to an unanimous and constant resolution, in holding fast to the faith of the Gospel, in spight of all the threats and malice of their enemies:<note place="margin">Phil 1.27, 28.</note>

            <p>All the question is, what the Apostle means by this <hi>Rule,</hi> whether only a Rule of Charity and mutual forbearance, with a liberty of different practice; or such a <hi>Rule</hi> which limits and determines the manner of practice. It cannot be the former, because that is the case the Apostle had spoken to just before. <hi>If in any thing ye be otherwise minded</hi>; therefore now subjoyning this with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to those who had gone beyond them, he doth imply such an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and uniformity of Practice as doth lie in observing the same standing Rule. For which we must consider, that they understood already what orders and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections he had given them when a Church was first formed among them; and therefore when the Apostle menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a Rule, without declaring what it was, we have reason to believe it was such a Rule which they very well knew which he had given to them before. So we find elsewhere the Apostle referrs to
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100318:161"/>
such Rules of Government and Order, which he had given to other Churches, and were already received and practised among them. For the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not write their Epistles for the sounding of Churches, but they were already in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; only they took notice of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders among them, and reformed abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and left some things to <hi>their own</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, when they should come among them.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>And the rest will I set in order when I come. As the Lord, hath called every one, so let him walk; And so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain I in all the Churches.</hi> Which shews that the Apostles did not leave all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to act as they judged sit, but did make Rules determining their practice, and obliging them to uniformity therein. For might not men pretend that these were not things in themselves necessary, and might be scrupled by some Persons, and therefore were not sit to be imposed upon any? But I do not find that the Apostles on this account did forbear giving Rules in such cases, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige Christians to observe them; and that not on the mere Authority of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, but as Governours of Churches, whose business it is to take care of the welfare and preservation of them. There
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100318:162"/>
are many things which seem very little and inconsiderable in themselves, whose consequence and tendency is very great: and the wisdom of Governours lies in preventing the danger of little things, and keeping the zeal of well-meaning persons within its due bounds. For those who are engaged below, in the Valley, fighting in small parties, and pursuing their advantages, do run into the enemies Camp before they are aware of it, may receive an unexpected check from their Commanders in chief, who from the higher ground espie the hazard they are in by their over-forwardness, and the arts which their enemies use in drawing them into little Companies to fight separately, and the danger they may thereby bring upon the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and therefore send them a perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory order to give over fighting by themselves and make good their retreat into the Body of the Army: They wonder, they complain, they think themselves hardly used; but no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing man blames their Generals who regard their safety more than they do themselves, and know the allowing them the Liberty they desire, would endanger the destruction of them all.
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100318:162"/>
The Wisdom and Conduct of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, is quite another thing from the Zeal and Courage of inferiour Persons; who knowing their own resolution and integrity, think much to be control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but those who stand upon higher Ground and see farther than they can do, must be allowed a better capacity of judging what makes for the safety of the whole, than they can have: and such things which they look on in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and therefore think them mean and trifling, the other look upon them in their consequence, and the influence they may have upon the publick safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It were extremely desireable, that all good and usefull men should enjoy as much satisfaction as might be, but if it cannot be attained without running great hazards of unsettling all, it is then to be considered, whether the general safety or some mens particular satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be the more desireable. And this is that which the example of the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves gives us reason to consider, for although there were many doubts and scruples in their times about several Rites and Customs, yet the Apostles did give Rules in such cases, and bind Christians to observe them; as we find in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100318:163"/>
decree made upon great delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Act 15 28</note> in a Council of the Apostles at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>; wherein they determined those things which they knew were then scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and continued so to be afterwards, where-ever the Judaizing Christians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. But notwithstanding all their dissatisfaction, the Apostles continued the same Rule; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the most forward Christians to mind their Rule, and to preserve Peace and Unity among themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But doth not St.</hi> Paul <hi>in the</hi> 14<hi>th Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of his Epistle to the</hi> Romans <hi>lay down quite another Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>only of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forbearance in such cases, where men are unsatisfied in Conscience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, that the Apostle did act like a prudent Governour, and in such a manner, as he thought did most tend to the propagation of the Gospel, and the good of particular Churches. In some Churches that consisted most of <hi>Jews,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this time did, and where they did not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the necessity of keeping the Law on the Gentile Christians (as we do not find they did at <hi>Rome</hi>) the Apostle was willing to have the Law buried as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, and with as little noise as might

be; and therefore in this case he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades both parties to Forbearance and Charity,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.3, 6, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that the preserving the Peace of the Church, and preventing Separation was the great measure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, the Apostle gave his directions; and that makes him so much insist on this advice to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that whatever their attainments in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity were, they should <hi>walk by the same Rule, and mind the same things.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>From whence arise two very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Enquiries.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:100318:164"/>1. How far the obligation doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to comply with an established Rule, and to preserve the Peace of the Church we live in?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is to be done, if men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come up to that Rule? For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks only of such as have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained so far; <hi>Whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. How far the obligation doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to comply with an established Rule, and to preserve the Peace of the Church we live in? This I think the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be spoken to, because I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not persuade my self that so many scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous and conscientious men as are at this day among us would live so many years in a known sin; <hi>i. e.</hi> in a state of Separation from the Communion of a Church, which in Conscience they thought themselves obliged to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with. It must be certainly some great mistake in their judgments must lead them to this; (for I am by no means willing to impute it to passion and evil designs) and out of the hearty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire I have, if possible, to give<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this matter, I shall endeavour to search to the bottom of this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous mistake, to which we owe so
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100318:164"/>
much of our present distractions and fears.</p>
            <p>But for the better preventing all mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding the design of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I desire it may be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I speak not of the Separation or distinct Communion of <hi>whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> from each other; which according to the Scripture, Antiquity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, have a just right and power to govern and reform themselves. By <hi>whole Churches,</hi> I mean<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the <hi>Churches</hi> of such <hi>Nations,</hi> which upon the decay of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> resumed their just right of Government to themselves, and upon their owning Christianity, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into one Christian Society, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same common<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ties and rules of Order and Government. Such as the Church of <hi>Macedonia</hi> would have been, if from being a Roman Province it had become a Christian Kingdom, and the Churches of <hi>Thessalonica, Philippi</hi> and the rest had united together. And so the several Churches of the <hi>Lydian</hi> or <hi>Proconsular Asia,</hi> if they had been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one Kingdom, and governed by the same Authority under the same Rules, might have been truly called the <hi>Lydian Church.</hi> Just as several Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100318:165"/>
uniting make one Kingdom, which at first had a distinct and independent Power, but it would make strange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the world to reduce Kingdoms back again to Families, because at first they were made up of them. Thus National Churches are National Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Christians, under the same Laws of Government and Rules of Worship. For the true notion of a <hi>Church</hi> is no more than of a Society of men united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for their Order and Government according to the rules of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And it is a great mistake, to make the notion of a <hi>Church</hi> barely to relate to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; and consequently that the adequate notion of a Church, is <hi>an Assembly for Divine Worship;</hi> by which means they appropriate the name of Churches to particular Congregations<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Whereas if this held true, the Church must be dissolved as soon as the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> is broken up; but if they retain the nature of a Church, when they do not meet together for Worship, then there is some other bond that unites them; and whatever that is, it consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes the Church. And if there be one Catholick Church consisting of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of particular Churches consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in one Faith<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> then why may there not be one National Church from the consent in the same Articles of Religion, and the same Rules of Government and Order of Worship? Nay, if it be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual consent and agreement which makes a Church, then why may not National Societies agreeing together in the same Faith, and under the same Government and Discipline, be as truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Church, as any particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?

            <p>On which ground, we are acquitted from the imputation of Schism in the

scarce any, either of their Preachers or People here, come ordinarily to the publick Congregations. And this is that which at present we lament as a thing which unavoidably tends to our common ruin, if not in time preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for by this means the hearts of the People are alienated from each other, who apprehend the differences to be much greater than their Teachers will allow, when they are put to declare their minds; and our common enemies take as much advantage from our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, as if they were really far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than they are.</p>
            <p>But you may ask, what then are the grounds of the present Separation? for that there is such a thing is discernible by all, but what the reasons of it are is hard to understand after these concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet it is not conceivable that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious men can in such a juncture of affairs persist in so obstinate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive a course of separation, unless they had something at last fit to answer the <hi>twenty Reasons</hi> of their own Brethren against it?</p>

Some plead, <hi>That it is true they have distinct and separate Communions from us, but it is no sin, or culpable separation so to have. For,</hi> say they, <hi>our Lord Christ instituted only Congregational Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or particular Assemblies for divine Worship, which having the sole Church power in themselves, they are under no obligation of Communion with other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but only to preserve Peace and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with them.</hi> And to this Doctrine, others of late approach so near, that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100318:169"/>
they tell us,<note place="margin">

               <hi>That to devise new species of Churches (beyond Parochial or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational) without God's Authority, and to impose them on the world (yea in his name) and call all Dissenters Schismaticks, is a far worse usurpation, than to make or impose new Ceremonies or Liturgies.</hi> Which must suppose Congregational Churches to be so much the Institution of Christ, that any other Constitution above these is both unlawfull and insupportable. Which is more than the Independent Brethren themselves do assert.</p>
            <p>But to clear the practice of <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from being a sin on this account, two things are necessary to be done.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To prove that a Christian hath no obligation to external Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a Congregational Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it is lawfull to break off Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with other Churches, to set up a particular independent Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That a Christian hath no obligation to external Communion beyond a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Congregational Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Love, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 49, 52, 54.</note> They do not deny, <hi>That men by Baptism are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Catholick visible Church as Members of it; and that there ought to be a sort of Communion by mutual Love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all that belong to this Body:</hi> and to

do them right, they declare, <hi>That they look upon the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or the Generality of the Nation professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, to be as sound and healthfull a part of the Catholick Church, as any in the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 59.</note> But then they say, <hi>Communion in Ordinances must be only in such Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as Christ himself instituted by unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Rules, which were only particular and Congregational Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Granting this to be true, how doth it hence appear not to be a sin to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from our Parochial Churches; which according to their own concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have all the Essentials of true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? And what ground can they have to separate and divide those Churches, which for all that we can see, are of the same nature with the Churches <hi>planted</hi> by the Apostles at <hi>Corinth, Philippi</hi> or <hi>Thessalonica?</hi> But I must needs say far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I have never yet seen any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proof, that the Churches planted by the Apostles were limited to Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is possible, at first, there might be no more Christians in one City than could meet in one Assembly for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; but where doth it appear, that when they multiplied into <hi>more Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> they did make <hi>new</hi> and <hi>distinct
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100318:170"/>
Churches,</hi> under new Officers with a <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Power</hi> of <hi>Government</hi>? Of this, I am well assured, there is no mark or foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step in the New Testament, or the whole History of the Primitive Church. I do not think it will appear credible to any considerate man, that the 5000 Christians in the Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> made <hi>one stated and fixed Congregation for divine Worship</hi>; not if we make all the allowances for <hi>strangers</hi> which can be desired: but if this were granted, where are the unalterable Rules that as soon as the company became too great for one <hi>particular Assembly,</hi> they must become a new Church under peculiar Officers and an independent Authority?</p>
            <p>It is very strange, that those who contend so much for the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a perfect Rule of all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Worship and Discipline, should be able to produce nothing in so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary a Point. If that of which we read the clearest instances in Scripture, must be the standard of all future Ages, much more might be said for limiting Churches to <hi>private Families,</hi> than to <hi>particular Congregations.</hi> For, do we not read of <hi>the Church that was in the House of</hi> Priscilla <hi>and</hi> Aquila <hi>at</hi> Rome;<note place="margin">Rom. 16.3.5.</note>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:100318:171"/>
of the <hi>Church that was in the House of</hi> Nymphas <hi>at</hi> Colosse;<note place="margin">Col. 4.15.</note> and in <hi>the House of</hi> Philemon <hi>at</hi> Laodicea?<note place="margin">Philem. 2.</note> Why then should not Churches be reduced to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Families,</hi> when by that means they may fully enjoy the Liberty of their Consciences, and avoid the scandal of breaking the Laws? But if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing such plain examples, men will extend <hi>Churches</hi> to <hi>Congregations of many Families</hi>; why may not others extend <hi>Churches</hi> to those Societies which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of <hi>many Congregations</hi>? Especially considering, that the Apostles when they instituted Churches, did appoint such Officers in them, as had not bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a respect to those already converted, but to as many as by their means should be added to the Church; as <hi>Clemens</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms in his Epistle;<note place="margin">Clem. <hi>Ep. ad</hi> Cor. p. 55.</note> 
               <hi>The Apostles,</hi> saith he, <hi>went about in Cities and Countries preaching the Gospel; and appointed their First-fruits, having made a spiritual trial of them, for Bishops and Deacons, <gap reason="foreign">

It is true, after some time in the greater Cities, they had distinct places allotted, and Presbyters fixed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and such allotments were called <hi>Titles</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Laurae</hi> at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and <hi>Parishes</hi> in other places: but these were never thought then to be new Churches, or to have any indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Government in themselves; but
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100318:172"/>
were all in subjection to the Bishop and his College of Presbyters, of which multitudes of examples might be brought from most authentick Testimonies of Antiquity; if a thing so evident needed any proof at all. And yet this distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion even in Cities was so uncommon in those elder times, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> takes notice of it as an extraordinary thing at <hi>Alexandria</hi>; and therefore it is probably supposed there was no such thing in all the Cities of <hi>Crete</hi> in his time.<note place="margin">Petav. <hi>not. in</hi> Epiph. <hi>har.</hi> 69. <hi>n.</hi> 1. <hi>Canon.</hi> Nicaen. 6.15, 16.

confess, continue their separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after his banishment, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of <hi>Arsacius:</hi> but although they withdrew in his time, being unsatisfied in the manner of his choice; yet when <hi>Atticus</hi> restored the name of S. <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> to the <hi>Diptychs</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> they returned to Communion with their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,<note place="margin">Baron. <hi>A.

<pb n="345" facs="tcp:100318:176"/>
go about to vindicate the <hi>separate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> among us, from the guilt of a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full separation.</hi> For although they allow <hi>our Churches to be true,</hi> and <hi>that it is lawfull to communicate with them,</hi> which is the most plausible Plea they have, this is so far from extenuating, that it doth aggravate the fault; for as the Brethren of the Assembly said,<note place="margin">

               <hi>Though they do not pronounce an affirmative Judgment against us; yet the very separating is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>But whatever may be said as to other Pleas for their present practices, my Text seems to afford the strongest of all, <hi>viz.</hi> that men are to be pressed to go no farther than <hi>they have already attained,</hi> and not to be strained up to an <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> beyond the dictates of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, but to be let alone, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle directs in the foregoing verse, <hi>If any one be otherwise minded, he must be left to God,</hi> and that manifestation of his Will, which he will be pleased to give him.</p>
            <p>The clearing of this will give a full answer to the second enquiry, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>What is to be done, if men cannot come up to the Rule prescribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:100318:177"/>To this therefore I answer in these particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>This can never justifie men in not doing what they lawfully may do.</hi> For this Rule of the Apostle makes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion necessary, as far as it is lawfull; and that upon the account of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral obligation lying upon all Christians to do what in them lies for preservation of the Peace of the Church. <hi>Therefore as far as ye have attained walk by the same Rule, do the same things</hi>; which words, saith <hi>Cajetan,</hi> the Apostle sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins to the former, lest the persons he there speaks to should think themselves excused from going as far as they can as to the same Rule. Which plainly shews that men are bound in Conscience to go as far as they can; and I cannot see how it is consistent with that <hi>tenderness of Conscience</hi> which our Brethren pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, for so many of them to live so many years in a neglect of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with our Church, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves judge to be lawfull.</p>
            <p>I dare say, if most of the Preachers at this day in the <hi>separate Meetings</hi> were soberly asked their judgments, whether it were lawfull for the People to join with us in the publick Assemblies, they
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:100318:177"/>
would not deny it; and yet the People that frequent them, generally judge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. For it is not to be supposed, that faction among them should so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly prevail beyond interest; and therefore if they thought it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them to comply with the Laws, they would do it. But why then is this kept up as such a mighty secret in the breasts of their Teachers? Why do they not preach it to them in their Congregations? Is it for fear, they should have none left to preach to? that is not to be imagined of mortified and conscientious men. Is it lest they should seem to condemn themselves, while they preach against <hi>Separation</hi> in a <hi>Separate Congregation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I confess, looks oddly, and the tenderness of a man's mind in such a case, may out of meer shamefacedness keep him from declaring a Truth which flies in his face, while he speaks it.</p>
            <p>Is it that they fear the reproaches of the People? which some few of the most eminent Persons among them, have found they must undergo if they touch upon this Subject (for I know not how it comes to pass, that the most <hi>Godly
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100318:178"/>
People</hi> among them, can the least en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be told of their faults.) But is it not as plainly written by S. <hi>Paul, If I yet please men I should not be the Servant of Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">Gal. 1.10.</note> as <hi>Woe be unto me if I preach not the Gospel?</hi> If they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would acquit themselves like honest and conscientious men, let them tell the People plainly that they look on <hi>our Churches as true Churches, and that they may lawfully communicate with us in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sacraments</hi>; and I do not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion but in time, if they find it lawfull, they will judge it to be their Duty. For it is the Apostles command here, <hi>Whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same Rule, let us mind the same things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If the bare dissatisfaction of mens Consciences do justifie the lawfulness of Separation, and breaking an established Rule, it were to little purpose to make any Rule at all.</hi> Because it is impossible to make any, which ignorant and injudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men shall not apprehend to be in some thing or other against the dictates of their <hi>Consciences.</hi> But because what we say may not weigh so much with them in this matter, as what was said
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100318:178"/>
on this Occasion by their own <hi>Brethren</hi> in the <hi>Assembly,</hi> I shall give an account of their <hi>Judgment</hi> in this matter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>dissenting Brethren</hi> were not so much wanting to their <hi>Cause,</hi> as not to plead <hi>tenderness</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> with as much advantage and earnestness as any men now can do it. To which they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though tenderness of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science may justifie Non-communion in the thing scrupled,<note place="margin">Papers for Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, <hi>p.</hi> 51. <hi>V.</hi> p. 61.</note> yet it can never ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie Separation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We much doubt,</hi> say they, <hi>whether such tenderness of Conscience, as ariseth out of an opinion,</hi> cui potest subesse falsum, <hi>(which may be false) when the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is so tender, that it may be withall an erring Conscience, can be a sufficient ground to justifie such a material Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as our Brethren plead for; For though it may bind, to forbear or suspend the Act of Communion in that particular wherein men conceive they cannot hold Communion without sin (nothing being to be done contrary unto Conscience) yet it doth not bind to follow such a positive prescript as possibly may be divers from the Will and Counsel of God, of which kind we conceive this of gathering Separated
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:100318:179"/>
Churches out of other true Churches to be one.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>That scruple of Conscience</hi> is no <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection against Schism; no cause of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating;</hi>

I do not hence inferr that the pretence of <hi>Conscience</hi> is not to be regarded, because it may be abused to so ill purposes; for no man that hath any <hi>Conscience</hi> will speak against the <hi>Power</hi> of it, and he that declares against it, hath no reason to be regarded in what he saith. But that which ought to be inferred from hence, is, that men ought not to rest satisfied with the present dictates of their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> for notwithstanding them they may commit very great sins. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, the common mistating the <hi>Case</hi> of an <hi>Erroneous Conscience</hi> hath done a great deal of Mischief to conscientious men, and betray'd them into great se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, while they are assured they do act according to their Consciences. For the <hi>question</hi> is generally put, <hi>How far an Erroneous Conscience doth oblige?</hi> And when men hear that they must <hi>not act against their Consciences though they be mistaken,</hi> they think themselves safe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough and enquire no farther. But if they would consider, that no man's <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:100318:181"/>
alters the nature of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> in things; that what <hi>God</hi> hath made a <hi>Duty</hi> or a <hi>Sin</hi> remains so, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man's <hi>Conscience</hi> doth judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them; that no man's <hi>Conscience</hi> can strictly oblige him either to <hi>omit a Duty,</hi> or to <hi>commit a Sin</hi>; the utmost <hi>Resolution</hi> of the Case comes to this, That a man may be so perplexed and entangled by an <hi>erroneous Conscience,</hi> that he may be under a necessity of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, if he acts either with or against it. Not that God ever puts a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the necessity of sinning, (for then it would be no sin to him, if it were unavoidable) but that by their own neglect and carelesness, without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after due information, and running on with violent <hi>Prejudices,</hi> which was the case of S. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> (and I wish it were not of many Christians) they may make false and rash <hi>judgments</hi> of things, and so <hi>sin</hi> either in doing or not doing what their <hi>Consciences</hi> tell them they are bound to do.</p>
            <p>The most material Question then, in the case of an <hi>erroneous Conscience,</hi> is, What <hi>Errour of Conscience</hi> doth excuse a man from <hi>Sin</hi> in following the <hi>Dictates</hi> of it? For, if the <hi>Errour</hi> be wholly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100318:182"/>
i. e.</hi> if it be caused by <hi>invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Ignorance,</hi> or after using the <hi>best means</hi> for due information of his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> though the <hi>Act</hi> may be a fault in it self, yet it shall not be imputed to him as a <hi>Sin</hi>; because it wanted the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> of the <hi>Mind,</hi> by which the <hi>Will</hi> is determined; but if men fall into <hi>Wilfull Errours of Conscience; i. e.</hi> if they form their <hi>Judgments</hi> rather by <hi>Prejudice</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> than from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God</hi> or just <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi>; if they do not examine things fairly on both sides, praying for divine direction; if they have not patience to hear any thing against their opinion, but run on blindly and furiously, they may in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>act</hi> according to their <hi>Consciences,</hi> and yet they may be in as great danger of committing heinous sins as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were. Thus if men through the <hi>Power</hi> of an <hi>Erroneous Conscience</hi> may think themselves bound to make <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> to disobey Laws and to break in pieces the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of that <hi>Church,</hi> which they are, or ought to be members of, they may satisfie themselves that they pursue their <hi>Consciences,</hi> and yet for want of due care of informing themselves and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

aright, those very Actions may be <hi>Wilfull</hi> and <hi>Damnable Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing now remains but to make <hi>Application</hi> of what hath been said to our own Case. And that shall be to two sorts of Persons, 1. to those who <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue</hi> in the <hi>Communion</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> 2. to those who <hi>dissent</hi> from it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To those who <hi>continue</hi> in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of our <hi>Church.

It hath not been either the <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Rules</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> which have ever given advantage to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it; but the indiscretion of some in going beyond them; and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of others in not holding to them.</p>
            <p>Such is the <hi>Purity</hi> of its <hi>Doctrine,</hi> such the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of its <hi>Principles,</hi> such the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of its <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi>

that none who are true Friends to any of these, can be Enemies to it. Let us take heed we do not give too much occasion to our Enemies to think the worse of our <hi>Church</hi> for our sakes. It is easie to observe, that most quarrels relating to <hi>Constitutions</hi> and <hi>Frames</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> are more against <hi>Persons</hi> than <hi>things</hi>; when they are unsatisfied with their management, then they blame the <hi>Government</hi>; but if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were in place, or those they love and esteem, then the Government is a good thing, if it be in good mens hands. Thus do mens judgments vary as their interests do.</p>
            <p>And so as to <hi>Churches,</hi> we find <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> condemned as <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,</hi> till men come into <hi>Power</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and then the very same things and arguments are used and thought very good and substantial, which before were weak and sophistical.<note place="margin">Ans. to 2 Questions. 1659.</note> Those who speak now most against the <hi>Magistrates Power</hi> in matters of <hi>Religion</hi> had <hi>ten sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Reasons</hi> for it, when they thought the <hi>Magistrate</hi> on their own side.

Let us by the innocency and unblameableness of our lives, the life and constancy of our devotions, the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and gentleness of our behaviour in our own Cause, our Zeal and Courage in God's, add a lustre to our Religion and bring others to a <hi>Love</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi>

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:100318:192"/>
that it was not enough for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Priesthood,<note place="margin">

For he that would not believe the Christian Religion to be from God, thought himself bound to give some probable account, how a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion so contrary to the Interests and Designs of this World, should be able to prevail against all the arts and power of its many and potent Enemies; and upon the deepest search which could be made by himself, or the greatest Wits of the Heathens then about him, they concluded the flourishing and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to be chiefly owing to those things which he so much commended to the Heathens imitation. And from hence they inferred, that if the same things could be brought into practice among the Gentiles, they should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to supplant Christianity by its own methods, and restore Paganism by the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:100318:192"/>
same Weapons by which it was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. This was thought so subtle and artificial a device by him whose great design was to extirpate our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a soft and gentle manner, without the blood and cruelty of former times, that he writes an Epistle on purpose to <hi>Arsacius</hi> the chief Priest of <hi>Galatia,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring punctual observance of these Commands; and as to the chargeable and expensive part, he offer'd large provisions out of his own Revenue to defray it.</p>
            <p>But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had been beforehand with him in <hi>Galatia,</hi> having planted Churches with great success there; and Christianity, by his means, took so deep root in mens hearts, that neither the rage and fury of former Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor the plausible arts and insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Julian</hi> were able to root it out. It is true, that these Churches, soon after their planting, were in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being over-run by the pernicious Errors of some Seducers of that time; (the apprehension whereof put St. <hi>Paul</hi> into that astonishment which he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in the beginning of this Epistle,<note place="margin">Gal. 1.6.</note> 
               <hi>I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the Grace of Christ

unto another Gospel,</hi> &amp;c.) yet by the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notice and care which he took to prevent the spreading of these corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them, the <hi>Galatian Churches,</hi> recover'd the soundness of their Faith, and have preserved a name among the Eastern Churches, though under great variety of conditions, to this day. Some take notice, that this is one of the shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest <hi>Epistles</hi> written by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> He appears indeed, by the beginning of it, to have been much surprised and moved at the news of a great and sudden alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration among them; which he was sure was not for the better. And by this plain dealing with them, he knew, till they consider'd better, they would be offended with him; but withal he tells them this did best become <hi>a Servant of Christ,</hi> who, like a good Physician, hath more regard to the Disease than to the Palate of his Patient;<note place="margin">Gal. 1.10.</note> 
               <hi>For if I yet pleased Men, I should not be the Servant of Christ.</hi> But having vindicated his own honour,<note place="margin">Ch. 1, 2.</note> which the evil reports of the false A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles made necessary; and argued with great strength and conviction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the imposers of the Law;<note place="margin">Ch. 3, 4. part of 5.</note> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himself to the inforcing the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the general and necessary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

of <hi>Christianity</hi> upon these <hi>Galatians.</hi> If they had such a mind to keep the Law, <hi>All the Law,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.14.</note> 
               <hi>is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shall love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> It was a vain and foolish thing for them to contend about keeping the Law, who did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the main design of it, by their heats and animosities against each other; which, instead of preserving the honour of the Law, was the certain way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy one another.<note place="margin">15.</note> 
               <hi>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</hi> From hence he shews, that <hi>hatred, variance,</hi>

               <hi>emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</hi> are as much <hi>the lusts of the flesh,</hi>

               <hi>Let us not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</hi> But the Apostle
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:100318:194"/>
did not think the design of the Law, or the obligation of Christianity was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with abstaining from doing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to others; therefore he proceeds to tell them what exercise of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, compassion and readiness to do good to others were expected from them by the Law of Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If a man, through the frailty of humane Nature, or the sudden sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of a Temptation, be overtaken in a fault, do not, saith he, trample upon him, nor insult over him; but endeavour <hi>with the spirit of meekness</hi> to recover him from his fall; considering that we carry about us the same load of flesh, and are exposed to continual Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons our selves.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note>

            <p n="2">(2.) If we see others groaning under the heavy burthen of their own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the pressures and calamities of the world, do not add more weight to their afflictions; but put your own shoulders under to bear a part with them, to make their burthen more easie to them; for herein lies a great deal of that duty which Christ hath laid on all his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.<note place="margin">6.2.</note>

                  </gap> to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> Which instances being mention'd, the Apostle subjoyns two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A general Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That every man shall receive in another World according to the good that he doth in this. <hi>Be not deceived,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.7.</note> 
               <hi>God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap.</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.8.</note> 
               <hi>For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of his flesh reap corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting:</hi> i. e. He that looks only after his present ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this world, and dares not venture to do any thing out of hopes of recompence for it in another life, he is said <hi>to sow to his flesh;</hi> but he that is good and charitable and kind to others without hopes of any other advantage than what God will give him for it, is said <hi>to sow to the spirit; the flesh and spirit</hi> being opposed as the two Centres of the different worlds: the great thing
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:100318:195"/>
to which all things tend in this world being something carnal or that relates to the <hi>Flesh</hi>; and the great principle of another world being wholly spiritual. And these two <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are placed as two Loadstones drawing our hearts several ways; the one is much stronger, but at a greater distance; the other hath less force in it self but is much nearer to us, by which means it draws more powerfully the hearts that are already touched with a strong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it. But the Apostle useth the similitude of two Fields, wherein the product of the Seed answers to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Soil; <hi>so he that sows to the flesh, i. e.</hi> that minds only his present interest in this world, his harvest shall be proportionable to his seed, he may reap advantages to himself in this world suitable to his pains and industry; but the utmost this world can yield is but of a short continuance, being of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, transient corruptible nature, <hi>he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption:</hi> but <hi>he that soweth to the spirit, i. e.</hi> hath so great a regard to the rewards of another life, that he is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to let go a present enjoyment and bury it under ground, casting it in as
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:100318:195"/>
seed into the earth in hopes of a future resurrection, however he may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a weak and improvident man by the men of this world, yet as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as there is a life everlasting to come, so certainly shall all his good deeds yield an abundant increase and meet with a glorious recompence then, if there be no corrupt mixture in the sowing which may spoil the vertue of the seed, <hi>for he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit reap life everlasting.</hi> And let not men deceive themselves; if they look only at themselves and the things of this world, let their pretences be never so spiritual, if they dare not do acts of Charity so as to trust God for a reward, they do but <hi>sow to the flesh</hi>; and though the world may be cheated, and men may sometimes deceive themselves, yet <hi>God cannot be mocked;</hi> he knows the hearts and intentions, and secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of men, and according to them their reward shall be; <hi>for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap.</hi> This I take to be the natural and genuine meaning of the Apostle in those words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A particular exhortation, not to be discouraged <hi>in well doing,</hi> which is the same with <hi>sowing to the spirit</hi> before,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:100318:196"/>
and with <hi>doing good</hi> in the following verse, both which are to be understood of the Works of Charity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to take it in that sense here. These are especially called <hi>good Works</hi> in the new Testament; <hi>Dorcas</hi> is said to be <hi>a Woman full of good Works and Alms-deeds which she did.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Tit. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>these things are good and profitable unto men</hi>; Where the same word is used in the Greek, that is in the words of the Text. And to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose other words of a like signification are used,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.16.</note> as <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Charge them that are rich in this worldâ€” that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.18.</note> 
               <hi>That ye may abound to every good Work,</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul;</hi> which
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:100318:196"/>
he after explains, by <hi>being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 9.8.11.</note> So that although <hi>well-doing</hi> in the general may extend to every good action, yet by the particular sense of that phrase in the New Testament, and especially from the coherence of these words with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going and following verses, it appears that the <hi>well-doing</hi> here spoken of, is to be understood of <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Charity.</hi> Which the <hi>Apostle,</hi> as they were Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, did suppose them to practise, but being apprehensive lest the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements they met with in the world, should make them grow cold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss in this great duty, he therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them not to faint or <hi>grow weary of doing it;</hi> and to that end he lays down the most powerfull Motive and Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; <hi>for in due season ye shall reap if ye faint not; i. e.</hi> ye shall not miss of a reward from God.</p>
            <p>So that from the words we may take notice of these two things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The many discouragements men meet with in the World, which are apt to make them grow <hi>weary in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:100318:197"/>2. The mighty incouragement which God gives to our continuance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance in it; <hi>for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The many discouragements men meet with in the World, which are apt to make them grow <hi>weary in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Precepts of Charity deliver'd by our Saviour and his Apostles are so plain, so full, so many, so easie to be understood; and those Precepts infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by so just, and reasonable, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous considerations, with respect to God, to the World, to fellow Christians, to the honour of our Religion, and lastly to our selves, from the comfort that is in well-doing, and the reward that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it; that a man must have great impudence, to profess himself a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and yet to think himself not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do acts of Charity. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all this, and much more which might be said to this purpose, there are too many still who are ready to find out some plausible pretences to excuse them from <hi>well-doing;</hi> which being the greatest discouragements to men from continuing in it; I shall make it my present business to examin
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:100318:197"/>
them, and to shew how little weight there is in them, especially being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Authority of him who hath made this our duty, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward we may justly expect for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it. And here I shall pass over the more common and trivial Objections, which every one can easily answer that makes them; and rather argue an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing mind to perform their duty, than one unsatisfied about the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of it; and I shall therefore insist on those that carry a greater appearance of strength in them: which are chiefly these two,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the different <hi>state</hi> of our <hi>Times</hi> from those when these <hi>Commands</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> were given.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the sad prospect of our own Affairs, which seem rather to call for a <hi>Care</hi> of our selves than <hi>Charity</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The first pretence is from <hi>the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> of <hi>Times</hi>;
<q>There was then, say such men, great reason for Charity which will not hold now; those were times of persecution for Religion, and many were driven to great streights and necessities on that account who deserved to be relieved, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:100318:198"/>
had been worse than Infidels not to do good to men that were brought to want meerly for Christ's and the Gospel's sake; the Laws then could take no care of these poor and indigent persons; for the Laws made them so, being then opposite to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: but now our Religion is settled by the Laws; and we have many Laws made for a competent provision for the poor, which will be sufficient if they be put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if they be not, what Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is this to relieve an idle and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly sort of People who live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Alms, when it is greater Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to such to make them work and to provide for their own subsiestnce?</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the force of the Objection which seems to have a great deal of strength and weight in it: but before I give an Answer to it I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth of some things contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That there is a great difference in the case of Charity, where our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is settled by Law, and where it is persecuted by it. For a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and degree is justly required in a time of Persecution, in as much as those
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:100318:198"/>
are the truest Objects of Charity who preferr <hi>the keeping Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> before the good things of this Life. And we ought to look upon it as an unvaluable blessing, that we have the <hi>Christian,</hi> yea the <hi>Reformed Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> settled by our <hi>Laws.</hi> And God grant it may ever so continue!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It cannot be denied that we have very good Laws for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Poor, and that they might be sufficient for their common necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, if they were duly executed. And it is a very just and reasonable distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our Laws make between the involuntary Poor, who are made so by the hand of Heaven, either by Sickness, or Lameness, or Age, or Children, or Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the voluntary Poor, who may help themselves but will not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idle, dissolute and slothfull persons. These deserve rather the hand of Justice to punish them than that of Charity to relieve them: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself is so far from thinking this to be true Charity, that he hardly thinks it so to keep such from starving if we take that Proverbial saying in its strict and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense, <hi>If any would not work,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thess. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.10.</note> 
               <hi>neither should he eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:100318:199"/>(3.) I grant that it is greater Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to put persons upon providing for themselves than to relieve their present necessities. For that is the greatest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which doth a man the most good. And he that reduceth a dissolute and wandring Beggar to the taking pains for himself and Family cures an ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of his Mind; puts him into the way of Vertue and Sobriety; gives him a lasting stock for himself and Family (for diligence and industry is so) keeps him out of the danger of the worst sort of Company; gains him more Friends, who will be far more ready to help a person industrious in his Poverty than the most clamorous and importunate Beggar. And therefore our Laws have wisely determin'd, that Work-houses are the best Hospitals for the Poor, who are able to help themselves. But after these concessions, I am far from thinking the command of Charity to be swallowed up in our Laws for the relief of the Poor. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If our Laws were the best in the World for this purpose, yet, if they be not duly executed, they leave as much room for Charity as if there were none. What if a Law were made that there
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:100318:199"/>
should be no Poor at all among us; but that immediate care should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, upon any man's falling into decay, that his Stock should be supplied out of the superfluities of the Rich; If this Law were not executed, men would be altogether as miserable in their Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as great Objects of Charity as if there were no such Law in being. For the making of a Law for their sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply without putting it in execution, is but like the Person in St. <hi>James,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2.16</note> 
               <hi>who said to those who were naked and destitute of daily food, be ye warmed and filled; but notwithstanding gave them nothing needfull for the Body; what doth this profit?</hi> What advantage or satisfaction is it to a Man to starve with the Law on his side? Or can men be better fed or cloathed with the Words of a Law than of any particular Person? If not, then if care be not taken for the relief and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Poor according to the Laws, there is as great need of Charity as if there were none at all.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If we suppose the Laws for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Poor to be duly executed, yet there are many particular cases of Charity which often happen which the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:100318:200"/>
Laws cannot be supposed to provide for. The Law takes care only of general, and notorious, and common cases; but there are continual Instances of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and extraordinary cases where relief is as much wanted, but is rarely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged. How often is some men's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation a snare to themselves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; who had rather sink silently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gulf of Misery, than have their wants made known to their insulting neighbours, among whom they have lived in as good fashion as themselves? How many have been tempted rather to put an end to a miserable Life than to be despised and contemned for their Poverty in their old Age! How many are unwilling to make known their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for fear of a repulse and being thought Liars, or impudent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Beggars! How hardly will some pinch themselves and Families, before they will make known their necessities! and some have been known to have brought themselves so low, that when their sad condition hath been discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they have been past all possibility of recovery. I hope such Instances are not frequent among us. And yet we are late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p n="3">(3.) The obligations of Charity reach much farther than the force of our Laws doth. For how small a matter within this City doth answer the Letter of the Law, where Persons enjoy very great and plentifull Estates?

            <p>The true Charity of Christians is a free and voluntary thing, not what men are forced to do by the Laws; It is a largeness of mind, that disposeth men to do good to others, and embraceth every opportunity for that purpose; It is the flowing of a Fountain which runs freely, easily and constantly; and not like the pouring water out of a narrow mouthed Vessel, where but little comes, and with a great deal of noise. Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity spreads it self like the beams of the Sun, and warms and enlivens the colder parts of the Earth; it pierceth into the bowels of it, and makes it self a passage to those secret and hidden objects which are out of the view of the World. True Christian Charity hath arms so large to comprehend the whole World within
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:100318:201"/>
them; but it is the Life and Spirit of that Body whereof Christ is the Head; it passeth from one Member to another, emptying it self from the larger vessels into the less, and so by a constant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and course through the Body it keeps heat and union in all the Parts. To do good because one cannot help it, is to obey the Law of Necessity and not of Charity. He that resolves to go no farther in Charity than the Law requires him, declares he would not have gone so far unless the Law had forced him; which is in effect to tell the World, he hath not so much as an inclination to Charity.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Our Laws give great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the best, the noblest,<note place="margin">

Co. 2. <hi>Instit.</hi> 723.</note> the most lasting Works of Charity; such as erecting Work-houses for the Poor that are able to work, endowing Hospitals and Alms-houses for the impotent, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper'd and aged Poor; setting up Free-Schools for the Education of Youth. And I never yet met with any Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against these that will not hold against the best designs in the World. For it is possible they may be abused, and may accidentally prove an occasion of Idleness to some Persons, and they
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:100318:202"/>
may exceed the due proportion of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons fit for them, (although we yet see no great danger of that.) Yet what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign can the wit of Man pitch upon in a captious and suspicious Age, that will not meet with Objections from those that have a mind to cavil? The best Religion in the World, the best Church, the best Government, the best Laws, the best Men cannot escape the censures of ill-minded Men; and why should we think the best designs of Charity should? But some men whose minds are set upon one particular way of Charity, are apt to disparage all other ways to advance their own: which is the common Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Mankind, to think sufficient Right is not done to the thing they admire, unless they undervalue all other things in comparison with it. But it is a part of Charity to allow, approve and incourage all true ways of Charity; not to set up bodily Labour against the improvement of the Mind; nor the learning of Arts and Sciences to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of breeding men up for Trade and Business; nor to cry down Hospitals and Infirmaries for the Lame and Sick and Aged in comparison of Work-houses for the Young and Strong
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:100318:202"/>
and Healthfull. For all these are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and most commendable ways of Charity, and have nothing of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or inconsistency with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, if they do answer the ends of their Institution. I do not go about to lessen the esteem of casual and occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acts of Charity done to particular Persons in present Want; when our Blessed Saviour in the midst of all his Poverty took care of the <hi>Poor,</hi> for when he spake to <hi>Judas</hi> at the Table, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples supposed it was <hi>that he should give something to the Poor.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 13.29.</note> What admirable Charity was this, when he had not whereon to lay his head, and was at the expence of a Miracle to give an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to the People, yet he had an Officer, one of his own Apostles, to take care of the Poor! And when he pronounceth such Blessedness to those who do Acts of Charity to them, and accounts them <hi>as done unto himself</hi>; which is the highest expression of his gracious acceptance of such Acts from us,<note place="margin">Matt. 25.34.40.</note> and of the great obligation that lies upon us to do them; since we ought not to think much of any thing we do for the honour of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, who did and suffer'd so much for
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:100318:203"/>
our sakes: Yet when we compare these with the publick Works of Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, being done for the same end; we shall find these to exceed the other in some material circumstances, which add much to the excellency of them.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In the Largeness and Extensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their design. Other Charities are for the present relief of some poor and indigent Persons, whose bowels are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, and backs are clothed, and hearts are eased, by the kindness of others to them; but these are soon gone, and men's Charity cannot follow them beyond the Grave. But publick en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of Charity are to last for ever, and do good to the Poor of many Generations. The Ages to come will rise up and bless their Memory who took care to do good to those whom they never saw; and to provide for such, yea very many such, whom it was impossible for them to know. When a man sees a great object of Charity, as the Widow and Fatherless under extreme necessities, the Mother weeping and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning her Children not having bread to put into their Mouths, and the poor Children looking ghastly and fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:100318:203"/>
crying for want of bread, but not knowing where to get it, the very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness of a man's own mind at the sense of so much misery in others, will extort some present relief to still their cries, and to put such an unpleasing Idea out of his Fancy. But if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it self do not move, yet importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity may: if that doth not, yet custom, reputation, natural humanity, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Friends may prevail on men to be sometimes liberal to Persons whom they see under present Wants. But how much doth all this fall short of a fixed, certain, perpetual provision for the necessities of those, whom none of those Arguments could excite men to shew kindness to? The other is a more sensible, natural, private Charity; this is a more rational, generous Christian Charity; being built upon more free, and noble, and lasting considerations, most agreeable to the design and honour of the Christian Religion, which puts men upon doing the best things and which tend to the greatest benefit and advantage of mankind. And in the comparison of things that are good, the largest, the most publick, the most last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ought to have the pre-eminence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="400" facs="tcp:100318:204"/>(2.) In their Consequence and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; which ought to be especially regarded in Acts of Charity. For true Charity must be accompanyed with Wisdom and Discretion. It is not a man's profuse liberality to every one that asks; nor making himself poor to make others rich; it is not squandering away an Estate among idle and indigent Persons, that makes him a charitable man; but it is a wise dispensing the Gifts God hath bestowed upon him for the benefit and advantage of others. And the greater the Good is that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the greater is the Charity in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing it. The Schoolmen reckon up seven sorts of Corporal Alms, and as many of Spiritual;<note place="margin">

               <hi>to visit the sick, to feed the hungry, to satisfie the thirsty, to cloath the naked, to redeem the captive, to entertain the stranger, to bury the dead</hi>; are the former: <hi>to teach the ignorant, to advise the doubtfull, to comfort the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull, to correct the wicked, to forgive the injurious, to bear the troublesome, to pray for all;</hi> are the Instances of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Charity. But this is rather a distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the different sorts of Charity, than any just Rule and Measure of our obligation to the Acts of it. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:100318:204"/>
in the general, spiritual Acts of Charity to mens Souls, are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before what referrs only to their Bodies; yet in particular cases a man may be more obliged to relieve their outward necessities than to give them good counsel for their Souls; <hi>i. e.</hi> when those necessities are urgent and pressing, and by a present supply they may have longer time and be in better disposition to receive spiritual Advice. Some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute if a bad man be in greater want, and a good man in less want, which of these two is to be preferred? And the Casuists say, <hi>The Work of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is greater in the former Case, but <hi>the Work of Charity</hi> in the latter. For <hi>Mercy</hi> only relates to another's misery;<note place="margin">Cajet. <hi>in</hi> 2.2. <hi>Q.</hi> 32. <hi>art.</hi> 4.</note> but <hi>Charity</hi> takes in other considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So I say, when the competition lies between the present supply of some in great want, and making a lasting provision for more persons in less want, there may be more <hi>Mercy</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer case, but there may be greater <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> in the latter: because the more publick, the more common, the more usefull the Good is, the greater the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is in doing of it. I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, whether the breeding up of youth
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:100318:205"/>
to Learning or Labour be among us the greater <hi>Charity?</hi> I know no reason why two such excellent ways of <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> should be set at variance with each other. But certainly we are not to judge of mens usefulness to the publick merely by the strength of their limbs, or the hardness of their hands, or the nimbleness of their fingers. Is it not possible that by the charitable education of Children in the ways of Learning and Knowledge some may arrive at a greater capacity of serving God and their Country, than if they had been grinding in a Mill, or tugging at an Oar all that while? It is not only keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People to hard labour, or to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual working, which is the design of Charity; but the most excellent way of Charity, is to improve all Persons according to their several Capacities, so as to make them more usefull and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Publick. This is not only <hi>doing Good</hi> to the particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but to the whole Nation; and <hi>Charity</hi> is not barely to be measured by the quality of its Acts, but by the largeness of the circumference it fills. The breeding up some few great and usefull Persons to a Nation is a Work

of Charity the publick Good is more concerned in, than in the manual la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of many industrious Artificers: who do serve the Publick too in their way; but there is a difference between those lesser Stars in the Firmament, that wanted a Telescope to discover them, and those great and splendid Bodies which influence the Earth, and direct mens passage in the deep Waters. That is therefore the greatest and most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Charity, which tends to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving mankind according to their different Capacities; some for Labour, others for Trade, others to be usefull to the rest of mankind with a respect either to their Country or to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, their Bodies or their Souls: And which takes all possible care to prevent the unspeakable and innumerable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which idleness and debauchery do bring upon mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) In the Honour they bring to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. There are some cases, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Charity must be so secret, that <hi>our<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> left hand must not know what our right hand doth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 6.3.</note> i. e. when there is danger of vanity and ostentation in the doing of our Alms; but when the honour of God and Religion is concerned, then
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:100318:206"/>
               <hi>let your light so shine before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 5.16.</note> 
               <hi>that they may see your good Works, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Father which is in heaven.</hi> But how can men see those Acts of Charity which are done in secret, and are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously concealed from the knowledge of men? And if that were to be taken as a strict command in all cases, then all the publick Works of Charity, which are most considerable for the Honour of God and Religion would be forbidden by the Gospel. But where men do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and praise-worthy things for great and good ends, without Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Hypocrisie, it is the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of Religion and the glory of God not to have such things kept from the knowledge of the World.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.8.</note> 
               <hi>For herein,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>is my Father glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be my Disciples.</hi> So shall ye appear to be my Disciples, for Christ had owned them for his Disciples before, but this would manifest their being so to the World; which would bring the greatest honour to God and to the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And it is certain nothing did more advance the reputation of it in the World, than their singular and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care of the Poor. For they not
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:100318:206"/>
only relieved in the first place those that were Christians, according to the Apostle's rule in the next Verse; <hi>especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to those of the House-hold of Faith</hi>; but their Charity extended to the very Heathens: which <hi>Jubian</hi> takes notice of with great Indignation:<note place="margin">Jul <hi>Ep.</hi> ad Arsac.</note> 
               <hi>Is it not a shame for us not to relieve our own poor, when the Christians not only take care of their own but of ours too?</hi> And by the case of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Peregrinus,</hi> it appears, that some pretended to be Christians on purpose that they might be partakers of the great bounty and kindness which the Christians shewed to their Brethren. But such instances as these did not make <hi>them weary in well-doing</hi>; but still as the Church increased in Riches by the free and large oblations of the People; so greater care was taken for the erecting Hospitals for the reception of the Poor, who could provide no habitation for themselves; and this was then always looked on as a particular concernment of Religion, and not as a mere political Constitution.</p>
            <p>Thus the matters of Charity stood in the Christian Church, till men came to be perswaded that by the Priest's say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many Prayers for the dead, their
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:100318:207"/>
Souls might be removed out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and translated to Heaven. And when this notorious Cheat prevailed, the stream of mens Charity was diverted from the Poor, to the making good bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains for their Souls. And who could blame men who had spent all their days in Wickedness, or raised an Estate by Fraud and Oppression, if at their death they took care to leave enough to have so many Masses said for their Souls, as might by a reasonable computation serve for their Redemption out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory at a marketable Price. When the laying open these Cheats to the World, gave the first occasion to the Reformation, a mighty out-cry was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where made, that the Foundation of all good Works was destroyed, and if the Reformation prevailed there would be no want of Faith, when every one might chuse what he pleased, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Charity was to be expected. To remove the former Calumny, our Reformers published the Articles of our Religion; and to take away the latter, they put that admirable Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth upon the new founding the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Hospitals</hi> of this <hi>City,</hi> (for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there were some <hi>Hospitals</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:100318:207"/>
such as St. <hi>Mary Bethlehem, Elsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spittal,</hi> St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s, yet they were inconsiderable in comparison of what they have been since.) For by the care and Charity of the Governors and other Members of the City, they have yielded a wonderfull support to a mighty number of poor Children, and wounded and diseased Persons both in Body and Mind; which being joyned with another <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>one single Person,</hi> this <hi>City</hi> may justly vye with any other in the Christian World as to so many and so great Foundations, for the best kind of Christian Charity, in the Education of Youth and the Care of the Impotent and Diseased.</p>
            <p>Our Religion teacheth us better, than to have so vain and fond an opinion of our good Works as to think we <hi>merit</hi> Heaven by them; but surely our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is so much the greater, if we do these things out of a sense of gratitude to God, than if we think to drive a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with him, and put our imperfect Works in the balance with an infinite and eternal Reward. Those of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may think they carry on a better Trade with Heaven than we do; and that they have a mighty
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:100318:208"/>
advantage in the <hi>overbalance</hi> of what they hope for in exchange for what they part with; but they had best look well to the stating their Accounts, the due value of their Works, and the reason of expecting such a disproportionable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; lest at last they deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and totally fail of their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: For in the great day of account, all things will be most exactly weighed; and although the greatest Benefactors rejoyce in the highest Acts of <hi>Kindness,</hi> yet when any thing is challenged in a way of <hi>Justice,</hi> men do not love to be imposed upon or over-reached in a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. What madness then is it, for any sinfull Creatures to hope that any Acts of theirs, being weighed by divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, can bear any proportion in a way of <hi>Merit,</hi> with no less than the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven? This we utterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and owe all our hopes of Heaven merely to the infinite Goodness and Mercy of God through his Son Christ Jesus: and yet we think our selves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the less bound <hi>to be fruitfull in good Works</hi>; because we hereby testifie our obedience to the Laws of Christ; our sincere love to God and our Brethren; our readiness to do good to others by
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:100318:208"/>
the mercies which God hath bestowed upon us; our sense of the obligation we have to one another, as partaking of the same nature, and liable to the same infirmities, and exposed to the same calamities; our expectation of a blessed reward, though not due to the merit of our Works, but to the infinite Grace and Mercy of God. And I do not see, but where men have a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to God and Religion, such consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations as these do more effectually stir men up to true Acts of Charity, than those mercenary and corrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines in the Roman Church; which look rather like cunning devices to pick the Peoples Pockets than any real Arguments for Charity. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a carefull examination, it hath been found, that our <hi>Protestant Doctrine</hi> was so far from stopping up the Channel that ran so freely before, that within sixty years after the <hi>Reformation</hi> more great and noble Works of Charity were done in founding of <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,</hi> than for some hundreds of years before; and some say from the <hi>Conquest</hi> till that time of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> But this I have formerly insisted more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, on the like Occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="410" facs="tcp:100318:209"/>The summ of what I have said is this, that we have no reason to be <hi>weary in well doing</hi>; on the account of our Laws for the common relief of the Poor; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those Laws cannot provide for all cases of Charity; and because they do suppose the greatest Works of Charity to depend upon the largeness and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those mens minds to whom God gives a heart to do great and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy things with the Estates he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there is another plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence yet behind, <hi>viz.</hi> from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our own Times.
<q>Were the times calm and fixed; had we a fair prospect of things before us, that were a great encouragement to Charity; but we live in perplexed and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full times and know not what may become of us all; mens minds are strangely discompos'd and full of Fears; and therefore this is a very unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time to perswade them to Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, when they ought rather to lay up and secure something against an evil day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What times were those the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians lived in, who so much
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:100318:209"/>
abounded in Charity? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of himself and his Brethren,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>they were hungry and thirsty, naked and buffetted, having no certain dwelling-place; labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, working with their own hands, revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, persecuted, defamed</hi>; and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing relating to this World was so much their care and concernment as providing for the Poor. For when he went up to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and there conferred with <hi>James, Cephas</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal 2.9.10.</note> at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they had nothing to desire of him and <hi>Barnabas, but to remember the Poor, the same which I also was forward to do</hi>; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> relates it. And you may see how earnest he was in it, by his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8, 9. <hi>ch.</hi>
               </note> when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades them to a liberal contribution to the poor Christians in <hi>Judea,</hi> who then suffer'd much either through Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or Persecution or both. St. <hi>Paul</hi> had undertaken for the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaia,</hi> (of which <hi>Corinth,</hi> being a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and trading City, was the chief) but the <hi>Collection</hi> not being yet made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he sends some on purpose to <hi>Corinth</hi> to make all ready against his coming to them, and perswades them to great liberality in their giving: for which end he makes use of the most
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:100318:210"/>
powerfull and prevailing arguments and great arts of insinuation. (1.) He sets before them the Example of the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> which is truly a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary instance of Christian Charity. They were under great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deep poverty at that time them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet understanding by St. <hi>Paul</hi> this occasion of more than ordinary Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they not only straitned themselves even beyond their abilities, but did it with that chearfulness and satisfaction of mind, that they intreated the <hi>Apostle</hi> to accept of what they had given, and to undertake the managing of so good a Work. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to speak of it with a kind of transport, <hi>Moreover, Brethren, we do you to wit of the Grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia; how that in a great trial of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded to the riches of their liberality; for to their power I bear record, yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves; praying us with much intreaty that we would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the gift, and take upon us the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of the ministring to the Saints.</hi> Nothing can be added to the weight of these words and the <hi>Emphasis</hi> wherewith they are penned. (2.) He lets them
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:100318:210"/>
know what a shame and reproach it would be to so famous a Church for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Divine Gifts</hi> to come behind others in Charity. <hi>Therefore as ye abound in every thing, in faith, in utterance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.7.</note> 
               <hi>in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us,</hi> (what artificial insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are these!) <hi>see that ye abound in this Grace also.</hi> (3.) But lest he should seem to press too hard upon them, he draws off again; <hi>I speak not by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 8</note> 
               <hi>but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</hi> (4.) Yet he hath no sooner said this, but he comes on again with the most prevailing Argument taken from the example of our Blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>For ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> Can any thing be more moving to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than this? (5.) His design was not to lay a burthen upon them, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite mutual compassion in Christians to one another. (6.) This would be a demonstration to the World of their kindness to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14.</note> and that he had not spoken great things of them without cause. (7.) They might justly expect
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:100318:211"/>
a retribution suitable to their Bounty;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.24.</note> 
               <hi>But this I say, He which soweth sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shall reap sparingly;</hi>
               <note place="margin">9.6.</note> 
               <hi>but he which sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.</hi> (8.) This would be the occasion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thanksgivings and prayers to God for them.<note place="margin">

               <hi>For the administration of this service, not only supplieth the want of the Saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgiving unto God.</hi>

               <hi>(Whilst by the experiment of this ministration they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God for your professed subjection unto the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men.) And by their prayer for you,</hi>

               <hi>Thanks be unto God for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable gift.</hi> Wherein he supposes the thing as already done, as believing it impossible for them to resist the force of so many Arguments. And yet all this while St. <hi>Paul</hi> supposes their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be such as in a little time they might stand in need of relief from others; which he thought was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Argument against present Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that he useth it the other way; <hi>that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want,</hi>
               <note place="margin">8.14.</note> 
               <hi>that their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance may also be a supply for your want,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:100318:211"/>
i. e.</hi> Do not consider what times may come upon your selves so as to hinder <hi>doing good</hi> while it is in your power to do it; leave those things to the wise Providence of God; if he think sit to reduce you to want, he that now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites your hearts to do good to them, will stir up others to make up the same measure to you. So that while the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians either were under great persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or in expectation of them, through the Power of the Magistrates, or the Rage of the People; yet the <hi>Apostles</hi> pressed them, and that with great success, to a free, chearfull, liberal contribution to relieve those who labour under great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wants than others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This very consideration is used as an argument in <hi>Scripture</hi> to persuade men to <hi>Charity, viz.</hi> That we do not know what times may come upon us. <hi>Give thy portion to seven and also to eight;</hi>

               <hi>inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was sick, and ye visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me; I was in prison,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 40.</note> 
               <hi>and ye came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. For in as much as ye have done
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:100318:213"/>
it to one of the least of these my Brethren ye have done it unto me.</hi> O the infinite Goodness and unexpressible kindness of our Blessed Saviour, who in the day of Judgment will interpret all Acts of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity so much to the advantage of those that do them! Who would deny any thing to a Servant of that Lord who takes all kindnesses to them as done to himself, and rewards them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? What other apprehensions will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and hard-hearted Wretches then have of their sordid penuriousness in heaping up riches, without any ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness or compassion to the necessities of their Brethren and Christ's represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives? How will they wish ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times, when it will be to no purpose to wish, that they had rather they had laid out their money in <hi>doing good,</hi> than laid it up for those, who may go to Hell the faster for the great Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they leave behind them. Neither let the prodigal Fools think they shall escape better, for being so contrary to the griping and stingy humour of the covetous; for it is not the vain and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less squandring an Estate away in rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous courses will make a man's conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more tolerable at that day; but it
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:100318:213"/>
is the provident, seasonable, carefull distribution of our Charity for wise and good ends, which shall meet with so glorious a reward.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Especially, in the last place, <hi>if we faint not,</hi> and do not repent of what good we have done, but continue so doing to the end of our Lives. For this reason I presume it is, that many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their greatest <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> to their Deaths; but it is dangerous putting off their Repenting and doing Good till they come to die, for fear their hearts, or those whom they trust deceive them. But if men begin to do well in their health and strength, let them <hi>not faint</hi> when they come to die; but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <hi>charitable</hi> as well as <hi>faithfull unto death, and God will give them a crown of life.</hi>

            <p>And now my business is to make particular <hi>Application</hi> to this great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly <hi>not to be weary in well-doing</hi>; and therefore I shall repeat to you, <hi>A tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which are very commendable ways of <hi>well-doing,</hi> and it is a great advantage to me this Day, that I am only to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you <hi>not to be weary in this well-doing; for in due season you shall reap if you faint not.</hi> You have already broke through many discouragements, and since the sad calamities of Plague and Fire, which made such desolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, you have done even as to these charitable Foundations, what hath been to the Admiration and Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of beholders. Which of us all who saw the City in its Ruins, with so many Churches and Halls and Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals buried in its rubbish, could ever hope to have lived to see them rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with a much greater Glory; and our new-built Hospitals to appear with that Magnificence, that strangers may easily mistake them for Palaces? We have lived in an Age that hath beheld strange Revolutions, astonishing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and wonderfull Deliverances; what all the Fermentations that are still among us may end in, God alone knows; our unanswerable returns to God for his great Mercies may justly make us fear, that he hath greater scourges provided for us; the best thing
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:100318:217"/>
we can do for our selves, is to amend our ways, and to bring forth fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of amendment of life; not barely to own and profess the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> but to adorn it, by holy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary lives, and doing all the Good we can while we have opportunity. And to that end I shall offer these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations, and so conclude.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The more Good ye do, the more Comfort you will find in the doing it. <hi>Therefore be not weary in well-doing.</hi> There is a certain secret pleasure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward satisfaction that follows <hi>doing Good</hi>; which encreases by exercise and continuance. This is so far above the pleasure of the Covetous and Voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in pursuit of their ends, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches nearest of any thing we can conceive, to the satisfaction of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who delighteth in doing Good. It was a remarkable saying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> preserved,<note place="margin">Act. 20.35.</note> 
               <hi>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</hi> How happy do the poor think themselves, when those who are Rich are bountifull to them! But the advantage is on your side; they are the receivers but you are the gainers. What you bestow on them <hi>you lay up in store for your selves:</hi> which
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:100318:218"/>
will yield far greater comfort when you come to die than having raised a vast Estate: for that is only carrying a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er account into another World; but this is a great help to discharge it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doing Good is really one of the best parts of our Religion. <hi>True Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and undefiled before God and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1.27.</note> 
               <hi>to visit the Widow and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless in their Affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the World.</hi> It is not giving a cold formal visit to the Widow and Fatherless that makes any part of Religion, but doing all the good we can to them, by advice and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, by supplying their wants and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of their affairs. No Duty takes in so much of the substance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as true Charity. <hi>It is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5.14. Tim. 1.5. Col. 3.14.</note> 
               <hi>the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, i. e.</hi> of the <hi>Gospel; the bond of perfectness.</hi> That, without which all other pretence to Religion is but flattering of God and mere hypocrisie. For all our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praises</hi> are but verbal acknowledgments; that which he hath put the trial of our love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon, is our love to our Brethren. <hi>For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath seen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4.20.</note> 
               <hi>how can he love God whom he hath not seen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:100318:218"/>3. Doing Good to others is taking the best care of our selves. We all seem very apprehensive of dangerous times, and very fearfull what may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us; the best course every wise and good man can take in difficult and uncertain times, is to do his own duty and to leave events to God. And there is no duty more unquestionable, more safe, more advantageous, to himself as well as to others, than <hi>to do good,</hi> i. e. to be kind and obliging to all, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give injuries, to reconcile enemies, to redeem captives, to visit the distressed, and according to our abilities and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to relieve those that are in wants and necessities. This is the way <hi>to dwell safely, and to be quiet from the fear of evil</hi>; for as long as God governs the World he will take care of those who commit themselves to him <hi>by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Doing Good doth the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the obligations God hath laid upon you by the Mercies he hath vouchsafed to you.</p>
            <p>And now give me leave to plead with you the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therless Children,</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Wounded</hi> and <hi>Maimed,</hi> who cannot help
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:100318:219"/>
themselves, the <hi>Cause</hi> of those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve so much more pity because they cannot pity themselves, being deprived of the use of their Understandings. If God hath provided well for you and for your Children, wherein can you better express your thankfulness for such a mercy than by your kindness and charity to those who are destitute of the means to make them Men. If you have reason to bless God for your good <hi>Education,</hi> shew it by taking care of theirs who may hereafter bless God for your kindness to them. If God hath blessed you with Riches and a plentifull Estate in this <hi>City,</hi> and raised you beyond your hopes and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what can you do more becoming the <hi>Members</hi> of this City than to be kind to the <hi>Children</hi> of those who have been such and reduced to <hi>Poverty?</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from what God hath raised you; do not think much to consider what you have been, as well as what you are. You can never take the just height of God's Mercies to you unless you begin at the bottom; and let others measure your height now, as some have done that of the <hi>Pyramids, by the length of your shadow,</hi> by the refreshments they
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:100318:219"/>
find under you. Think what God hath brought you to, and for what end; Was it for your own sakes, that you might be full, while others are empty; that you might swim in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, while others are pinched with necessities? Was it not rather to make you his <hi>Conduit-Pipes</hi> to convey bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and comforts to others through your means? When you are in health and at ease, then think of the miserable condition of those who<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> lie in <hi>Hospitals</hi> under aches and pains and sores, having nothing to comfort them, but the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of good People to them. They cannot represent their own condition to you, being unable to come abroad to do it. Be ye <hi>good Samaritans</hi> to the wounded and hurt, bind up their wounds with your kindness, and help to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the charges of their cures. This is <hi>loving our neighbour as our selves,</hi> and that is <hi>fulfilling the Law,</hi> and the <hi>great design of the Gospel.</hi> Lastly, when you think what a blessing it is that you do enjoy the use of <hi>your Reason and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> pity the poor Creatures whom God hath deprived of it. How easily, how justly, how suddenly may God cast you into their Condition?
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:100318:220"/>
Shew the esteem that you have of this Mercy of God to your selves, by the freeness of your Charity to those that want it. Therefore, I conclude in the <hi>Words</hi> of the Text, <hi>Let us not be weary in</hi> any of these ways of <hi>well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</hi>

            <p>SAint <hi>Paul</hi> was now a Prisoner at <hi>Rome</hi> for the sake of the Gospel, when he wrote this Epistle to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> but his mind was at liberty;
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:100318:221"/>
And the compass of his thoughts and cares was so far from being confined within the Walls of a Prison, that it reached not only to the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> planted by himself, as those of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi>; but to those which had never seen him, as the <hi>Colossians</hi> and <hi>Laodiceans.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.1.</note> For, saith he, <hi>I would that you knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh.</hi> Had not he trouble enough with the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and those he had conversed with in other parts, but he must take upon him to interpose in the affairs of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches he had never seen? But such was the largeness of the Apostle's mind, the fervour of his Zeal, the extent of his Charity, that <hi>the care of all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches was upon him</hi>; but especially those which had been planted by his means, although not by his personal endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; among which, in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this of the <hi>Colossians</hi> was one. For this <hi>Epaphras</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>a faithfull Minister of Christ to them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 1.7.</note> was imploy'd as an Evangelist under him; and particularly in the Cities of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea, Hierapolis,</hi> and <hi>Colosse,</hi> which were
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:100318:221"/>
not far distant from each other in <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi>; and for the Churches there setled, S. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies, that he had a mighty zeal and concernment: From whence it arose, that hearing of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">4.13.</note> he resolves to take a Journey thither to acquaint him with the State of those Churches, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire his Advice and Direction in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent danger they were in, of being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the simplicity of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, by the plausible insinuations of false Teachers, who pretended to give them a more refined System of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by a composition of Law and Gospel and Philosophy all together. S. <hi>Paul</hi> understanding by him the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous circumstances they were in, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Epaphras</hi> himself was made a <hi>Fellow-Prisoner</hi> with him; as appears by the <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philem. 23</note> sent at the same time with this; yet he finds means by <hi>Tychicus</hi> and <hi>Onesimus</hi> to convey this Epistle to them. Wherein by an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable art of insinuation, far above the eloquent <hi>exordiums</hi> of the Heathen O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, he lets them understand, how passionately he was concerned for their welfare; and what an <hi>Agony</hi> he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own breast for their sakes,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:100318:222"/>
lest under some artificial colours and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fair pretences, they should be drawn off from the Love and Unity and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Gospel. For after he had told them <hi>what conflict he had for them that had not seen his face in the flesh,</hi> he immediately adds, that it was, <hi>that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the Mystery of God and of the Father and of Christ. In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</hi> And when he hath thus set forth the excellency and sufficiency of the Gospel; he then lets fall an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of his design,<note place="margin">V. 4.</note> 
               <hi>And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing words.</hi> But lest they should su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect from hence that ill offices had been done them, and they had been misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to S. <hi>Paul</hi>; in the next verse he tells them, that at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,<note place="margin">V. 5.</note> 
               <hi>he did rejoyce, beholding their order, and the stedfastness of their faith in Christ.</hi> And therefore exhorts them, <hi>As they had received Christ Jesus the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 6.</note> 
               <hi>so to walk in him: i. e.</hi> to adhere to that faith which they at first em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; as he explains it, in the seventh
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:100318:222"/>
Verse. Having thus removed all jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie and suspicion as to their present stedfastness, he doth more openly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress himself to them; in giving them caution against the most dangerous and deceitfull Errours.<note place="margin">V. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Beware lest any man spoil you through Philosophy and vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, after the Tradition of men, after the rudiments of the World, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ.</hi> Not as though there were the least prejudice to Christianity to be imagined by men's searching into the Works of God, or the Nature of Moral Actions, or the digesting our own thoughts or conceptions of things, which is all that is understood by true Philosophy; but that the Model of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which they were in so much danger of being deceived by, was made up, partly of Philosophical Precepts, and partly of Jewish Traditions and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Observations; by which the false Teachers endeavoured to corrupt and adulterate the Gospel of Christ. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the following Discourse, the Apostle first disputes against the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of keeping the Ceremonies of the Law, now under the Gospel, and summs up the force of it, V. 17. <hi>Which are a shadow of things to come, but the

<pb n="435" facs="tcp:100318:223"/>
give Worship to Angels as <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> And although <hi>Baronius</hi> endeavours likewise to clear the <hi>Cerinthians</hi> from this guilt (lest the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> should be found to tread in their steps) <hi>because</hi> Cerinthus <hi>acknowledged one su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power above Angels,</hi>

Especially, since <hi>Theodoret</hi> so expresly affirms, <hi>that those who then pleaded for the keeping of the Law brought in the Worship of Angels, which custom,</hi> he saith, <hi>continued a long time in</hi> Phrygia <hi>and</hi> Pisidia; <hi>and at last the Council of</hi> Laodicea, made a Canon against <hi>praying to Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> are so sensible of the force of this <hi>Testimony</hi> of <hi>Theodoret</hi> against their practice, that they are driven to desperate shifts to avoid it. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, <hi>that he speaks against the Gnosticks</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bell. de S. B. c.</hi> 20.</note> whereas <hi>Theodoret mentions only those who were for keeping the Law. Baronius</hi> saith in plain terms, <hi>Theodoret was mistaken, and that there were no such Hereticks then</hi>; but this is so gross, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and others contradict him in it. Others therefore say, that the Worship of Angels here spoken against, <hi>is the Worshipping of them as makers of the World.</hi> But that is more than St <hi>Paul</hi> saith, for he speaks against that <hi>Worship</hi> which arises from <hi>Humility,</hi> and nothing so proper for that, as the <hi>Worshipping</hi> them as <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> between God and us. Some think it is <hi>when Angels are preferred before Christ,</hi> which is likewise more than the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:100318:224"/>
Apostle saith; and they who chuse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Mediators,</hi> by whom God is more accessible by us; do preferr them in <hi>Vse,</hi> though not in <hi>Dignity:</hi> Others, as the <hi>Jansenists</hi> in their <hi>New Testament,</hi>

               </note> say it is, <hi>When Angels are set up as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators in opposition to Christ</hi>; but that cannot be the Apostles meaning; for then his great business would have been to have proved Christ to be the true <hi>Mediator,</hi> and not <hi>Angels</hi>; and if any <hi>Religious Worship</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable with the Christian Doctrine, the Apostle would never have thus in general condemned it, but with such restrictions and limitations as made it to be evil. Therefore to avoid these difficulties, some conclude that <hi>by the Worship of Angels</hi> is understood <hi>such a Worship as was introduced by a pretended Revelation of Angels</hi>; but against this, we have the concurrent Testimony of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:100318:225"/>
of being Seducers and corrupting the Gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) About <hi>stricter Abstinence and greater Severity of Life.</hi> For these Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers gave out that the <hi>Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> were yet very defective in this matter: And that there were several Societies of Men, both among the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> which went very far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them: as the <hi>Essens,</hi> the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> the <hi>Gymnosophists</hi> and others; who far outstript the Christians in <hi>Watchings</hi> and <hi>Fastings,</hi> in the hard usage of their Bodies, and a total <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from Wine and Flesh,</hi> and other lawfull Pleasures of Life. On which account these false Teachers represented the Christianity, as yet received in these Churches, as too soft and gentle an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and not answering the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that was given of it; but if they had a mind to set it off with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, it would be necessary for them to take in some of the strictest Precepts of those Societies, especially relating to Meats and Marriage, <hi>Touch not, taste not, handle not:</hi> which they magnified as the greatest Instances of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Self-denial, Humility, Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; without which they despised the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:100318:225"/>
Christian Institution as a mean and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing, requiring only the belief of some great things done and suffered by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> in <hi>Judea,</hi> and the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereto till Death, and doing those Offices of Humanity and Kindness to each other, and those Duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>God,</hi> which all Mankind thought fit and reasonable to be done.</p>
            <p>But these pretended refiners of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, were not contented with such common things; they must set up for something singular, and extraordinary; so <hi>Epiphanius</hi> observes of the <hi>Gnosticks</hi> in the beginning,<note place="margin">

And there are scarce any of those who are mentioned as the Authors of great Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief

to the Church, but were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for something of this Nature; as appears by <hi>Marcion, Montanus, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus, Severus,</hi> and others. And which is observable, this sort of singularity prevailed no where more, than in these parts of <hi>Phrygia</hi>; where the <hi>Encratitae</hi> very much encreased and continued so to do in the days of <hi>Epiphanius.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. Notwithstanding all this fair <hi>shew of Wisdom,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn these things as <hi>not pleasing to God,</hi> nor <hi>suitable to the Christian Religion.</hi> For,</p>

            <p n="2">(2.) This new way of Worship, though it hath such a specious <hi>shew of Devotion</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi>; yet it reflects
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:100318:228"/>
on the Honour of <hi>Christ,</hi> as <hi>Mediator</hi>; and therefore the Apostle charges the introducers of it, with <hi>not holding the Head.</hi>

               <hi>The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a Man Gluttonous, and a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> Not that he gave way to any thing like Luxury, or Intemperance, who was the most exact pattern of all true and real Vertues; but because they saw nothing extraordinary as to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Life in these Matters, they looked on him but as one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sort of men, making no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of more than usual Sanctity, as to eating and drinking. And when <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Disciples</hi> who were bred up with greater austerity, were really offended that Christ's Disciples did not fast as they did: our Saviour puts them off with a Parabolical Answer; <hi>Can the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

But what then? <hi>Doth St.</hi> Paul <hi>make it unlawfull to submit to any Orders or Rites appointed by the Church in which we live?</hi> By no means. For neither doth the Apostle speak of those who had lawfull Authority, but of Seducers; nor doth he speak of things appointed merely for <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Decency</hi>; but of such things which are supposed by the Imposers to have more of <hi>true Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Sanctity</hi> in them: more <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi>; and consequently to be <hi>more pleasing to God,</hi> than bare obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> Whoever introduce any such things into the Christian Church, and maintain any such opinions of them, are justly censured by the <hi>Apostle</hi> here, and fall under the condemnation of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) These things, whatsoever shew of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> they make, are really the effects of <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. In placing the main of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in things that would not bear the weight of it, which the Apostle inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in those Words, <hi>Which all are to perish with the using,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 22. <hi>Vid. Theod. Theophyl.</hi>
               </note> i. e. as the <hi>Greek Interpreters</hi> explain it, <hi>the matters of eating and drinking are no such great things, that so much ado should be made about them.</hi> For as our Saviour saith,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.11, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Not that which goeth into the Mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth a Man; for it goeth into the Belly, and is cast out into the draught.</hi> And therefore saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost; for he that in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In supposing the following their own <hi>Inventions</hi> to be more pleasing to God, than the observing his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. For this seems to be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of all; these Seducers made no question, but they had found out ways much more pleasing to God, than those which were in common esteem and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the Christian Churches. So
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:100318:231"/>
that which is call here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, is by the Latins render'd <hi>in Superstitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> i. e. in an opinion of pleasing God by some particular Rites of their own; in making much of their Religion to lie in forbearing some things and doing others, which God never required, and are made no parts of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by Christ or his Apostles. So that here are two parts of the <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> here spoken of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Forbearing some things as <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> which God never made <hi>unlawfull</hi> by any prohibition, <hi>Touch not, tast not, handle not.</hi> The root of their <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> did not lie, as some imagine, <hi>in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the things which they did forbear as in themselves abominable, as some He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks did</hi>; but in an opinion, that God would be so much pleased with the mere forbearance of them, that those who design to please God, were bound to abstain from them, although he had never forbidden them. And there is a material difference between these three things. (1.) Abstaining from things as in themselves unlawfull to be used. (2.) Preferring the Abstinence before the Use, on some particular Seasons and Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. (3.) Making the forbearance of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:100318:231"/>
them as unlawfull (though not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den) as necessary to the pleasing of God. There were such who did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid the use of <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Meats,</hi> of whom the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. And the Christian Church, as St. <hi>Augustin</hi> observes, doth not fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this censure of the Apostle, when in some cases it prefers Abstinence from both. <hi>Ille prohibet,</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. c. Faust. l.</hi> 30. <hi>c.</hi> 6.</note> 
               <hi>qui hoc malum esse dicit, non qui huic bono, aliud melius anteponit.</hi> But yet there may be a <hi>Superstitious Abstinence,</hi> without that Superstitious opinion; or else the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church had no reason to condemn the <hi>Abstinence</hi> of the <hi>Montanists,</hi> who, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> pleads for them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tert. de Jej. c.</hi> 15.</note> 
               <hi>utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that opinion.</hi> Neither was it mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because <hi>Montanus</hi> wanted <hi>Authority</hi> to make Laws of <hi>Abstinence.</hi> But <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> acquaints us with other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against it, <hi>chiefly from the unsui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of it to the design of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And to impose such <hi>Abstinence</hi> as necessary to the pleasing God, is that which the <hi>Church</hi> condemned in <hi>Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>; and the believing it is a <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion</hi>; though of another sort from that which made the <hi>Vse</hi> of them in it self <hi>unlawfull.</hi> For they did it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:100318:232"/>
an extravagant fancy, that <hi>no living Creatures were of God's making, but were produced by some other powers, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him</hi>; as appears by the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> the <hi>Marcionists,</hi> the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and the <hi>Encratitae.</hi> But the same reason could not hold as to those <hi>Judaizing</hi> Christians, who believed the World and all living Creatures were produced by the Power of God.<note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. Their <hi>Superstition</hi> did lie in suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that God would be mightily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with their doing some things of their own invention, as the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> was; which was so far from being commanded by God in the <hi>Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> that they had thence many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against it: but notwith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>anding they thought there was so much of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi>
               <pb n="453" facs="tcp:100318:232"/>
and <hi>Complement</hi> to <hi>God Almighty</hi> in it, that he could not but be very much pleased with it. And when men lay a great weight of Religion upon <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>forbearing things,</hi> neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nor forbidden by the Law of God, that is so far from being a pleasing Worship of God, that it deserves no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name but that of <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Will-worship</hi>; as they do imply a <hi>shew of Wisdom,</hi> without the <hi>Truth and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here arises the main difficulty;
<q>How shall we put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what is pleasing to God, and what is not; or between true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Superstition?</hi> For since the Apostle implies that some things may have <hi>a shew of Wisdom</hi> in them, <hi>i. e.</hi> may seem pleasing to God, which are not so; and other things may be more pleasing to God, which do not make such a <hi>shew of Wisdom</hi> to Men; it seems to be a matter of as great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as concernment to us, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the just and true bounds between <hi>Religious and Superstitious Worship.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This is an enquiry of so great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consequence, for the easing our minds of many troublesome dou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Superstition</hi> in the general, is nothing else but <hi>an unpleasing Worship of God,</hi> I do not speak of that <hi>Worship</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to a <hi>false object</hi>; which is more properly <hi>Idolatry</hi>; but when that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is ultimately referred to a <hi>true Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> as in the <hi>Worship of Angels as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators,</hi> then it is <hi>Superstition</hi> too; it being an undue way of giving <hi>Worship</hi> to the <hi>true God.</hi> I shall not trouble my self with an enquiry into the <hi>Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology</hi> of the words in <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> it being Well observed by <hi>Aquinas,</hi>

            <p>Those who believed no <hi>God</hi> at all, or at least no Providence, accounted all <hi>Religion</hi> to be nothing but <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And it is a weak and silly Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy a late <hi>Commentator</hi> on <hi>Lucretius</hi> makes for his saying,<note place="margin">

               <hi>and the other not; or one is what we like, and the other what we dislike</hi>; do destroy any real difference between them; and make only <hi>Religion</hi> a <hi>Superstition in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion</hi>; and <hi>Superstition</hi> a <hi>Religion out of fashion.</hi> Whereas if there be a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> there must be such a thing as <hi>true Religion: i. e.</hi> there ought to be some Acts in us agreeable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions we have of the Divine Nature. For, His <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> requires our <hi>Fear</hi>; not an amazing, confounding, unaccountable Fear, arising from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and disorder of our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but a just, reasonable, prudent Fear, springing from our most serious thoughts and deepest consideration of things. For, if it be impossible for any thinking man to satisfie himself in the train of Causes, but <hi>he must come to this thought at last, that there is some Cause, whereof there is no former Cause, but is Eternal; which is that we call God</hi>; then it is impossible if this man pursues his
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:100318:234"/>
own thoughts, but the first Consequence from hence will be, that if this <hi>God</hi> be the <hi>first cause of all things, his Power and Majesty</hi> is so great, as to command a due Reverence and Fear from us his Creatures. This is not such a <hi>Fear</hi> as <hi>Men have in a storm, or when a sudden calamity seizeth upon them, which makes them at their wits end, and to run they know not whither for present help</hi>; but it is a settled, calm, composed temper of mind; a Fear without consternation; an awe and Reverence of the Divine Majesty, without terrour and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For, as the mighty Power of God begets fear in us, so the infinite Goodness and Wisdom of God, not only keep up Men's minds from sinking into slavish Fear, and horrible Despair; but fills them with comfortable hopes, and a patient and humble Trust and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his never-failing Providence. And this is the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>true Religion</hi> in the minds of Men.</p>
            <p>But because it tends to the honour of our Maker, and the incouraging one another to Acts of Piety and Devotion, that this inward sense of our Minds be expressed by such external Actions as are agreeable thereto, from thence came
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:100318:234"/>
the necessity of the publick Offices of Religion, wherein we offer up our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Praises to the Divine Majesty in acknowledgment of our Dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for what we have, or are, or hope for. And there is nothing in all this, but what is highly just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and this is <hi>true natural Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then we cannot deny, that there is too great a natural proneness in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to <hi>Superstition.</hi> For, when men cannot shake off the apprehension of a Deity, and yet are conscious to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that they have offended him; the very thoughts of him prove so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to them, that they would be glad to believe there were none at all, and give all the advantage to Atheistical Objections which a willing mind can do: And as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes of Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, <hi>they would be Atheists if they durst.</hi> But finding still an inward dissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and an impossibility of root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the fears of a Deity; the next thing is, to think upon some ways to please him, and to mitigate his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against them. And we can hardly imagine any thing so pompous and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious, so mean and servile, so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and barbarous, so ridiculous and fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:100318:235"/>
but Mankind have made use of it to atone the anger of their Gods. For, the first effect of <hi>Superstition,</hi> on Men's minds, was; that they durst not make immediate <hi>Applications</hi> to the <hi>Supreme Being,</hi> as being too great and powerfull for them: therefore they pitched on some inferiour Beings to mediate, and to offer up their Devotions and Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to him, whom they thought it too great presumption to approach. When thus <hi>Superstition</hi> in the most proper sense of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> had in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure supplanted <hi>true Religion</hi> in the World; then it proceeded to find out such ways and methods of Worship, as they thought would be most pleasing to these inferiour Deities. They erected Temples and Altars to them, and set out their Images with all the Art and Splendor they were capable of; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on extraordinary Occasions they were carried with wonderfull Pomp and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity through the Streets, all Orders of Men attending them with Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Prayers and costly Sacrifices to avert their Wrath and Displeasure. And they were not content with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous Sacrifices, but they studied by all possible means to find out what <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi>
               <pb n="459" facs="tcp:100318:235"/>
would please them best; if they fansied it must be something very dear and precious to them, they stuck not at offering up their very children to appease them; and contrived by loud Musick to stop their Ears from hearing the hideous cries of their Children while they were roasting in the flames. And in their ordinary Sacrifices, they were extremely scrupulous, lest any spot or blemish, or number, or unfit season, or so much as colour should be displeasing to the Gods they offered them too: some must have white and uneven; others black and even Sacrifices; some must have their Sacrifices offered at the rising, some at the setting of the Sun; some must have one sort of Beasts, and some another; and some no less than Man's flesh would satisfy; which inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Sacrifices on some occasions, did almost universally obtain, before the Christian Religion prevailed in the World. But again, other Deities were presumed to be so nice and squeamish, that nothing was to be offered them but Milk, and Wine, and Honey, and some Fruits of the Earth. It were infinite to relate the Rites and Customs of their Sacrifices, and all the ways they used
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:100318:236"/>
to please their Gods, and to find out whether they were pleased or not; by the posture, the tongue, the entrails of their Beasts; by the flying of Birds, the feeding of Chickens, the falling of a staff, the holes of a sieve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable ways of Divination, by which they flatter'd themselves that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the good Will and Pleasure of their Gods, which did not so much satisfie their curiosity, as fill them with perpetual fears, and oppress them with the horrible Bondage of <hi>Superstition</hi>; which exalted almost every thing to the honour of a Deity, and made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves miserable by seeking to please them.</p>
            <p>But although this were the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble state of Mankind, forsaken of God and left to their own inventions; yet such is the weakness and folly of Men, that when God himself had given a <hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>Israelites</hi> to regulate their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, with as much condescension to their weakness, as the Wisdom of his Law would permit; yet so great was the Witchcraft of <hi>Superstition,</hi> that they were always almost-hankering after the <hi>Dotage</hi> of their neighbour Nations. And although they often smarted severely
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:100318:236"/>
for it; yet the rod was no sooner off, but they were ready to return to their former <hi>Superstitious vanities,</hi> and were so obstinately bent upon them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could move them; not their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer experience; not the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the thing; not the terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of God's heavy judgments against them; till at last, when there was no remedy, the whole People were carried into Captivity; from whence the greatest part never returned, and their very memory is lost by a mixture with other Nations. Those who retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, have been so wise ever since, as to abhor that provoking sin of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; which their Ancestors suffered so much for: but by degrees they fell into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of <hi>Superstitions.</hi> For it was thought a mean thing among them to keep to the Law; but the <hi>Traditions</hi> of their <hi>Elders</hi> were looked upon as preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things; and happy was the Man that was strictest in the observance of them. Their frequent Washings, their additional Fastings and Prayers, their Garments, their Postures, their very Looks had such an appearance of Sanctity above other Mens; that a man who kept only to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:100318:237"/>
the Law, was of no regard or esteem for Piety and Devotion.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> among the Jews when Christ appeared, who laid open the foppery and hypocrisie of these great pretenders to extraordinary Sanctity. He directed men <hi>to the love of God and their Neighbours,</hi> as the main substantial parts of <hi>true Religion.</hi> And next to his making a propitiation for the sins of Mankind by the Sacrifice of himself, his great end was to restore <hi>true Religion</hi> to the World, which had been so long buried under the heap of <hi>Superstitions.</hi> And there needed so great an Authority as his was, to assure Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that nothing was so pleasing and acceptable to God, as unaffected Piety, and universal Goodness; which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends under it all the Duties of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Righteousness and Charity. And it is one great Argument of the Providence of God watching over his Church, that he hath caused the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>; without which in all likelihood, the Christian Religion had been long since lost in the World. For the <hi>Jewish
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:100318:237"/>
Christians</hi> who corrupted Christianity, had represented St. <hi>Peter</hi> so favourable to them; and so misrepresented St. <hi>Paul</hi>; that unless Christ's Doctrine had been preserved in his own words, and that by the concurrent Testimony of different Writers, the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had preserved little more than its name in the World.</p>
            <p>And yet with all this advantage, such was still the fondness of Mankind for their own <hi>Inventions,</hi> that even under the Apostles eyes, most of the Churches began to be tainted with these corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; partly by the <hi>Judaizing Christians</hi>; and partly by the followers of <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Menander.</hi> But they all agreed in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing new and mysterious, and more pleasing to God, than the dull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> After the <hi>Apostles</hi> decease, the corruptions still multiplied, and any new pretence to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi> and <hi>Mysteries,</hi> especially being joined with greater <hi>Abstinence and Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Life,</hi> took wonderfully among weak and injudicious Christians, and made them apt to despise the <hi>Churches Devotions,</hi> as too cold and flat, and not having that <hi>Life and Spirit,</hi> that Strictness and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity which appeared among the new
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:100318:238"/>
pretenders. What disturbance on this account did the Spirit of <hi>Montanus</hi> give to the Churches of <hi>Phrygia, Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Cappadocia?</hi> The meer pretence to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> had never done it, had it not been for the stricter Laws of <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Mortification,</hi> and greater Severity of Discipline than was used in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church. It was this which made <hi>Tertullian</hi> swallow the bait he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised before; and the force of all his Arguments against the Church is, we are stricter than you. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all these pretences, the Christian Church still kept it self within its bounds, making nothing necessary to Salvation, but what Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles had made so; yet recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Fasting,</hi> as there were just <hi>Occasions,</hi> especially before the great solemnity of <hi>Easter;</hi> wherein both the <hi>Sacraments</hi> were administred with more than ordinary <hi>Devotion,</hi> and the <hi>Penitents</hi> reconciled to the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look at this day into the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Christian World</hi>; how great a part of it is relapsed into almost <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Superstitions,</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators?</hi>
               <pb n="465" facs="tcp:100318:238"/>
and no great difference in the outward Solemnities and Processions, save that their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are turned into a <hi>Consecrated Wafer,</hi> which is carried in <hi>Procession,</hi> as the <hi>Heathen Gods</hi> were wont to be. It is true, there are great pretences to <hi>Will-worship,</hi> and <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>neglecting the Body</hi> in several <hi>Orders</hi> of Men; and those are looked on as ways of <hi>greater perfection,</hi> than li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the World, and doing good in it. Which we have no reason to think agreeable to the Doctrine of Christ or our Apostle here. But where there is not only <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Merit,</hi> placed in such observations, but <hi>Supererogation too,</hi> they flatly contradict St. <hi>Paul</hi>; for if that be true, these things have far more than <hi>the shew of Wisdom</hi>; for what wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser thing can any man do, than not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provide for his own Salvation, but for others too?</p>

Yet even <hi>this Church,</hi> that is so wise, so moderate, cannot escape the charge of <hi>Will-worship and Superstition,</hi> for the <hi>Orders</hi> that are observed in it. But wherein is it that we are liable to this charge? Do we make the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> any <hi>parts</hi> of our <hi>Religion?</hi> Or
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:100318:240"/>
think that God is any otherwise displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with others violation of them, than as it argues a froward, restless, unpeace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirit? But what is it then? <hi>God,</hi> say they, <hi>hath not commanded these things, therefore they are Will-worship and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is an <hi>Objection,</hi> which for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Church I must remove, before I proceed to what remains. The true Case among us is this, the Church ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points such <hi>Orders</hi> to be observed in it, which have no express <hi>command in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>; some utterly refuse them as <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull,</hi> though no where forbidden in Scripture; the Question is, Whether of these two sorts, those who practise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Orders, or those who utterly refuse, are liable to the charge of <hi>Will-worship</hi> and <hi>Superstition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this, we must state the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Will-worship</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> as they are here used by the Apostle, and then apply it to the present Case.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Will-worship</hi> I have shew'd, is nothing but a forwardness to do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that relates to the pleasing of God; and is said by the Apostle to have <hi>a shew of Wisdom,</hi> and therefore can be no more evil in it self, than <hi>Humility, or
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:100318:240"/>
neglecting the Body</hi>; but whether it be good or evil is to be determin'd by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Those circumstances which make it ill are, when men make those things a <hi>part</hi> of their Religion, which God hath neither commanded nor forbidden; and think God is pleased with their meer doing or abstaining from doing them, and this is true <hi>Superstition.</hi> For there are two things necessary to the <hi>Notion</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the matter about which it is conversant relate to the <hi>pleasing of God. Superstition</hi> I grant, hath been taken by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others from him, for <hi>a dreadfull apprehension of the Deity</hi>; but that is rather the <hi>foundation</hi> of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,</hi> than the definition of it. For a Superstitious Man doth both think God to be angry without just cause, and beyond reason; and to be pleased again without reason. If he thought God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable upon his Displeasure, he must presently despair; but because he thinks he may be easily pleased again, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he bethinks himself in what way he may best do it; and so devises se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways of his own, and useth any means suggested by others, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:100318:241"/>
so unreasonable in themselves, in hopes to please God by them. Thence <hi>Plutarch</hi> mentions such Mens, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>uncouth ways of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>; and he observes, that at the same time, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and reproach God</hi>; they think un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily of him, as of one that is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>very easily provoked</hi>; and yet that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>as easily chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi>; and that is the reason why a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious fear puts men upon finding out any ways and methods to please him, though never so unreasonable; for they looking upon God as a peevish, angry, humoursome Being, they have no certain Rule to judge what will please him, and therefore follow their own fancy and imagination about it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That they be mistaken in their judgment concerning what they believe to be pleasing to God, that is, that they judge that to be so, which really is not. So <hi>Superstition</hi> is an excess or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing in the matter of Worship; that which doth <hi>modum legitimum cultus su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstare &amp; excedere,</hi> saith <hi>Vossius</hi>; which <hi>Etymology</hi> he thinks much better than any other.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, that Religion is <hi>pius cultus,</hi> Superstition <hi>timor inanis
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:100318:241"/>
Deorum; i. e.</hi> one is a reasonable, the other an unreasonable Worship. So <hi>A. Gellius</hi> saith, it is <hi>inepta &amp; importuna Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio</hi>; a foolish and troublesome Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fest. v. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligios.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Festus</hi> applies it to those things which are done, <hi>praeter morem Civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi>; against the Custom prescribed by Law. As those of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> do, to things done against the <hi>commands</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> and so not fasting upon <hi>Saturdays,</hi> and fasting upon <hi>Sundays</hi> are both <hi>Superstitious</hi> in their account; but all the Trumpery of the Mass, and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of their Worship are by no means <hi>Superstitious,</hi> because required by the Church. Which however helps us with a good argument to prove that the Worship of <hi>Images,</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> are required by their <hi>Church</hi>; or else by their own confession they must be <hi>Superstitious.</hi>

<pb n="472" facs="tcp:100318:242"/>
have <hi>a shew of Wisdom</hi>; yet <hi>not in any honour,</hi> saith he, <hi>i. e. they deserve no esteem, being only for the satisfying of the flesh</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> i. e. <hi>of a carnal desire as to these external observations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Superstition</hi> here condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, lay in the supposing God to be pleased with the forbearance of lawfull things; <hi>touch not, taste not, handle not.</hi> Which if we understand either of <hi>Meats</hi> or <hi>Marriage,</hi> was a forbearance of things in themselves lawfull; but they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God would be far better pleased with their forbearance of them. I do not say, it is <hi>Superstition</hi> for any man to abstain from doing what he apprehends to be unlawfull by vertue of a general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: For that is a Moral Duty, and obedience to those places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which bid us abstain from all kind and appearance of evil. But yet it is plain here was a <hi>Negative Superstition</hi> in the forbearance of lawfull things: And so it was in the dispute between Christ and the Pharisees <hi>about healing on the Sabbath-day</hi>;<note place="margin">Matt. 12.10.12.</note> they thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: Christ declares it to be lawfull to do good on the Sabbath-days. Here was no positive observance on the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi> part; Yet here was <hi>Superstition</hi> in
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:100318:242"/>
them; and therefore the true notion of <hi>Superstition</hi> doth extend to the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things in themselves lawfull as displeasing to God.</p>
            <p>But how shall we know, when such a forbearance is <hi>Superstitious?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By these Rules:</p>
            <p n="1">1. If such a forbearance be thought to bring some <hi>special honour</hi> to God. For then, even Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> himself grants it to be <hi>Superstition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fresh Suit, p.</hi> 101.</note> 
               <hi>to abstain from law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things though accounted unlawfull by the Persons who abstain; when some singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar service and honour is by that abstinence intended:</hi> For then he grants it to be <hi>a kind of Ceremonious Worship.</hi> The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then is, when this case happens; for our Abstinence from <hi>Popish</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan Superstitions,</hi> is not any special Act of <hi>Service,</hi> or <hi>Honour</hi> to God. But if we lived where those <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> were required by lawfull Authority; and we refused to comply with them, that would be a special Act of Honour aad Worship to God; it being a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our Minds, that we thought God dishonoured by such Acts, and therefore durst not comply with them. It was once a great Question among the Papists, whether they might lawfully
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:100318:243"/>
come to our Churches, or not; and if not to our Prayers and Sacraments, yet to our Sermons, to avoid the severe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties of the Laws. And after great debate both by a <hi>Committee</hi> of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Rome</hi>; it was resolved in the <hi>Negative,</hi> upon this Reason, because in our Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was <hi>signum distinctivum cultÃ»s,</hi> a mark of distinction as to <hi>Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> and therefore it was an <hi>Act</hi> of special honour and service to God to forbear. To abstain from pouring out Wine, and throwing Incense in the fire, is in it self no Act of Worship; but when the Heathen Emperours commanded the Christians to do it, in token of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their Religion; their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining then from it, was a singular Act of Worship to God. So in the present Case, when men are required by lawfull Authority, to do things which in themselves are lawfull, to testifie their union and conjunction with us in Religion; their refusal in this Case is a special <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi>; and being without Ground, is nothing else but <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When men value and esteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as more holy and more in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:100318:243"/>
of God on the account of such forbearance. As the <hi>Pharisees</hi> did on the account of their <hi>Traditions,</hi> who believed that God had no such people upon Earth as they were; and despised others who were far nearer to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God than themselves, as mere <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi> And it is very natural to Mankind to set a great value upon themselves, for the sake of their affected singularities in Religion; and in a transport of pride and vanity, to tell God himself, as the Pharisee did, <hi>That they are not like other Men:</hi> But this is a certain sign, whatsoever they pretend, that they look on the forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the things which others do, as a part of <hi>Holiness</hi>; and if they do so, it is undoubtedly <hi>Superstition.</hi> For, on this ground we charge the <hi>Papists</hi> with <hi>Superstition</hi> in their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> because they place holiness in them. It is true, they say they are the Instruments to convey some degrees of holiness to them; but this makes no material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; for those who account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves more in God's esteem for the sake of such things, do attribute some real efficacy to such distinctive Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:100318:244"/>
of themselves, as to the obtaining the favour of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When they forbear necessary Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion rather than comply with others in lawfull things, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church they live in, in Prayers and Sacraments: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied to be necessary Duties; but if men resolve rather to forbear these, than to join in such Ceremonies and Prayers as do accompany the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, it is a sign they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the following their own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before the joining in Communion with the Church in the most unquesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Duties of Religion: As in the Case of the <hi>Encraticae</hi> of old, who thought it unlawfull to taste of Wine; and therefore refused to communicate in the Eucharist, unless they might have it in Water alone. Was not this a great <hi>Superstition</hi> in them, rather to forbear communicating with the Church, than not to observe their own fancies in what they thought most pleasing to God, as to the manner of doing it?</p>
            <p>Now to apply this to our own Case.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="477" facs="tcp:100318:244"/>We are often blamed for laying too great weight on the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of this <hi>Church.</hi> But certainly, never any <hi>Church</hi> laid less weight upon its own Orders, supposing that it believes them to be just and reasonable. It places no <hi>holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> no <hi>merit,</hi> no <hi>efficacy</hi> in them, as to the obtaining the Grace and Favour of God: It expects obedience only for <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Peace-sake</hi>; It hath taken great care by <hi>Prefaces</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Rubricks,</hi> to prevent any misinterpretation of its intention and design.</p>
            <p>But on the other side, those who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from us, lay so great weight on their scruples, that they will rather ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard breaking a Church in pieces, rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Religion by our differences, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all the benefit of Communion with a Church, whose Doctrine they approve in all the Duties of religious Worship; than they will yield to the allowance of those circumstances of our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which our Church requires. And now on which side the charge of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi> more justly lies, let all that are impartial judge.</p>
            <p>So much I thought necessary on this <hi>Occasion</hi> to speak, in vindication of our <hi>Church</hi> from this common imputation of
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:100318:245"/>
               <hi>Superstition,</hi> by those who so little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what it means.</p>
            <p>Nothing now remains, but to make <hi>Application</hi> of all to our selves. You see how much mischief <hi>the shew of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> was like to do in the <hi>Apostolical Churches</hi>; let us all have a care of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived by it. It was long since observed by <hi>Menander, That things which were like Truth were more easily believed by the generality of Mankind,</hi>

               <hi>than Truth it self.</hi> So I am afraid it is about Religion, which is the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> here spoken of, that which makes a great <hi>shew</hi> of it to the World, is more apt to prevail among persons of weak and well disposed Minds than true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For <hi>the shew of Wisdom</hi> strikes more upon the fancy and inclination of such Persons, than sober, calm and well-weighed Religion; which seems dull and flat to those who have more warmth and zeal than judgment and discretion. And I do not at all question, but many of the corruptions of the Christian Church came in, from an apprehended necessity of complying with the heat of some over-zealous People; who were not contented with the plain and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:100318:245"/>
Religion of Jesus Christ; but they must, as they thought, heighten and improve it, till they had mixed with it the freaks of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> or the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of <hi>Superstition.</hi>

            <p>In the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> there is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things a <hi>shew of Wisdom,</hi> in <hi>Will-worship and Humility, and neglecting the Body</hi>; And in some of our Sects, that seem to abhor <hi>Will-worship</hi> so much, that for fear of it they will not give ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil respect to men; yet they pretend to <hi>shew of Wisdom in Humility and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body,</hi> but after a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: others have a <hi>shew of Wisdom</hi> too in a wonderfull, I had almost said, <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious</hi> zeal, against what they call <hi>Will-worship</hi> and <hi>Superstition.</hi> But what is to be done in this Case? How shall we avoid being led aside by such a <hi>shew of Wisdom,</hi> on every side? I shall only lay down some Directions, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Fix a true Notion of God and the Christian Religion in your minds. If you judge aright of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it will ease your minds of many uneasie thoughts, troublesome fears and superstitious fancies. He is not capable of being flattered or deceived by us;
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:100318:246"/>
God is neither taken with outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, nor is he pleased with any thing we do, merely because it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to our selves, <hi>The righteous God loveth righteousness</hi>; and he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed best with the innocency, integrity and holiness of our hearts and lives. And for the Christian Religion, take not your Notion of it from the different and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain opinions of Men, but from the Doctrines of Christ and his Apostles. Men do not read the Scriptures as they ought to do, with a design to know their Religion by them; but to justifie what they take to be Religion from them. One would think it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any one that considered the sayings of Christ or his Apostles, to place his Religion in being for or against any particular Modes or Ceremonies of Worship; whereby he may so easily see that it lies chiefly in an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of mind, holy, spiritual, humble, calm, peaceable, charitable, and a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of action to this temper. This is so plain and easie to be understood, that he must read the New Testament with a very ill mind, that doth not find it out. And if you have settled this Notion of true Religion, it will be a
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:100318:246"/>
continual Touchstone about you to judge of all Pretenders.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Set not an equal value on things that are good in order to other things, that you do upon things that are good in themselves. For the one are but the Instruments of Religion, the other are properly the Duties of it.<note place="margin">Mich. 6.8.</note> 
               <hi>He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good,</hi> viz. <hi>to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And this was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken when very costly Sacrifices were offered instead of it; no less than thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, and ten thousands; yea the first-born, and the fruit of their Bodies. And therefore God sets a high value on these Duties, and so ought we. No one that hath any sense of Religion can despise the immediate Duties of Divine Worship; it being a good Saying of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plutarch de Superst. Cic. de Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gib. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> that we are never better than when we approach to God; or, as <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> expresses it, when we do <hi>rebus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis operam dare,</hi> are employed in the Duties of Divine Worship: But yet to do good is better than Sacrifice, and to forgive an injury than the fat of Rams. It is a wise Observation of <hi>Maimonides,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Porta Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, p.</hi> 201.</note> That the intention of the Law of God
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:100318:247"/>
is to keep men within the just Bounds of Vertue; but when men found a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inclination to one extreme than to another, they made use of remedies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to reduce themselves from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, by great severities towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by Watchings, and extraordinary Fastings, and other hardships: but when Fools saw Wise men do these things, they imagined presently that there was an excellency in the things themselves, and that if they did the same things, they should pass for very good men, and be highly in the favour of God. Which, saith he, is just like an ignorant Fellow, who observing the Physicians prescribing Physick to his Patients, and forbiding eating to them, and finding them to recover upon it, should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conclude, that surely it is the best way to live upon Scammony and Aloes, and such like, and so keep himself with the same strictness that was prescribed to the Sick; which instead of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Disease, would certainly bring one: so, saith he, do those who use the remedies of diseased minds in a state of health, they spoil a good constitution of their souls, and make it uneasie and troublesome.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="483" facs="tcp:100318:247"/>(3.) Judge of mens pretences, not by their outward <hi>shew</hi> and <hi>appearance,</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> that goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them. This was the course the Apostle here took; he regarded not their <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> and great <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Mortification</hi>; but he pursued these things to their Fountain-Head, and there he found nothing but <hi>spiritual pride, and vanity of mind.</hi> We must not judge easily nor rashly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this;<note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> but where the evidence is notorious, we have great reason to slight and contemn the most sanctimonious appearance, <hi>i. e.</hi> if there be great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableness and censoriousness towards all who do not comply with them; great scorn and contempt of all other ways but their own; great malice and spight against all who go about to oppose them; where these are, whether in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elsewhere, whatever <hi>the shew of wisdom be,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3.15.</note> this <hi>wisdom des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth not from above, but is earthly, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual, devilish.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 17.</note> 
               <hi>But the Wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easie to be entreated, full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisie.</hi>

                     <hi>Job XXIII.15.</hi>

            <p>THese Words were spoken by <hi>Job</hi>; not in his flourishing and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous state, when that extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Character was given of him, <hi>That there was none like him in the Earth, a perfect and an upright man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1.8.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>one that
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:100318:248"/>
feared God, and eschewed evil</hi>; but, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Devil was permitted to try that malicious Experiment upon him, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the changing his outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, would not alter the inward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of his mind, as to God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For he suggested,<note place="margin">1.9.</note> that nothing but Interest made him so religious, that all his Piety and Devotion was owing to the wonderfull Blessings of God upon him; and if these were once removed, he would fly out into so much impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as <hi>to curse God to his face;</hi>
               <note place="margin">11.</note> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> to speak evil of his Providence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his service. And this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prevailed so far on <hi>Job</hi>'s Wife, that she became an Instrument to carry on the Devil's design, when she said to him, <hi>Dost thou still retain thy integrity?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 2.9.</note> 
               <hi>Curse God and die:</hi> As though she had said,
<q>You see what all your Religion is now come to, and what a condition the Providence of God, on which you trusted so much, hath brought you to; let them serve God, that have ease and plenty, you have nothing left to do now, but in spite of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to put an end to such a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life.</q>
But as it was observed of the old Heathen Oracles, that they had
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:100318:249"/>
often a true meaning in them, but it was commonly misapplied (the Devils own knowledge of future events being but probable and conjectural) so here, it was a shrewd guess that so sudden a change would have such an effect upon some person concerned in it: But he was very much mistaken as to <hi>Job</hi>; who behaved himself with admirable patience and submission to the Will of God, under all his severe afflictions; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that he did not suffer an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent expression to come from him, with respect to God and his Providence: <hi>In all this Job sinned not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 1.22.2.10.</note> 
               <hi>nor charged God foolishly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which was no doubt a great disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to the Devil, who made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he should by <hi>Job</hi>'s impatience have given a terrible blow to Religion, by making the World believe, that it was nothing but a grave pretence of some mens seeming to be better than their Neighbours. For if a man of so much Piety, as <hi>Job</hi> was esteemed, should no sooner be pinched himself with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but he would be quarrelling at God's management of things, the Devil would have inferred, that he did plainly discover, how little influence Religion
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:100318:249"/>
had upon the minds of those, who made the greatest shew of it.</p>
            <p>This had been a very dangerous snare in that Age, to the rest of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, among whom the example of so great a Person, as <hi>Job</hi> was in the parts of <hi>Arabia</hi> where he lived (as appears by the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> and <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Neighbours) did give a mighty reputation to the practice of Religion,<note place="margin">Job 1.15, 17.</note> especially among such a wild and ungo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned People as the <hi>Arabs</hi> were. And in truth, the World is never so kind to Religion, to give a fair interpretation of the failings of those who pretend to it; but how unreasonable soever it be, they will make Religion bear the blame of all their miscarriages who wear its livery. And <hi>Job</hi> himself tells us,<note place="margin">21.14, 15.</note> there were such profane Persons then in the World, who despised and contemned all Religion, as a vain impertinent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant thing, <hi>Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the Almighty that we should serve him? And what profit shall we have if we pray unto him? i. e.</hi> they understood or valued nothing but what made for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent interest; and they were content to
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:100318:250"/>
let God alone with the disposal of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, so they might secure this to themselves. But it was not only then a seasonable vindication of Religion, that <hi>Job</hi> behaved himself with so much patience under his great Calamities; but it continues so to be as long as the memory of his sufferings remains, which hath lasted for so many Ages, that some think the Book of <hi>Job</hi> the oldest Book in the World; (not in the supposed translation into Hebrew, but in the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal <hi>Arabic</hi> or <hi>Syriac</hi>) and is now like to be preserved, as long as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church endures; against which <hi>the Gates of Hell will never be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding the general e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venness of <hi>Job</hi>'s temper, and his quiet submission to Divine Providence, there were two things which touched him more sensibly than all the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his afflictions; and those were,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That God should seem so much displeased with him, as to single him out <hi>as a mark to shoot at,</hi> when he was not conscious to himself of any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety to deserve it, according to the common method of his Providence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:100318:250"/>(2.) That his Friends should call in question his sincerity in Religion, and suspect him guilty of Hypocrisy and secret Impiety; because they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that such signal calamities could hardly fall upon any man, that was not guilty of some such great crime towards God.</p>
            <p>These were a trial of <hi>Job</hi>'s patience indeed; that those from whom he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the greatest comfort, should prove his sorest Enemies; for if God were angry, who could stand before him? and if he were false in his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how could he expect he should be his Friend? But in answer to both these, he owns his fear of God's displeasure, and denies the charge as to his secret Hypocrisie, and both in these few words of the Text, <hi>When I consider, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These words may be understood,</p>
            <p n="1">I. With respect to his apprehension of God's displeasure against him, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am I troubled at his presence,</hi> saith he immediately before; not as though <hi>Job</hi> were like those <hi>Eliphaz</hi> speaks of in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>which said unto God, Depart from us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22.17.</note> or that he
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:100318:251"/>
endeavoured, as profane Persons do, to keep God out of his thoughts as much as he could: for what could <hi>Job</hi> have done under all his Troubles but for God's presence to support him? And therefore he declares his firm resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never to let go his confidence in God whatever became of him; <hi>Though he slay me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 13.15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>yet will I trust in him. He also shall be my salvation; for an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite shall not come before him.</hi> But the <hi>Presence</hi> which troubled him, was the great appearance of God's displeasure; of which again he speaks, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>For God maketh my heart soft, and the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty troubleth me.</hi> As though he had said,
<q>All other considerations make no deep impression upon my mind; but I am no more able to bear up under the sense of God's anger, than the Wax is to forbear melting before the Fire.</q>
And from this sense of his own utter inability to stand before the Power of the Almighty, he elsewhere argues thus with him;<note place="margin">13.25.</note> 
               <hi>Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</hi> Man being as unable to resist the Divine Power, as a leaf is to stand before a tempestuous Wind, or the dry Stubble to stop the rage of a consuming Fire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="491" facs="tcp:100318:251"/>But here are two things to be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make this matter clear before I proceed;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What it was made <hi>Job</hi> so afraid of God <hi>when he considered,</hi> seeing he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists so much upon his own Integrity?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) What apprehensions then ought we to have of God in our minds, when such a one as <hi>Job</hi> said, <hi>When I consider, I am afraid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What it was made <hi>Job</hi> so appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of God's anger that <hi>he was afraid of him,</hi> when he pleads so much for his own Integrity towards God and Man? Doth not this seem to lessen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and satisfaction of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when such a one as <hi>Job was afraid of God?</hi> For, from whence comes all the peace of a good Conscience, but from him? And what content can there be from him, the very thoughts of whom make us afraid? To that I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Mankind ought always to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve an humble and awfull apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God in their mind. And that from the sense of the infinite distance between God and us; as he is our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and we are his Creatures; as he is our Benefactor, and we his Dependents;
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:100318:252"/>
as he is our supreme Lord, and we his Subjects; as he infinitely exceeds us in all the Perfections of his Nature. For, what are our shallow and dark and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused conceptions of things, to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wisdom? By which he compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all the differences of times at one view; and all the Reasons and Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Possiblities of things are <hi>open and naked before him.</hi> What is all the power of Mankind, if it were gathered into one, in comparison with that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, which gave a Being to the World, when it was not; and rules, and governs, and orders all things in it, with greater ease than we can move a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? It is by that, God <hi>hath spread out the Skies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 37.18.16.26.12, 7.</note> 
               <hi>and balanced the Clouds, and garnished the Heavens, and divided the Sea, and hanged the Earth upon nothing</hi>; as it is elegantly set forth in this Book of <hi>Job.</hi> And therefore as <hi>Job</hi> saith to his Friends,<note place="margin">13.11.</note> 
               <hi>Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</hi> For as <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">37.22.</note> 
               <hi>With God is terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majesty:</hi> and therefore <hi>when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,</hi> we have reason <hi>to be afraid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The best of Mankind have guilt enough upon them to make them appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:100318:252"/>
God's displeasure under great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends insist much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that God may see just cause to lay great punishments upon Men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may not see it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For,<note place="margin">4.18.</note> 
               <hi>if he charges his Angels with folly,</hi> as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">15.15.16.</note> 
               <hi>and the Heavens are not clean in his sight; How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iniquity like water? i. e.</hi> whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural propensity to evil, is like that of the thirsty Traveller to drink of the Brook that he meets in his way. But suppose some to have much greater care to restrain their desires than others; yet saith he, <hi>What is man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14.</note> 
               <hi>that he should be clean? and he which is born of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that he should be righteous? i. e.</hi> to such a degree as not to deserve afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from God. And after all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations <hi>Job</hi> makes of his Integrity, he confesses, that there is so much na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and contracted impurity in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that God may justly cast them into the Furnace to purge and refine them.<note place="margin">Job 14.4.7.20.</note> 
               <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> And, <hi>I have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? For,</hi>
               <note place="margin">13.26.</note> 
               <hi>thou writest bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things against me, and makest me pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:100318:253"/>
the iniquities of my youth.</hi> He could not deny but he had sinned enough to deserve God's displeasure: but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the usual method of Providence, he could not but think his Case very hard, to suffer so much for sins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted before he well knew the nature or danger of his sins; for sins so long since repented of, and forsaken (which is the only satisfactory sign of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) and when so many wicked men in the heighth of their impiety, and contempt of God and Religion, go away here unpunished; whereas he had made it his business and delight to serve him, as he speaks in this Chapter, <hi>My foot hath held his steps,</hi>
               <note place="margin">23.11.</note> 
               <hi>his way have I kept and not declined; neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips:</hi>
               <note place="margin">12.</note> 
               <hi>I have esteemed the words of his mouth, more than my necessary food.</hi> But after all this, to find God's hand so heavy upon him, made him sometimes complain <hi>in the anguish and bitterness of his Soul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">7.11.20.</note> 
               <hi>Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to my self?</hi> And else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>I was at ease, he hath broken me asunder;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 16.12.</note> 
               <hi>he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</hi> Nothing sunk his spirit,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:100318:253"/>
till he thought God was displeased with him; and then his heart and courage failed him; and he begg'd compassion from his hard hearted Friends, <hi>Have pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon me, have pity upon me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">19.21.</note> 
               <hi>O ye my friends: for the hand of God hath touched me.</hi> Which makes good the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Wise Man,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.14.</note> 
               <hi>That the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmities; i. e.</hi> a Man's natural courage will carry him through a great many troubles, <hi>but a wounded spirit who can bear? i. e.</hi> when a Man's heart fails him, he becomes a burden to himself; every thing adds to his trouble, and nothing can give him ease but what can revive his Spirit. Now, no consideration in the World doth so break in pieces and confound and shatter the Spirit of a Man, like the apprehension of God's wrath and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against him for his sins; which made <hi>Job</hi> cry out, like one wounded in the most tender and incurable parts, <hi>The arrows of the Almighty are within me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">6.4.</note> 
               <hi>the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit; the terrors of God do set themselves in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray against me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all this,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) God may not be so displeased with such Persons as lie under great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:100318:254"/>
as they apprehend him to be. And this was the truth of <hi>Job</hi>'s Case; his sufferings were extraordinary, and such an unusual concurrence of so many sad accidents, made him think he had great cause to apprehend an immediate hand of God to be stretcht out against him. But the main design of this Book, is to shew that all these afflictions were intended only as trials of his Patience, and that God never loved him better than at this time, when he thought him so much displeased with him; as he shewed in the Conclusion. This is a very hard thing for Persons under great afflictions to believe, and it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary they should; nay, sometimes the apprehension of God's displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them for their sins, is one of the most usefull parts of afflictions: for without this, they are apt either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame Men's minds with discontent and unruly Passions; or to stupefy them with the dull and heavy <hi>Opiates</hi> of <hi>Chance</hi> or <hi>Necessity:</hi> but when afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are looked on as coming from God's hand, this rouses and awakens our minds, and makes us think it necessary to look about us, to search and examine our ways, to find out the particular
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:100318:254"/>
sins we have given way to, which may have justly provoked God to shew his displeasure against us. As we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son above all things, to be afraid of his anger; so it is our Wisdom to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the least change of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance towards us, and to make our Peace with him, and then we have no cause to fear any thing that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us: For the Wise God will then turn all our Crosses into such proper Remedies for the Diseases of our Minds, that the sharpest afflictions will tend more to the purging away our sins, and thereby to a more sound and healthfull state of our Souls, than all the sleeping Potions of the intoxicating pleasures and vanities of this World would ever have done. For, Luxury and Epicurism, with all the Arts of heightning the Pleasures of Life, are things not more delightfull to sense than dangerous to men's Souls. They are like too frequent use of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in a time of health, which weaken the force of Nature by raising it too high. So that were it in the choice of a wise Man to have and enjoy as much of this World as he pleased, he would see a necessity to restrain his appetite, and to deny himself some of the lawfull
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:100318:255"/>
Pleasures of Life; were it only to keep up the relish by variety; and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them less, to hope to enjoy them longer. We have certainly then no reason to complain, if God thinks sit to debar us at all times, any use of unlawfull Pleasures, and an inordinate use of any; since he leaves scope enough for the true contentment of Life; and if at some times he judges it necessary to give us Physick as well as Food, shall we not submit to his Will? For as <hi>Job</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Job 2.10.</note> 
               <hi>Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?</hi> as if he had said,
<q>Shall we think much that <hi>our Father</hi> should be our <hi>Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>; that he who hath been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so kind to us to please us, should now be so kind to undertake our Cure? Shall we complain that our <hi>Physician</hi> doth not humour our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, when he designs our health? God knows what is better for us, than we do for our selves; and that which seems most evil at present, may turn to the greatest good.</q>
I confess afterwards, <hi>Job</hi> being either sowred by the malignity of his Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or heated by the impertinency or bitterness of his Friends Discourses (for
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:100318:255"/>
if they had no relation to his Case, they were impertinent; if they had, they were severe and uncharitable) doth break out sometimes into some expressions of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience; but these arose from the Clouds upon his mind, which made him then apprehend all these afflictions to come from God's wrath and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; the thoughts of which he was not able to bear: but therein he was wholly mistaken, and then only hit upon the truth of his Case when he said, <hi>When he hath tried me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">23.10.</note> 
               <hi>I shall come forth as gold, i. e.</hi> more pure and refined, more bright and glorious.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) In the hardest condition good Men can be cast into, they have more comfortable hopes towards God than other Men can have. <hi>Job</hi> was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted to think the best Friend he had in the World, and whom he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to please above all things, should become his Enemy, and set himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; but he did not always think so, although his Friends represented his condition to him in the blackest and most frightfull manner, which startled him and made him resent his sufferings with great bitterness, and express it with a kind of horror; yet he soon recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:100318:256"/>
himself out of those Agonies, and kept up his trust and confidence in God. And there were two things which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him under all his dismal appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The reflections of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the discharge of his duty to God and Man; and therefore he tells his Friends, after all their sharp reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon him,<note place="margin">Job 27.5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>Till I die, I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move my integrity from me; my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness I hold fast, and will not let it go; my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</hi> It was this which raised his Spirits, and made him stand his ground against the opposition of his Friends, and the scorn of his Enemies: It was this, which made him despise the meanness of those who courted, admired, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd him in his former Greatness; but now despised and derided him, making him the subject of their raillery and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments:<note place="margin">Job 30.9.</note> 
               <hi>And now I am their song, yea I am their by-word</hi>; even theirs who but a little before, as he at large describes it, kept their distance from him, and made way for him as he passed the streets,<note place="margin">29.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> and admired all spoke as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and all he did as the perfection of Wisdom and Vertue. But so wise a Man
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:100318:256"/>
could not be surprised to see flattery turned into scorn and derision; (for no Man thinks to gain by his flattery, who hath not a secret contempt of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he flatters) and so good a Man could not but forgive the unjust reproaches that were cast upon him, as long as he had the inward satisfaction of his own Integrity. And therefore he gives so ample an account of his whole Life and Actions,<note place="margin">Ch. 30. &amp; 31.</note> both in his publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate capacities; not to boast of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, but to be a just vindication of his Innocence under all their aspersions; and to let them see, that the comfort of a good Conscience doth not fail, when Friends do; and as the Wise Man speaks: When <hi>the back sliders in heart shall be filled with their own ways;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 14.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>a good man shall be satisfied from himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The expectation of a future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; either in this World, as he seemed to hope, or at least in another. Some think, that <hi>Job</hi> spake as to this Life, when he said,<note place="margin">Job 19.25.</note> 
               <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">26.</note> 
               <hi>And though after my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh I shall see God:</hi> and so the meaning of these Words is, tho'
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:100318:257"/>
at present his Case seem'd desperate, and his Life past hope, <hi>the worms eating through his skin</hi>; yet he had a secret hope, that God would at last redeem him out of his troubles, and that very loathsome Carkass of his would hold out so long as to see that Day. But the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church hath generally understood them to referr to the Day of <hi>Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> when he was certain that God would reward his innocency and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: And of a future state, it is plain he had an undoubted expectation, when he saith,<note place="margin">27.8.</note> 
               <hi>What is the hope of the Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, although he hath gained, when God taketh away his Soul?</hi> which shews the great folly of Hypocrisie, which can never stand a man in stead beyond this World, where he must leave all his Riches, and Honours, and Hopes, and Happiness behind him; and the just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation good Men had, that God would reward them after this Life, though they were sufferers in this. And therefore, although <hi>Job</hi> had such dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apprehensions of God at present, yet he had very comfortable hopes as to his future condition, when he calls God his Redeemer, even the same of whom he here saith, <hi>When I consider, I am afraid of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="503" facs="tcp:100318:257"/>(2.) But if so good, so vertuous, so sincere a Man as <hi>Job,</hi> had such terrible apprehensions of God, what can we wretched Sinners think of him? if <hi>when he considered, he was afraid of him</hi>; have not we reason <hi>when we consider,</hi> to sink into despair? Can we appeal to God as to the sincerity of our hearts in his fear and service, as <hi>Job</hi> did? Can we say with <hi>Job,</hi> that <hi>we have not gone back from the commandment of his lips, but have esteemed the words of his mouth more than our necessary food?</hi> Have we not rather cast his most just and reasonable commandments behind our backs, and esteemed our vanities, our superfluities, our debaucheries, our follies, <hi>above the words of his mouth?</hi> But if we have not despised his Laws, yet we cannot say, as <hi>Job</hi> did, that <hi>our feet have held his steps, his way have we kept and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined</hi>; for our Consciences cannot but condemn us for the breach of his Laws; and our sins, our great and manifold sins bear witness against us. What ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of God then may we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in our minds, when even <hi>Job was afraid of him?</hi> I answer,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) None ought to look upon God as so terrible, as to make them despair.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="504" facs="tcp:100318:258"/>(2.) Men ought to have different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of God, according to the nature and continuance of their sins.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) None ought to look upon God as so terrible, as to make them despair. For when our apprehensions of God are such as drive us from him, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the great end of Religion, which is to bring God and Man nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. None ought to exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from mercy, whom God hath not excluded from it; and God excludes none whom he invites to repent, with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of forgiveness, if they do it; and the goodness and long-suffering, and forbearance of Sinners, is on purpose design'd to lead them to Repentance. So that after all this, to despair, is not only to reject the mercy which God offers, but to question his Truth and sincerity, to slight his Patience, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage his Goodness, and to look upon him as a most revengefull and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Being; which is, to entertain most dishonourable and unworthy thoughts of the best, the wisest, the most merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and compassionate Being in the World; who hath proclaimed himself to be a <hi>God mercifull and gracious,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 34.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:100318:258"/>
truth, keeping mercy for thousands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving iniquity, transgression and sin, i. e.</hi> to all that truly repent of them. So that <hi>when we consider,</hi> we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>to be so afraid of him</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Men ought to have different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of God, according to the nature and continuance of their sins. For as on the one side, the Scripture assures us, that <hi>God knoweth our frame, and remembreth that we are dust</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 103.14.</note> and therefore will make all just and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able allowances for the unavoidable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Humane Nature, and all circumstances that abate the wilfulness of our evil Actions: so on the other side, at the same time when he declared his infinite goodness, he adds, <hi>and that will by no means clear the guilty</hi>; not of any kind of sin; for then none could escape, since all have sinned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are become guilty before him: but <hi>the guilty</hi> are such, as add impenitency and obstinacy to their sins; such as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and presumptuously, not only break; but contemn his Laws; not barely neglect their duty, but despise it; such as are not meerly cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different about Religion, but are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:100318:259"/>
concerned against it, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to expose it to scorn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. For a very judicious Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saith, This severity of God here spoken of,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>H. Grot.</hi> in loc.</note> 
               <hi>in visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children,</hi> &amp;c. is not to be understood of all crimes, but of such as immediately concern the honour of the Divine Majesty, such as Apostasy, Idolatry, and consequently Atheism and Irreligion; which is a Plot against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, an attempt to dethrone the Divine Majesty, or to make his Government insignificant in the World. If faults are justly aggravated among Men, not so much from other circumstances, as from the dignity of the Person against whom they are committed, and from the tendency of them: Will not the parity of reason so far hold, as to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate those sins which are immediate offences against the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> and which tend to overthrow his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World?</p>
            <p n="2">II. And so I come to the second sense of these Words, as they may be taken for <hi>Job</hi>'s Vindication of himself from the unjust charge of his Friends, as though he were a <hi>secret Hypocrite,</hi> or
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:100318:259"/>
a contemner of God and Religion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a fair outward shew of Piety and Devotion. For, <hi>Eliphaz</hi> in plain terms, in the foregoing Chapter, tells him, he was one of those who thought God was at too great a distance to take notice of things upon Earth. <hi>And thou sayest, how doth God know?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 22.13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>Can he judge through the dark Cloud? Thick Clouds are a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, that he seeth not, and he walketh in the circuit of Heaven.</hi> Which is in short, to charge him with denying the Providence of God; and reckon him with those <hi>that said unto God, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 22.17.</note> 
               <hi>and what can the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do for them? i. e.</hi> with such as would have nothing to do with God or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, looking on it as a foppish useless thing: but however, he gives him good counsel to repent of his folly, and to apply himself yet to God; <hi>Acquaint now thy self with him, and be at peace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">21.</note> 
               <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by good shall come to thee. Receive I pray thee the law from his mouth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22.</note> 
               <hi>and lay up his words in thine heart: i. e.</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to be Religious in good earnest, and to let the fear of God make a deep impression upon your Soul, and you will find great benefit and advantage by it. <hi>If thou return to the Almighty,</hi>
               <note place="margin">23.</note> 
               <hi>thou
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:100318:260"/>
shalt be built up,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> finding his Friends so often letting fall expressions to this purpose, and knowing no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable reason for it, but a groundless suspicion they had entertained, because of his unusual sufferings, makes here in this Chapter a solemn protestation of the mighty value and esteem he had for the Laws of God,<note place="margin">23.11, 12.</note> that <hi>he constantly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them, and esteemed them more than his necessary food.</hi> And to let them know that this was no sudden heat, he tells <hi>Eliphaz,</hi> that the fear of God in him, came from the most weighty and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous consideration; <hi>When I consider, I am afraid of him:</hi> as if he had said,
<q>I have spent many thoughts about God and Religion, whether there be any just reason for Mankind to apprehend and stand in awe of an infinite Being above them; and I do assure you, the more I have fixed my thoughts upon this matter, and laid all things before me, the deeper impression the fear of God hath made upon me: or as some render it, <hi>perpendo &amp; paveo, I consider, and I fear him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein are two things implied.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="509" facs="tcp:100318:260"/>I. That Men's disesteem of Religion doth arise from want of <hi>Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That the more Men <hi>consider,</hi> the more setled and fixed will their minds be in the esteem and practice of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That Men's disesteem of Religion doth arise from the want of <hi>Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which will best appear, by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the most common and prevailing reasons of Men's disesteem of it; which are chiefly these two;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Their looking on Religion as a matter of meer <hi>interest and design,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other foundation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The unaccountable folly and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious fears of Mankind; which makes them think more to be in it than really is.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Looking on the whole business of Religion as <hi>a matter of interest and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>; first started by some great <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians</hi> to tame and govern Mankind, and ever since kept up by a Company of <hi>Priests</hi> who lived upon the Cheat, and therefore were bound to maintain,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:100318:261"/>
and to keep it up; which otherwise would sink to nothing.</p>
            <p>This is the worst can be said against Religion; and it is bad enough of all reason, if it were true: and we should deserve all the scorn and contempt, which such Men treat us with, if we were but accessary to so great a fraud and imposture.</p>
            <p>But is there such a thing as <hi>Reason</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Mankind? Can we judge of what is true and false; probable or improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; certain or uncertain? Or must some things be run down, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining? and others taken up, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other colour of reason, than because they serve to such a purpose?</p>
            <p>For God's sake, and for our own sakes then, let us <hi>consider</hi> these things a little better, before we pronounce against them; or entertain any doubt or suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of them in our minds. And there is this great reason for it, that the wisest, the best, the most considering, the most disinteressed Men have taken the part of Religion, and been zealous Defenders of it; whereas on the other side, the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the looser, the more debauched part of Mankind, have been most enclined to Atheism and Irreligion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:100318:261"/>But if we have not <hi>Reason</hi> of our side, we are content to give up the Cause, and to be thought <hi>Deceivers</hi> (which goes very hardly down with an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous mind:) and if on the other side, there be nothing found but false and groundless suppositions, or unreasonable suspicions; I hope, <hi>Religion</hi> may be fairly acquitted from being thought a meer contrivance of <hi>Politicians,</hi> and we from being <hi>the Silver-smiths</hi> to this <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Those who make Religion to be such a contrivance, must suppose that all Mankind were once without any such thing as Religion. For, if some crafty <hi>Politicians</hi> did first start the notion of an <hi>Invisible Being</hi> among the rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking Multitude, the better to awe them into Obedience to Government; then Mankind must have lived before those <hi>Politicians</hi> appear'd, with as little sense of God and Religion, and with as much security and ease, as to the thoughts of another World, as the very Beasts that perish. If this were true, these Politicians were so far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the interest of Mankind, that they were the greatest Enemies to it; by filling their minds with such uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:100318:262"/>
fears, as rob them of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disturbed Tranquillity which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed before. But when and where did this race of mankind live, whom these designing Men first cheated into the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Deity, and the practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? The eldest Writings in the World, without all dispute, are those of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures; and among these, the Book of <hi>Job</hi> hath been thought the most antient; for in all this Book we have not one word of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or of Circumcision; which makes it very probable to have been written before the Children of <hi>Israel</hi>'s coming out of <hi>Aegypt</hi>;<note place="margin">

their minds. And they not only give an ample Testimony as to their own times, but they appeal to all the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of former times;<note place="margin">Job 8.8.</note> 
               <hi>Enquire I pray thee, of the former Age,</hi> saith one of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, <hi>and prepare thy self to the search of their Fathers.

               <hi>and the hypocrites hope shall perish.</hi> And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of his Friends speaking of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable judgments of God upon the World, saith to <hi>Job,</hi>
               <note place="margin">22.15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overthrown with a flood? i. e.</hi> the Men of the old World. And what was their great and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sin? A contempt of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Which said unto God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">17.</note> 
               <hi>Depart from us; and what can the Almighty do for them?</hi> This is the oldest, and truest, and severest instance of such a profane and irreligious temper, and the great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief it brought upon the World; which shews, that this is not the original dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:100318:263"/>
of Mankind, but the monstrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degeneracy of it. But if they are unsas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisfied with the Testimony of <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends, let them produce any to be mentioned the same Day with it, which can pretend to give a truer account of the Religion of the first Ages of the World: I do not mention <hi>Moses</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his Authority be unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) lest he should be thought one of these <hi>Politicians,</hi> who inspired the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Israel</hi> with the Principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but I the rather chuse this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the free Princes of those parts of the East, who were under subjection to no common Authority, yet were so early possessed themselves with such firm Principles of Religion, and assure us that all good Men had the same; and that they were slighted by none, but such loose and profane wretches, whom God set up for the Monuments of his Indignation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Suppose we should allow that in a particular Nation, some great and wise Man should think sit to reclaim a loose and barbarous People by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion; how doth this prove Religion to be false, or what doth it signifie to the universal consent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind?
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:100318:263"/>
Is it any Argument that there is no foundation in Nature for Justice, Charity, and common Humanity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wise Men have been put to use variety of methods to reduce Canibals to civility? And it would be as good arguing against all Morality from thence, as against Religion, because it was judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wise Men a necessary instrument to civilize Mankind. And as far as I can observe, Religion and Civility have risen and sunk together. The Roman Orator made a bold Challenge, as to the then known World, to name any Nation <hi>so barbarous, that they had no Religion among them.</hi> And although the Romans knew but little of the habitable World in comparison of what is now known; yet upon the whole matter, the new discoveries add force and strength to the Argument; only with annexing this observation, That the more improved and civilized any People have been, the more regard they have had to Religion; the more ignorant, sottish, and barbarous they were, although they were not wholly without Religion, yet it was in less esteem and honour among them: and this observation will hold, as to all the
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:100318:264"/>
Nations since discovered both in the East and West-Indies. But what a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty number of <hi>Politicians</hi> must spring out of the Earth at once, to scatter <hi>the seeds of Religion,</hi> in such a manner, over all the face of the Earth? It is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a few Men, though never so subtle, never so experienced, should be able to captivate all Mankind in so great a variety of Language, and distance of Countries. And such an universal Effect must have some common and universal Cause; which the invention of a few crafty Men could never be.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) But suppose this to have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in some one unlucky Age, when the Earth brought forth such a fruitfull crop of <hi>Politicians</hi>; yet how comes it to pass, since these have so long been laid in their Graves, the effect of this Policy should still remain all the World over? For, every Age is apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Policy of the foregoing; and whether the men of the present Age stand upon the shoulders of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or not, they are very apt to think they see farther than they; how comes it then in so many Ages, as have passed since these deep <hi>Politicians</hi> lived, that no other Persons have been able to lay
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:100318:264"/>
open the artifice of Religion so, as to free mankind from the pretended slavery of it? It cannot be said, <hi>that there were none to attempt it</hi>; for that were to own an absolute consent of all mankind as to Religion. And we know there were some once at <hi>Athens,</hi> who set up with a design to overthrow Religion; but with so very little success, whatever the Roman Poet boasts, that they were fain to be very private in their meetings: and the City was so little moved with their Discourses, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Act. 17.22.</note> 
               <hi>the Men of Athens, were in all things too su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious.</hi> It cannot be said, <hi>that there were none ready to join in such a design</hi>; for all bad men had rather there were no Religion at all; and their number is never small, and never unwilling to carry it on: How comes it then after all, that Religion still prevailed, and the fears of a Deity could not be shaken off, no not by the greatest <hi>Politicians</hi> themselves, who thought they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all the Arts of Government, as well as any that had been before them? Would not some of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who had none to controul them, have been glad to have eased themselves of the fears of an invisible Power? But
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:100318:265"/>
they found, after all their strugglings, it was a thing not to be done; God and Conscience were so much too hard for their loose reasonings set up against them, that where men had shaken off the love of Religion, they could not shake off the fears that follow the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it. But where mankind have been imposed upon, when once the cheat is discovered, all its force is for ever lost: for men do not love to be deceived, especially in matters that so very nearly concern them; so that if Religion had been a trick of so long standing, assuredly it would have been hooted out of the World long ago; and nothing would have been so ridiculous as to pretend to it. But thanks be to God, the credit of Religion is not yet worn out of the World; which can be owing to nothing but to those invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reasons, on which it stands. For there hath wanted nothing of wit or malice in profane Persons, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and blow up the reputation of it. But the foundations on which it is built, are so firm and stable, and have endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the violent shocks, and secret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of so many Ages, that as long as reason and civility hold up in the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:100318:265"/>
World, we need not question but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion will. If once I begin to see Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind cast off all the reins of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and run wild and savage, quitting all the conveniences and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of Houses, and Lands, and Cloths, to live naked in the Woods, and to feed on Roots and Acorns, because they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that all Civil Government, was a crafty design of some cunning Men to get above others; I may then begin to think that such suspicions about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may prevail upon Mankind to cast off the most reasonable obligations to maintain the profession and the practice of it. For although the Reasons on which Religion is grounded, be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on Civil Authority, such as the train of Causes, the Motion, Order, Beauty, usefulness of all the parts of the Universe; which remain the same in all Ages, and under all Revolutions: yet the Principles of Religion do really give so much strength and support to Civil Government, that none who have a kindness to the one, can be Enemies to the other; and they who suspect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be an Imposture, will be as ready to suspect all Government to be no better: the consequence whereof
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:100318:266"/>
will be nothing but Barbarism and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) But it may be said, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Principles of Religion in general, are reasonable enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and the things we observe in the World, do naturally lead men to own a Deity; yet when they reflect on the strange <hi>folly</hi> and <hi>superstitious fear</hi> of mankind, they are apt still to suspect, that men being puzled and confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have frighted themselves into the belief of Invisible Powers, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Acts of Worship and Devotion to them, as appears by so many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Deities among the Heathen; and the superstitions which still prevail on so great a part of the World. But this way of reasoning is just as if a man should argue that there is no such thing as true Reason in mankind, because ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is a wild, extravagant, unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable thing; or that we never see any thing when we are awake, because in our Dreams we fansie we see things which we do not. We cannot deny the follies of mankind about Religion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ancient or Modern: but when was it given to all the World to be wise? It were extremely to be wished, that
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:100318:266"/>
nothing but pure and undefiled Religion should obtain in the World? or at least that the Christian World were purged from the follies of Enthusiasm and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition. But alas! the more we consider all the wilfull errours, and involuntary mistakes, vicious Inclinations, violent Passions, foolish Opinions, strange Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> superficial Reasonings, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Resolutions which are incident to Mankind, we shall see greater reason to wonder, that there is so much true Religion in the world, than that there is no more. Nothing but the strong impression God hath made of himself on the Souls of Men; nothing but a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Hand could have kept such a flame alive, in the midst of so many contrary Winds of Mens different Passions and Interests, and such a rough and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Sea, as the state of this World hath generally been with respect to true Religion. But if through the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God it fares better among us, as to outward circumstances (for which we ought to be very thankful) let not Religion bear the blame of all the follies and indiscretions of those who profess it. It is a hard Case, if the common weaknesses of Humane Nature, and
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:100318:267"/>
those faults which Men commit through the want of Religion, shall be laid to the charge of it. But nothing is more apt to incline Men of better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to ill thoughts of Religion, than to see it made use of, to serve bad pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and designs, to cover ambitious projects; and to draw in People the more easily into Faction and Rebellion; and while they look on this side of the Picture, and see there nothing but the lamentable spectacles of the mischiefs which have been done in the World un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of Religion, they are far from thinking those <hi>Politicians,</hi> that invented it; it being so easily turned upon the Government, and being then so dangerous to it. (Which is a farther Argument to me, that it could not be a contrivance of such Men: for then there would have been no other Scheme of Religion owned in the World, but that of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> which being so great a Novelty, it is a certain sign, that Religion was not framed meerly to serve the ends of Government.) But however, that only true and holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which we profess, is so far from giving any encouragement to seditious Practices, that it is not possible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:100318:267"/>
a Religion, which we must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to whatever we suffer for it, that should more effectually recommend the Duties of Quietness, Patience, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Authority, than the genuine Religion of our Saviour doth. As long therefore as the Rules of our Religion are so plain and easie, so reasonable, so useful, and beneficial to Mankind, we ought not to lessen our esteem of it, for the sake of any weak, or super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, or hypocritical pretenders to it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Having thus far shewed, that Mens disesteem of Religion comes from the want of <hi>Consideration,</hi> I now come to the last thing I designed, as the <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the rest, <hi>viz.</hi> That the more Men do consider, the more they will esteem Religion, and apply themselves to the practice of it.</p>
            <p>And now methinks, I may with greater assurance address my self to all sorts of Persons, since all that I shall request, will lie in two very reasonable things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To <hi>consider</hi> impartially what is fit for them to do in Religion.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="524" facs="tcp:100318:268"/>2. To practise so much of Religion, as upon <hi>Consideration</hi> will appear fitting to be done.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) To consider impartially what is fit for them to do in Religion. I am not going about to perswade you to leave your Estates and Imployments, and to retire your selves from the World and to give up your selves wholly to Devotion. For I do not deny but that they who serve their Prince and their Country, and follow their lawful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, with an honest and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious diligence, and neglect no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Duties of Religion, do carry on the great ends of Religion, as well as those, whose time and occasions will give them leave to devote themselves more to Fasting and Prayer. But let none think the matters of Religion to belong to others, and that they have business of another nature to attend upon, as though paying their duty to God, were fit only for those who had nothing else to do. While <hi>Job</hi> was in the height of his Prosperity, and was <hi>the greatest of all the men of the East</hi>;<note place="margin">Job 1.3.</note> he tells his Friends how much he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in doing all the good he could by works of Justice and Charity;<note place="margin">

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> So that not only constant Offices of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but more solemn Acts of Devotion at certain seasons, are not only agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ancient practice of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, but to the most ancient Principles of natural Religion, as they were understood and practised in the time of <hi>Job</hi>; who was so great a Person in God's esteem, that himself, who knew him best, gave that Character of him, <hi>That there was none like him upon earth</hi>; and therefore we cannot follow a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Example.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Let us then set our selves to practise all the known Duties of our Religion, and the more we consider these things, we shall be more resolved to do it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="526" facs="tcp:100318:269"/>(1.) That God infinitely deserves from us all the service we can do him.</p>

            <p n="1">(1.) That God infinitely deserves from us all the service we can do him. <hi>Can a man,</hi> saith <hi>Eliphaz, be profitable to God,<note place="margin">Job 22.2.</note> as he that is wise may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himself? i. e.</hi> he cannot: but yet if God expects and requires such service from us, we have no reason to enquire farther; for we are certain all we can do, falls infinitely short of the obligations he hath laid upon us For let us <hi>consider,</hi> Was it not God who formed us in our Mothers Womb, and so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously framed and fashioned all the parts of our Bodies? Was it not He, that breathed into us the breath of Life, that first set the <hi>Wheel</hi> in motion by the course of the Blood, and setled the <hi>Cistern</hi> in the Heart to receive and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse it,<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.6.</note> and the <hi>Pitcher at the fountain,</hi> to take it at its return from the Veins? Was it not He, that fixed the <hi>golden Bowl</hi> in the Head that covers the Brain, and stretched out the <hi>silver Cord</hi> of the Nerves over the whole Body, for the
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:100318:269"/>
admirable use and service of all the Parts? Was it not He, that endued us with those noble Faculties of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Reasoning, Reflecting, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring, Discoursing with others, and Governing our selves? Was it not He, that made all the Parts of the World about us so serviceable and beneficial to us? Was it not He, that preserved us from so many and great Dangers which we have been exposed to by open Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and secret Conspiracies; by Fire, and Sword, and Plague; by storms at Sea, and upon Land too? Was it not He, that hath so often scatter'd the Clouds, that threatned us, when the face of the Heavens gathered blackness, and all things seemed to tend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion? Is it not He, who still wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully continues our Peace and Plenty, amidst all the sad complaints, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable condition of our Neighbours? yea, who continues our Laws, our Government, our Religion amidst all the Fears and Conspiracies which have been among us? And shall we think much to serve so Wise, so Mercifull, so Gracious a God? Is it not He, that hath exercised so much patience, and long-suffering, and goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towards
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:100318:270"/>
us in order to our Repentance? That still offers to us the most unvalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Blessings of the pardon of our Sins, and everlasting Happiness upon our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Repentance? Yea, is it not He, that hath given his own Son to die for our Sins, and exposed him to the Reproach and Pain of an accursed Death upon the Cross, that he might be a Sacrifice of Atonement for us? And will not all these Motives prevail with us to fear and serve him, who hath deserved so much more from us, than the service of our whole Lives, in the most perfect Obedience, would make a requital for? Shall we then grudge him that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sincere Obedience, which he is not only willing to accept of, but hath promised to reward with a Crown of everlasting Glory? Which is the last thing to be considered.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That in serving God faithfully we do most effectually serve our selves and promote our own Interest.<note place="margin">Psal. 49.18.</note> 
               <hi>Men will praise thee,</hi> saith the <hi>Psalmist, when thou dost well to thy self.</hi> Not, when thou pamperest thy Body, and thereby layest a foundation for Lusts and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases; not, when thou <hi>heapest up Riches, and knowest not who shall gather them</hi>;
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:100318:270"/>
not, when thou givest way to all the Vanities and Follies of a deceitful World: but when thou takest a just care of thy true and lasting Interest. For as <hi>Job</hi> saith, <hi>God</hi> looked on this as the proper Wisdom of Mankind: <hi>Vnto Man he said,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 28.28.</note> 
               <hi>The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil is understanding.</hi> And that is certainly our true Wisdom, whereby we secure our best Friend in all conditions, we disappoint our greatest Enemies, we lay the surest foundation for Peace and Tranquillity in our Minds while we live, and a Blessed Eternity when we die.

            <p n="1">(1.)

a great and effectual Door was open'd unto him.</hi> What, for one single <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Church</hi> to be formed, in so great a City, with all the success St. <hi>Paul</hi> had in his Preaching there; when, in far less time, he planted so many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in other Places!</p>
            <p n="2">(2.)

of that <hi>Apostolical Office,</hi> which he was entrusted with the management of; And especially about these things,</p>

            </p>
            <p>Some have thought these words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of <hi>Penitents,</hi> and not to the <hi>Ordination</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> before mentioned; because it immediately follows, <hi>neither be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of other men's sins</hi>; but I see no Cause to recede from the Sense general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, for these Reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Because St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in relation to <hi>Penitents</hi>; but he had done it in this <hi>Epistle,</hi> with respect to <hi>Ordination</hi>; and that in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s own Case; wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> as the principal Person did in an Authoritative manner, <hi>lay on his hands,</hi> as himself expresses it, in the second <hi>Epistle</hi>; and the <hi>Presbyters</hi> assisted in <hi>laying on their hands,</hi> to manifest their Concurrence and Approbation:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> but <hi>the
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:100318:275"/>
laying on of hands</hi> is no where in these <hi>Epistles,</hi> applied to the other Sense;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.14.</note> nor in any other place of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If these words do not <hi>relate</hi> to <hi>Ordination,</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> would have given <hi>Timothy</hi> no particular direction, about that which was one main part of his Office. As it is expressed concerning <hi>Titus, That he was appointed to ordain Elders in every City:</hi> And no doubt <hi>Timothy</hi> had the same <hi>Commission,</hi> which is no where intimated but in these words.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Supposing, <hi>laying on of hands</hi> then equally used in both Cases, yet the Apostle gives no Rules concerning the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of <hi>Penitents,</hi> as he doth concerning <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi>; and therefore we have more cause to apply it according to the chief intention and design of this <hi>Epistle</hi>; but he saith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before, what <hi>Penitents</hi> were to be reconciled; and after what time, and under what Conditions they were to have <hi>hands laid on them in</hi> token of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. And there is no concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Evidence</hi> of such a Practice, so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Christian Church.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The following words are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a very good meaning, according
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:100318:276"/>
to this Sense. For then <hi>being partaker of other men's Sins,</hi> doth imply, that as it is a Fault in those who rudely, and inconsiderately, without due preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, do rush upon so Sacred an Office; so those cannot acquit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of a great share in their Guilt, who do not use their best endeavours, by due <hi>Examination</hi> and <hi>Trial</hi> of the Persons, to keep them from entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, till they are prepared and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for it.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) The great use of the <hi>laying on of hands</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> is for the setting Persons apart for the discharge of a Sacred Office. So, when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Deacons</hi> was first instituted, it is said,<note place="margin">Acts 6.6.</note> 
               <hi>They were set before the Apostles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</hi> And which is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, when <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> by the particular appointment of <hi>the Holy Ghost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 13.2, 3,</note> 
               <hi>were to be separated unto the Work whereto God had called them</hi>; it is said, <hi>And when they had fasted and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.</hi> Here it was not for <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 16.18. Act. 28 8. Act. 8.15.15.19.6.</note> as the <hi>Apostles</hi> sometimes used it to Sick Persons; nor for confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi>
               <pb n="541" facs="tcp:100318:276"/>
as at other times they used it; (and probably this was <hi>the Gift of God</hi> which <hi>Timothy</hi> had,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.6.</note> by <hi>laying on of the Apostles hands</hi>;) neither was it a mere <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Benediction,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 48.14. Mark 10.26.</note> as <hi>Jacob laid his hands on the sons of Joseph;</hi> and our <hi>Saviour on the Children when he blessed them</hi>; but it was a solemn <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Dedication</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Persons to God, when they are set apart for the Exercise of a Function which immediately related to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. I confess, that among the <hi>Jews,</hi> it was not used in the <hi>Consecration</hi> of <hi>Priests</hi>; For,<note place="margin">Exod. 29.9.10.15.19.</note> 
               <hi>Aaron and his sons were to lay their hands on the Sacrifices</hi> that were offered on that occasion, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on <hi>the Ram of Consecration</hi>; but the Ceremony was performed by putting some <hi>part of the Ram, and the Cakes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 8.14.18.22.</note> 
               <hi>and the Wafer upon Aaron's hands, and his sons hands.</hi> For the Priesthood of the Law being a <hi>Work of the hands,</hi>
               <note place="margin">26.27.28.</note> the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony</hi> was very fitly applied to them; but that of the Gospel being more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual and spiritual, the <hi>laying on of hands on the Heads</hi> of the Persons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted thereto, was more agreeable to the design of it. And this was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Custom among the <hi>Jews</hi> in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the highest nature. So

               <hi>Moses</hi> laid his hands on <hi>Joshua</hi>; and then it is said,<note place="margin">Numb. 27.18.23. Deut. 34.9</note> 
               <hi>that he was full of the Spirit of Wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him:</hi> and from hence it came to be an usual Ceremony among the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Solemn Designation of Persons for Sacred employments, either to be <hi>Rulers</hi> or <hi>Teachers</hi> in their <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues.</hi> And from thence it was not only brought into the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> but made use of to express that <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> which Persons do receive together with it, for the <hi>Exercise</hi> and <hi>Discharge</hi> of their <hi>Ministerial Function.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that from these Words, there are Three things considerable to be spoken to.</p>

               <pb n="543" facs="tcp:100318:277"/>(I.) The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Office</hi>; which may relate both to <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> before mention'd; But the principal parts of that <hi>Office,</hi> which is here chiefly meant, are by St. <hi>Paul</hi> said to be these two; <hi>Ruling well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Ruling well</hi>; Not, in opposition to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was to <hi>Rule them well</hi>; nor so as to imply, that the entire Power of Government was lodged in a <hi>College of Presbyters</hi> then,<note place="margin">Hier. <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in Epist. ad</hi> Tit.</note> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines; for what had <hi>Timothy</hi> then to do in the governing them? I cannot find any Argument of Force in the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,</hi> to prove, that ever the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches</hi> were under the sole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> For what St. <hi>Jerome</hi> alledgeth, doth by no means prove it: I grant he proves, <hi>That the Name of Bishop and Presbyter were at that time common to the same Persons</hi>; But what then? Suppose the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> here in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Epistle were the same: Doth this prove, that these Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the Church without <hi>Timothy?</hi> The true Question is not about the Sense of <hi>Words,</hi> but about the <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of these <hi>Bishops</hi> or <hi>Presbyters,</hi> i. e.
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:100318:278"/>
Whether the whole Care of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were committed to them, without any Superiour Jurisdiction? What if it be yielded to St. <hi>Jerome,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1.1.</note> 
               <hi>That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Deacons at Philippi were no other than the Presbyters and Deacons</hi>; as long as the Apostle, either in Person, or by some other appointed by himself, did rule over them? What, <hi>if the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops summon'd to Miletus, were no other than the Pastours and Teachers?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> Did not St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, at that very time, call them together, and give a Charge and Direction to them, as one who had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them? So that it doth no where appear in Scripture, that the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> were invested in the <hi>Supreme-Power</hi> over the <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But yet they were not excluded from all kind of share in the <hi>Government,</hi> for then they could never be said <hi>to Rule well,</hi> who had nothing at all to do in Government: And those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>Supreme</hi> may be called <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.14.</note> and are to be obey'd according to the Nature of their <hi>Authority</hi>; which doth relate to men in another capacity, and for very different ends from what Civil Government doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="545" facs="tcp:100318:278"/>For the Church is a Society in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Design, Duties, Offices, Censures, really distinct from any mere Humane Institution. And no Christian who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves that the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias</hi> was to be an external, visible Kingdom, can be of another Opinion. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Christ be <hi>the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Revel. 17.14.19.16.</note> and therefore <hi>as Kings</hi> they are subject to him; yet that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which Christian Kings do exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise over their Subjects, doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Rules and Orders which himself hath establish'd in his Church. For no Power derived from him can void or destroy his own Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions. Since then the Church doth subsist by virtue of Christ's own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and that Church is to have peculiar Officers to instruct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, it must follow, that even in a <hi>Christian Kingdom,</hi> the Church is a Society distinct from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Labouring in the Word and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> Not to distinguish them from another sort of <hi>Elders,</hi> whom St.<hi>Paul</hi> never thought of: For he knew of none but such as were set apart by <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> and therefore dedicated to the
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:100318:279"/>
Work of the Ministery; and if St.<hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Elder</hi> were the same, they must have the same <hi>qualifications</hi>; and one of the chief of them is, <hi>that he be apt to teach</hi>; so that they may as well plead for a <hi>Lay-Bishop,</hi> as for a <hi>Lay-Elder</hi>; or else the <hi>Elder</hi> must be <hi>one apt to teach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.2.</note> if the same with the <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But some may say,
<q>There was then indeed great need of <hi>labouring in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> when the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine was not well known, or understood in the World; But what necessity is there of it now, when all People own the Profession of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity among us? And this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Preaching doth but fill the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's heads with too much Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and makes them more opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native, and less capable of being go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I answer,</p>
            <p>If <hi>Christ</hi> appointed Preachers only for the Conversion of Infidels, this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have great force: But the Apostle tells us, That Christ hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Church, not only <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Evangelists,</hi>

               <hi>but Pastours and
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:100318:279"/>
Teachers; for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>v.</hi> 13.</note> 
               <hi>unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as long as the Church is in its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect State, as long as it may want Unity or Knowledge, or Improvement, this Office of Teachers is to continue. And those <hi>Elders</hi> will still deserve <hi>double honour,</hi> who do not perfunctorily and rarely discharge this Duty, but who <hi>do labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are indeed many sorts of Preaching, which the Church stands in no need of, because they tend so little to Edification: Such are all fine Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues in the Pulpit, <hi>i. e.</hi> Words well put together without suitable Matter; All dry, flat, insipid Discourses, about things of no great consequence to Men's Salvation; All affectations of Jingling Sentences, Far-fetched Allusions, Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Trifles; All impertinent Disputes about needless, vain, intricate Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies; All Enthusiastick unintelligible Talk, which tends to confound Men's Notions of Religion, and to evaporate the true Spirit of it into Fansies and
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:100318:280"/>
Eastern-Modes of speaking: Lastly, All Corrupt and Seditious Doctrine, which poisons the Minds of People with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errours, or Factious Principles.</p>
            <p>But setting all these aside, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Grave, Serious, Pious, Affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Convincing way of Preaching; which is profitable, in its degree, for the same ends for which the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is usefull,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> viz. <hi>for Doctrine, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness,</hi> i. e. for the best purposes in the World. And can any think such a Work to be now unnecessary, as long as men have Consciences to be awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken'd, Errours to be confuted, Vices to be reform'd, and stand so much in need of good direction in the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</p>
            <p>Can we be employ'd about a better or more usefull Work than this? While the Souls of those under our Care, are in such perpetual danger, either of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over-spread with Errours, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with Temptations, or over-set with Difficulties, or overwhelmed with Fears? When should the Pilots shew their Skill and Courage, and Diligence, but when the Sea is rough, and the Weather tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous, and Banks of Sand appear on
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:100318:280"/>
one side, and Rocks on the other, and so many Wrecks before them; and the common Mariners are bold and unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, unable to govern, and impatient of being govern'd? Is it time then to say, There is no need of Pilots now, but they may lie in their Cabins and sleep, for the Ship will steer it self well enough, and the Mariners cannot fail of their Duty, as long as the Coasts are known, and the Rocks have been discover'd to them?</p>
            <p>It is very true, that the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not now hard to find; but it is no easie matter to bring men to look in earnest after it, or to keep them in it. And here lies the main of our Work of Preaching; We are not to teach men new Doctrines, but to Clear, Defend, and Apply the old, to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men. It is very easie to shoot over the People's heads, and to spend an hour to little or no purpose; but it requires all our skill to Preach plainly without flatness; and to set the matters of Religion in the best light, and to recommend them to the minds of People, with the greatest force of Persuasion. It is no hard matter to trifle away the time, but it is so to
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:100318:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
speak Suitably, Warmly and Effectually to the Hearts of our Heares; to make them find the same effect of our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which the two Disciples did, when Christ unknown was discoursing with them;<note place="margin">Luk. 24.32</note> 
               <hi>When they said to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked with us, and while he open'd to us the Scriptures?</hi> That is then the best way<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> of Preaching, which hath Light and Heat together; which clears the Scriptures to the People's Capacities, and warms their Affections to Spiritual things. And it is hardly possible to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, as to the best Method of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, if men do but judge aright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the End and Design of it. For there must be Strength and Clearness to convince; and a close Application to Men's Consciences, to excite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade them to the Practice of those things which men can hardly be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of, and yet are very backward to do. And therefore this must be the chief Work and Business of our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>Which none ought to undervalue or be asham'd of, who do in earnest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God and another World; none ought to neglect, whose peculiar Office
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:100318:281"/>
and Dignity it is to take Care of Men's Souls; and none will be careless in it, who have a regard to their own or others Souls. <hi>For in doing this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.16.</note> saith St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> speaking of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in his Function, <hi>Thou shalt both save thy self and them that hear thee</hi>; as though a Man's own Salvation, and that of his Hearers, went together. That is indeed the most desirable thing in the World to be the Instruments of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls to Heaven;<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> 
               <hi>for they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert many to righteousness, shall shine as the stars for ever and ever:</hi> but yet, the most carefull Endeavours do not always meet with Success; and even our Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Saviour's Preaching, <hi>who spake as never man spake,</hi> was ineffectual to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; (What then may we expect!) But this is our Duty, and the most likely way of doing good to Souls, as appears by our Saviour's own Practice; and if we do not meet with success to our desires, let us not give over doing our Duty; and say, <hi>We have labour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Isa. 49.9.</note> 
               <hi>and spent our strength for nought and in vain; for surely our judgment is with the Lord, and our Work with our God,</hi> as the Prophet speaks; and if we fail of a Recompence in this World, we shall not in another.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="552" facs="tcp:100318:282"/>II. And so I come from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Office,</hi> to the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Conferring</hi> it; these words implying it to belong to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as being spoken particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him, <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> For although he often speaks of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> before; yet he gives no charge about <hi>Ordination,</hi> but only to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>True, <hi>some say,</hi> in this particular Case; but this was by virtue of an <hi>Extraordinary Commission</hi> given to him, as an <hi>Evangelist</hi> by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> But what is this to the standing Rule and Practice of the Church in succeeding Ages? which is not to be govern'd by such <hi>Precedents,</hi> unless the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in the same Office be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the following Bishops of the several Churches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To make this Matter as clear as I can I shall recommend these things to consideration.</p>
            <p>(I. <hi>Consid.</hi>) That from hence appears evidently, That the <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> of <hi>Governing Churches,</hi> and <hi>Ordaining Elders</hi> in them, was not limited to the Persons
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:100318:282"/>
of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but was capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communicated to others whom the Apostle entrusted with it. And this is a very material Point, to Prove, that this Power was not so peculiar to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> but it might be transmitted to others, and therefore might be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church.</p>
            <p>But the great Objection against <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>'s being a Pattern for <hi>Episcopal Power</hi> is this;
<q>That it appears by Scripture, he was sent up and down to several Places, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought fit. For he took him into his attendance at <note n="(a)" place="margin">Act. 16.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Lystra</hi>; from whence he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him through <note n="(b)" place="margin">6.</note> 
                  <hi>Phrygia, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia, Macedonia,</hi> and <note n="(c)" place="margin">12.17.1.10.</note> (there from <hi>Philippi</hi> to <hi>Thessalonica</hi> and <hi>Beraea.</hi>) And when he went to <hi>Athens,</hi> he <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note> sent for <hi>Timothy</hi> to him, and sent him from thence back to <hi>Thessalonica</hi>; and he returned from <note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Thess. 3.1, 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Macedonia</hi> to him <note n="(f)" place="margin">Act. 18.5.</note> at <hi>Corinth.</hi> From thence St. <hi>Paul</hi> went into <note n="(g)" place="margin">18.</note> 
                  <hi>Syria,</hi> and so to <note n="(h)" place="margin">19.</note> 
                  <hi>Ephesus</hi> and there again he sent <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> into <note n="(i)" place="margin">Act. 19.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Macedonia</hi> with <hi>Erastus</hi>; <note n="(k)" place="margin">20.1.</note> whither St. <hi>Paul</hi> went afterwards himself. And upon his return to <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letus,</hi> he speaks to the <hi>Elders,</hi> and not to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as their <hi>Bishop.</hi> From
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:100318:283"/>
hence, they say, St. <hi>Paul</hi> took him to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome,</hi> as appears by the <hi>Epistles</hi> Written from thence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this <hi>Series</hi> of the Story they conclude <hi>Timothy</hi> to have been onely an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> and not a fixt <hi>Bishop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Answer; That the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent removes of <hi>Timothy,</hi> before this <hi>Epistle</hi> to him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> are not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to this purpose. But it is very material to consider, what Power of Government St. <hi>Paul</hi> then committed to him. Which is a certain Proof, that such a power was not so peculiar to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> by vertue of their immediate Commission from Christ, but it might be delegated to others in their stead. Whether for a longer or shorter time, whether while the Apostles went up and down, or near their Decease, makes no difference, as to the Point of Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And if it be granted, that such an Apostolical Power of Governing Churches might be committed to others and was actually so by the <hi>Apostles</hi>; then there is no more to be done, but to enquire, whether upon their Remove, or Departure, they did entrust any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in such a manner, as it is certain
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:100318:283"/>
from Scripture Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Timothy,</hi> as to the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> when he went into <hi>Macedonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some think, that St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s leaving <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> was upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> when he was going up to <hi>Jerusalem, knowing that they should see his face no more</hi>? and that while he staid for him at <hi>Troas,</hi> he sent this <hi>Epistle</hi> to him. But St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words are too plain to be avoided, that he left him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, which can never be interpreted <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from Macedonia.</hi> And there was as much need of one to look after the Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was then absent in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as when he went to <hi>Jerusalem</hi>: and so <note n="(l)" place="margin">Theo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dor. <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi> Pauli.</note> 
               <hi>Theodoret</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands it. But if <hi>Timothy</hi> were then with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as appears by his being at <note n="(m)" place="margin">Act. 20.4.5.</note> 
               <hi>Troas,</hi> when he went from thence to <hi>Miletus,</hi> that was sufficient Reason why he did not address himself to him, but to the <hi>Elders which came from Ephesus;</hi> whom he put in mind of their Duty by his <hi>Speech,</hi> as he had done <hi>Timothy</hi> by an <hi>Epistle</hi> not long before directed to him.</p>
            <p>Whose Office was no more superseded by this Charge given to them, than a
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:100318:284"/>
               <hi>Proconsul</hi>'s was by the <hi>Senates</hi> Instructions to his <hi>Legates,</hi> when himself was present.</p>
            <p>If it were evidently proved, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> then carried away <hi>Timothy</hi> with him to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and so to <hi>Rome,</hi> there would be greater force in the Objection. But how doth that appear? Not from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

For, he being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> there was far greater Reason for them to have raised a Tumult about <hi>Timothy,</hi> than about <hi>Trophimus.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But it is said, <hi>These Secondary Apostles were not sent by Christ, but by the Apostles.</hi> And what then?<note place="margin">Walo, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 50.</note> Would the Apostles betray their Trust, and commit part of that charge to others, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted onely to themselves? But if this Office were by the Will of Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the Persons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, they could not commit it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without breach of Trust. And if it were not so, then this Power might be communicated to as many as the Apostles judged convenient; and so (as I said before) we have nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do, but to enquire, whether at their removal from particular Churches, they did not put this Power into the Hands of others.</p>
            <p>(II. <hi>Consid.</hi>) Whether the <hi>Apostles,</hi> upon their withdrawing, did pass this
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:100318:285"/>
               <hi>Power</hi> over to others, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did plainly in the Case of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> is a matter of Fact; and to be proved in such a manner as such a thing is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. We find plainly, the <hi>Apostles</hi> had this Power in themselves, and did convey it to some others; but whether <hi>Vniversally,</hi> and with a design to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this Order, must be proved by the best means we can doe a matter of Fact of so great Antiquity.</p>
            <p>(III. <hi>Consid.</hi>) There can be no stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Proof of such a matter of Fact, than the general sense of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in the Ages next succeeding the <hi>Apostles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, as to the finding out the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense of the <hi>Church,</hi> as to this matter, I shall premise Three things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) It is not necessary to prove from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did observe the same method in all Churches; which we find, as to the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete.</hi> For we have no such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account, as to the other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but we are certain St. <hi>Paul</hi> would doe no irregular thing, nor communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:100318:286"/>
an Office to others, which was to expire with themselves.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is not at all necessary, to prove, that all <hi>the Bishops</hi> mention'd in <hi>Scripture</hi> had this <hi>Apostolical Power</hi>; for the contrary appears in the <hi>Bishops</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi>; and therefore the Succession is not to be drawn from the Bishops mentioned in the <hi>Epistles</hi> to them, but from themselves; the want of considering this one Point, hath caused more perplexity in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie about <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> than any one thing besides.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is not necessary that the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> in this <hi>Apostolical Power</hi> be made equally clear in all <hi>Churches</hi>; since the <hi>Records</hi> of the Church may be more doubtfull and defective in some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which are not in others. But yet there are these ways to make out the general Sense of the Christian Church as to this point.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That the Evidence of the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> is clear in the most conspicuous Churches, by undoubted Testimonies.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That those who seemed most doubtfull about the first <hi>Succession,</hi> do yield the <hi>general Consent</hi> of the Church in the Practice of it.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="561" facs="tcp:100318:286"/>(1.) As to the undoubted Testimonies of this Succession in the most conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Churches; I shall first appeal to <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as least liable to Exception. The former not onely mentions a <hi>Succession</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> to the <hi>Apostles</hi>; but he saith, <note n="(*)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Qui ab Apostolis ipsis instituti sunt Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi in Ecclesiisâ€”quibus etiam ipsas Ecclesias com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittebant â€” quos &amp; Successores relinquebant, suum ipsorum locum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterii tradentes.</hi> Iren. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3.</note> 
               <hi>The Apostles committed the Care of the Churches to them; and left them to succeed in their Places:</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that as the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves had the Care of the Church, so they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> whom they chose to succeed them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> not onely mentions those in general <hi>who succeeded the Apostles,</hi> but particularly instanceth in <hi>Polycarp,</hi> placed by St. <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Smyrna</hi>; and <hi>Clemens,</hi> by St <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; and then adds, <note n="(â€ )" place="margin">

with them, <hi>i. e. to the end of the World.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 28.20.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That those who seem'd most doubtfull about the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</hi> doe yield the general consent of the Church in the Practice of it. Some few of the <hi>Ancients</hi> must be allowed to have had <hi>singular Fancies and Opinions</hi> of their own, about this Matter. And the not yielding this, hath been another great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Enemies of Episcopacy.</p>
            <p>But, as to those few among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have advanced singular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the <hi>first Government</hi> of <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> I desire these things may be observ'd.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That it is no wonder there should be different Opinions about the Beginnings of things, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very obscure; and therefore think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men are apt to frame different <hi>Hypotheses</hi> about them. As about the Original of Civil Government; some sounding it in Dominion and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; others on Consent of the People; others in a Natural Right of Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which one preserves, and the rest part with; others in Primogeniture; and lastly, others most reasonably in Divine Providence and Institution. Whilst these things lie onely in <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> a difference of Opinions is hard
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:100318:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be prevented, and of no such ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence to the World: but if Men, from those <hi>Speculations,</hi> draw such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences as tend to disturb the Peace of the World, and to withdraw Men from Obedience to Government; then such Opinions are to be looked on as Dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Seditious, and care must be taken to prevent their spreading. So here about the Rice of <hi>Episcopal Government,</hi> if the Question were onely a matter of Curiosity, <hi>Whether the Apostles did first try the Experiment of Presbyters govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in common, and upon the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of that Government set up Bishops,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> seems to think; or, <hi>Whether there were at first a Succession in Course,</hi> as another of the Ancients imagin'd, <hi>till the inconveniences of that made a Choice necessary:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ub Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> Ambros. <hi>in c. c. ad</hi> Ephes.</note> If it went no farther than bare <hi>Speculations,</hi> though these Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be both false, yet they are not dangerous: But when any from hence inferr, the Episcopal Government to be an Usurpation, and that Men are bound to restore the Right of Presbyters in opposition to them, notwithstanding the Universal Consent of the Church, from the Apostles times; then such Opinions change their Nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:100318:288"/>
mischievous in their Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It is a great Argument against these singular Opinions, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict each other; and therefore the General Sense of the Church is to be preferr'd before them.<note place="margin">Hieron <hi>in Epist.</hi> ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagr. 85.</note> For St. <hi>Jerome</hi> affirms, <hi>That from St.</hi> Mark<hi>'s time, in the Church of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>the Presbyters always chose one of their Body, whom they made their Bishop:</hi> So that no such thing could ever be practised there, as <hi>a Succcession in Course,</hi> which the other affirms. And as it is the great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Monarchy, that it had the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Consent of Mankind in the Eldest times; and that those who would set up Popular Government, differ so much in the First Principles and Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of it; So it is as to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by Bishops, that even these who differ about the First Form, yet agree in the early Change, and the Universal Consent in it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If St. <hi>Jerome</hi> be understood of the setting up Episcopacy in the <hi>Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Churches,</hi> after the Apostles times, and a trial then made of Governing by Presbyters, he cannot be excused from contradicting himself as well as the rest
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:100318:289"/>
of the Fathers. For what Experiment was there of that kind in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> if <hi>from St.</hi> Mark<hi>'s time, the Presbyters set up one above themselves, as an Army making choice of a General</hi>; which are his own Expressions? Will any Man say, An Army is Governed by a Council of Inferiour Officers, when they have a General over them, though of their own choosing?<note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>ad</hi> Cal 2 <hi>&amp; in Script. Eccles.</hi>
               </note> So in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he saith, <hi>St.</hi> James <hi>was the first Bishop</hi>; How was that Church then Governed by <hi>a College of Presbyters?</hi> At <hi>Ephesus,</hi> he confesses <hi>Timothy</hi> was Bishop there;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In Catalog.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete.</hi> At <hi>Rome</hi> he makes <hi>Linus and Clemens to succeed in the Bishoprick there. At An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> he saith, <hi>Ignatius was Bishop,</hi> and he owns his <hi>Epistles,</hi> and surely there is nothing like the sole Government by Presbyters in them. <hi>At Smyrna,</hi> he saith <hi>Polycarp was appointed Bishop, and had care of the Churches of Asia.</hi> Where then, according to St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> is this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Presbyters</hi> to be found after the <hi>Apostles</hi> times?</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) No Man lays down greater Reasons for the Change of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, than St. <hi>Jerome</hi> doth. For
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:100318:289"/>
he saith,<note place="margin">

For he might think, the <hi>Presbyters</hi> would have thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves hardly dealt with, to be excluded from Government till the Experiment were tried, and the Confusions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced themselves of the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Superiour, and so made them more willing to submit. St. <hi>Jerome</hi> seems to have had the same kind of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Church-Government,</hi> which others have of the beginnings of Civil-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> That at first there was a <hi>State of War among Mankind,</hi> and the inconveniencies of that made Men wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with their own Rights for
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:100318:290"/>
the sake of Peace; so these <hi>Presbyters,</hi> finding so much Disorder and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by being left to themselves, were far better contented to yield to such Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as would best keep the Church in Peace.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) St. <hi>Jerome</hi> yields, that this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Government did <hi>Vniversally obtain.</hi> For nothing less than that can be meant by his <hi>In toto orbe decretum est:</hi> He doth not speak clearly, whether he means a Decree of the <hi>Apostles</hi> to bind the Church, or a General Consent; but whichsoever be meant, he supposes no difference, or opposition about it. If he had said it was done by the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> in plain terms, he had taken away the force of his own Argument, which goes upon the <hi>Apostles Times</hi>; but yet it is hard to conceive how such an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration should happen without the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles Act.</hi> For, if they had left the <hi>Presbyters</hi> in full Power of Government, it is not to be imagin'd, they would so universally part with it, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged thereto, by those who had Authority over them; but this St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> leaves to be gather'd by the Event.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) St. <hi>Jerome</hi> never supposes this Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration to have been made against any

Institution of Christ. All that he saith, is, <hi>That there was a time when the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were left to themselves, and so did Govern the Church by common Consent. And at that time the Apostles writing to them suppose a Bishop and Presbyter the same:</hi> but he never saith that Christ had appointed, that none should be set over them. For then there could be no Alteration without Violation of a Law of Christ, which he could never sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose would so universally obtain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opposition. And he never dreamt the setting up of this Government to be any part of <hi>the Mystery of Iniquity then working</hi>; unless he could imagine the preserving the Peace of the Church to be it. On the contrary, St. <hi>Jerome</hi> makes this Government in the very same Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to bear an Analogy to <hi>Aaron and his Sons, and the Levites in the Temple, to Moses and the LXX Elders, under the Law:</hi> and in other Places out of the heat of Dispute, when the Roman Deacons were not in his head, he <hi>makes the Bishops the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Apostles.</hi>

yet there is no plain Text for it, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to all the Books contained in it, and some of the Books were a long time disputed in some Churches; but the Churches coming at last to a full Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter, upon due search and enquiry, hath been thought sufficient to bind all after-Ages to make no Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in it. And as to the <hi>Divine Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s Day,</hi> we do not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to lessen it, but only to shew, that some Examples in Scripture being joined with the <hi>Vniversal Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in its purest Ages, hath been allowed to be sufficient ground not only for follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages to observe it, but to look on it as at least an <hi>Apostolical Institution.</hi> Now it cannot but seem unequal, not to allow the same force, where there is the same Evidence And therefore our Church hath wisely and truly determined, <hi>That since the Apostle's times there have been three Orders, of Bishops, Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons</hi>; and in a Regular, well constituted Church, are to continue to the World's End.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The last thing to be spoken to, is the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Circumspection</hi> necessary in admitting Persons to the Exercise of this
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:100318:292"/>
holy Function here mention'd, <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man.</hi> And that will appear very reasonable on these accounts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Men's Souls</hi> depend so much upon those who are admitted to holy Orders; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not only <hi>Negligence</hi> and <hi>Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,</hi> but <hi>Vnfaithfulness</hi> to the <hi>Trust</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in them, if through their Fault they suffer unfit Men to take upon them to be the Ministers of holy things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> is so much concerned in it. It is true, some have higher Places, greater Authority, more powerfull Influence on the State of the Church than others have; but yet every Wheel must be in its due Order and Motion, or the whole may be easily disturbed. A loose, irregular Clergy have so great Influence on the Minds of some People, with respect to the whole Church, that they will never think well of that Church where such Persons are employ'd. For they will not distinguish the Good and Bad, where it is more suitable to their Interest, and Prejudices not to do it.</p>
            <p>And we find, by too sad Experience, if those who are disaffected to our Church have met with unfit Persons in their
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:100318:292"/>
Places, though very obscure and remote, what perpetual Clamour they make with it all their Lives after; and what Insinuations are given, that the rest were alike; and this is still pleaded, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly soever, as the most popular Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Separation. So that a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Clergy-man doth unspeakable Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, not only to his own and others Souls, but to the whole Church he owns himself to be of. And very many good Examples do not signifie so much to the Benefit of a Church, as a few bad ones do to the Mischief of it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The <hi>Honour</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> lies at Stake too; which suffers very much, when those who pretend to Teach others the way to Heaven, are seen going them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and drawing others into the broad Way to Destruction. Our Preaching to the People their Duties, doth but make them more narrowly watch and observe our Lives, to see whether we live agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the Directions we give them. And if we slight in our Practice what we Preach in the Pulpit, if we act our selves just contrary to what we require from them, it will be hardly possible to convince them we are in earnest, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any thing of Religion our selves.
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:100318:293"/>
And how can we imagin they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what we say in the Pulpit, if they plainly see we regard it not our selves when we are out of it? It was <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s observation long ago;<note place="margin">Fab. Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>l.</hi> 12. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> That it is not what Men speak, which moves the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple so much, as the Opinion they have of the Person that speaks: and therefore the Oratours of old put into the Definition of one fit to persuade the People, that he must have <hi>the Reputation of a good Man</hi>; otherwise all he speaks will be thought only Art or Design.</p>
            <p>I know no way to have the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good Man, like being so: and we are infinitely more concerned to be so, than those, whose great Business was to put false Colours upon things. We speak the Words of Truth and Soberness; let us not then make the People question them, by not finding the due effects of them in our own Conversations. They are very apt to suspect we look on Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching as our Trade, and mind it no more than <hi>the Silver-smiths did the Shrines</hi> they made for <hi>Diana,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19 24.</note> which they set off to the best advantage, not for the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they had for <hi>Diana,</hi> but for the Gain she brought to the Crafts men. We have no such effectual Way to convince
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:100318:293"/>
our Auditours, that we mean what we say, as when they find us to be great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples our selves of the Duties we press upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> of Devotion, Humility, Charity, Sobriety, Mortification, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedness, Peaceableness, and Universal Holiness: and when the People <hi>see our Light shining before them, by the good Works we do,</hi> we shall thereby excite them <hi>to glorifie God,</hi> to think better of Religion, and to follow our Example.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Men's Souls</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends very much upon the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> of those who are to be their Guides to Heaven. For, if they lead them astray, whom they think they are bound to follow, their destruction will be unavoidable. <hi>When the blind lead the blind, they both fall into the Ditch</hi>; but yet the <hi>blind leader</hi> falls first, and falls heaviest and deepest, and the other falls upon him, and sinks him lower. It is a sad thing to have the Guilt of other Men's sins, as well as our own to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for; when by our wilfull Neglect of our known Duty, or by our Examples, or by our Erroneous Doctrine, we prove the occasion of damning those Souls, which were committed to our Charge to conduct them to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="576" facs="tcp:100318:294"/>The Care of <hi>Souls</hi> would be a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing indeed, if we were to answer for all the Miscarriages of the People committed to our Charge: But if they are such as happen through the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and plain Omission of the Duty laid upon us; or our being accessory to their Commission of them, they may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged on our Account.</p>
            <p>With what <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> then ought all Persons to enter upon so weighty, so holy, so tremendous a Charge? What Preparation of Mind is necessary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider it! What <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain God's Assistance in it! What Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and Piety, and Resolution to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it!</p>
            <p>But let us not be dishearten'd; we serve a Gracious Master, and in the best Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; and although we may meet with many Difficulties, within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and on all sides, yet <hi>let us be stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord, for as much as we know, that our labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
