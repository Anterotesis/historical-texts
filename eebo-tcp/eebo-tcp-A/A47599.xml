         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS I was put upon preaching on this great Subject; ſo I am ſatisfied it was at
a very ſeaſonable Hour, this Doctrine being greatly ſtruck at by too many
Perſons, though of different Sentiments in many Points of Religion. And
as it was well accepted by you, who heard theſe Sermons (and the others that followed)
when preach'd; and having been prevail'd with to publiſh theſe to the World, ſo I
hope ſome may receive Advantage hereby: Though for the meanneſs of the Author, and
weakneſs of the Work, they may not meet with that Entertainment from ſome as the
Subject deſerves; yet for your ſakes whoſe Souls are committed to my Charge, and for
whom I muſt give Account <hi>to the great Shepherd of the Sheep</hi> at the laſt Day, I
readily conſented to this Publication; as alſo that all may ſee that we are in this, and
in all other great Fundamentals of Religion, eſtabliſhed in the ſame Faith with our
Brethren, and all Sound aud Orthodox Chriſtians in the World: And can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but look upon our ſelves greatly concerned, to ſee how Men by Craft and Subtilty
endeavour, through Satan's Temptations (though I hope ſome do it not wittingly)
ſtrive to ſubvert the Goſpel of Chriſt, and corrupt the Minds of weak Chriſtians.
An Error in a Fundamental Point, is dangerous and deſtructive; but ſhould we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake
ſome Men we have to do with, we ſhould be glad: The Lord help you to ſtand
faſt in the Truth, as it is in Jeſus (in which through Grace you are well eſtabliſhed:)
Our Days are perillous; Satan ſeems to be let looſe upon us, and is in great Rage, his
Time being but ſhort. Brethren, 'tis a hard Caſe that any of thoſe who maintain the
Old Doctrine of Juſtification, ſhould be branded with the black Name of <hi>Antinomians.</hi>
As for my part, if Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> be not miſ-repreſented by his Oppoſers, I am not of
his Opinion in ſeveral reſpects; but I had rather erre on their ſide, who ſtrive to exalt
wholly the Free Grace of God, than on theirs, who ſeek to darken it and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie


<pb facs="tcp:59952:3"/>
the Power of the Creature, though we fear the Deſign is to wound the Truth and
us, through that good Man's ſides, who, I doubt not is gone to Heaven: O when
ſhall we ſee that Truth, Peace, and Vnion longed for!</p>
            <p>My Brethren, the Doctrine we preach does not open a Door to the leaſt Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(as 'iis unjuſtly ſaid to do by ſome, who are either wilfully or ignorantly blind.)
No, God forbid. Nothing can promote Holineſs, and Goſpel-Sanctification like unto
it, only it teaches us to act from high, ſublime, and right Evangelical Principles: It
ſhews the only way to attain to Goſpel-Purity, flows from our Vnion with Chriſt;
and that no Man can arrive to any degree of true Holineſs, or expect to meet with
any Succeſs therein, without a Principle of Spiritual Life, or ſaving Faith in our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The Nature of Men muſt firſt be changed, and that Enmity that
is in their Hearts againſt God, be removed, before they can be holy: The Tree muſt
firſt be made good, or the Fruits will be evil. The Image of God muſt be formed in
our Souls, which puts the Creature into an actual bent and propenſity of his Heart
to the Practice of Holineſs. If a Man hates not Sin, be not out of Love with Sin,
How ſhould he be in love with God and Holineſs? Now becauſe we ſay Sanctification
is not neceſſary, as antecedent to Juſtification, but is the Fruit or Product of
Vnion with Chriſt; though we deny not but the Habits of Holineſs are infuſed at that
ſame Inſtant that Faith is wrought in the Soul, Muſt we be look'd upon <hi>as Promoters
of a Licentious Doctrine?</hi> Muſt we make our own Performances, or Obedience a
Condition of Juſtification, or be laid under Infamy and Reproach? 'Tis by Faith only,
that we come to have actual Enjoyment and Poſſeſſion of Chriſt himſelf, and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of Sin; and not only ſo, but of eternal Life; and ſo of Holineſs alſo, and
no other ways. The good Lord help you to a right Vnderſtanding of theſe things, and
make you all a holy People, to the Praiſe of his Glory, and Honour of your Sacred
Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The Holy Apoſtle having aſſerted Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of God, which
is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, deſired <hi>to know him and the Power of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
&amp;c. which he did not to be juſtified thereby, but as a Fruit flowing therefrom,
or as a further Evidence thereof: The firſt he had attained; but there was a higher
degree of Sanctification in hts Eye, which he preſſed after, as then not having attained:
Whoſe Example let us follow.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more: You own a Rule of Goſpel-Holineſs; Let me exhort you to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
after ſincere Obedience: And pray forget me not in your Prayers, that God
would graciouſly help me through all my Troubles and Temptations, and preſerve me
and you to his Heavenly Kingdom; who am your Servant for Jeſus's ſake, and ſo
ſhall abide till Death.</p>

            <p>THIS Text is given me (as I told you the laſt Lord's Day) by an
unknown Hand, and though it may ſeem to interfere with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
and intention, in ſpeaking to another Scripture, on a different
ſubject; yet I readily imbrace this Motion, and Anſwer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of those Chriſtian Friends, who ſo earneſtly requeſt and intreat me to
ſpeak to the Doctrine of Juſtification, and that for theſe Reaſons following.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe the Doctrine of Juſtification is one of the greateſt and moſt
weighty ſubjects I can inſiſt upon; it being by all Chriſtians acknowledged
to be a Fundamental of Religion and Salvation. Hence this Article is juſtly
ſtiled, by worthy Writers, <hi>Articulus ſtantis, vel cadentis Religionis: The very
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illar of the Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Other Subjects a Miniſter may Preach upon,
and that unto the Profit and Advantage of the People; but this he muſt
Preach, this he cannot omit, if he would truly Preach the Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:59952:4"/>
2. Becauſe I fear many Good Chriſtians may not be ſo clearly and fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
into this Doctrine as they ought, or it might be wiſhed they were,
though they may be rightly built upon the true Foundation, or upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Corner-ſtone God hath laid in <hi>Sion;</hi> yet are but Babes in Chriſt, and
therefore need farther Inſtruction, for their eſtabliſhment in this, and other
Eſſentials of the true Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe the preſent Times are perillous, and many Grand Errours in and
about this great Fundamental Point too much abound and prevail, (as many
have with grief obſerved of late,) and that too in and about this City, which
cauſed a worthy Miniſter lately to ſay, that it greatly concerned Paſtors
of the Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſtrive to eſtabliſh their People in this Bleſſed Truth,
ſince there are ſome who with all their Might endeavour to ſow the Seeds
of Errour and Hereſie almoſt every where, and many are ſadly corrupted
thereby already.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe if a Perſon err herein, or be corrupt and of an unſound Faith,
in the caſe of Juſtification, he is in a dangerous condition, though he may ſeem
to be otherwiſe a Good Chriſtian and of a Holy Life; for 'tis evident that
there are damnable Principles, as well as damnable Practices, according to
that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1, 2. And as our Saviour ſaid to the <hi>Jews,
Vnleſs ye believe that I am he, ye ſhall die in your Sins,</hi> Joh. 8. 24. So muſt I ſay,
Unleſs ye have a true and right Faith in him, <hi>ye muſt die in your Sins;</hi> for 'tis
not enough to believe Chriſt is the true Saviour; but we muſt have alſo a right
Faith in that Object; unbelief and a miſ-belief are alike deſtructive and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious:
Was it not an Errour about Juſtification that cauſed the <hi>Jews</hi> to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry
eternally, <hi>viz. They being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, went about to
eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 10. 3.</p>
            <p>5. Becauſe this Doctrine tends ſo much to the Honour of God, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
of his infinite Wiſdom, and his Free Grace, and Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt,
and alſo to the abaſement of the Creature: Was it not the Exaltation of the
Glory of God in all his Attributes and Bleſſed Perfections, which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of that Glorious Counſel, held above between the Father and the Son,
before the World began, in the bringing in and eſtabliſhment of the Covenant
of Grace? What did God, as I may ſay, deſign or aim at therein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> more than
his own Glory, and to abaſe ſinful Man? And if ſo, how doth it behove us
to ſee to our utmoſt to open the Channel, that this Sovereign Grace may run
freely, and not be obſtructed by the Mud or curſed Notions and Errors of
Men's dark Minds, who ſeek to Eclipſe the Doctrine of God's Free Grace?</p>
            <p>6. Becauſe from this Doctrine doth proceed all the Hope we have of
Eternal Life: Deſtroy this Foundation, and what can the righteous do?
I may ſay of Juſtification through the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs, as
<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>This is all our Salvation and our Hope,</hi> &amp;c.
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. If we come not to Heaven this way, I know no other; <hi>for
other Foundation can no Man lay, than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor.
3. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59952:4"/>
7. Becauſe 'tis a Doctrine that affords ſo much ſweet and Divine Comfort
to our Souls, when rightly underſtood and apprehended; and I am perſwaded
'tis through the want of Light, and clear knowledge of this Doctrine, ſo
many Doubts and Fears attend many Good Chriſtians: For (as I have told
ſome of you lately) divers weak Saints are ready to judge of their Juſtification
according to the degree and meaſure of their Sanctification; and can hardly
be brought to believe, ſuch vile Creatures as they are, who find ſuch evil and
deceitful Hearts, and ſo many great Evils and Infirmities in their Lives, can
be Juſtified in the fight of God; (not that I ever denied that Sanctification and
Holineſs, is a Mark or Evidence of a Juſtified Perſon;) though I deny Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
to be a gradual Act, as Sanctification in us is; or that a Perſon is not
perfectly Juſtified until he is perfectly Sanctified, or actually delivered in him
ſelf from the pollution and defilement of all Sin; for then it would follow, No
Believer is actually Juſtified in this Life: But that which I intend, and hint at,
is this, That if ſome weak Chriſtians can but arrive to Holy and Spiritual
Frames in Duty, and get power over their Corruptions, then they think they
have good grounds to believe and hope they may be Juſtified; as if it were
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So much, briefly, as to the Grounds and Reaſons which induced me to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Call I had to inſiſt upon this Text and Subject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To proceed the more orderly, I ſhall give you the ſcope and
coherence of the Text it ſelf, for the better underſtanding the deſign and
main drift of the Holy Ghoſt therein.</p>
            <p>And as to this we need go no further back than to the 9 verſe of the 3 Chap.
where the Apoſtle proves, that all Men, both Jews and Gentiles, are under
Sin: <hi>What then are we better than they? no, in no wiſe; for we have before proved,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oth Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under Sin,</hi> verſe 9. This he confirms by
the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament; particularly, by that of <hi>David, There is
none righteous no not one,</hi> verſe 10. All Men, naturally, as conſidered under
the Fall, are ungodly and vile in the ſight of God; and although the <hi>Jews</hi>
thought themſelves in a better condition than the Gentiles were, and boaſted
of their Knowledge and Sanctity; the Apoſtle declares, they were notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
abominable Sinners, and in no better State, but deceived themſelves;
and that he might make this farther manifeſt, he proceeds more particularly
to diſcover their wretched Pollution and Filthineſs: <hi>There is none that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth,</hi>
verſe 11.</p>
            <p>1. He ſhews that all the Faculties of the Soul are corrupted, <hi>viz.</hi> their
Minds and Underſtandings are blind and darkned, being ignorant of God, or
without the knowledge of his pure and ſpotleſs Nature, Juſtice, and Holineſs:
<hi>There is none that ſeeketh after God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. By this he ſhews alſo the Poyſon and Venom that was got into the Will;
for as they have loſt God, ſo they will not ſeek after him, like that of our
Saviour, <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have Life,</hi> Joh. 5. 40. Now till a


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59952:5"/>
Man comes to ſee his own wretched and woful condition, and underſtands
the Nature of God, and the Nature and Tenure of the Holy Law of God, he
cannot diſcern that abſolute neceſſity there is of a perfect and compleat righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
to Juſtifie him in God's ſight.</p>
            <p>3. And that their Will and Affections are alſo depraved, and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
corrupted, he proceeds farther to cite what <hi>David</hi> in the ſame Pſalm ſaith,
viz. <hi>They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable, there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
none that doth good, no not one,</hi> verſe 12.</p>
            <p>Now leaſt any one Zealot ſhould fanſie himſelf in a good condition, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from this black Indictment, and ſo in a Juſtified State, by his own
righteouſneſs, he confirms again his former Univerſal Charge, <hi>All are gone out
of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable;</hi> and therefore not one of them
can be Juſtified.</p>
            <p>And as the Faculties of their Souls are corrupt, ſo the Apoſtle proceeds to
ſhew the infection had ſeized on the Members of their Bodies; therefore he
ſaith, <hi>Their Throat is an open Sepulchre, with their Tongue they have uſed Deceit
the Poyſon of Aſpes is under their Lips,</hi> verſe 13. <hi>Whoſe Mouth is full of curſing an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
bitterneſs,</hi> verſe. 14. <hi>Their Feet are ſwift to ſhed Blood,</hi> verſe 15. Both Tongues
Lips, Throat, and Feet, are polluted and abominable, being Inſtruments o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
unrighteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>In verſe 19. he ſeems to Anſwer, by way of anticipation, an Objection
which the Jews might bring againſt what he had ſaid, as if they ſhould ſay, What
you ſpeak doth not concern us, but the prophane Gentiles; we have the Law
and that relieves us, and thereby we may be Juſtified; to which he Reaſons
thus, to cut off all their Hopes, <hi>viz. Now we know that whatſoever the Law ſaith,
it ſaith unto them that are under the Law, that every Mouth may be ſtopped, and all
the World become guilty before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the Law is not only meant the Law as it was given to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Two
Tables of Stone, but as the ſubſtance of the ſame Law was written in the
Hearts of all Mankind; the Apoſtle means the Law of the Firſt Covenant
which was broke by our Firſt Parents, by the breach of which all the World
became guilty before God originally; and alſo by their actual Breach thereof
for that neither Jews nor Gentiles lived without Sin: but contrariwiſe wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
guilty of the Breach of that Law, under which they lived: But although all the
World were under the Law of the Firſt Covenant, and had the ſame Law as to
the ſubſtance of it, as a rule of Life; yet the <hi>Jews</hi> had the upper hand of the reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of the World, by their having the Oracles of God committed to them, by
which means they had greater advantages to come to the knowledge of Sin, and
alſo by means of divers Figures and Prophecies to the knowledge of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what of all this? the Apoſtle ſhews them that the Law on which they
reſted, was ſo far from relieving them, that it ſerved chiefly to convince them
of their horrid guilt, and bound the Sentence upon them, ſo that they and all the
World were ſubject to the Juſt Judgment of God, and under his Wrath and
Curſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:59952:5"/>
2. And therefore he infers, that by the Law (either as it was written in the
Two Tables, or in the Heart, which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had as well as the <hi>Jews</hi>) no
Man could be juſtified ſo, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. <hi>Therefore by the deeds of the Law ſhall no fleſh
be juſtified in his ſight; for by the Law is the knowledge of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. But leſt upon this, the loſt World ſhould be left under utter Deſpair, the
Apoſtle proceeds to ſhew us there is a way found out in the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God, and according to his unſpeakable Grace and Goodneſs, to deliver
us from Sin and Guilt; and ſo to juſtifie us before God; and therefore he
adds, <hi>but now the Righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed
by the Law and the Prophets,</hi> v. 21. <hi>Even the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by
faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all, and upon all that believe; for there is no difference,</hi> v. 22.
<hi>For all have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his
Grace, through the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>No wonder there is no difference, when both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> lie under the
guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, it being imputed to them, he being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Head and Repreſentative of the whole race of Mankind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. And
ſince alſo all of them partake of the ſame original Corruption or depraved
Nature, inherent in them, from whence proceed all thoſe actual Tranſgreſſions,
by which means it appears that all come ſhort of that glorious Image of God,
in which they were at firſt created; and alſo of the eternal Glory above: Yet
to the praiſe of God's Grace, the loſt World is not left in a hopeleſs Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
God having ſent his Son to ſatisfie the Law and Divine Juſtice, or to <hi>be
a propitiation through Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the remiſſion
of Sins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God,</hi> v. 25.</p>
            <p>4. In the 27th Verſe, he adds, a God-honouring, and a ſelf-confounding
Inference from what he had ſaid; <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is excluded. By what
Law? Of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. And hence he draws another concluſion, <hi>viz. ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That a man is juſtified by faith without the works of the Law;</hi> and in the 4th
Chapter he proceeds to prove his main Argument; <hi>i. e.</hi> That a Sinner is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith without Works, by the Example of <hi>Abraham<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if Abraham
were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God,</hi> chap. 4. 2.</p>
            <p>6. This is the Apoſtle's Argument: if <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by Works, he
had ſomewhat whereby he might boaſt and glory; but <hi>Abraham</hi> had nothing
whereof to boaſt or glory; and therefore he was not juſtified by Works.</p>
            <p>But to put it further out of doubt, he affirms what the Scripture ſaith; <hi>viz.</hi>
That <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was counted, to him for Righteouſneſs,</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p>7. In the next place, he proceeds to prove this bleſſed Doctrine from the
nature of Works and Grace, they being quite oppoſite, and contrary the one
to the other. <hi>Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace but of
debt,</hi> v. 4. If therefore it was granted, a Man could perform the condition of
perfect Obedience; yet he could not he juſtified.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe all, (as he had ſhewed before,) have ſinned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59952:6"/>
2. Becauſe there is no Reward as a due debt from God, becauſe we can do
no more than our Duty, we being the Lords, and all our Abilities and Services
can ne'er make a reparation for the wrong we have done againſt the Law, and
the Holineſs, and Juſtice of God.</p>
            <p>And thus I come to my Text, <bibl>
                  <hi>ver.</hi> 5.</bibl>
               <q>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his
faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To him that worketh not;</hi> That is, worketh not, thinking thereby to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and ſaved. Though he may work; <hi>i. e.</hi> lead a holy and righteous Life;
yet he doth it not to merit thereby; nay, though he be wicked, and an ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſon, and ſo worketh not, or hath no Moral Righteouſneſs at all; yet
if he <hi>believeth on him that juſtifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted</hi> or imputed <hi>for
righteouſneſs:</hi> Not as a ſimple Act, or as it is a quality or habit, or in us, as the
Papiſts teach; <hi>ipſa fides,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, cenſetur eſſe Juſtitia,</hi> Faith it ſelf is
counted to be a Juſtice, and it ſelf is imputed unto Righteouſneſs: No, nor in
reſpect of the effects or fruits of it; for ſo it is part of our Sanctification.</p>
            <p>But as it is a hand to take hold of, or receive, or apply Chriſt and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manus accipientis,</hi> ſaith Dr. <hi>Downham,</hi> the hand of the Receiver is the
Grace of juſtifying Faith: 'Tis not Faith, but the Object and Righteouſneſs
Faith apprehends or takes hold of, that <hi>juſtifies the ungodly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Apoſtle doth not intend by theſe Words, That if a Man hath the
Works here meant, he cannot be juſtified, unleſs he throws them away, and
become openly wicked and prophane; and ſo ſin that Grace may abound:
No, as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>God forbid,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. But his meaning is, that the
abſence or want of good Works, or moral Righteouſneſs, cannot hinder a
Man's Juſtification, if he believes in Jeſus Chriſt, though he be never ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ungodly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That juſtifieth the ungodly.</hi> Every Man is ungodly before he is acquitted and
juſtified, having till that very inſtant a great Mountain of guilt and filth lying
upon him.</p>

or a Law-Term, which uſually is oppoſed to Condemnation. And it ſignifies

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But may be you will ſay, what ungodly ones doth God juſtifie: if it be
an impenitent, ungodly one, how can you reconcile this Text with that of
<hi>Solomon; He that juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the juſt, even they are
both abomination to the Lord?</hi> Prov. 17. 15.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59952:6"/>
1. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer; 'tis not meant of juſtifying of any ungodly Act of a wick<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
Perſon; for God can as ſoon ceaſe to be, as ſo to juſtifie the ungodly.</p>
            <p>2. Nor Secondly, he means not juſtifying the perſon in his committing of
any ſinful deed; for that is as oppoſite to God's holy Nature, and all one with
the former.</p>
            <p>3. Nor in the Negative, are they ſuch ungodly ones that are righteous
in their own Eyes, like as many of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were, and <hi>Paul</hi> alſo
before his Converſion, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 4, 5, 6, 7. when a Perſecutor.</p>
            <p>For although ſuch who are Righteous in their own ſight, are the worſt
of Sinners in the ſight of God; yet they are ſuch whom God, while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

righteous, but ſinners to Repentance. There is,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, a Generation pure in

Man's own Righteouſneſs cannot further his Juſtification, or conduce or add
thereto; ſo his Sin and Ungodlineſs cannot hinder or obſtruct his Juſtification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
if he truly believe on him who juſtifies the Ungodly.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, do not miſtake; a Man ſeeing himſelf wounded doth not
heal him, though it may, and does put him upon ſeeking out for healing; ſo
a Man ſeeing himſelf a Sinner, doth not render him Righteous. Nothing
renders a Man righteous to Juſtification in God's ſight, but the Imputation of
the perfect Perſonal Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, received only by the Faith <hi>of the
Operation of God.</hi> When I was a Lad, I was greatly taken with a Book, called
<hi>The flowing of Chriſt's Blood freely to Sinners, as Sinners.</hi> O, my Brethren, that's
the Caſe, that's the Doctrine which the Apoſtle preaches; you muſt come to
Chriſt, believe on Chriſt, as Sinners, as Ungodly ones, and not as Righteous,
not as Saints, and Holy perſons, <hi>The whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are
ſick.</hi> The Thief on the Croſs, as a Sinner, cry'd out, <hi>Lord remember me,</hi> &amp;c.
and the Jaylor as a Sinner, cry'd out, <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> So
much, as to the Explanation of the Terms of the Text; in which you have
three parts:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A Negative Propoſition,</hi> But to him that worketh not.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>An Affirmative Propoſition,</hi> But believeth on him that juſtifies the ungodly.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The Concluſion from hence,</hi> His faith is counted (<hi>or imputed</hi>) for
Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>The Obſervations I ſhall take notice of from the Words, ſhall be but two.</p>
            <p>1 Doct. That all Works done by the Creature, are quite excluded in point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of a Sinner in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>2. Doct. That Juſtification is wholly of the free Grace of God, through the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the perfect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt by Faith.</p>
            <p>I purpoſe to begin with the firſt of theſe Points of Doctrine, and then come
to ſpeak to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>1. But before I proceed, I ſhall ſhew you divers falſe and erroneous Principles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which Men have ſucked in, in and about the great Doctrine of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>2. I ſhall then prove the Point, <hi>viz.</hi> That all Works done by the Creature
are quite excluded in point of Juſtification of a Sinner in God's ſight.</p>

1. I ſhall begin with the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who hold that Men are Juſtified by inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Righteouſneſs, by Good Works, and not by Faith only, affirming Good
Works to be meritorious, or that Men thereby deſerve Eternal Life; nay,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hat a Man may perfectly fulfil the Law of God, though he cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sin: But to mend the matter, <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Argument is, That Venial Sins,
of which he denies not, that all are guilty; yet they do not hinder a Man from
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeping the Law perfectly: The fooliſhneſs of which diſtinction is eaſily

of the Law, and he that tranſgreſſes the Law doth not keep it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,

               </gap>: But they affirm, that a Man may not only, by his Good Works, merit
for himſelf; but alſo may do more than is commanded, or may do Works of

               </gap>upererogation, or do more than his Duty.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond ſort I ſhall mention are the <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny the Deity
of the Son of God; and from hence deny alſo the Satisfaction of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the latter depends upon the former: It was from the dignity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Chriſt's Perſon, he being God as well as Man, that his Sacrifice

God, without that Glorious Fruit of his infinite Goodneſs, have pardoned and

He proceeds to blame our Proteſtant Writers, in aſſerting Juſtification by
Faith alone, without Works. Brethren, although we do not oppoſe Faith
to Love; as if Faith, that is of the right Kind, can be without Love to God;
yet we ſay, 'tis Faith and not Works; not love, nor Deeds of Mercy, nor
any other Goſpel Duties, or Obedience, that is <hi>counted to us for righteouſneſs.</hi>
And why to Faith only? Becauſe that Grace only carries us out of our ſelves
to another for righteouſneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>4. The ſame ſort affirm Faith doth Juſtifie the Sinner (as far as I can gather)
as it is the act of the Creature, God accepting of that internal act of the Soul,
according to his good pleaſure, to Juſtification; not having reſpect ſo to the
Object of Faith, as that the matter thereof is Chriſt, perfect righteouſneſs,
and the form or formal Cauſe of it, the Imputation thereof, to ſuch who
believe in Jeſus; but that it hath pleaſed God to appoint or ordain Faith,
in reſpect of it ſelf, to that end and purpoſe; namely, to Juſtifie the
Sinner.</p>
            <p>Of this ſort are the <hi>Dutch Arminians,</hi> in purſuance of their main Doctrine
of Free Will; they exalt Man's Works, and therefore affirm, that he is Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
not by Chriſt's righteouſneſs, but by his own Faith; God having required
of him, inſtead of full Obedience to the Law of Works, that now he ſhould
believe on his Son; and that for ſo doing he ſhould be Juſtified and ſaved, as
he ſhould have been before for perfect Obedience: So that with this ſort (as
one obſerves) <hi>Faith</hi> is that righteouſneſs for which we are Juſtified before
God. Moreover, they tell us, that Faith is a belief of the Truth of the Goſpel,
ſo as to live according to it; thus it includeth, and not excludeth Works;
and that Faith and Works, or Obedience to the Goſpel, is our righteouſneſs
for which we are Juſtified and ſaved. At the ſame time you muſt remember
that they do not own Faith to be the Gift of God, or a Grace of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
but that which the Creature has power, when the Goſpel is Preached, to
act by common aſſiſtance, and influences, he hath power to do, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
as any other Duties of Religion, as to <hi>Pray, hear the Word,</hi> &amp;c. And thus
they make the whole ſtreſs of Man's Salvation (after all that Chriſt hath done)
to depend upon the depraved and corrupt Will of the Creature; and faith; ſuch
a condition of Juſtification and Eternal Life, as may or may not be performed,
which, if true, it might ſo fall out, that not one Soul might be ſaved, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the precious price, paid by Jeſus Chriſt to redeem them; for
by the ſame purity of Reaſon one Man may reſiſt the offers of Grace, and
not believe in Chriſt, or exert that power every Man may as well do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

too. See Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi>'s <hi>Luther us Redivivus,</hi> p. 2.</p>
            <p>5. Some alſo there be, who affirm, that Juſtification conſiſteth in our being
perfectly and inherently Holy, by the Spirit, Light, or Chriſt within; and
that no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

evident thoſe who aſſert this Doctrine ſay, <hi>God doth not accept any, where
there is any failing, or do not fulfil the Law, and Anſwer every demand of Juſtice,</hi>
Edw. Burroughs <hi>Works,</hi> 14 <hi>Queries, p.</hi> 33. And another of their chief Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
ſaith; <hi>That Juſtification by the righteouſneſs of another, or which Chriſt fulfilled
for us, in his own Perſon, wholly without us; we boldly affirm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Devils, and an Arm of the Sea of Corruption, which doth now Deluge the
World,</hi> Pen'<hi>s Apol. p.</hi> 148. And again he ſays, <hi>It is a great Abomination to ſay
God ſhould condemn and puniſh his innocent Son, that he having ſatisfied for our Sins
we may be juſtified by the imputation of his perfect righteouſneſs,</hi> Pen'<hi>s Sandy Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
p.</hi> 25. And then afterwards ſpeaking of that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Not
the Hearers of the Law are Juſt before God, but the Doers of it ſhall be Juſtified.
From whence,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>how unanſwerably may I obſerve, that unleſs we become</hi>
Doers <hi>of that Law which Chriſt came not to deſtroy, but as our Example to fulfil,
we cannot be Juſtified before God? Nor let any fanſie that Chriſt hath fulfilled it for
them, as to exclude their Obedience from being requiſite to their Acceptance, but only
as their Pattern,</hi> Pen'<hi>s Sandy Foundation, p.</hi> 26. No marvel they Preach up
a ſinleſs Perfection to be attainable in this Life, or that Men may live and
not Sin at all, ſince without an actual Obedience in our own Perſons to the
Law in every part and branch of it, no Man can be Juſtified in the ſight of God.
We ſay there is no Man can be Juſtified, but by a compleat and perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
either inherent in us, or imputed to us; but 'tis evident, by what
I have already ſhewed, no Man hath ſuch a righteouſneſs in himſelf; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>none that doth good, and ſinneth not; if we ſay we have no Sin, we deceive our
ſelves, and the Truth is not in us,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 8. <hi>Paul</hi> cryed out, <hi>When he would
do Good, Sin was preſent with him,</hi> Rom. 7. Beſides, if a Man could live
and Sin not, yet he could not thereby be Juſtified, becauſe all have ſinned,
and broke God's Law, who ſhall therefore ſatisfie for, and pay off the old
ſcore.</p>
            <p>6. Another ſort there be, that hold, that ſome things muſt be done by the
Creature, not only to prepare for, but to procure Juſtification, not believing
they can have this <hi>Wine and Milk, without Money and without price,</hi> Iſa. 55. 1, 2.
or ſomething of their own.</p>
            <p>They think they muſt make themſelves clean, and then come to Chriſt to
be waſhed, and Juſtified.</p>
            <p>7. There are others of late, as well as formerly, who by too many are
looked upon to be true Preachers of the Goſpel, and Orthodox Men, who are
ſtrangely tainted with that poyſonous Notion, which brings in ſincere Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto the Goſpel, as joyning it with Faith in point of Juſtification. Thus
I find they expreſs themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith and Obedience are Conditions
of the Goſpel, or of the Covenant of Grace, as perfect Obedience was of the
Covenant of Works; and that Chriſt hath purchaſed by his Death, that this
new Covenant ſhould be made with us, <hi>viz.</hi> That if we would believe and
obey the Goſpel, we ſhould be pardoned and ſaved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore that for
which we are Juſtified and ſaved, is our Faith and Obedience; and ſo far as I


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59952:11"/>
can gather, the Faith they ſpeak of doth not reſpect the taking hold of Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Belief of the acceptance of our Perſon's Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel, through Chriſt, to our Juſtification;
Chriſt having taken away, by his Death, the rigour of the Law of the Firſt
Covenant, which required perfect Righteouſneſs in point of Juſtification,
and hath made the terms of our Juſtification eaſier, <hi>viz.</hi> inſtead of perfect
Obedience, God will now accept of imperfect Obedience, if ſincere, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
us from Condemnation, and receive us to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Now ſuch, who have always been looked upon as ſound in this great Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Point of Juſtification, believe and teach, <hi>Chriſt came not to deſtroy
the Law, but to fulfil it,</hi> and in our Nature, and ſtead as our Head Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
and Surety, to do and perform the terms thereof; I mean the Law of
Works, which we had broken, and by his Death made a full compenſation to
the Juſtice of God for our breach of it, whoſe Actual and Paſſive Obedience,
or Righteouſneſs, is imputed to all who believe in him.</p>
            <p>We ſay Obedience ſuppoſeth a Man Juſtified; but theſe Men ſay, that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
concurs with Faith to Juſtifie, or is part of our Righteouſneſs to Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:
We affirm, as a Worthy Divine Obſerves, that Faith alone perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Juſtifies, by truſting in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; ſo that <hi>there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
to them who are in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 1. or truly believe in him;
but they teach that Faith and Obedience Juſtifie only, as the Conditions of
the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> as thereby we doing what the Goſpel requires of us; and ſo
we are Juſtified, or accepted, ſo far as our Faith and Obedience go, and no
farther; and when they are perfect at Judgment, we ſhall be perfectly Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;
ſo that they render our Juſtification to be as imperfect as our inherent
Perſonal Holineſs or Sanctification is imperfect; or to give it in the Words of
a Learned Writer, they intimate, while we are imperfect our Juſtification is
imperfect alſo; and if our Faith and Obedience be interrupted or utterly loſt,
Juſtification is interrupted and utterly loſt likewiſe; nor is it any wonder
our Juſtification ſhould be look'd upon by them to be imperfect, while any
Imperfections remain in us, if the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, be not the
matter of our Juſtification, or that which does Juſtifie us in God's ſight; and
on the other Hand 'tis impoſſible, if we are Juſtified and accepted as juſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and graciouſly acquitted by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, there ſhould be
the leaſt ſtain, imperfection, or ſpot, in our Juſtification; but that Chriſt
muſt needs ſay of ſuch, in reſpect of Juſtification, as he doth of his Spouſe,
<hi>Thou art all fair, my Love, and there is no ſpot in thee,</hi> Cant. 4. 7. And how
ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſince therewas no ſpot nor blemiſh found in him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> in his Fourth Propoſition, in his Preface to D. <hi>Tully,</hi> ſaith, that
this Condition (<hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Grace, by which we have right to the
benefits of it) is our Faith [mark it] or Chriſtianity, as it is meant by Chriſt
in the Baptiſmal Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> to give up our ſelves in Covenant, believing
in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, renouncing the contraries; and that
though this conſent to the Chriſtian Covenant (called Faith alone) be the full


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59952:11"/>
Condition of our firſt Right to the Benefit of that Covenant (of which Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is one,) yet obediential Performances, and Conqueſt of Temptations,
and Perſeverance, are ſecondary parts of the Condition of our Right, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

Rom.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. Is plainly meant, that God, who under the Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
required perfect Obedience of us to Juſtification and Glorification, upon
the Satisfaction and Merits of Chriſt, hath freely given a full Pardon and Right
to Life to all true Believers; ſo that now by the Covenant of Grace, nothing
is required of us to our Juſtification, but Faith, all the reſt being done by
Chriſt; and ſo Faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, is reputed tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be the condition on our part, on which Chriſt and Life by that Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Covenant is made ours.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, here is not a Word concerning Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, or Faith in him
for Righteouſneſs. And hence worthy Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi> citing this paſſage of Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
ſaith, <q>By this Author, 'tis not Chriſt's Righteouſneſs apprehended by Faith,
juſtifieth us; but Faith it ſelf, as including Obedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> the belief and
practice of the Chriſtian Religion is our Righteouſneſs, by, and for which we
are juſtified and accepted, <bibl>Luth. Red. p. 8.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, 'tis worth noting to obſerve how Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſeems to lay the
whole ſtreſs of our firſt Juſtification to what is promiſed in our Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
wherein we profeſs Faith in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; ſure he
might with much eaſe have foreſeen that ſuch who entered into that Baptiſmal
Covenant in the Primitive, Apoſtolical Days, were ſuch who before they were
admitted thereto, were required to believe: And if true Subjects were all juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before they ſign'd that Covenant, the Jailor who cried out, <hi>Sirs, what
muſt I do to be ſaved,</hi> was by St. <hi>Paul</hi> required <hi>to believe on the Lord Jeſus,</hi> with a
Promiſe upon his ſo doing of being ſaved: Though I deny not, but that Faith
in God the Father, and in the Holy Ghoſt, is injoined as well as Faith in the
Son; yet 'tis Chriſt who is the immediate Object of our Faith, and that too as
he was crucified for us, and bore our Sins, or <hi>was made ſin for us, that we might
be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> And 'tis by him that we come to God,
and believe in God, and are juſtified and accepted of God, <hi>other foundation</hi>
(of theſe things) <hi>can no man lay.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſpeaks nothing of this, but
of a Faith in general in God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; which Faith
he ſays is reputed truly to be the Condition on our part on which Chriſt and
Life by that Baptiſmal Covenant is made ours, till I met with this paſſage of
Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>I did not ſo well underſtand what Mr. <hi>Daniel Williams</hi> means by thoſe Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his in his late Book, called <hi>The Vanity of Youth,</hi> p. 130. 131. who
anſwers theſe Queſtions following, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What doth the Covenant bind thee to?</hi> (meaning the Baptiſmal Covenant).</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What if a Child through the love of Sin, or vanity of Mind, will not agree
to this Covenant when he is capable?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> He then rejecteth Chriſt our Saviour, and renounceth the Bleſſings of the
Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is it a great Sin to refuſeth agree to the Covenant to which thy Baptiſm
engaged thee?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's the damning Sin, and the heart of all Sin.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> were of the ſame Faith and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If you will know what the Terms and Condition of the Covenant of
Grace are, which muſt be performed by us that we may be juſtified, both theſe
Men tell you, (though the latter more fully) 'tis to make good this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmal
Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> ſincerely to love, believe, obey, worſhip, and ſerve
the Lord; ſo that Faith alone as it receives Chriſt, or helps us to fly to Chriſt,
and relie on Chriſt, is not the alone way or condition (if it may be ſo termed)
on our part in order to actual Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and Juſtification; but
alſo the whole of Goſpel-Obedience and Holineſs, they make to he as abſolute
Conditions in order thereunto, as Faith. Sirs, we deny not but that Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Perſonal Holineſs is neceſſary to Salvation, or in order to a meetneſs
for an actual Poſſeſſion of Heaven: But we muſt exclude all inherent Holineſs
or Works of Obedience done by us, in point of Juſtification, Pray mind my
Text, <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if it be not as I affirm concerning theſe Men, how can Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> call
the <hi>non</hi>-performance of the Baptiſmal Covenant, <hi>the damning Sin, and heart of all
Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve the very ſame damning Evil, which the Holy Ghoſt charges on the
Sin of Unbelief. In the New Teſtament, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. <hi>John</hi> 3. 36. he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
on the <hi>non</hi>-performance of his true Condition of Juſtification, and Eternal
Life; <hi>i.e.</hi> this Baptiſmal Covenant: All Sin (I grant) is damning in its own
Nature, every Sin being a breach of God's Law, expoſes to God's Wrath and
Curſe: But the not agreeing to, or <hi>non</hi>-performance of this Covenant (he
making this the Condition of the Covenant of Grace) he calls, by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency,
<hi>the damning Sin,</hi> and heart of all Sin. If this Man preaches Chriſt, or
the glorious Goſpel, I am much miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Beſides, our Baptiſmal Covenant is not a ſign of that Faith and Holineſs we
ſhould afterwards obtain; but 'tis an outward ſign of that inward Grace we
have (or ought to have when baptized) <hi>i.e.</hi> 'tis a ſign that we are dead to Sin, to
the World, to the Law, and to our own Righteouſneſs: <hi>How ſhall we</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>who are dead to Sin, live any longer therein,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. <hi>Know ye not,
that ſo many of us as were baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, were baptized into his death,</hi> v. 3.
<hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death; that like as Chriſt was
raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, ſo we ſhould walk in newneſs
of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Perſons who were baptized, being true Believers, were in a juſtified
State; and though 'tis true, they by their Baptiſmal Covenant promiſed to


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59952:12"/>
walk in newneſs of Life; yet the neglect of this is no more called the damning
Sin; nor is the performance of it that Righteouſneſs they deſire to be found in
to Juſtification. But 'tis evident, theſe Men place Obedience and Perſonal
Holineſs in the place of Faith, and the <hi>non</hi>-performance of that inherent Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Obedience in the room of Unbelief; though we grant without Holineſs
no Man ſhall ever ſee the Lord; yet 'tis not for that, or thereby we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and ſhall be ſaved, but by the Perſonal Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But to proceed as a further Confirmation, that theſe Men deny that the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as 'tis apprehended or received by Faith, is that alone
through which we are juſtified, I might here cite another Author, Mr. <hi>Truman
Grand Prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iation,</hi> p. 30. 86. who paraphraſing on thoſe Words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.
26. <hi>That he might be juſt, and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> He ſaith,
That he that is of the Faith of Jeſus, or of the Chriſtian Faith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
And concerning the Effects of the Death of Chriſt, or his Satisfaction,
he ſaith, It was only this, that the Obſtacle being removed (<hi>viz.</hi> offended Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice)
God might be at liberty to act in the pardon of Sinners, in what way
and upon what Terms he pleaſed. The immediate Effect is, that God might
be juſt, though he ſhould pardon Sinners, that he might pardon <hi>Silva
Juſtitia,</hi> not, that he muſt pardon, come what will of it, or be
unjuſt. And further, to exclude Chriſt's Righteouſneſs from being the
Matter of our Juſtification; (ſaith Mr. <hi>Troughton</hi>) he ſaith, that in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
we 1. are not properly to be looked upon as Debtors, nor God
properly as a Creditor, but as a Governor and Legiſlator, we as Subjects; and
that Chriſt acted not the part of a Surety (though he be once figuratively ſo
called) but of a Mediator expiating Guilt, and making reparation to Juſtic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
ſome other way than by the Execution of the Law; yea, endeavouring that the
legal threat might not be executed by making amends, for the <hi>non</hi>-execution
of it. 2. The Sufferings of Chriſt were not properly an Execution of the Law
(though they may figuratively be ſo called) but a Satisfaction to Juſtice. And
further, that it is contrary to Scripture and Reaſon, to hold that Chriſt's ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling
of, and Obedience to the Law is accounted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, as if Believers had
fulfilled and obeyed the Law in his doing it.</p>
            <p>1. And thus theſe Men go about to ſhake, if they could, nay, overthrow
the great Article of our Faith, and glorious Doctrine of Juſtification, as it hath
been generally received by all Orthodox Chriſtians in every Age of the Church
clearly denying that which Chriſt did and ſuffered, he did and ſuffered as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Perſon, as a Head, Surety and Repreſentative for all the Elect; but that
he did all meerly as a Mediator, <hi>viz.</hi> as one endeavouring to compoſe the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt God and Sinners.</p>
            <p>2. Not that he fulfilled the Law of Works for us in our ſtead; but that he
fulfilled the peculiar Law of a Mediator.</p>
            <p>3. That Chriſt by undergoing the Curſe of the Law delivered Mankind from
the Curſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof; and by his active Obedience unto the Precepts of it, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
Life for them, which the Law promiſed with other ſuper-abounding


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59952:13"/>
additional Bleſſings; but rather give Man a new and a milder Law of Grace or
Terms of Life, according as the Father and the Son ſhould, or did agree.</p>
            <p>And only gave to God a valuable Conſideration or Recompence, that he
might juſtly wave and not execute the Law of Works; but give Man a new
and milder Law of Grace, or Terms of Life; which clearly tends in a great
meaſure to deſtroy, or make void the Law, inſtead of making it honourable,
by Chriſt's perfect Conformity to it, in our Nature and Stead; nor can the
Righteouſneſs of the Law be ſaid to be fulfilled in us (if what theſe Men ſay
be true) that is in our Nature, or as ſome read it for us; and indeed if Chriſt's
Obedience and Suffering in our room and ſtead, hath not delivered us, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
from the Curſe of the Law. Doubtleſs, we are all under the ſaid Curſe
ſtill, and ſo muſt remain for ever.</p>
            <p>Nor can I ſee why Chriſt ſhould take our Nature upon him, were he not
ſubſtituted in our ſtead, as our Surety to do and ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Beſides, how can our Sins be ſaid to be laid upon him, or imputed to him,
and his Righteouſneſs imputed to us, were he not put in our ſtead to do and
ſuffer for us.</p>
            <p>If that Righteouſneſs which ſatisfied the Law of Works, doth not juſtifie
us, I know not how we can be juſtified.</p>
            <p>Nor can I ſee how the Honour of God in his infinite Juſtice and Holineſs,
and the Sanction of the Law, is repaired by this Doctrine. But more of this
hereafter.</p>
            <p>4. Theſe Men do not ſay that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereby he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
the Law, is imputed to us, who believe, to juſtifie us in God's ſight; tho'
for that Righteouſneſs-ſake, God grants us pardon of Sin, and hope of Eternal
Life.</p>
            <p>But rather (ſo far as I can gather) that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs or Obedience is
not imputed to us, for which we ſhould be juſtified and accepted, as being an
Obedience due to the Law of the firſt Covenant; but to his own peculiar Law
of a Mediator: But yet ſo, that Chriſt's Obedience did merit or purchaſe;
<hi>i.e.</hi> that God ſhould appoint Men new and eaſier Terms of Life, inſtead of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Obedience, and Death for the failure of that Obedience.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you ſeveral dangerous, and corrupt Notions of Men about
the great Point of Juſtification, I ſhall proceed to give you in the laſt place the
true Deſcription, Notion, and Definition of it, according as it hath been, and is
aſſerted generally by all ſound Chriſtians and faithful Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly, This is that which we ſay;</hi> i.e. That Juſtification is an abſolute Act
of God's moſt ſovereign Grace, whereby he imputeth the compleat and perfect
Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to a believing Sinner, though ungodly in himſelf, abſolving
him from all his Sins, and accepting him as righteous in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We affirm that Juſtification is the Acceptance of a Sinner with God as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
through the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt imputed to him; not that
Juſtification is nothing more but the pardon of Sin, or the not, or <hi>non</hi>-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
the Puniſhment of Sin, due for the breach of the Law of Works, and


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59952:13"/>
the acceptance of a Man, ſo far as he performeth the New Condition of ſincere
Obedience.</p>
            <p>But we affirm that believing Sinners are made Partakers of Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
and the benefits of it; and that by Faith alone, as that by which
we wholly fly to him for Righteouſneſs, and truſting in the promiſe of Life for
his Sake and Merits.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Not that Faith, as one obſerves, in the whole Latitude, is believing and
obeying the Goſpel, by which we are made Partakers of the benefit of Chriſt
in his Obedience to his own Law; and, in that he having purchaſed this Grant
or Law,</q> 
               <hi>i.e.</hi> that they which obey him ſhould be juſtified and ſaved, and not that
Chriſt's Obedience ſhall or doth ſave them.</p>
            <p>We believe, and teach that by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
is perfectly juſtified, and is free'd from the Curſe of the Law, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and accounted righteous in the ſight of God, and hereby hath a certain
Title to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Not that our Juſtification or Right to Life dependeth wholly upon our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as the Condition to which it is promiſed, and we only put into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
or ſtate of Life imperfect, and ſubject to change as Obedience it ſelf
is: And ſo that we are not perfectly juſtified till our Obedience be perfected,
which is the Doctrine ſome Perſons of late preach; for as ſure as God juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
us, ſo ſure will he ſave and glorifie us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30.</p>
            <p>Thus having made our way clear, and removed ſome Stumbling-blocks,
I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, that all Works done by the Creature are utterly
excluded in point of Juſtification in the ſight of God, which muſt be my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the next day, the time being gone. I ſhall therefore conclude with a word or
two of Application.</p>
            <p>1. The Firſt ſhall be a uſe of Caution to both Saints and Sinners, to take heed
who you hear; it greatly concerns you; for the Times are perilous, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
is endeavouring to ſtrike at the Root, even at the Foundation it ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
leſt you are deceived and carried away with thoſe poiſonous and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Doctrines that are fomented at this preſent time in and about this City.
We ought to keep clean from all Errors; but eſpecially ſuch as are Capital ones.
I am afraid many good Chriſtians are not ſenſible of the ſad danger they are in.
I cannot ſee but that the Doctrine ſome Men ſtrive to promote, is but little better
than Popery in a new Dreſs. Nay one of the worſt branches of it too, ſhall
any who pretend to be true Preachers of the Goſpel, go about to mix their
own Works or their ſincere Obedience with Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; nay, to
put their Obedience in the room and place of Chriſt's Obedience, as that in
which they truſt and deſire to be found?</p>
            <p>2. Let me exhort you all to ſtand faſt in that precious Faith you have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
particularly about this great Doctrine of Juſtification, give your ſelves
to Prayer, and to the due and careful ſtudy of God's Word. And <hi>beware leſt
ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <argument>
               <p>I have already opened this Text of Scripture, and gave you an account
of the Scope and Coherence thereof at large; and then obſerved two
Points of Doctrine therefrom.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all Works done by the Creature are quite excluded, in Point
of Juſtification of a Sinner in the ſight of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE laſt Day, I ſhewed you <hi>divers erroneous Principles</hi> held by ſome
Men about the Doctrine of Juſtification. I ſhall trouble you with no
Repetition of what we have ſaid; but proceed to what was then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to be further done; which is to give you the Scripture Proofs and
Arguments to confirm the Truth of the firſt Point of Doctrine; viz. <hi>That all
Works done by the Creature are quite excluded,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. My firſt Argument ſhall be taken from the very Letter and expreſs Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of the Holy Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Where is boaſting then? It is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
By what Law? Of Works? Nay, but by the Law of Faith.</hi> This Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in ſo many Words confirms this Propoſition; if all boaſting is excluded,
all Works are excluded: But more of this hereafter. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>If Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
were juſtified by Works, he had whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> If he
had been juſtified by Works, he had whereof he might glory; but he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to glory in before God.</p>
            <p>Therefore he was not juſtified by Works, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Even as David deſcribeth
the Bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works.</hi>
He brings in <hi>David</hi> to confirm this great Goſpel-Truth <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 1. And the
<hi>David</hi> doth not uſe the very ſame Words, as here expreſſed by the Apoſtle;
yet they are Words of the ſame Purport, the ſence and meaning of <hi>David</hi> is
the ſame.</p>
            <p>I wonder at the boldneſs of ſome Men, who affirm the Word Imputation
of Righteouſneſs is no where to be found in the Scripture. Doth not the
Apoſtle plainly and poſitively aſſert that God imputeth Righteouſneſs to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

juſtified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Knowing;</hi> That is, being ſure and certain of this, this is a Doctrine (as if
he ſhould ſay) we are well grounded in, and confident of, That a Man is not
juſtified by the Works of the Law; Works do not juſtifie or declare us righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
in the light of God: So <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8; 9. <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved through Faith,
and that not of your ſelves; 'tis the gift of God; not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould
boaſt.</hi> Here it is again in the Affirmative, it is by Grace; and alſo laid down
in the Negative, <hi>not of Works,</hi> and the Reaſon ſubjoined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To theſe Proofs of Holy Scripture, I might mention That in</hi> Phil. 3. 8, 9.
Yea doubtneſs, and I account all things but loſs for the Excellency of the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus

               </gap> is through the Faith of Chriſt the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
which is of God by Faith.</p>
            <p>What was it <hi>Paul</hi> accounted but Dung, and gave up for Loſs? Why, he
tells you it was whatſoever he accounted once for gain, or did eſteem of, and
reſted upon; <hi>viz.</hi> all his own Righteouſneſs, while he was a <hi>Phar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſee,</hi> and all
his other external and legal Privileges, which in times paſt he gloried in; but
now they were nothing to him: He ſaw no Worth or Excellency in them;
but wholly threw himſelf on Chriſt, and on his Righteouſneſs for Juſtification.
<hi>I count now at this very time</hi> all the Righteouſneſs I have (he ſpeaks in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Tenſe) <hi>but as dung,</hi> that is, in compariſon of that Righteouſneſs, which
doth and muſt juſtifie him in God's ſight, in which he would be found now, and
at Death and Judgment. Compare this Text with that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Not by
works of righteouſneſs that we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But perhaps ſome will object, that the Apoſtle in all theſe places only excludes
the works of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis evident he excludes all Works done by the Creature, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Grace, or after Grace, as well Works of Obedience to the Goſpel as to
the Law. Pray obſerve, <hi>not by works of righteouſneſs that we have done.</hi> We
that are Saints, we who profeſs the Goſpel; nay, ſuch Works, <hi>which God
hath prepared</hi> or ordained that we ſhould <hi>walk in them,</hi> Eph. 2. 9, 10. Good
Works done by Saints and godly Perſons cannot juſtifie them in God's ſight.
Were not the <hi>Galatians</hi> Chriſtians and Profeſſors of the Goſpel, who held
without Faith in Chriſt, no doubt, that they could not be juſtified? But yet
were ſo far fallen from the true Faith, as to look to be juſtified alſo by the
Law, or by their Obedience to it; or by an inherent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Righteouſneſs, which the
Apoſtle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> oppoſed. Works are indifferently mentioned, as being
excluded? He that is ſaid to be juſtified by faith, is ſaid not to work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to have a
Righteouſneſs imputed; therefore all works are excluded in this reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>2. If all Works were not excluded; then there would ſtill be the ſame cauſe
or reaſon to glory, or to boaſt; be they either <hi>Legal</hi> or <hi>Goſpel work<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>:</hi> but ſince


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59952:15"/>
all boaſting is excluded, all Works are excluded: It ſignifies nothing what
Works they are, if the reaſon of their Excluſion be but conſidered; which is
to take away all manner of boaſting, and to abaſe the Creature, and wholly to
magnifie God, and exalt Free Grace.</p>
            <p>3. Moreover the like Debt would be due to us; <hi>For to him that worketh, is
the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt.</hi> What though ſome of my Works
doth not make God a Debtor to me? Yet if any Works in this caſe are not
excluded, God would ſtill become a Debtor to me, which is inconſiſtent with
the Doctrine of Free Grace.</p>
            <p>4. If Works going before Juſtification, are excluded from being any cauſe
thereof; then much more thoſe Works that follow Juſtification; for Cauſes
(as one well obſerves) do not uſe to follow after, but go before their Effects,
at leaſt in order of Nature.</p>
            <p>5. If Works juſtifie, they muſt of neceſſity be good Works; but Works
done before Faith, or without Faith, are not good Works; for <hi>whatſoever is
not done of Faith is Sin,</hi> and are dead Works. Neither can the Fruit be good,
as our Saviour ſaith, while the Tree is bad, <hi>Every evil Tree bringeth forth evil
fruit;</hi> But every Man before he is juſtified is like an evil Tree, and therefore
can bring forth no good Fruit, no good Works; wherefore all Works, 'tis
evident, before Faith and Juſtification, are utterly excluded.</p>
            <p>6. Furthermore, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of all Men, whether converted or
unconverted, that 'tis not of Works, or Works done by them, or either of
them, that they are juſtified, or ſaved, <hi>but by grace; we are juſtified by grace,</hi>
and not by Works; all Works are oppoſed (by the Apoſtle) to Grace,
therefore all Works are excluded. From hence take this Argument.</p>
            <p>That Doctrine that gives the Holy Scripture the Lie, is falſe and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>But the Doctrine that mixes any Works of Righteouſneſs done by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
with Faith or the Free Grace of God, in point of Juſtification, gives the
Scripture the Lie; therefore that Doctrine is falſe, and to be rejected.</p>
            <p>2 <hi>Arg.</hi> That all Works done by the Creature, are utterly excluded in point of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
appears from the different Nature of Works, and Grace; 'tis poſitively ſaid,
we are juſtified by Grace.</p>
            <p>Now Grace and Works (let Works be of what ſort they will) are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
the one to the other. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>And if it be of Grace, then it is not of Works,
otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace; but if it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace,
otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> There is no mixing Works and Free Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but one of theſe doth and will deſtroy the Nature of the other; and
as it holds true in Election, ſo in Juſtification: If Juſtification was partly of
Grace, and partly by Works done by the Creature, or from foreſeen Holineſs
and ſincere Obedience done by us; then Grace is no more Grace, or Works
no more Works: For whatſoever proceeds of Grace (as our Annotators ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve)
that cometh freely, and is not of Debt, <q>But whatſoever cometh by
Works, that cometh by Debt; but now Debt and Free Grace, or that which


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59952:15"/>
is free and abſolutely by Grace, and that which is by Deſert, are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
things; therefore to ſay Men are called and juſtified, partly by Grace,
and partly by Works done by the Creature, this were to put ſuch things
together as cannot agree; for 'tis to make Merit no Merit, Debt no Debt,
Work no Work, Grace no Grace; and ſo to affirm and deny one and the ſame
thing.</q> From hence take this Argument:</p>
            <p>That which is of the Free Grace of God, is not by any Works done by the Creature.
But Juſtification is of the Free Grace of God; therefore not by any Works done by
the Creature. That being juſtified by his Grace we ſhould be made Heirs according to
the hope of Eternal Life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. From hence riſes all the hopes we have of
Salvation; 'tis by, or according to the Free Grace of God, through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of Jeſus Chriſt alone.</p>
            <p>3 Arg. <hi>My third Argument, to prove all Works done by the Creature are excluded in
Juſtification, is this,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith is the way preſcribed in the Goſpel in order to Juſtification;</hi>
not Love, not Charity, not Works of Mercy, but <hi>Faith:</hi> Now why is Faith
rather than any Grace mentioned as the way to be juſtified; is it not from
the Nature of this Grace? In reſpect of the Object it flies unto, or takes hold
of, Faith contrary to any other Grace of the Spirit, carries the Soul out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to Chriſt, like as thoſe who were ſtung with the fiery Serpents in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
were healed by <hi>looking up to the Brazen Serpent:</hi> So by fixing our Eye
upon Chriſt, looking by Faith upon Chriſt, we come to be healed and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
Moreover, pray wherein doth the Terms of the Goſpel differ from
the Terms of the Law, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> or, <hi>The Man that doth theſe things ſhall
live in them,</hi> Gal. 3. 12. Lev. 18. 5. Theſe are the Terms of the Law. Thus
runs the <hi>Tenour of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Terms</hi> of the Goſpel are quite different; <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus,
and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16. 31. This was the Doctrine <hi>Paul</hi> preached to
the poor trembling <hi>Jailor,</hi> which agrees <hi>with what</hi> the ſame Apoſtle ſays,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in
thine heart God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> This Confeſſion,
and this Faith, has more in it 'tis true than ſome believe; 'tis not a verbal
Confeſſion only, or a bare believing Chriſt was raiſed from the dead; <hi>'Tis a
believing with all the heart,</hi> Acts 8. 37. or to throw our ſelves wholly on Chriſt
<hi>by the Faith of the Operation of God,</hi> Col. 2. 12, 13. in full confidence and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that he was raiſed from the Dead, as our Head, Surety, and Repreſentative,
for our Juſtification, by the Power or Virtue of which Faith, we alſo riſe with
him from a Death in Sin to walk in newneſs of Life. From hence I argue
thus:</p>
            <p>That Doctrine which confoundeth the Terms of the Law and Goſpel together in
point of Juſtification, is a falſe and corrupt Doctrine: But the Doctrine that mixeth
ſincere Obedience, or Works of any kind done by us, with Faith in point of Juſtification,
confound the Terms of the Law and Goſpel together in point of Juſtification; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that Doctrine is falſe and a corrupt Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59952:16"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> May be our Oppoſers will object, that the Terms of the Law conſiſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Obedience, and that the Terms of the Goſpel conſiſt in Faith and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and therefore they do not confound the Law and Goſpel together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel (as all our true
Proteſtant Divines teach) doth not at all conſiſt in this; <hi>i. e.</hi> that the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<hi>perfect Obedience,</hi> and the other <hi>only ſincere Obedience;</hi> but in this, that
the one requires doing, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> but the other, no doing but belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
for Life and Salvation: their Terms differ not only in degree, but in
their whole Nature.</p>
            <p>2. The Apoſtle, 'tis evident, oppoſeth the believing required in the Goſpel
to all manner of doing or working for Life, as the Condition proper to the
Law, <hi>The Law is not of Faith, but the Man that doth them ſhall live in them.</hi> Faith
in Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, is not commanded by the Law by which the Soul
ſhall live, the Law ſaith nothing of this; this is not of the Law: And the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
ſpeaks nothing of doing or working for Life, neither of perfect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Obedience, but the direct contrary, <hi>He that worketh not, but believeth on him
that juſtifieth the Vngodly,</hi> his Faith; not his Obedience to the Goſpel, but his
Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>If therefore we ſeek Juſtification by any manner of Doing or Works, though
upon never ſo eaſie and mild a Condition of Obedience, we do thereby bring
ourſelves under the Terms of the Law; which is a compleat Declaration of
the only. Terms whereby God will judge all, and condemn all who are not
brought to ſee the Inſufficiency that is in it, <hi>through the Fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. no
juſtifie the Soul, and from that ſight and ſenſe diſown all their Works of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and accept of Chriſt his Righteouſneſs and perfect Obedience to the
Law, to juſtifie them in the ſight of God; for let our Obedience be never I ſo
ſincere, if it be not perfect, we are ſtill Debtors to the Law, and are a courſed
by it, unleſs we believe in Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that all who ſeek for Juſtification
or Eternal Life knowingly, or ignorantly by any Works done by then<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leſs or
more, whether commanded by the Law or Goſpel, confound the Terms of
the Law and Goſpel together.</p>
            <p>And to this, let me add one thing more, <hi>i. e.</hi> it cannot be rationally doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judaizing Chriſtians</hi> in the Apoſtles Days, againſt
whom he contended, did profeſs any hope to be juſtified by a compleat or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Obedience to the Law according to the <hi>rigour of it;</hi> but no doubt thought
if they did ſincerely do what they could <hi>to love God,</hi> and <hi>keep his Commandments,</hi>
they ſhould be accepted and juſtified in his ſight: For the Jewiſh Religion
taught them that profeſſed it (as one obſerves) to acknowledge themſelves Sinners,
which appears by their <hi>Anniverſary Humiliation at the day of Atonement,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
other Rites of the Law; nor have we any reaſon to conclude but ſome
of them yielded alſo ſincere Obedience (I ſpeak of Moral Sincerity) to the
Law; this being ſo, I ſee not why their ſincere Obedience might not juſtifie
them as far forth, as any ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel or milder Law can
a Chriſtian now. Brethren, this new Doctrine is but a piece of <hi>Old Judaiſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>


               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59952:16"/>
Theſe Men do but ſtumble at the <hi>Old Stumbling-ſtone,</hi> which was the ſeeking to
be juſtified by a man's own Righteouſneſs, in a ſincere or upright Obedience to
that Law or Rule of Life God gave them; and ſo thereby <hi>not ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> which is by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, without the
Law or any Obedience of ours.</p>
            <p>Moreover, pray conſider that <hi>Paul</hi> who told the <hi>Galatians they were fallen from
Grace,</hi> did not diſown Jeſus Chriſt; they were ſtill Profeſſors of the Goſpel,
though they thought Obedience to the Law a neceſſary Condition in order to
Juſtification alſo. Nor was the Obſervation of the Moral Law a damning Sin:
No, no, the Goſpel obliges to it; but it was their ſeeking Juſtification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and not by Faith only, or in that reſpect mixing Works with Faith.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>All Works done by the Creature are excluded in point of Juſtification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the ſight of God, becauſe we are juſtified by a perfect Righteouſneſs: If no Man
is in himſelf perfectly righteous, then no Man can be juſtified by any Works done by
him.</hi> But the Apoſtle proves, that the Juſtice of God requires a perfect or
ſinleſs Righteouſneſs in point of Juſtification; and alſo proves that all have
ſinned, <hi>nor is there one that doeth good, and ſinneth not:</hi> No Perſon has a perfect
Righteouſneſs of his own. Alas, Sirs, the Law of God is but as a Tranſcript
or written Impreſſion of that Holineſs, and Purity that is in his own Nature,
and ſerveth to ſhew us what a Righteouſneſs we muſt be found in, if we are
ever juſtified in his ſight. Nor can it be once ſuppoſed by any Man, unleſs
blinded, that God will ever looſe or relax the Sanction of his Holy Law, or abate
a jot or tittle of that Righteouſneſs his Holy Nature and Law requires in point
of out being juſtified in his ſight, it muſt be all fulfilled by us in our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
or by our Surety for us, and imputed to us.</p>
            <p>The Law did not only proceed from God, doubtleſs, as an Act of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Will and Prerogative, but as an Act proceeding from his infinite Juſtice
and Holineſs. Can any be ſo left, as once to conclude God ſent his Son to
deſtroy the Law, or to diminiſh, or take away the leaſt part or tittle of that
Obedience he therein injoins, which ſo well agrees with the Perfections of his
own pure Nature; 'tis ſtrange to me any ſhould conceive God ſhould give way to
relax or abrogate the Law of perfect Obedience; nay, ſend his Son to do it
(and in its room bring in a Law for imperfect Obedience to juſtifie us) as if
he repented he ever gave it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For by this means, ſaith a learned Author, God ſhould loſe much Honour
in making this ſecond Covenant, and granting ſuch eaſie Terms; for there
is no compariſon betwixt perfect Obedience required by the Law, and due
to God as our Creator, and that imperfect Obedience, which is accepted by
the Goſpel, neither in Quantity, Quality nor Duration: Here it is poſſible a
Man may be converted at the laſt hour and ſaved, though he have lived in
Rebellion againſt God many years; What little Honour or Service hath God
from ſuch a Man? yea, from the beſt Men, who confeſs <hi>their righteouſneſs to
be as filthy rags,</hi> in compariſon of a ſinleſs Nature and perfect Life, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of all Duties, Time, and Place, without mixture of any ſinful Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59952:17"/>
What ſhould be the reaſon of this alteration? <hi>If there had been
a Law given, which could have given Life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been
by the Law,</hi> 
                  <bibl>Gal. 3. 21.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Could not Man keep the Law of Works then? it ſeems the firſt Law was
too ſtrict. This reflecteth upon the Wiſdom and Juſtice of God: It muſt be
granted that perfect Man could obſerve a perfect Law, had God pleaſed
to give him Grace and Aſſiſtance ſufficient to his State and Neceſſity; and
ſo there was no need the Law ſhould be altered, and the Obedience, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of it, changed from perfect to imperfect: For if perfect Man could
not keep the Law of perfect Obedience, with ſufficient Grace. How ſhould
ſinful Man perform the Law of ſincere Obedience, having no more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Grace to aſſiſt him? Did not God foreknow that Man would break the
Law of Works, and ſo was neceſſitated to make a New and more eaſie Law?
Or, did not God both foreknow and permit the Fall of Man? Or, could he
not have hindred it? Why then ſhould he give way to the abrogating the
Command of perfect Obedience, to bring in that of imperfect? Surely (as
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) <hi>God is ſo Juſt that he can allow no Evil,</hi> and ſo Good that he
can permit no Evil, except it be with deſign to bring greater Good out of it.
If God permitted the Firſt Covenant to be broken, that thereby he might
abaſe Man and magnifie his own Grace, and his Son, in beſtowing Heaven
freely on him, and in bringing him thither by the continued Power of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
and ſanctifying Grace; hereby indeed God doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> advance his
own Glory, by the change of the Covenants.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But that the Condition of perfect Obedience, being broke by Man's Sin;
the Law therefore ſhould be diſ-annulled, and a new way of treating with
Man ſet up, wherein ſtill Man ſhould be ſomething, and his Works bring
about his own Salvation, and God be contented with few and very imperfect
Acts of Obedience; this certainly is a prejudice to his Honour; nor doth this
make it up, <hi>i.e.</hi> That our Obedience is accepted for Chriſt's ſake; for Chriſt only
made way for removing the Old Covenant, (ſay you) and the granting a New;
but he did not obey in our ſtead; nor doth add any Worth to our Obedience;
unleſs you will ſay that we are Juſtified by our own ſincere Obedience, the
righteouſneſs of Chriſt making up the defects of it; and ſo our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
will be a co-ordinate cauſe of our Juſtification with the righteouſneſs
of Chriſt; we ſay.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By the Works of the Law no Fleſh ſhall be Juſtified,</hi>
he doth not mean only the Law, as in the Hands of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but alſo as it is a-new
given forth by Jeſus Chriſt; for we are ſtill under Obedience to the <hi>Moral
Law,</hi> the ſubſtance of which is <hi>to Love God and our Neighbour as our ſelves:</hi> By
the Law is meant that Rule of Life God hath given, whether as written in the
Heart, or given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> or as given a-new by Chriſt as Rule of Life to us; <hi>Luſts
is a breach of Chriſt's Law,</hi> or as the Law given by Chriſt, as well <hi>as it was
given by Moſes,</hi> no Man, becauſe a Sinner, can be Juſtified by his own Works,

might be fulfilled in us,</hi> that is in our Head, who by Faith is ours; and thus by

or of none effect by Faith? Are we juſtified without regard had to the juſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
thereby required, or without a Compenſation made for the breach
thereof? Is it made void? <hi>No, God forbid,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>we eſtablish the
Law,</hi> in as much as by Faith we get or attain to a perfect Righteouſneſs; even
ſuch a Righteouſneſs as the Law requires, by being Intereſted in the compleat
and perfect Righteouſneſs, and Obedience of Chriſt to the Moral Law, in whom
every Type and Shadow of the Ceremonial Law, and in whom each Promiſe,
and Prophecy is fulfilled alſo: To cloſe this, take this Argument, <hi>If we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
by a compleat and perfect Righteouſneſs; then an imperfect though a ſincere
Righteouſneſs, doth not juſtifie us, but we are juſtified by a compleat and perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>
Ergo,</p>
            <p>Remember, Sinners, you are guilty, and muſt be juſtified in a way of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
as well as pardoned in a way of Sovereign Mercy, <hi>that God might
be juſt, and the Juſtifier of them that believe in Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 3. 26. We can only

Leigh</hi>'s Body of Divinity, <hi>p.</hi> 529. Our Obedience, though ſincere, is
not univerſal nor compleat; therefore our ſincere Obedience or Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
juſtifies us not in God's ſight.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>All Works done by the Creature are excluded in point of Juſtification of the Sinner
before God, appears, becauſe Goſpel-Juſtification is a great Myſtery,</hi> and the preaching
of it counted Fooliſhneſs to the wiſe Men of this World: to preach Chriſt and
his Righteouſneſs, as that which juſtifies us they cannot underſtand; Natural
Light and Reaſon comprehends it not. What, muſt we be juſtified by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Righteouſneſs of another? This to the learned <hi>Greeks</hi> was a ſtrange
Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But to ſay a Man is juſtified by ſincere Obedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> by believing the
Truth of God's Word, and living a godly Life, ſuits well with Man's natural
Wiſdom and Reaſon: But the Doctrine of Faith, though it be not againſt
humane Reaſon; yet it is above it, and wholly depends upon divine or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Revelation, <hi>through this Man is preached unto you remiſſion of Sins, and by
him all that believe are juſtified from all things, by which they could not be juſtified
by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts 13. 38, 39. <hi>For as by one Man's Diſobedience many
were made Sinners; ſo by the Obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous,</hi> Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

5. 19. How dare any ſay our Works or ſincere Obedience is our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſith the Apoſtle poſitively aſſerts, We are made righteous by the Obedience
of Jeſus Chriſt? If it be by his Obedience, 'tis not by our own: For as <hi>Adam</hi>'s
Sin was imputed to his Seed to <hi>Condemnation;</hi> ſo is the Obedience or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of Chriſt imputed to all thoſe who believe in him to <hi>Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the worſt of Men that have any ſenſe of Religion, are prone to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the only way to obtain God's Favour, and to be juſtified in his ſight, is
to make the practice of Holineſs and upright Walking a Condition; nay, the
only way thereunto, and that Happineſs is to be by that means obtained.
Hence 'tis, when they meet with any awakening Convictions or Terror of
Conſcience, they preſently begin to think they muſt amend their Lives, and
perform Religious Duties: Nay, this way the <hi>Heathens</hi> were brought to
their beſt Devotion (as a learned Writer obſerves) Mankind being made and
born under a Covenant of Works, are naturally led to work for Life, or
to do ſomething to procure God's Acceptance, and eſcape his Diſpleaſure.
The very Light of natural Reaſon informs us, that it is juſt with God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
us to perform Duties of ſincere Obedience, or Duties of natural or inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Religion; and if we fall in doing what our Conſciences tells us we ought
to do, we preſently through ſelf-love and blind hope, perſuade our ſelves God
being gracious will pardon us wherein we come ſhort, through Chriſt, who died
for Sinners.</p>
            <p>And thus we may perceive that the Perſuaſion of Salvation and Juſtification
by the Condition of ſincere Obedience, hath its Original from our corrupt,
natural Reaſon, and is part of the Wiſdom of the World; but <hi>it is none of

            <p>Certainly the Juſtification of a Sinner in the ſight of God by Faith only, or
to believe on him that juſtifies the Ungodly, is one of the chief Myſteries of
the Goſpel; but if our Juſtification was by our own Obedience, or by confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
our Lives to the Rules of the Goſpel, Juſtification and Salvation would
ceaſe from being any more a Myſtery: But to be juſtified by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of another, though Sinners in our ſelves, and have done nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
ſuch Favour and Acceptance at God's hand, can't enter into the heart of
natural and ſelf-deceived Mortals. Sirs, our Juſtification is a great Myſtery, as
'tis an Act of God's Sovereign Grace and Wiſdom: Herein his Juſtice and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
equally ſhine forth, and the one doth not eclipſe the Glory of the other;
Sin is puniſhed, and the Sinner acquitted.</p>
            <p>6 <hi>Arg.</hi> If when we have done all we can do, we are unprofitable Servants; then by
our beſt Works of Obedience and Services under the Goſpel, we cannot be juſtified:

He is no unprofitable Servant, whoſe Works or ſincere Obedience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends

he does deny that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone is imputed to us for Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
as being the only Matter that juſtifies us from all things, and that
without any Works done by us, either in reſpect of anſwering the Rules of
Law or Goſpel, though never ſo ſincerely performed. All indeed that I can find he
means, is this, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Chriſt's Merits are the Cauſe of the Goſpel Rule
and Promiſe, and his Righteouſneſs imputed is the Cauſe for which we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
and ſaved, when we have got new Hearts, and anſwer the Rule of the


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59952:19"/>
Goſpel in Holineſs and ſincere Obedience. And thus though imperfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the Law was Dogs meat; yet imperfect Obedience to the Rule of
the Goſpel or Promiſe thereof, if ſincere, is the Children's Bread; nay, that which
they ought to ſeek Juſtification by, and to deſire to be found in. (If this
Man's Doctrine may be received,) it ſhould appear by him that Chriſt's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
imputed, and our Goſpel-obedience mixt together, juſtifies us: But
the chief part is our Conformity to the Rule of ſincere Obedience, and Chriſt's
Righteouſneſs, cannot do by Faith alone without this of ours.</p>
            <p>2. But Soul know, and be not deceived, this Text hath always been urged
by ſound Proteſtant Writers, as one of the Pillars of the Doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt applied by Faith alone. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
not only diſclaim his Righteouſneſs he had before Converſion, or his Obedience
to the Law in point of Juſtification; but he ſpeaks in the preſent Tenſe,
<hi>What things were gain to me, thoſe have I counted loſs for Chriſt:</hi> But that which
he adds, is more, <hi>I do count all things loſs.</hi> He ſpeaks, as our Divines note, of
all, both paſt, long ſince, and alſo now preſent, whether Righteouſneſs of his
own, in Obedience to the Law, or Works done by him under the Goſpel, all
he counted as dung in compariſon of the Knowledge of Chriſt and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
or the Righteouſneſs of God which is by Faith.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis to be noted how Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> do jump together, and
agree in their Expoſition of this Text: The latter ſaith, <hi>That by Righteouſneſs
which is of the Law, are meant Works of Obedience done through the Knowledge of
the Law by the only ſtrength of natural Abilities before his Converſion.</hi> To which
<hi>Chemnitius</hi> and other Proteſtant Writers anſwer, That <hi>Paul</hi> rejected not only
his Works before his Converſion, which he ſignifieth, ſpeaking of the time

do count all things but loſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaith, <hi>They were the Jewiſh Privileges, and that conceited Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Righteouſneſs which he once valued:</hi> But ſaith he, <hi>a Goſpel-holineſs is not here
intended;</hi> and that ſtill by ſpeaking in the preſent Tenſe, <hi>Paul</hi> means what was
paſt, ſaith he. Pray obſerve they both exclude the Righteouſneſs of the Law,
done by natural or legal Abilities; and they both agree to include an inherent
Righteouſneſs, performed by gracious Aſſiſtance under the Goſpel. This
Man is I hope no Papiſt, though he ſtrives, 'tis plain, to maintain one of the
groſſeſt parts of <hi>Popery,</hi> and that part God raiſed up holy <hi>Luther</hi> principally to
detect. Chriſtians look about you, for you are greatly concerned.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider that the Apoſtle poſitively diſclaims all Righteouſneſs of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
done by the Creature in Juſtification before God, and did relie on
the Righteouſneſs of God: For if he ſets our Righteouſneſs,
or the Righteouſneſs of the Creature in direct oppoſition to the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God, which is by Faith; then <hi>that which is the Righteouſneſs of God
applied by Faith, is not the Righteouſneſs of the Creature, though never ſo ſincerely

5. 'Tis ſuch a Righteouſneſs <hi>Paul</hi> here intended, that he deſired to be found
in both at Death and Judgment; but durſt he, think you, deſire to be found
in any Righteouſneſs of his own at that Hour, or in that great and dreadful
Day? As to this, take what <hi>Reverend Downham,</hi> and others ſay, <q>When a

and moſt righteous Judge, if he look back on his own Converſation, as
having nothing to truſt to but his own Righteouſneſs, he ſhall find ſufficient
Maſter of Deſpair.</q> He may ſay with <hi>Anſelm, Terret me vita mea,</hi> &amp;c. My
Life doth terrifie me. Alas! what Man is fully able to ſay he is perfect, or
that he ſincerely has done all his Duty, in reſpect of that milder Law of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

            <p>Sirs, there is no way in order to Peace of Conſcience for us, but to do as

            </p>
            <p>1. If that Righteouſneſs which is the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith, in

the Creature are excluded in point of Juſtification in God's ſight: But the former is

juſtifie us not; but the former is true; therefore no Works of ours, nor ſincere
Obedience doth juſtifie us in God's ſight.</p>
            <p>3 <hi>Arg.</hi> That Doctrine that holds a Chriſtian down under ſlaviſh Fear, by ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Juſtification on his own Works of Holineſs and ſincere Obedience, is not of God;
but the Doctrine of Juſtification by our own Work of Holineſs or ſincere Obedience,
holds a Chriſtian down under ſlaviſh Fear, by grounding his Juſtification on his
Works of Holineſs and ſincere Obedience; therefore that Doctrine is not of God.
<hi>Chriſtians take heed what Books you read, if you would have a ſound and


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59952:20"/>
ſtedfaſt ground of Hope, Peace and Comfort; nay, not only have the Joy of God's
Salvation, but Salvation it ſelf; For if you build on your own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

by Faith only, you will fall into Hell,</hi> by ſtumbling at the ſame ſtumbling-ſtone
<hi>the Jews</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 32. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 2.</p>
            <p>8 Arg. <hi>All Works done by the Creature are excluded in point of Juſtification of a
Sinner in the ſight of God, becauſe we are juſtified by that Righteouſneſs by which
the Juſtice of God is ſatisfied, and his Wrath appeaſed.</hi> That Righteouſneſs that
delivers us alone from Condemnation, and the Curſe of the Law, doth juſtifie
us and none elſe; and is not that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt? Is not he that is
acquitted from Condemnation and Death, put into a ſtate of Juſtification and
Life?</p>
            <p>What is it that theſe new Doctors talk of? How is Chriſt's Righteouſneſs
made our <hi>legal Righteouſneſs,</hi> and yet not our <hi>Evangelical Righteouſneſs?</hi> If the
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt be imputed to us, as that which when apply'd by Faith,
delivers us from Condemnation, Wrath and Death, certainly we need no
other Righteouſneſs to juſtifie us in God's ſight unto eternal Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But Vnbelief is againſt the Goſpel, what Defence againſt this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Perſon that we ſpeak of, hath <hi>Faith,</hi> he <hi>believes in Chriſt,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Goſpel charges him not, and the Law cannot: <hi>Here is a Pardon, if
you receive it, you are acquitted: Here is a Plaſter, if you apply it, you are healed.</hi>
The Man receives the Pardon, applies the Plaſter; he is by the Grace of
God helpt to believe, he is therefore delivered from Death, and put into a
State of Juſtification, <hi>and ſhall not come into Condemnation,</hi> Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</p>
            <p>2. No Man is acquitted from the Charge of any Sin, either againſt the Law

and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt,</hi> he is <hi>juſtified from all Things, from all Sins</hi> of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſoever they are. Muſt we by our ſincere Obedience make God a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
for the Sins we have committed againſt the Goſpel, and free Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

Chriſt ſatisfied God's Juſtice for all our Sins; and when we believe, are we not
thereby juſtified from all Sins committed againſt the Goſpel, as well as againſt
the Law? Have we any Plea at God's Bar, but that of the Merits of Chriſt,
and his Righteouſneſs only, let our Sin or Guilt be what it will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how doth it appear a Man doth believe in Chriſt indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why his Faith, if true, will <hi>make him a new Creature,</hi> 'twill <hi>purifie his

Righteouſneſs ſtill nevertheleſs that juſtifies him in God's ſight, though his
Obedience and inherent Righteouſneſs may juſtifie his Faith, or evidence the
Truth of Grace to his own Conſcience and to Men alſo. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> God doth require an Evangelical Righteouſneſs in all that do believe this
Righteouſneſs Chriſt is not, nor is it the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; he may be ſaid to be
our legal Righteouſneſs, but our Evangelical Righteouſneſs he is not. And ſo far as we
are righteous with any Righteouſneſs, ſo far we are juſtified by it; for according unto


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59952:20"/>
this Evangelical Righteouſneſs we muſt be tried, if we have it we ſhall be acquitted,
and if we have it not we ſhall be condemned; there is therefore a Juſtification according
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>To this, take reverend Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s Anſwer, According to ſome Authors,
or Maintainers of this Opinion, I ſee not, ſaith he, but that the Lord Chriſt
is as much our Evangelical Righteouſneſs as he is our Legal: for our Legal
Righteouſneſs, he is not in their Judgment by a proper Imputation of his
Righteouſneſs unto us, but by the Communication of the Fruits of what he
did and ſuffered for us: And ſo he is our Evangelical Righteouſneſs alſo;
for our Sanctification is an Effect or Fruit of what he did and ſuffered for us,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, 26. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10.</q>
            </p>
            <p>2. <q>None have this Evangelical Righteouſneſs, but thoſe who are in order of
Nature at leaſt juſtified before they actually have it; for it is that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of all that do believe, and are juſtified; and we need not much enquire
how a Man is juſtified after he is juſtified.</q>
            </p>
            <p>3. <q>God hath not appointed this Perſonal Righteouſneſs, in order to our
Juſtification before him in this Life, though he have appointed it to evidence
our Juſtification before others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>4. <q>If we are in any ſence juſtified hereby in the ſight of God, we have whereof
to boaſt before him: Though we may not <hi>abſolutely</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Merit;</hi> yet we
may ſo <hi>comparatively,</hi> and in reſpect of others, who cannot make the ſame Plea for
their Juſtification: <hi>but all boaſting is excluded:</hi> And it will not relieve, to ſay,
that this Perſonal Righteouſneſs is of the Free Grace and Gift of God unto
ſome, and not unto others; for we muſt plead it as our Duty, and not as
God's Grace.</q> See his further Anſwer, Dr. <hi>Owen of Juſt. p.</hi> 221, 222. To
cloſe this, take this Argument:</p>
            <p>If by that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt which is out of us, though imputed to us, the Juſtice
of God is fully ſatisfied, we are juſtified; then all Works done by us, or inherent in
us, are excluded in our Juſtification before God: But by that Righteouſneſs of Chriſt
which is out of us, though imputed to us, the Juſtice of God is ſatisfied; therefore all
Works done by us, or inherent in us, are excluded in our Juſtification before God.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Finally, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> Nothing more frequently doth the Scripture teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
than that the Paſſion and Death of Chriſt was a full and perfect Satisfaction
for Sins. Further he ſaith, God doth indeed not accept, as a true Satisfaction
for Sin, any Juſtice but that which is infinite, becauſe Sin is an infinite Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<hi>&amp;c. De Juſt. l.</hi> 2.</q> Now the Sufferings of Chriſt and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
only, is of an infinite Value, ours is not; therefore Chriſt's Righteouſneſs
only, and not ours, is a true Satisfaction for Sin. Our Adverſaries ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

have, they muſt caſt it away, in point of Dependance, Truſt, or Juſtification:
Theſe are they, Chriſt came to call; theſe are they he invites to come to him; theſe
are they <hi>he came to ſeek and to ſave,</hi> who ſee nothing of Good in themſelves;
but contrariwiſe, are ſenſible of their filthy Hearts and abominable Lives: And
yet though it be thus, if they come to Chriſt, believe truly in Chriſt, they
ſhall at that very Inſtant be juſtified, which Faith or Divine Grace will ſoon
make them holy and ſanctifie them; for holy Habits are at that very inſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
into them, though Sanctification is a gradual Work: <hi>This being ſo, it
follows all Works done by the Creature are excluded, in point of Juſtification of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
before God.</hi> What ſaid <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>ungodly Jailor,</hi> when he cry'd out, <hi>Sirs,
what muſt I do to be ſaved? Believe on the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved and
thy houſe,</hi> Act. 16. 31. The Apoſtle did not put him upon doing to be ſaved,
but upon believing. But O how contrary is this to the Doctrine ſome Men
preach <hi>now a-days;</hi> they tell Sinners what they muſt do, <hi>what good Fruits they
muſt bring forth, and this before the Tree is good,</hi> or they have cloſed with Chriſt,
or have real Union with him; nay, bid the People take heed they do not too
ſoon believe on Chriſt or venture on Chriſt. <hi>Sirs,</hi> you cannot too ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Chriſt, I mean truly believe; I don't ſay you ſhould get a preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Faith, but true Faith: But is it not ſtrange a Miniſter ſhould be heard late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſay, <hi>A Man muſt get a new Heart before he can be juſtified.</hi> I thought a
Man could not have <hi>a new Heart</hi> before he had true Faith: Is not a new Heart
one of the <hi>abſolute Promiſes of the New Covenant,</hi> Ezek. 36. 26. Can any thing,
ſhort of <hi>Almighty Power,</hi> make the <hi>Heart new,</hi> or <hi>form the Image of God in the


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59952:21"/>
Soul;</hi> or can a Man that hath a new Heart be under Condemnation, for are
not all in that Condition who are not actually juſtified? Or can a dead Man
quicken himſelf, or dead Works pleaſe God? Or the Fruit be good before
the Tree is good? Are not all that are new Creatures in Chriſt Jeſus, and have
Union with him, 2 Cor. 5. 17.</p>
            <p>12 <hi>Arg.</hi> With which I ſhall conclude the Proof of the Doctrine. (though
I might mention many more, to prove <hi>all Works done by the Creature, or Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of his, are in this Caſe excluded,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>It is, becauſe if a Man ſhould ſo walk
as to know nothing of himſelf,</hi> i.e. <hi>be ſo righteous, or ſo ſincere in his Obedience, as not
to have his Conſcience to accuſe, or reproach him; yet he cannot thereby be juſtified.</hi>
See what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though I know nothing of my ſelf, yet am I not thereby juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
1 Cor. 4. 4. Though he had kept a Conſcience void of Offence towards
God, and towards Men; yet in the Point of Juſtification, he renounces all his
own Obedience and Righteouſneſs that was inherent in him. Durſt holy <hi>Job</hi>
depend upon his Sincerity, or venture in that, to ſtand at God's Tribunal?
Though he could plead Uprightneſs againſt the falſe Charge of his three
friends, and with much Confidence perſevere therein, juſtifying his Sincerity
with his Faith and Hope in God; againſt their Accuſatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But at length he is called into the immediate Preſence of God, to plead his own
Cauſe; not now as it was ſtated between himſelf and his Friends before, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

not from Faith in Chriſt, neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me exhort you not to receive for Truth all things that you find aſſerted
in ſome Men's Books, Sermons, and Writings, though recommended by ſuch
Men you have ſo great a Veneration for. I hope ſome of thoſe Miniſters that
have ſet their Hands to <hi>Mr.</hi> William'<hi>s late Book,</hi> will ſee Cauſe to repent of
their raſh Act, and great Inadvertency; for we cannot ſee but that the ſaid
Book brings in another Goſpel, or is a Subverſion of the Goſpel (tho' the unwary
Reader may not ſoon diſcover the Poyſon that lies hid in it) and 'tis full of <hi>hard,</hi>
and <hi>uncouth,</hi> or <hi>unintelligible Terms, Notions</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions,</hi> not formerly
known to the Chriſtian World: 'Tis ſtrange to me that he ſhould intimate
and hold forth the Goſpel to be a Law, or Command of Duty, as a Condition
with the Sanction of <hi>Threats</hi> upon Non-performance, and <hi>Promiſes of Rewards</hi>
upon Performance of <hi>ſincere Obedience;</hi> for if Sincerity of Grace and Holineſs
be not the Condition of that which he often calls the Rule of the Promiſe,
which he nevertheleſs ſays is not the Precept, I underſtand him not: Doth he
not mean a Man muſt be holy, ſincere, or a New Creature, before he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
on the Promiſe of the Goſpel, or can be juſtified, which is the Error
my Text oppoſes; as if the free Promiſe of the Grace of God in laying hold
on Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs juſtifies us not, but that we muſt get ſome
inherent Qualifications of Holineſs, as the Rule of the Promiſe, before we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
upon it, or throw our ſelves upon Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo muſt receive him
<hi>as Saints</hi> and not <hi>as Sinners;</hi> which is directly contrary to what all our true
Proteſtant Writers and <hi>Modern Divines</hi> have all along aſſerted. <hi>The Papiſts</hi> ſay,
a Man muſt be inherently righteous before he can be declared juſt; and that
Faith juſtifies, as it infuſes ſuch a Righteouſneſs in us: And this Man ſays but
little elſe, if I underſtand him; <hi>i. e.</hi> a Man muſt anſwer the Rule of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Promiſe,
aſſerting that the Goſpel doth judicially determine a Conformity
to the Rule thereof; and when God forgives, he <hi>judicially</hi> declares a Man hath
true Faith, and by Faith he means doubtleſs more than a laying hold on Chriſt,
<hi>viz.</hi> the making good <hi>the Baptiſmal Covenant, i. e.</hi> to <hi>love, ſerve, and ſincerely
to yield Obedience to the Goſpel;</hi> ſo that Faith muſt by him be taken in a large
and comprehenſive manner: And that before God declares us righteous to
Juſtification, he looks whether or no we have fully anſwered the Conditions
(according to the Doctrine theſe Men preach) and finding the Creature has
done that, God judicially gives the Promiſe in a way of Reward; and the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
being ſincere, though imperfect, 'tis accepted as far forth as perfect
Obedience would have been (could it have been performed) under the Law
of Works; ſo that ſtill inhereut Righteouſneſs is the Condition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>


                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:59952:23"/>
our Juſtification before the holy God, and not the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt:
Away with this Error.</p>
               <p>Brethren, This New Law it ſeems can give Life upon Obedience thereto,
the firſt being taken away; but <hi>if by the Law, any Law, a Man might be juſtified,
Chriſt is dead in vain:</hi> For as one Law, ſo all Laws of Works ſince Man hath
ſinned, utterly fail, and are unable to juſtifie us in God's ſight. For as ſome
learned Men have obſerved, the Greek Word is not [<hi>the Law</hi>] but [<hi>a
Law.</hi>] Let it be what Law or Rule of Righteouſneſs it will, that requires per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or imperfect Obedience, it will not do, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>For the juſt ſhall live
by Faith:</hi> Juſtification and Life comes only that way, and not by Works of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
we have done.</p>
               <p>And truly to talk of ſincere Obedience, when performed by an unregenerate
Perſon, 'tis ſtrange Doctrine. Sincerity muſt only be look'd for in him, who
is renewed by the Grace of God: 'Tis as impoſſible for an unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to perform ſincere Obedience (if we ſpeak of Goſpel-Sincerity) as it is for
a Believer to perform perfect Obedience to the Law of Works.</p>
               <p>Therefore Sinners, though 'tis your Duty to reform your Lives, and leave
your abominable Sins, which often bring heavy Judgments upon you in this
World, and expoſe you to eternal Wrath in the World to come; yet know
that all that you can do, will fail in point of your Acceptation and Juſtification
in God's ſight, or to ſave your Souls: Your preſent Work and Buſineſs is to
believe in Jeſus Chriſt, to look to him, who only can renew his ſacred Image
in your Souls, and make you New Creatures, which muſt be done, or you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
O cry that he would help your Unbelief: Come, venture your Souls on
Chriſt's Righteouſneſs; Chriſt is able to ſave you, though you are never ſo
great Sinners. Come to him, throw your ſelves at the Feet of Jeſus: <hi>Look to
Jeſus,</hi> who came to ſeek and ſave them that were loſt; <hi>If any man thirſt, let
him come to me and drink.</hi> Joh. 7, 37, 38. You may have Water of Life
freely. Do not ſay I want Qualifications or a Meetneſs to come to Chriſt.
Sinner, doſt thou thirſt? Doſt thou ſee a want of Righteouſneſs? 'Tis not
a Righteouſneſs; but 'tis a ſenſe of the want of Righteouſneſs, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Qualification, thou ſhould'ſt look at: Chriſt hath Righteouſneſs
ſufficient to cloath you; Bread of Life to feed you, Grace to adorn you; or
whatſoever you want, it is to be had in him. We tell you there is help in
him, Salvation in him, <hi>through the Propitiation in his Blood</hi> you muſt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
which is by Faith alone.</p>
               <p>Know that <hi>God juſtifies the Vngodly;</hi> not by making them firſt inherently
righteous, nor are they ungodly any more after juſtified: <hi>The Faith of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of God will ſoon purifie your Hearts,</hi> and cleanſe your Lives; this Grace
will teach you <hi>to deny all Vngodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly,
and godly in this preſent evil World.</hi> We do not tell you, you muſt be
holy, and then believe in Jeſus Chriſt; but that you muſt believe in him, that
you may be holy. You muſt firſt have Union with him, before you can bring
forth Fruit to God; you muſt act from Life, and not for Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:59952:24"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But O 'tis hard thus to believe; to be ungodly, and yet to believe; to ſee no
Holineſs of our own, no divine Habits planted in us: Had we ſome degree of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
or Righteouſneſs of our own, we could then believe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is not Chriſt able to ſave you, or is he not willing to ſave you, unleſs
you are Co-workers and Co-partners with him in your Salvation? Or are you
unwilling to be ſaved, unleſs you might ſhare with him in the Glory of your
Salvation? Is it hard for you to believe the higheſt Teſtimony and Witneſs
that ever was born to any truth? Can't you believe the Report of the Goſpel,
or receive the Record God hath given of his Son? Is reſting on Chriſt hard?
Can't you beg for Bread rather than periſh? Can't you drink when thirſty,
when you are bid to do it freely?</p>
               <p>We ſay the Goſpel is not a conditional Covenant of Obedience; or that
Faith, and Holineſs, or Faith, and Good Works, are the Condition of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
we are juſtified by any Works of ours, as a ſubordinate Righteouſneſs to
the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, or that we are juſtified for Chriſt's ſake only;
but not that his Righteouſneſs is imputed to us alſo, as our Sins were imputed or
laid upon him. We ſay that Faith doth not juſtifie as an Act, nor as a Habit,
or from any Worth there is in that, <hi>it being only as a hand to apply the Remedy.</hi>
We ſay, Faith is a Fruit of Chriſt's Purchaſe; and that <hi>he who ſpared not his own
Son, but delivered him up for us all, will much more give us all things,</hi> that is, Grace
here, and Glory hereafter: He that gave us the greateſt Gift, will not deny
to his Elect ones the leſſer Gift.</p>
               <p>And now know all you <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Perſons, this Doctrine will pull down your
high Thoughts and Imaginations, and abaſe your Pride.</p>
               <p>To you that are Believers, Oh! admire Free Grace; lift Chriſt up who
died for you, <hi>the Juſt for the Vnjuſt,</hi> who bore your Sins, <hi>who was made ſin for
us that knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> He
gave himſelf for you, and has given Grace, the Fruit of his Death, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to you. O labour to be a holy People; live to him that died for you,
and roſe again.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Is there any Sinner here? Are you <hi>ungodly,</hi> and in a wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Condition in your own Eyes? Are you <hi>weary and heavy laden?</hi> Come to Chriſt,
lift up your Heads: <hi>For to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the Vngodly, his Faith is counted for Righteouſneſs.</hi>

            <p>REader, I have now given thee the Subſtance of the two firſt Sermons
preached on this Text; and that which follows, contains an Anſwer to
all the main Objections brought againſt this Doctrine; particularly that of the
Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> about <hi>Works juſtifying, and not Faith only.</hi> And if this meets
with kind Reception, and I have Encouragement, I ſhall publiſh two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
more (God willing) and fully demonſtrate, That Juſtification is by the
Imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, or by Grace alone; and the Nature of
Imputation opened, together how we are to underſtand the change of Perſons:
Wherein I ſhall produce the Teſtimony of the <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> and a multitude
of our faithful <hi>Modern Divines,</hi> and <hi>worthy late Writers;</hi> that ſo you may ſee
we plead for no New Doctrine, but the very ſame that all Good Men and
Orthodox Chriſtians, in every Age have maintained; which will, I hope, be
of great Advantage to the Church of God. And alſo ſhew you how Faith is
concerned in our Juſtification, or is ſaid to juſtifie, and how not; together
with the Nature of that Faith. As alſo the Difficulty and Excellency of that
Faith that is accounted for Righteouſneſs: Likewiſe the horrid Evil and
Danger of the Sin of Unbelief; and Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s Book and Doctrine further
