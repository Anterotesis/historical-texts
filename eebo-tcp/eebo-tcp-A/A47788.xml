            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE fatal <hi>pique</hi> between parties oppositly perswaded, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Liturgy</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our Church, drawing nigh to its <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and highest pitch, about twenty years since, the noise of those clashings roused me up seriously to consider, that this was not a controversie, like many others, about trifling niceties, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a safe neutrality: but a controversie about a <hi>Practical fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> wherein to erre was to hazard the main. For if as the <hi>(Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists</hi> urged) the <hi>Liturgie</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our Church were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and simply unlawful; <hi>First,</hi> as being of mans device, and <hi>Secondly,</hi> because extracted out of the <hi>Masse-Book, Breviary,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rituals of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> then did the ordinances of our Church betray me all the while to an abominable complyance, no longer to be endured. But if, on the contrary, her religious Rites and appointments had no such impious quality, if they were elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of materials, not onely lawful, but highly decent: then to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my obedience to her sanctions would prove as dangerous on the otherside. Being then necessitated to an Election of one of these two (for they admit no <hi>medium) Conformity,</hi> or <hi>Separation,</hi> resolved I was to do it as it should be, that, is by examining what was said <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> for and against it, on both sides, and then to follow the dictates of an impartial judgement. That I migh stand the more erect, and behold both Opponents with equal angles, resolved I was also to amove some prejudice I had conceived against some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons disaffected to our Ceremonies, in regard by former Subscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had allowed what was since of so hard concoction to them; this I considered was <hi>argumentative</hi> onely <hi>ad homines,</hi> not <hi>ad rem;</hi> for if any did comply in order to their temporal interest, their fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings must not be urged to the disadvantage of the cause. Personal reflections thereforeset aside, I fixt my minde onely upon a disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the truth. All in effect that at that time, had been, or since hath been, said on the complainants behalf, was drawn up into one body by Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> the Magazin that stores all that party with a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noply, comple at armour</hi> for these Polemicks: and all that Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> did urge was faithfully summed up by Dr. <hi>Whitgift</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> who replied upon him. So that my study was reduced to a narrow sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tling, viz. a perusal onely of those learned Authors: this I did, from point to point, with all possible diligence, and that more then once; having sériously weighed the arguments on both sides, I sincerely professe, my judgement did clearly aquiesce in this, <hi>That our Liturgy and Ceremonies were no way guilty of that foul charge, of unlawful:</hi> and if so, I had enough whereon to establish my obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:107079:4"/>
Necessity and consideration of my eternal state having brought me thus far, curiosity had a further journey: for whereas one part <hi>cryed down</hi> our Service and Ceremonies as a <hi>Popish,</hi> and the other <hi>cryed</hi> them up as a <hi>Primitive</hi> model, and both with equal confidence, I had a minde to bestow some labour in the research of this truth also, and to consult the very fountains themselves, I mean those precious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the first six centuries. With <hi>Clemens Romanus, Ignatius. Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi> Apostolical men, I began; then descended to <hi>Justin Martyr Clemens Alexandrinus, Ireneus, Tertullian, Cyprian</hi> &amp;c. so gradually, downward unto the age of <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> Whatsoever in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage occurred to my observation as evidence of the practise primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive I noted, at first confusedly, and after disposed into more service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able order, assigning every note its proper station as it did paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelly relate to any respective part of our Liturgy. By the help of these notes able was I to discern that our Liturgy in the <hi>most,</hi> and those the <hi>most noble</hi> parts (those of sacred extraction excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) was extant in the usage of the Primitive Church long before the Popish Masse was ever dream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of. Nay more then so, able was I to discern an admirable harmony, even in external Rites between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and those ancient Fathers. These notes hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had so potent an influence upon my self that, whereas I at first conformed onely as education and custom had prepossessed me; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of that light they afforded me, I became a true son of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> both in judgement and affection: I inclined to think that meeting with mindes of the same complecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with mine, that is studious of truth, not biassed by passion, nor adicted to any faction, they would have the same operation. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this supposition I began to fit them for the publick: and I can onely say I <hi>began;</hi> for, in my entrance upon that work, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our civil discentions, <hi>plunder, and eight years sequestrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Reduced to this condition, how to live became my onely study, these uselesse collections I laid to rest, where probably they had slept their last, had not an unexpected occasion awakened them. That occasion, this</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> 1656. came forth a Book entiled <hi>Extraneus vapulans,</hi> in English, <hi>L'estrange is beaten,</hi> the Author Dr. <hi>Heilen,</hi> by Ordination a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> who of all men, should be <hi>no striker,</hi> so the Apostles Canon, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 3. and so the Canon of the Apostles <gap reason="foreign">

No, that he may see that he hath wronght a reformation upon me, that I am the better for the beating, I solemnly professe all the injuries he hath done me have with me had long since Christian burial, burial by the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> in that excellent form <hi>if any of you be in malice, come not to this holy Table.</hi> I thank God I have not the lest swelling thought against him, yet I ingenuously confesse, that when I first read in the Preface of that Book, my self, amongst others not very lovely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
<pb facs="tcp:107079:4"/>
blazond for a <hi>Non-conformist;</hi> I beheld it as a provocation most piquant and pungent to turn again, had I not seriously resolved never more to enter the lists of unchristian strife with him or any other. But though I resolved totally to acquiesce from such contests, yet did I as firmly from that very moment resolve, if God blest be with a few dayes, not to suffer that great <hi>blot</hi> of Ink to dry upon mine <hi>honour,</hi> and the rather because I was perswaded I could take it out, not with juce of Limon, sharp recriminations, but with milk and milder leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. In order to it, I presently re-assumed my long neglected pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Having re-viewed them, my second thoughts suggested to me a designe of a new-model: For wereas I at first intended onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of my Notes to the established <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> my last meditations resolved to apply them to all our <hi>Liturgies</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> to re-commend the Common-Prayer by all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I could, to a more passible entertainment, and to take off all the considerable objections against it. In the progresse of which enterprise so many new speculations offered themselves to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that I cannot but professe my self a <hi>great</hi> (I hope not the <hi>onely)</hi> Proficient by mine own labours, so true is that <gap reason="foreign">

As little do I expect, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to enthral any man to my private fancy; in matters of so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute consideration, I hold it as absurd to quarrel with any man for not being of my opinion, as for not being of my diet. If in any thing I have erred, as it is an even lay I have, more then once, he who shall friendly remonstrate it to me, will exceedingly oblige me.

            <p>Having thus presented to the world an account why I published these <hi>Annotations,</hi> it will be proper to premise somewhat, by way of illustration, in reference to the Text it self. Know then, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is exhibited in the <hi>English</hi> letter, (where the Printer hath not erred) is the established <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> distinct from its Rubrick (which is in a <hi>Roman</hi> Character.) Parrallel to this, somtimes in a <hi>Roman,</hi> sometimes in an <hi>Italick</hi> letter, stand the several variations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and former <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and where such leteral ascriptions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not, and no Marginal directions to the contrary, you may there be confident the <hi>Liturgies</hi> agree to a syllable. The Litturgies I here refer to are, the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and that of Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heth,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:107079:5"/>
which doth as much differ from our present <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> as the second of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. doth from <hi>hers.</hi> Over and besides these, you have also the variations of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Liturgy, and, in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, such places noted wherein <hi>Bucers Latine</hi> Translations disagreeth with the Original <hi>English;</hi> you have also in the <hi>Annotations</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity observed between the Latine Translation 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and her own <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and at the end of all <hi>The order of the Communion,</hi> in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of time before them all. By this means you are furnished with all our <hi>Liturgies</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> some whereof are rare, very rare to be had, (and which doth double the rarity) these compleat; and this so frugally contrived, that the utmost price of all, with my inconsiderable <hi>Annotations</hi> into the bargin, will scarce amount to the moyety of what I was lately demanded for one, and that imperfect too. Nor have you onely the Books themselves, but those also disposed into such order, that without turning over leaves, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a tedious hunt from one to another, you may view them in one scheam, and compare them together at once, as they stand impaled.</p>
            <p>Before I end, I desire all Readers may know, what many sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, <hi>viz.</hi> that my Country imployment in relation to mine own and divers others affaires hath been so very great, as I could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Presse, which considered, it will be no wonder if the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be not very exact.

Which while We were in hand to do, as the contagion of the sicknesse reigning in our city of London and other places, would permit an assembly of persons meet for that purpose; Some of those who misliked the state of Religion here established, presuming more of Our intents then ever we gave them cause to do, and transported with humour, began such proceedings, as did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raise a scandal in the Church, then take offence away, For both they used forms of publick serving of God not here allowed, held assemblies without authority, and did other things carrying a very apparent shew of Sedition, more then of Zeal: whom We restrained by a former Proclamation in the month of October last, and gave intimation of the conference We intended to be had with as much speed as conveniently could be, for the ordering of those things of the Church, which accordingly followed in the moneth of January last at Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Hampton Court, where before Our Self, and our Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie

                     </gap>r pains were, what our patience in hearing and replying, and what the indifferency and uprightnesse of Our judgement in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, We leave to the report of those who heard the same, contenting our Self with the sincerity of our own heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. But We cannot conceal, that the successe of that Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was such, as happeneth to many other things, which moving great expectation before they be entred into, in their issue produce small effects. For We found mighty and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Informations supported with so weak and slender proofs, as it appeareth unto Us and Our Councel, that there was no cause why any change should have been at all in that which was most impugned, the book of Common Prayer, containing the form of the Publick Service of God here established, neither in the doctrine which appeared to be sincere, nor in the Forms &amp; Rites which were justified out of the practise of the Primitive Church. Notwithstanding, we thought meet, with consent of the Bishops and other learned men there present, That some small things might rather be explained then changed, not that the same might not very well have been born with by men, who would have made a reasonable construction of them: but for that in a matter concerning the Service of God We were nice, or rather jealous, that the publick Form there of should be free not onely from blame, but from suspition, so as neither the common Adversary should have advantage to wrest ought therein contained, to other sense then the Church of England intendeth, nor any troublesome or ignorant person of this Church be able to take the least occasion of cavil aginst it: And for that purpose gave forth Our Commission under our great Seal of England, to the Archbishop of Canterbury and others, according to the form which the Laws of this Realm in like case prescribed to be used, to make the said explanation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> and to cause the whole Book of Common Prayer, with the same Explanations, to be newly printed. Which being now done, and established anew after so serious a deliberation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though We doubt not but all our Subjects both Ministers and of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was never any thingby the wit of man so wel devised, or so sure established, which in continuance of time hath not been corrupted: as (among other things) it may plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the common prayers in the Church, commonly called divine service. <hi>The first original and ground whereof,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> if a man would search out by the ancient Fathers, he shall finde, that the same was not ordained but of a good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and for a great advancement of godlinesse. For they so ordered the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greatest part thereof) should be read over once in the year, entending the thereby, that the Clergy, and specially such as were Ministers of the Congregation, should (by often reading and meditation of Gods word) be stirred up to godlynesse themselves, and be more able to exhort other by wholsome Doctrine, and to confute them that were adversaries to the truth. And further, that the people (by dayly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of holy scripture read in the Church) should continually more and more in the knowledge of GOD, and be the more enflamed with the love of his true Religion. But these many yeers passed, this godly and decent order of the ancient Fathers, hath been so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in uncertain Stories, Legendes, Respondes, Verses, vain Repetitions, Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and Synodalls, that commonly when any Book of the Bible was begun, before three or four Chapters were read out, all the rest were unread. And in this sort the book of Esay was begun in Advent, and the book of Genesis in Septuagesima: but they were onely begun, and never read through. After like sort were other books of holy Scripture used. And moreover, whereas saint Paul would have such language spoken to the people in the Church, as they may understand, and have profit by hearing the same: the service in this Church of England (these many years) hath been read in Latine to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which they understood not: so that they have heard with their eares only, and their heart, spirit, and minde, have not been edified thereby. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, notwithstanding that the ancient fathers have divided the Psames into seven portions, whereof every one was called a Nocturn: now of late time a few of them hath been daily said, and oft repeated, and the rest utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Moreover, the number and hardnesse of the rules called the <hi>Pye,</hi> and the manifold changings of the service, was the cause, that to turn the book <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> only was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times there was more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse to finde out what should be read, then to read it when it was found out.</p>
                  <p>These inconveniences therfore considered, here is set forth such an order, wherby the same shall be redressed. And for a readinesse in this matter, here is drawn out a Kalender for that purpose, which is plain and easie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded, <hi>wherein</hi> (so much as may be) the reading of holy scriptures is so set forth, that all things shall be done in order, without breaking one peece from another. For this cause be cut off Anthems, Respondes, Invitatories, and such like things, as did break the continual course of the reading of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessity there must be some rules: therefore certain rules are here set forth, which as they be few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, so they be plain and easie to be understanded. So that here you have an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for prayer (as touching the reading of holy Scripture, much agreeable to the minde and purpose of the old fathers, and a great deal more profitable and commodious then that which of late was used. It is more profitable because
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107079:14"/>
here are left out many things, whereof some be untrue, some uncertain, some vain and superstitious, and is ordained <hi>nothing to be read but the very pure word</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> 
                     <hi>of God,</hi> the holy scriptures, or that which is evidently grounded upon the same, and that in such a language and order, as is most easie and plain for the understanding both of the readers and hearers. It is also more commodious, both for the shortnesse thereof, and for the plainnesse of the order, and for that the rules be few and easie. Furthermore, by this order, the Curates shall need none other book for their publick service, but this book and the Bible. By the means whereof, the people shall not be at so great charges for books, as in times past they have been.</p>
                  <p>And where heretofore there hath been great diversity in saying and sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Churches within this Realm, some following Salisbury use, some Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford use, some the use of Bangor, some of York, and some of Lincoln: Now from hence forth, all the whole Realm shall have but one use. And if any would judge this way more painful, because that all things must be read upon the book, whereas before by the reason of so often repetition, they could say many things by heart: if those men will weigh their labour, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and knowledge which dayly they shall obtain by reading upon the book, they will not refuse the pain, in consideration of the great profit that shall ensue thereof.</p>
                  <p>And for as much as <hi>nothing can almost be so plainly set forth,</hi> but doubts may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> arise in the use and practising of the same: To appease all such diversitie (if any arise) and for the resolution of all doubts concerning the manner how to understand, do, and execute the things contained in this book: The parties that so doubt, or diversly take any thing, shall alway resort to the Bishop of the Diocesse, who by his discretion shall take order for the quieting and appeas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same, so that the same order be not contrary to any thing contained in this book. And if the Bishop of the Diocesse be in doubt, then he may send for the resolution thereof unto the Arch-Bishop.</p>
                  <p>Though it be appointed in the forewritten Preface, that all things shall be read and song in the Church <hi>in the English tongue,</hi> to the end that the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> may be therby edified: yet it is not meant, but when men say Morning and Evening prayer privately, they may say the same in any Language that they themselves do understand. [1. B. <hi>of</hi> Edw. 6. <hi>neither that any man shall be bound to the saying of them, but such as from time to time in Cathedral and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat Churches, Parish Churches, and Chappels to the same annexed shall serve the Congregation.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And all Priests and Deacons shall be bound to say daily the Morning and Evening prayer, <hi>either privately or openly,</hi> except they be let by preaching, study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">These two Paragraphs omited in 1.

                  </p>
                  <p>And the Curate that ministreth in every Parish Church or Chappel, being at home, and not being otherwise reasonably letted, shall say the same in the Parish Church or Chappel where he ministreth, and shall toll a Bell thereto, a convenient time before we begin, that such as be disposed, may come to hear Gods word, and to pray with him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Church of Christ hath in all ages had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script form of Common prayer, or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine service, as appeareth by the ancient Liturgies of the Greek, and Latine Churches. This was done, as for other great causes, so likewise for retaining an uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Gods worship: a thing most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming them that are of one and the same profession. For by the form that is kept in the outward worship of God, men commonly judge of Religion. If in that there be a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, strait they are apt to conceive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be diverse. Wherefore it were to be wished, that the whole Church of Christ were one as well in form of publick worship, as in doctrine: And that as it hath but one Lord, and one Faith, so it had but one heart, and one mouth. This would prevent many schismes and divisions, and serve much to the preserving of unity. But since that cannot be hoped for in the whole Catholick Christian Church, yet at least in the Churches that are under the protection of one Soveraigne Prince the same ought to be endeavoured.</p>
                  <p>It was not the least part of our late Soveraigne King JAMES of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory his care, to work this uniformity in all his Dominions: but while he was about to do it, it pleased God to translate him to a better kingdome. His Majestie that now raigneth, (and long may he raigne over us in all happinesse) not suffering his Fathers good purpose to fall to the ground, but treading the same path, with the like zeal and pious affection,) gave order soon after his coming to the Crown, for the framing of a Book of Common prayer, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which is received in the Churches of England and Ireland, for the use of this Church. After many lets and hindrances, the same cometh now to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, to the good, we trust, of all Gods people, and the increase of true piety, and sincere devotion amongst them.</p>
                  <p>But as there is nothing, how good and warrantable soever in it self, against which some will not except: so it may be that exceptions will be taken against this good and most pious work, and perhaps none more pressed, then that we have followed the Service book of England. But we should desire them that shall take this exception, to consider, that being as we are by Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of one true profession, and otherwise united by many bonds, it had not been fitting to vary much from theirs, our especially coming forth after theirs, seeing the disturbers of the Church both here and there, should by our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, if they had been great, taken occasion to work more trouble. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did we think meet to adhere to their form, even in the festivals, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107079:15"/>
some other rites, not as yet received, nor observed in our Church, rather then by omitting them, to give the Adversary to think, that we disliked any part of their service.</p>
                  <p>Our first Reformers were of the same minde with us, as appeareth by the ordinance they made, that in all the Parishes of this Realm, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer should be read weekly on Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>daies, and other Festival dayes, with the Lessons of the old and new Testament, conform to the order of the book of Common prayer (meaning that of England, for it is known that divers years after we had no other order for common prayer.) This is recorded to have been the first head concluded in a frequent Councel of the Lords and Barons professing Christ Jesus. We keep the words of the history; <hi>Religion was not then placed in rites and gestures, nor men taken with the fancie of extemporary prayers.</hi> Sure, the publick worship of God in his Church, being the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <note place="margin">The history of the Church of Scotland, <hi>pag.</hi> 218.</note> action of us his poor creatures here below, ought to be performed by a Liturgie advisedly set and framed, and not according to the sudden and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fancies of men. This shall suffice for the present to have said; The God of mercy confirm our hearts in his truth, and preserve us alike from prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and superstition.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F such Ceremonies as be used in the Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> and have had their beginning by the institution of man: some at the first were of godly entent and purpose devised, and yet at length turned to vanity and superstition: some entred into the Church by undiscreet devotion, and such a zeal as was without knowledge, and for because they were winked at in the beginning, they grew dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to more and more abuses, which not only for their unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenesse, but also because they have much blinded the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and obscured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and clean rejected. Other there be, which although they have been devised by man, yet is it thought good to reserve them still, as well for a decent order in the Church (for the which they were first devised) as because they pertein to edification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto all things done in the Church (as the Apostle teacheth) ought to be referred. And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony (in it selfe considered) is but a small thing: yet the wilfull and contemptuous transgression and breaking of a common order and discipline, is no small offence before God.</p>
                  <p>Let all things be done among you (saith Saint Paul) in a seemly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> and due order. The appointment of the which order, pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to private men: therefore no man ought to take in hand, nor presume to appoint or alter any publick or common order in Christs Church, except he be lawfully called and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized thereunto.</p>
                  <p>And whereas in this our time, the mindes of men are so divers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> that some think it a great matter of conscience to depart from a piece of the least of their Ceremonies (they be so addicted to their old customes) and again on the other side, some be so new fangled, that they would innovate all things, and so despise the old, that nothing can like them but that is new: It was thought expedient, not so much to have respect how to please and satisfie either of these parties, as how to please God, and profit them both. And yet lest any man should be offended (whom good reason might satisfie) here be certain causes rendred, why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away, and some reteined and kept still.</p>
                  <p>Some are put away, because the great excesse and multitude
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107079:16"/>
of them, hath so increased in these latter dayes, that the burden of them was intollerable, whereof Saint Augustine in his time complained, that they were growen to such a number, that the state of a Christian people was in worse case (concerning the matter) then were the Jews. And he counselled, that such yoke and burden should be taken away, as time would serve quietly to do it.</p>
                  <p>But what would saint Augustine have said, if he had seen the ceremonies of late dayes used among us? whereunto the multitude used in his time was not to be compared. This our excessive multitude of ceremonies was so great, and many of them so dark, that they did more confound and darken, then declare and set forth Christs benefits unto us.</p>
                  <p>And besides this, Christs Gospel is not a ceremonial law (as much of Moses law was) but it is a religion to serve God, not in bondage of the figure or shadow, but in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the spirit, being content onely with those ceremonies, which do serve to a decent order and godly discipline, and such as be apt to stir up the dull minde of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by some notable and special signification, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> whereby he might be edified.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, the most waighty cause of the abolishment of certain ceremonies was, that they were so far abused, partly by the superstitious blindnesse of the rude and unlearned, and partly by the unsaciable avarice of such as sought more their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> own lucre, then the glory of God, that the abuses could not well be taken away, the thing remaining still. But now as concerning those persons, which peradventure will be offended, for that some of the old ceremonies are retained still: if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that without some ceremonies it is not posible to keep <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Y"/> any order, or quiet discipline in the Church, they shall easily perceive just cause to reform their judgements. And if they think much that any of the old do remain, and would rather have all devised anew: Then such men granting some cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies convenient to be had, surely where the old may be well used, there they cannot reasonably reprove the old, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their age, without bewraying of their own folly. For in such a case, they ought rather to have reverence unto them for their antiquity, if they will declare themselves to be more studious of unity and concord, then of innobations and new-fanglenesse, which (as much as may be, with the true setting forth of Christs religion) is alwayes to be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed. Furthermore, such shall have no just cause with the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Z"/> reserved to be offended. For as those be taken away which were most abused, and did burden mens consciences without any cause; so the other that remain, are retained for a discipline and order, which (upon just causes) may be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and changed, and therefore are not to be esteemed equall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107079:16"/>
with Gods law. And moreover, they be neither dark nor dumb ceremonies, but are so set forth, that every man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they do mean, and to what use they do serve. So that it is not like, that they in time to come, should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused as the other have been. And in these our doings, we condemne no other nations, nor prescribe any thing but to our own people onely. For we think it convenient, that every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey should use such ceremonies, as they shall think best, to the setting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the reducing of the people to a most perfect and Godly living, without er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or superstition. And that they should put away other things, which from time to time they perceave to be most abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as in mens ordinances it often chanceth diversly, in divers countries.</p>

                  <hi>i e. if the solitary prayer of one single supplicant be so operative, what would it do in a full Assembly?</hi> who <hi>combining together, besiege and beset God with their prayers, such a storming of, and forceable entry into heaven, being most acceptable to him,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> elegantly. Such an advantage hath the <hi>Publick</hi> above the <hi>Private,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> above the <hi>Closet;</hi> and hence a necessity of Common Prayer.</p>
               <p>But there may be a necessity of Common Prayer, yet no necessity of a Book <note place="margin">Object.</note> of Common Prayer, that is, of a set form. The prayers of the Minister, in the Congregation, for the Congregation, are Common Prayers; which are Prayers conceived, and without book.</p>
               <p>Answer. Confest, such Prayers may in some sort be called Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">Answer.</note> but not so properly as set forms; because the Minister who officiateth Publickly, is but the Agent, the representative of the people in their resort to God. Now in arbitrary Prayer he cannot so well be called the mouth of the Assembly, or said to send up his prayers on their errand, when they are not privy to one syllable he will deliver, when he speaks alwayes his own, not alwayes their sence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which case the peoples <hi>Amen</hi> should be as Arbitrary as is his Prayer: and if upon some dislike at the either matter or form, the people think fit to suspend their <hi>Amen,</hi> what then becomes of the Common prayer? Again, in conceived prayer the spirit of the Congregation is more stinted then imposed; our concernments, whether temporal, or whether spiritual, are very numerous and require <hi>in terminis,</hi> to the best of our power, a clear enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them all by the Congregation in their addresses to God. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit these particulars to a prescribed form, it will faithfully dictate them again, commit them to memory, impossible it is for her precisely to refund them upon a minutes warning, and where any are omitted, the people's spirits as to those particulars must needs be restrained. Again, Arbitrary prayer is not so edifying as a prescript form. When the people are preacquainted with, and wonted to a set form, better can they accompany the Minister all along that sacred exercise with intention of spirit, then when he prayeth <hi>ex tempore</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words, perhaps sentences, being like to escape audience, either through vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal impediment, or local distance. Again, by set forms many mischiefs are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to which conceived prayer stands obnoxious, be the abilities of him who officiateth in an extemporary way, never so eminent, yet are they not alwayes the same. As man, subject he is to those familiar incidents, languor of either body, or mind, and when either of these possesse him, the vigour of his spirit must needs abate, his conceptions become disordered; and it were a sad case, that when a Congregation assemble to sollicit God by publick prayer, there should prove a fail in that great duty, upon any such common emergency, which mischief is prevented by a prayer alwayes the same. Care also is taken thereby, as the <note place="margin">Can. 15.</note> Councel of <hi>Milevis</hi> decreed. <hi>Ne forte aliquod contra fidem, vel per ignoratiam, vel per minus studium sit compositum.

                  <hi>qui novationes quasdam affectant. That the Capricious giddinesse of such who like nothing but changes and innovations be encountred.</hi> Upon which, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considerations, set formes have ever been esteemed so expedient, as the casting all our publick applications to God totally upon occasional and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested suggestions, cannot but signify a strange humour of singularity, and a practical schism from all holy men in all ages. What the practise of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God hath been unto the dayes of our Saviour, what of the Christians from <hi>Constantine</hi> to this day; hath been so often proved by very learned Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of our Church, as our adversaries begin to yeeld this controversy to us. But we are slender gainers by it, for now we are told that after <hi>Constantines</hi> time the Church began to gather soyl; and that unlesse we can produce evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for set formes within the first 300. yeers, we shall not be heard. Well then, let that be our present task, which if we be not able to make good, we professe we have much missed our aim. And first we will make our inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as early as may be. Acts 1. 14. we finde the Apostles <hi>all with one accord in Prayer and supplications:</hi> upon which words <hi>(d) Chamier</hi> (a man far enough from <note place="margin">Panstrat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol.</note> Superstition) <hi>Si orabant unâ, ergo communis erat omnibus formula: if they prayed together, then they used one set form,</hi> whether such a conclusion be <note place="margin">Tom. 3. l. 5. c. 12. S. 10.</note> absolutely inferrible from the premises of their <hi>Praying together.</hi> I will not here determine; that it will easily flow in upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> with consideration had to the circumstance of time, I am prone to beleeve. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was but new ascended, and the holy Ghost being not yet sent down upon the Apostles, they were not qualified above the rate of other men, and having not yet those extraordinary dispensations of gifts, which were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon them at <hi>Pentecost,</hi> it is very probable they durst not repose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon unpremeditated suggestions, but used some known form amongst them, most likely such as they had been acquainted with in the Temple and Synagogues, to which they so often resorted. Pentecost once past, and they with others endowed with miraculous graces <hi>(b</hi>

In the first times of Christianity, so far as Apostolick evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences teach, Common Prayer never went alone without the celebration of the Eucharist, then notified by breaking of Bread. Act. 2. 42. 20, 7. And though the form of consecrating these Elements be not there delivered, yet <hi>Jerom, Augustine and Gregory</hi> affirm it was by the dominical prayer, and that our Lord gave order to his Apostles so to do, and indeed no prayer was more apt for the service of that Sacrament especially if by <gap reason="foreign">

In after times their work encreasing, so as they could not well attend it themselves, they had their Periodeutae and Itinerary Vicars to go the circuit for them, these acting still agreeable to a series of Articles enjoyned by their Bishops. In the beginning of the Reformation when it much concerned the Civil power to act (as we say of natural agents) <hi>ad extremum Potentiae,</hi> to the utmost of its politick hability, King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though (I presume, upon consultation had with the Clergy) assumed and exercised the Authority of framing and imposing a body of Articles for Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal visitations, which had certainly this very commendable property, that they preserved uniformity, whereas the leaving them to every arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary fancy, and the exercise of that liberty by some Bishops of later memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, was (in my opinion) a probable way of erecting Altar against Altar, and creating Schisme in the Church.</p>

                  <hi>The Queens Majesty may by the like advice &amp;c.]</hi> There was in the Act pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, a prohibition, with a penalty annext to it, that no [Parson, Vicar, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> other whatsoever Minister, shall use any other rite, ceremony, order, form, &amp;c. then is mentioned in the Book of Common prayer] against this constitution, a caveat is entred here, whereby the <hi>Queen may by the advice of her Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners or metropolitan ordain and publish such farther Ceremonies or Rites, as may be most for the advancement of Gods glory &amp;c.</hi> So that upon the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this exception, the rule is corroborated, as to all particulars not so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, and consequently that none might innovate any Rite not expressly enjoyned in the book of Common Prayer then established, or Book of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons legally to be framed afterwards. Which clause of reserve was no impow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, nor enabling the Queen with any new and upstart authority, but onely a declaration of what was resident in her before, as inseparably incident to the supream Dominion vested in the Crown. Agreeable to which, She <hi>Anno.</hi> 1597. authorised the Clergy, then met in Convocation, to make and publish certain Canons which she after confirmed under the great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> Other Canons there were made <hi>Anno</hi> 1571. But being not ratified with roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority, I suppose, they were not obligatory enough to constrain obedience,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107079:20"/>
and as concerning these of 1597. the formal words of her heires and succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors being omitted in those <hi>Ratifications,</hi> they were supposed onely obligatory during her Reign, and that they together with her self breathed their last. Whereupon King <hi>James</hi> in the first year of his reign issued forth a new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission by his letters Patents to the Convocation then assembled, therein gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them <hi>[full power and Authority to consult and agree upon such Canons &amp;c. as they should think necessary]</hi> which being concluded upon by the Clergy and presented to his Majesty. He did <hi>[for himself, his heires and lawful successors]</hi> confirm them with his royal assent, as may be seen more at large in that Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Indeed the supremacy of the Civil Magistrate, as to confirmation and a cogency of external obedience in Religious and Ecclesiastical affaires, is no usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Churches right, as the Romish party contend against us; but hath been approved of in the purest times; and therefore whereas they seem to presse us with the objection, <hi>That our Religion is Parliamentary,</hi> because some concernments thereof have been Ratified by Act of Parliament. Our answer is, that Parliaments Enact not without the <hi>Royal assent;</hi> This is, &amp; onely this, that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal spirit which regularly animates those establishments, and from such assent the two first general Councels (not to insist upon Nationals,) received their confirmation.

Formed it was into four heads, comprehending a summary of all their pitiful grievances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning first the Church service, Secondly, Church ministers, Thirdly, Church livings, Fourthly, concerning Church discipline. To encounter these schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks both the Vniversities presently endeavour what they can, <hi>Oxford</hi> models out a very brief, but solid answer to all their objections, not suffering one to escape. <hi>Cambridge</hi> passeth a grace in their publick Congregation <hi>June</hi> 9. in the same year. <hi>That whosoever shall openly oppose the Doctrine or Discipline of the Church of England or any part thereof, either in words or writing, shall be forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with suspended of all degrees already taken, and made uncapable of taking any here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> This notwithstanding, they held private conventicles the usual fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of sedition, so as the King was compelled in <hi>October</hi> next to restrain them by Proclamation, but promising withal, that he intended a conference should shortly be had for the sopiting and quieting of those disputes. This was the great occasion of that Conference of <hi>Hampton Court.</hi>

                  <hi>According to the form which the Laws of this Realm &amp;c.]</hi> The Kings of this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> Realm are by the statute 26.

Queen <hi>Mary</hi> her self, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> severally in their respective reignes did act. But the laws referred to by this Proclamation is, first that Act of Parliament 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> wherein it is ordained, <hi>that the Kings and Queens of this Realm shall have have full power and authority by letters Patents under the great Seal of England to assigne, name, and Authorize, when and as often as their Heires and Successors shall think meet and convenient, such person or persons as they shall think meet &amp;c. to visit, reform, redresse &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the latter end of the Act for uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where the Queen (and consequently her Successors) are authorized <hi>by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Commissioners, or the metropolitan to ordain and publish further Rites and Ceremonies.</hi> And this helps us with an answer to an objection of <hi>Smect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymnuus</hi> who from the several Alterations made in our Liturgy both by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James</hi> from that of the second establishment by <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. infer, <hi>that the Liturgie now in use, is not the Liturgie that was established by Act of Parliament, and therefore that Act bindeth not to the use of this Liturgie.</hi> To this we reply, that those Alterations can excuse from that act onely in part, and for what is altered, as to what remaineth the same, it bindeth undoubtedly still <hi>in tanto</hi> though not in <hi>

And whereas it may be supposed that that Proclamation may lose its vigor by that Kings death, and consequently the Service book may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be thereby <hi>in statu quo prius;</hi> yet considering his late Majesty did not null it by any expresse edict, that several Parliaments sitting after did not disallow it, that all subscriptions have been unanimous in reference to those chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that the Emendations were made to satisfie the Litigant party. I conceive the Proclamation valid notwithstanding the death of that King.</p>

But this he effected not all at once, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: and first he begins with the great essentials of Religion, the <hi>Pater Noster, Creed</hi> and <hi>Decalogue,</hi> these were imparted to them in the English tongue by his injunctions, <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. then he proceeded to the communication of the sacred Scripture to them by a Translation of his own authorising, <hi>Anno</hi> 1540. But as yet the publick Service was kept lockt up from them: to indulge them therefore his Royal favour in this particular also, he caused an extract to be drawn out of the Latin Service, containing many of the best and most edifying Prayers, which (with the <hi>Litany,</hi> all translated into the vulgar tongue, under the title of his Primer) by injunction bearing date the sixth of <hi>May</hi> 37. of his Reign, he published for the good of his Subjects: But King <hi>Henry</hi> dying not long after, he left what he had begun to be compleated by his Son <hi>Edward;</hi> This Prince zealously devoted to the service of Gods Church, plied him as fast as the perplexity of the work, and little time he lived would well permit. The Bible which I told you before, King <hi>Henry</hi> had commended to the use of his people, not long after, upon reason of State he was enforced to withdraw from them again, and the restauration of it was King <hi>Edwards</hi> first endeavour, by <note place="margin">1542.</note> injunctions dated <hi>July</hi> the last 1547. confirming also the use of the other things, as <hi>Pater Noster, Creed, Decalogue, Primer, and Litany.</hi> But nothing was done yet in reference to the Sacrament of the Altar, as they called it then, whereof the Clergy had extended and extorted the moity, the Cup, from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; therefore ful restitution was made, in the next and first Parliament, to such as did in both kindes desire it. And because slender benefit this Act of Grace was like to prove, as long as in the service proper to it they understood not a syllable, (for the Reformation formerly made had not proceeded to the Communion office) this consideration drew on another peece of Reformation, <hi>viz.</hi> the forming and collecting of an office in the vulgar tongue sutable to that great ordinance; and this was done by the Bishops and others convened by the Kings command at <hi>Windsor,</hi> passing under the Title of <hi>The order of the Communion,</hi> which was a breviate and summary of neer resemblance to that we now have, and was published <hi>March</hi> the 8. 1548. But this was onely an interim order, made to stay the stomacks of earnest longers for the present, that very Proclamation which enjoynd it, promising somewhat of an higher import, which was effected accordingly in the first Liturgy of that <hi>King,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled by the most judicious Bishops and others of that time, ratified by Act of Parliament, and set forth <hi>March</hi> 17. 1549.

Thus have I drawn the line of our Reformation, so far as concerneth Publick worship in a known tongue, that the Reader may observe all its motions, stages, and processions, from its first rise unto the second Book of <hi>Edward</hi> 6. wherein our Church (some few particulars excepted) doth acquiesce.</p>

Some think our Church had under consideration how ignorant and illiterate many Vicars were, and ordered thus, that they might <hi>con</hi> in private, the better to enable them for the Publick. But I am of another perswasion: for, first the Church, I conceive, would not, as she doth, enjoyn them to officiat in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, did she not suppose them already in some tollerable degree fitted for the service. Again, the words are general, not definitively such and such of those mean abilities, but <hi>all Ministers</hi> without exception.

But be this so, or not so, sure of this we are, that the Church doth hereby warrant the use of her Liturgy sometimes in places not consecrated.

But let us examine the foundation of this Objection, and this is derived from those words of <hi>Isa.</hi> urged by our Saviour against the Pharisees, <hi>In vain ye worship me, teaching for Doctrines the traditions of men, Matth.</hi> 15. 9. where first it will be difficult to prove, that this was a significant ceremony; the Pharisees standing upon the outward custom, without the least hint of signification. Again, if it were a significant rite, here is a <hi>non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat</hi> of any reproof relating to it as significant, but that they stood more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, then upon the precepts of God, that being of a civil relation, they ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it as out of an opinion of holinesse, and as an essential part of Religion, in which respects those Ceremonies of the Crosse and Surplice, were never by us entertained or defended. And if all significant ceremonies are unlawful, what shall we think of that holy kisse mentioned in the holy Scripture, used at the Eucharist in the Primitive Church, which <note n="b" place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 26.</note>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107079:24"/>
the word defines the thing by Grammatical analysis, and resolving of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: and that it is a standing too much upon a thing, &amp; more then the nature of it requireth: to describe it larger, it is the doing or omitting of any thing out of a supposition of some holinesse, or pollution resident in it more then is. So that superstition is both positive, and negative; Positive, <hi>ye observe dayes, and months, and times, and yeers.</hi> Gal. 4. 10. Negative, <hi>touch not, taste not, handle not</hi> Colos. 2. 21. And so I may say of those expressions, be not signed with the Crosse, kneel not at the Sacament; for the placing of Religion, abstaining from such things of their own nature indifferent, is scituated under the same parallel of superstition with the Papists, who observe them as meritorious.</p>

The beginning of morning Prayer Sentences, Exhortation, Confession, Absolution, all to the Lords Prayer, seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Collects in the Litany, the rehearsal of the Decalogue, and divers Collects belonging to the Communion service, are no where to be found, either in the Masse-Book, or any other Popish service. So the <hi>All</hi> is false. But admit all our Liturgy were to be found in the Masse Book, that is no evidence it hath its Original from thence, not onely the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> and Book of Psalms, but the greatest and most edifying part of Canonical Scripture, is there to be found, as well as our Liturgy, why do we not therefore ascribe its Original to the Masse-Book, and upon that very score renounce it? Nay, if our Book was a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Papists, as the late Assembly have urged against it, assuredly it ill sorted with the Prudence of such Divines, to present the world with their own establishment, under a title borrowed expressly from the Papists, their <hi>Directory</hi> being the same, both <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing,</hi> with the <hi>Directorium Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi>

               <p>Far be it from me to charge the generality of our new ministery with these blemishes: confesse I must, and will; many, very many of them, are excellently qualified and endowed with gifts proper for this sacred duty, and do exercise those gifts to the great edification of their congregations; but in the mean time, if such miscarriages have actually happened already, or may so hereafter, through the violent passions of other men mis-principled, may it not justly be judged a matter of scandal and offence, to such as have a due value for that holy ordinance, and consequently may not those worthier men be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved guilty of the crime, through whose misprovidence these errours have come to passe. How much better were an amicable compliance on both sides, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing set forms for the desk, and allowing conceived prayer for the Pulpit, so that neither may professe and engrosse the whole service to it self, but share and divide it by a friendly agreement, untill such an award shall be made by those who assume the power of Arbitration in this affair, slender hopes have I to see much of either order or edification, in the service of our Church.</p>

                  <hi>(A) The division of the Psalmes very discreet. The ancient manner of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them various in Antiquity. The</hi> 15. <hi>Cannon of the Councel of Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea Expounded. (B) Bookes and Chapters of Canonical Scripture least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying omitted (C) The Rubrick for proper Lessons cleared. (D) A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Cave at to ministers. (E) Differences between the former Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendars and ours. Why several saints are added now more then formerly (F) Feasts instrumental to piety. The Jews fasted on high festivalls till noon. Whence our Fasts before some Holy-dayes. Why not before All. (G) Holy dayes why fit to be established by Parliament. Why instituted. The Churches power to ordain them. The Judgement of foreign Church and Divines.</hi> Zanchy <hi>cleared a demur upon the best reformed Churches. Our Holy-dayes not derived from the Pagans, yet warrantable if they were.</hi>

               <p>Though the Psalter be here appointed to be read, yet must it be interpreted according to the ancient practise, that is, by way of responce, the Priest one verse, and the people another, as <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriam</hi> sang their trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant hymn.

                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.] I finde in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Liturgy, in all the <hi>Cambridge</hi> impressions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> our Book of Common Prayer, and some others of the London edition, a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest errour, in rendering here the 13. of Matth. for the third; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly varying from the Liturgies of <hi>Edw:</hi> the 6. the 1. &amp; 2. and from that of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> all which give us the third of Matth. and conformable is the Kalender of the very impressions formerly cited as erroneous. This slip is taken, in truth, <hi>ex traduce</hi> from the first Church-Book printed in King <hi>James</hi> his time, which ought to be the standard for ensuing times, and which hath it the 13. of <hi>Matth.</hi> That it ought to be the third, is without dispute, upon comparing the two Chapters together, and therefore Ministers should do well to observe it henceforward, taking their directions from the Kalender, not from this Table. The like mistake is also current through all the same Impressions, in the proper Psalmes appointed for Whitsunday, where the xlvii is evidently put for the lxvii, and the x mislaid.</p>
               <p>In the Kalendar there is little observable, yet because some perhaps will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> be desirous to understand the several diversities betwixt the last and the two first; I shall briefly note them out for their satisfaction. First then, upon the account of the Sundayes, and some holydayes having, <hi>de novo,</hi> Proper Lessons assigned them, as I said before, our Kalendar differeth from the former. <hi>Sme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctymnuus</hi> hath taken the pains to tell us the diversity is an <hi>Omission of</hi> 32. <hi>and an Addition of</hi> 47. <hi>Chapters of the Old Testament besides many out of the Apocrypha:</hi> if so, as so it is, then I hope forty seven for thirty two is a fair amends, and might have passed without a Cavil. Secondly; in the first Kalendar St. <hi>Paul, Barnabas,</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> are in their Scarlet, in the two latter in their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Thirdly, in the first there are no Saints dayes mentioned but such as are in the Rubrick. In the second onely (besides <hi>Pauls</hi> and <hi>Barnabas) St. George</hi> St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> and St. <hi>Clement.</hi> In the last very many more, <hi>not that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them all for Saints, or holy men,</hi> so are the very words of the <note n="i" place="margin">Printed by Authority Anno 1573.</note> Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Reader in <hi>Praeces privatae, But that they may be as notes of some certain things, and fixed seasons, the knowledge of which is very beneficial.</hi> That is in civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, most great faires being kept, and many ancient rents and services be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing payable upon those dayes. Lastly, in the first and second no fasts on the vigils of any Saint, in the last many are added. But whereas <hi>Smectymnuus</hi> woul perswade the world, that what were fish-dayes before, were in the latter Kalendar called Fasting-dayes, and do strongly endeavour to charge it as an innovation upon our Church; I hope by this time they have seen their error, for certainly Fasting-dayes were never stiled <hi>fish-dayes</hi> by any former Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie since the Reformation, nor by any Injunctions of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, nor of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. nor of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but constantly Fasting-dayes.</p>
               <p>Between the Scotch Liturgie and ours, there is in the Kalendar a greater change, and more to the gust of our opponents. All Apocryphal Chapters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proscribed out of the Sunday and week dayes service by that Liturgy, and but a few admitted as proper Lessons for some festivals. Again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ours begins the Prophet Esay at Advent, the Scotch begins it the 28. of <hi>July.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fast]</hi> Too daily experience teacheth us, that nothing blunts the edge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> holy Zeal, or disposeth the soul to the performance of sacred duties, more then an intemperate surcharge of meat or drink: if so, by the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of contrary causes producing contrary effects, nothing doth more puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the spirit of man from earthly reflections, or whet it's appetite to heavenly concernments, and acts of Religion, then Fasting and abstinence, proportioned agreeable to the several conditions of several persons. Upon which very account amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> such Feasts as were celebrated with
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107079:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the most solemn service, were most strictly fasted in the fore-noon untill mid-day, or their sixt hour, that is, until after their morning service. This is the reason that the Pharisees cavill'd at our Saviour in relation to his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, saying, <hi>Thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the Sabbath day.</hi> Matth. 12. 2. what was that? not because they <hi>pluckt the ears of corn,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>they eat them,</hi> breaking thereby the fore-noone fast of the sabbath as they pretended. So also when some <hi>mockt</hi> at the Apostles. Acts 2. 13. as drunk when they were miraculously filled with the holy Ghost on the day of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost. Peter refuteth the calumny from the cool of the day, <hi>For these are not drunk as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third houre of the day,</hi> and they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted both meat and drink until the sixth.</p>
               <p>As for the fasts intended in the Kalendar by our Church as antecedent to their respective holydayes, I finde no direct nor expresse example of them in the Primitive Church. But very obvious, nothing more, is the devout practise of those early Christians, imploying the nights preceding their great festivals in humiliations, <hi>lying on the floore,</hi> watchings, teares and such outward acts of inward humiliation. But in tract of time abuses stealing in, and defiling those sacred exercises, the Church, say learned men, changed those night-vigils and watchings into Diurnall fasts.</p>
               <p>But it will be here demanded, <hi>why are fasts prefixt to some holy-dayes and not to all?</hi> My answer is, Proceeding in due order. The first of <hi>Jan.</hi> being the <hi>Circumcision</hi> is but of late known by that name, and anciently called the Octave of Christs nativity, and <hi>Octaves</hi> never were assigned their vigils in the Primitive Church. The <hi>Epiphany</hi> is no saints day. Again, if <hi>Theophilus Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> as he is cited by <hi>Riccardus</hi> upon <hi>Proclus</hi> deceive me not, it was a fast day it self, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>in which we were wont to fast till night.</hi> Now a fast-day could not have a fasted vigil. As for St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> they fall within the fifty dayes after <hi>Easter,</hi> which priviledged them from having fasts. Amongst all the rest onely St. <hi>Michael</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> have no fasts, Not <hi>St. Michael</hi> because, as ritualists observe, the Angels did not enter into their joyes through sufferings. Not St. <hi>Luke,</hi> because another day formerly of great esteem in our Church falleth upon the Eve thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These to be observed for Holy dayes and none other]</hi> In the Catalogue of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional alterations of our Liturgy, this Catalogue of Holy-dayes stands char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> by <hi>Smectymnuus.</hi> Truth it is in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Liturgy, no such Catalogue expresly occurrs, but they have in the Kalendar an establishment <hi>tant a mount:</hi> this Catalogue is extracted from a statute 5. &amp; 6. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. repealed by Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and revived by King <hi>James.</hi> 1. Jacob 1 c. 25. And by Act of Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit it is Holy-dayes should be confirmed; the property Parents claim in their children, masters in their Servants directs it: neither of which being <hi>sui juris,</hi> but subordinate to others their Superiours, it would be injurious to them who have the Paramount disposal of them, to deprive them of their work with-out their free consent; which being done by Parliament, where every man either personally, or by representation virtually voteth, all men are alike concluded, &amp; none hath reason to complain. For which very reason perhaps the Apostles were sparing in instituting holy-dayes, especially with a strict cessation from bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, wherein masters and Parents challenging an interest, their consent was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily required. And perhaps this may be in part the reason why the Councel of <hi>Laodicea</hi> can. 29. decreeing the observation of the Lords-day in stead of the Sabbath, in these words <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107079:38"/>
the earth, but I see no necessity but the other may be included also. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning feastivals <hi>of the Church they have rational grounds for their original, for Holy-dayes</hi> are the sacred records and entries of the most eminent mercies of God conferred upon the Church, the <hi>Memorials</hi> of his most remarkable works (for his greatest <hi>work-dayes,</hi> ought to be our capital <hi>Holy-dayes)</hi> tending to mans temporal, or eternal benefit: which works the prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, ought to be <hi>had in ever lasting remembrance:</hi> and not onely so, they are also the annual rent of that publick honour we owe, and return to him for those gracious dispensations, sometimes reserved by Divine limitation, sometimes left to the Churches liberty: for Gods Institution puts no absolute restraint upon the Churches freedom, nor doth the enjoying of the <hi>Lords day</hi> to be observed holy, exclude all power in the Church to constitute any other. The Jews had of humane ordination their feast of <hi>Lots. Ester</hi> 9. 21. their feast of <hi>Dedication.</hi> 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4. 59. This last honoured with: our Saviours presence, without the least hint of reproof, which certainly we should have heard of, had <hi>Judas Macchabeus</hi> done more then he had warrant for, as some sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Now if the people of God before Christ were dispenced with to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>add, as occasions did emerge, peculiar dayes of thanksgiving, over and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those of Divine establishment, it is not to be presumed that the Church of Christ, which pretends to a greater, should be abridged of the same liberty indulged to her predecessor: sure I am, her Catholick, both doctrine, and practise hath been alwayes a challenge of that immunity. What the opinion and usage of the primitive Church in this particular was, I shall leave copious occasion to declare in the future considerations of the Festivities in several; here I shall onely take notice of a passage of Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> misapplied by some of another perswasion, and then descend to shew the judgement of Protestant Divines in defence of this liberty. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> Epist. 118. <hi>ad Januar.</hi> speaking of the diversity of customes, relating to the festivals and time of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Eucharist, summs up all with an excellent Corollary. <hi>Totum hoc genus rerum liberas hàbet observationes.

Again, [They have not done ill, who have abolished all but the Lords day] This is granted too: for Festivals, being of an adiaphorous, and indifferent quality, far be it from me to impute sin to them who abrogate them, I speak of Magistrates impowred with the supream Authority, but though I allow they have not done ill in the abolishing, yet do I conceive they had done better in retaining them.

Answer, If the Churches here intended be, as the contrivers of it administer cause of conjecture, those of <hi>Geneva, France, Scotland, Belgia,</hi> it will raise a new question whether they may properly be called <hi>the best reformed</hi> Churches, a question fit to be stated before they be propounded as exemplary to us. To which end very proper it is, that it be demonstrated to us, that the advenu'es, the entries, the mode and way of their Reformation was agreeable to princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christianity, that the work proceeded in a regular, sober, and orderly manner, was not carried on by tumult, sedition, and Rebellion. For this hath been controverted, and no satisfaction given <hi>adaequate,</hi> or which hath made even with all scruples. Again, omitting how, and to examine what they did, we say their several parcels of that new structure, which they cry up for so rare a beauty, whose symmetry and proportion in the sense of many learned and judicious men, holds no conformity to the rules of Christianity. They have, it is feared, in an odd humour of singularity, abandoned the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order of <hi>Bishops,</hi> an order of 1500. years standing, before the new fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled discipline; wherein if they have done well, the consequence must infallibly be, that all those blessed <hi>Martyrs, Confessors Fathers,</hi> and others holy men of former ages, did abuse the Church in preserving such a Prelacy, and that Gods providence was supinely negligent, and fast asleep to permit his Church all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long so many Centuries, to be so mis-governed. To proceed, they have not onely layed aside these holy-dayes above specified, but even the Lords day it self, which our great adversaries themselves repute to be of Divine institution. True it is, they make it a day of publick assembling, but not for sacred concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alone, No, for civil also, having their markets kept upon those dayes: Till these obstacles be removed, we hold it not just that they pretend to the title of <hi>the best reformed Churches.</hi> Onely one objection more I must not fasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously <note place="margin">

The Objection is this, many of these festivals had their rise and growth from Christians conformity to the heathenish feasts, and customs, which is not agreeable to Gospel principles. Answer; No proof being produced out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient monuments to strengthen this assertion, it is as easily repelled as offered: there is indeed reference made to <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, but that Epistle, being the 71. of his 9. Book, speaks short; The Question is matter of Fact, whether actually the Christian came in place of Pagan feastivals: of this <hi>Gregory</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords not a syllable, all he saies is onely this. That <hi>Augustine</hi> the monk, who was his Emissary into <hi>England,</hi> desired his resolution what should be done with the Pagan Temples, as also with their festivals. <hi>Gregories</hi> direction in this case was this, that the Temples he should convert into Churches, and the Pagan festivals into Christian holy-dayes. How far <hi>Augustine</hi> pursued his Masters Order, there is no <hi>constat;</hi> suppose it acted what was commanded; then I say, first, the same objection lieth against our Churches also, which they have urged against our festivals. Secondly, this is enough to confute that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable mistake that Christmas day took it's rise from the Paganish Saturnals, when certain it is, that day was in observation hundreds of years before St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> and for other Festivals, they must rather be then supposed <hi>translated,</hi> then <hi>instituted,</hi> considering that <note n="q" place="margin">Anno. 300.</note>

Lastly, if the Christian festivals were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and translated to a coincidence with those of the Heathens, neither was the either direction, or execution too blame: St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in order to the Jews conversion made himself a Jew to them, upon this very score he circumcised <hi>Timothy,</hi> and shaved his own head at <hi>Cenchrea;</hi> why might not <hi>Pauls</hi> act be a leading case to all posterity, why might not <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> shew his act for their warrant. Beleeve it, if they could by this complyance cheat the Heathens of their Idolatry, and cozen them to the saving of their Souls, it was for ought I see a pious fraud. If <hi>Gregory</hi> be thought to have adventured too far in his direction, hear a Protestant of eminent note and account amongst us. Learned <hi>Zanchy,</hi> speaking of the Jewish feasts of <hi>Pasch, Pentecost, Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, Jubiles &amp;c.</hi>

Scripture; This in all probability of divine establishment, not so I conceive the next or sixth in order of Canonical hours, this being added by private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at which hour, after dinner, devout people resorted to the Temple to offer up their more pecular supplications, in reference to their private and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wants.

Fit it is that all holy offices the people should both hear and minde with all possible devotion:</hi> and this they could not doe in such Churches where the high Altars were disposed very distant from the Nave or Body of the Church by the interposition of a Belfrey as in many places it happened. Thereupon in the next Liturgy order was given for the service to be <hi>used in such places of the Church</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>the people might best hear.</hi> And if controverted, the Ordinary to determine the place. Now the last Reformers in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her time, observing that in many Churches the edification of the people might be secured and the ancient practice observed, restored the service to its former station, leaving notwithstanding an overruling power in the Ordinary to dispose it otherwise, if he saw just cause so to doe. Whereby it appeareth that the Bishops lately enjoyning the service to be said at the holy Table or in the Chancel, did not innovate but held to the Rubrick, and that the officiating in the Desk was a swerving from the rule, unless, where it was able to shew Episcopal dispensation expresly to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it.</p>

But as there is no <hi>constat</hi> that all altars were then taken down, for the letter speaketh but of most part, not of all, <hi>the Churches in the Realm;</hi> so is it dubious whether they were taken down by publick order, or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tumult, for the consideration might be <hi>good and Godly,</hi> yet the way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding therein not approvable: But taken down they were, and by way of concomitancy, probably in many places the steps of ascent were levelled also, set so as some were notwithstanding left in their former state: about which much strife and contention arising in several places, some eager to pull
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107079:45"/>
them down, others as earnest to continue them. The wisdom of the Church interposeth to part the fray ordering in this Rubrick no alteration to be attempted therein: which notwithstanding, the people in the begining of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Reign, began to be unquiet again in this particular, so as she was enforced to restrain them by a new order in these words. <note n="i" place="margin">Orders Oct, 10. 3.

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107079:46"/>
solemn, grave, and becoming, fitted with agreeable actions must need move to a sutable reverence.</p>
               <p>

[But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live, he shall not die; all his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him,] Whereby it is evident that this sentence in our Liturgy resulteth from the Original, rather by inference, then by translation. Now because many such seeming blemishes will perhaps occur to captious inquirers in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of this old translation, with that of the best edition: it will be time well spent to alleviate the burthen of this, and all other Objections, emergent upon this account. And first, we are ready to justifie our Church, thus far, that she never swerveth from the native verity in any one particular, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the fundamentals of, either faith, or morality. Secondly, it will be proper to examine what translation we follow. The first translation of the Bible into the English tongue in order to our reformation, was performed by Mr. <hi>Tyndal, Anno</hi> 1530. afterwards Martyr. But some Bishops had represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. that <hi>Tyndal</hi> was of a seditious spirit, and had disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed several books tending thereunto (a most false aspersion, witnesse that most Loyal peece, called <hi>the obedience of a Christian man)</hi> and that his Translation was very corrupt; whereupon it was immediatly called in and suppressed. But the Popes Authority about the year 1536 going down, upon the entreaty &amp; petition of the Clergy, King <hi>Henry</hi> issued out an order for a new translation, indulging in the intrim to his Subjects the use of a Bible then passing under a feined name of <hi>Matthews</hi> Bible, not much differing from Tyndals; the King promising a new, and more perfect Translation shortly to be published. This Translation came forth in the year 1540, and was called the Bible of the great volume, or the <hi>Great Bible,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Coverdales</hi> Translation. And though this Bible was enforced by the aid of a Proclamation, yet was both it, and all other Translations abolished by act of Parliamant 1542. and the publick use of the Bible interdicted in Churches without leave from the King or Ordinary first had: which interdict lasted all King <hi>Henries</hi> reign. But he not living many years after, and his son <hi>Edward</hi> succeeding him, the former statute was soon repealed, and the Scripturs made publick again according to the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Miles Coverdale,</hi> which in truth doth not differ much from <hi>Tyndals.</hi> In King <hi>Edwards</hi> time was our Liturgy compiled, and no Translation being then more perfect then this of <hi>Coverdals,</hi> reason good it should follow that. And from that doth our Liturgy derive both the Translations of the Psalms and other portions of Canonical Scripture But there have been two new and more correct translations since; one in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, called the Bishops-Bible, it being the labour of some Bishops commissionated by the Queen, the other in King <hi>James</hi> his time, and why was not our Liturgy reformed in this particular by those translations? shall I tell you what I have

heard, and from a very credible hand. A convocation in the Queens time were once in good earnest upon this very designe, but proceeding upon good advice, they thought fit, first, to examine the gust of the Parliament then sitting, by some confidence of theirs; these seriously disswaded them from fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progresse in it, declaring that this reformation being not very feasable without dissolving the ancient frame, they had cause to fear it would finde so potent enemies in the house (a thing of no great wonder) as it would scarce be allowed to passe again. The case standing thus, it sorted well with Christian prudence to desist. And the same Christian prudence moved the Compilers of the Scotch Liturgy, who had no other then the Royal Authority to regard, to reform agreeable to the best Translation, not onely these sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, but what else of sacred Scripture was ingredient into the service of that Church.</p>

                  <hi>A general confession to be said.]</hi> To begin Morning prayer with confession of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> sins, I may call the Catholick custome of the Primitive Church, <hi>De nocte po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus surgens antelucano tempore domum precationis petit, in labore, tribulatione &amp; Lachrymis indesinentibus facta ad Deum Confessione;</hi> saith <hi>Basil.

Nor is he onely a witnesse for confession, but for confession so qualified as ours, the Congregation repeating the words after the Minister, <hi>suis quisque verbis resipiscentiam profitetur, every man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his own confession with his own mouth.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The absolution to be pronounced by the Minister alone.]</hi> Of absolution I shall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> treat in the Communion of the sick. In the interim take this in part, that the Argentine Liturgy, used by such Protestants as live there in exile, and which Liturgy is dedicated to <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. as it begins service with a confession in substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials <note place="margin">Anno. 1551.</note> like to ours, so doth it enjoyn Absolution to follow presently upon it. As for this it is, you see, appointed to the Minister alone to pronounce it, which word <hi>alone</hi> hath here a double import; first, in relation to the Publick use of the Morning service in the Church, where it implieth that the people must not in this, as in their antecedent confession, say after the Minister, but leave it to be pronounced by him alone. Its second relation is to the private, for you must know that Morning and Evening prayer were not in their Original de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation intended by our Reformers, as onely peculiar to Church assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but as well appointed for the service of God in private families; this is evident by ancient Primers set forth which are composed of those services, and were designed to be, not only lessons for children to be initiaed into letters by, but also as helps for devout people in the performances of familie duties, as is evident by the injunction proemial to them. Now lest in the private ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of piety the people or Laiety ignorantly should rush into the Priestly office, this caveat is entred by the Church, declaring that the Minister alone, and no lay-man ought then to officiate. I think it also not improper here to acquaint you, that the words <hi>or Remission of sins</hi> was added, as also the word Priest changed into Minister both here and in divers other places by the Reformers under K. <hi>James.</hi>

First, that people ignorantly educated might the sooner learn it.

                  </gap>, every Catechumen who intended to come to the blessed Laver, was first to learn it: not a man of them, nor any other author of reputation, giving the least hint of it as any parcel of the Liturgy. As to the antient names by which it was called, there occur, first <hi>Regula fidei,</hi> the Rule of faith used by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> then <hi>Symbolum fidei,</hi> the symbol of Faith as <hi>Cyprian</hi> very often, sometimes <hi>confessio fidei</hi> the confession Faith. The Creed here inserted pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth under the Title of the <hi>Apostles</hi> Creed, supposed by many to have been composed by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> when they were about to disperse themselves into their several walks, to be the summary of their Faith, every Apostle collating one Article, his share, to the frame. But our Church did not confide in this Relation, and therefore hath delivered her self very sparingly in these saving terms, <hi>Symbolum quod vulgo Apostolorum dicitur, the Creed which is vulgarly denominated from the Apostles.</hi> And learned <hi>Vossius</hi> hath evidently proved it is a vulgar error, and that really the Apostles made no such Creed. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are; first, there is not the least syllable witnessing any such Creed <note place="margin">Article 8. De tribus Symbol. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertatio p.</note> made by them, neither in the Acts of the Apostles, nor in their Epistles. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, amongst all the Ecclesiastical writers not a man mentions it. Thirdly, that if any such Creed had been made by the Apostles, the Antient Fathers of the Church would never have presumed, or attempted to contrive so many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral confessions, but would have acquiesced in this. Fourthly, if this Creed had been delivered, <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> by the Apostles, there would not have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in several Churches such variety of confessions, with such Additions, such omissions of Articles, as the year 400. represents, many instances where-of he gives in comparing the three Creeds of <hi>Rome, Aquilegia,</hi> and the East, as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> renders them. But whereas that judicious man takes exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the word <hi>Catholick</hi> in the Article of the Holy <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, and <note place="margin">Disser. 1. Sect. 39.</note> yields this reason, <hi>Apostolorum aetate nondum obtinebat consuetudo ut Christiani dicerentur Catholici. In the Apostolical age custome had not yet prevailed to call Christians Catholicks.</hi> That assertion being negative, is tenant only by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie, and were it precisely true, yet can it not be rationally deduced from thence, that the word <hi>Catholick</hi> was not in that age applied to the Church, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially there being Record extant to the contrary.

If then the word <hi>Catholick</hi> entred upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> as a mark of difference to separate the true Church from the Conventicles of Hereticks, and such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles there were (whereof there is no doubt) in the Apostles days, the inference is spontaneously consequent, that in that early age, it might be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107079:49"/>
But to return to the Creed; if it was not framed by the Apostles, how came it to derive denomination from them? my answer is, because it is an excellent epitome of their Doctrine, and contrived in a neer resemblance to their own Language, or rather, because a great part of it was probably digested by the Apostolick Church, though some Articles were added by after times. So the great Creed is called the <hi>Nicene,</hi> though many things were affixt to it by the Councel of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and some things since, For, certain it is, the Primitive Church not farr distant from the Apostolick age, had a Creed resembling this of the Apostles, as to most particulars, and the substance of the Articles, though with some syllabical variations, as it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by <note n="g" place="margin">Tertullian de velandis virginibus.</note>

                  <hi>Hierome; Omne Christiani dogmatis Sacramentum carnis resurrectione concluditur.

So that to draw to an end, uniting these African par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels together, we have found a Creed, as to the essentials, very conformable to this of the Apostles, and for the verbal diversity, it is the less to be wondred at, when they who are conversant in the antient Fathers know, their manner was in citing even Canonical Scripture, not alwayes to consult the Originals, but often to deliver it in in such words as their memories suggested, provided they preserved the sense intire. Probably from the same Liberty, practised in those accounts, they give of the Confessions of their faith, might arise this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity</p>
               <p>This and the other Creeds in the offices of our Church, are alwayes appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be said after the reading of some part of Canonical Scripture; because <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. 17. first hearing, and then faith: it is ordered to be read standing, for three reasons.

Secondly, because the stationary posture is most significant, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a Resolution to defend and maintain the faith we profess, when we assert any thing with much earnestness, we usually say, <hi>this is truth, and we will stand to it.</hi> Thirdly, in imitation of the Order of the Catechumens, who did rehearse it in a stationary posture. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> relating one <hi>Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his deportment in this case speaks thus, <hi>ut ventum est ad horam profitendae fidei, quae verbis certis, conceptis retentisque memoriter de loco eminentiore in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu populi sidelis reddi solet. As soon as the time came for him to make profession of his faith, which was used to be done in a set form of words got by heart, and from an high place of ascent, so as all the faithful might behold, the Presbyters offered him, that if he would, he should rehearse it in private</hi> (as some others did, for fear of being daunted with so great an audience) <hi>he refused it, saying, he would do it in the presence of the whole congregation, and presently he mounted up.</hi> From which story very inferrible it is, that as the eminence of the place was regularly required for the greater evidence of the fact, so was the posture erect as most serviceable to that end, although St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith it not <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Which faith, except every one do keep holy and undefiled; without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</p>
               <p>And the Catholick faith is this; that we worship one God in trinity, and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in unity.</p>
               <p>Neither confounding the persons; nor dividing the substance.</p>
               <p>For there is one person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>But the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the holy Ghost is all one: the glory equal, the majesty coeternal.</p>
               <p>Such as the Father is, such is the Son; and such is the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>The Father uncreate, the Son uncreate; and the holy Ghost uncreate.</p>
               <p>The Father incomprehensible, the son incomprehensible; and the holy Ghost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible.</p>
               <p>The Father eternal, the son eternal; and the holy Ghost eternal.</p>
               <p>And yet they are not three eternals; but one eternal.</p>
               <p>As also there be not three incomprehensibles, not three uncreated, but one uncre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and one incomprehensible.</p>
               <p>So likewise, the Father is almighty, the son almighty; and the Holy Ghost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p>And yet they are not three almighties; but one almighty.</p>
               <p>So the Father is God, the son is God, and the holy Ghost is God.</p>
               <p>And yet are they not three Gods, but one God.</p>
               <p>So likewise the father is Lord, the son Lord; the holy ghost Lord.</p>
               <p>And yet not three Lords: but one Lord.</p>
               <p>For like as we be compelled by the Christian verity, to acknowledge every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by himself to be God and Lord:</p>
               <p>So are we forbidden by the Catholick Religion, to say, there be three Gods, or three Lords.</p>
               <p>The Father is made of none; neither created nor begotten.</p>
               <p>The son is of the Father alone; not made, nor created, but begotten.</p>
               <p>The holy Ghost is of the father and of the son; neither made, nor created, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but proceeding.</p>
               <p>So there is one father, not three fathers, one son, not three sons; one holy Ghost, not three holy Ghosts.</p>
               <p>And in this Trinity, none is afore or after other; none is greater or lesse then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>But the whole three persons be coeternal together, and coequal.</p>
               <p>So that in all things, as is aforesaid; the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be worshipped.</p>
               <p>He therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinitie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is necessary to everlasting salvation; that he also beleeve rightly in the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For the right faith is, that we beleeve and confesse, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the son of God, is God and man.</p>
               <p>God, of the substance of the father, begotten before the worlds, and man of the substance of his mother, born in the world.</p>
               <p>Perfect God, and perfect man, of a reasonable soul, and humane flesh subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</p>
               <p>Equal to the Father as touching his Godhead; and inferiour to the father, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his manhood.</p>
               <p>Who although he be God and man; yet he is not two, but one Christ.</p>

Due, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh; but by taking of the manhood into God.</p>
               <p>Due altogether, not by confusion of substance; but by unitie of person.</p>

The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon Sermon hath not that countenance of Authority in our Church which catechizing hath, this being setled by express rule, that only tolerated, or entring in by remote implication; and though late custome hath invested it with an honour commensurate with, and equal to that of the morning Sermon, sure I am it was of minor reputation in the Apostolick, and next succeeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

Now as this testimony of <hi>Socrates</hi> chalketh out the place of the afternoon Sermon to be the same with that in the morning, <hi>viz.</hi> after the reading of the Scriptures, so doth it imply that the custome was no where taken up but there, and that in other places preaching, at Evening service, was but occasional and arbitrary, not stated as parcel of the office. Let it not be thought that I here endeavour to disparage that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Preaching, an ordinance so often instrumental to the conversion of souls. No, my only design is to commend the other duty to more frequent practise: a duty without whose pre-elementation Sermons themselves edify ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little.</p>

By what hath already been said, Mr. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> mistake seems grosse enough in founding the first rise of Litanies upon <hi>Mamercus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna.</hi> He, if he did any thing in their establishment, probably went no further then the reviewing of anteceding Litanies, and disposing them into a form agreeable to <hi>Vienna's</hi> sad condition, and the assigning three dayes before Ascension for that service. As did also the Councel of Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a after him can. 23. Next <hi>Mamercus</hi> comes in <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Author of the great Litany, that of <hi>Mamercus</hi> being stiled the lesse, and most probably so he was; but the sneezing sicknesse being decryed by all learned men as fabulous, and so it no motive or inducement to the work, some other cause must be assigned, which perhaps might be some rage of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Pestilence; or else it may be conjectured to have been compiled upon the general score of Reformation. For <hi>Gregory,</hi> observing in the several offices of diverse Latine Churches many things which gave cause of dislike, some being vain, some unapt, some scarce making out sense, he presently applied himself to consider of and compare them all together, and so to compile a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the most choice peeces extracted from them, which he performing left as a Legacy to his successors, which was at first owned as the proper ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Romish Church. Part of this Liturgy was the Great Litany, which contained the very quintessence of all former Models, with additions of his own, some for the better and some for the worse, and these rather the ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes of his times, then of himself. That age wherein he lived was none of the learnedst, but declined much towards ignorance, which is worthily stiled the mother of blinde devotion, or superstition: this ignorance soon brought in the Invocation of Saints, an errour which began to be whispered in the writings of others some few yeers preceding, but never durst shew it self <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>bare-faced</hi> in the service of the Church untill this <hi>Gregory</hi> led it in; who over facile to credit mis-reported miracles (as his Dialogues demonstrate) was made susceptible of any errour which presented it self un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shape of devotion, and consequently of invocation of Saints. He therefore imbibing this fallacious opinion, acted agreeable to its principles, and after the addresse to the sacred Trinity inserted in the Litany an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, first to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> next to the <hi>Archangels.</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107079:59"/>
to the Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, and Virgins, bestowing upon every one an <hi>Orapro nobis,</hi> nominally applied.</p>
               <p>As for the Litany used in our Church, a very neer resemblance it hath with that devised by St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> if he were the Author of the <hi>Sacramontary,</hi> as I am prone to beleeve he was.

As for the so frequent repetition of <hi>Lord have mercy upon us:</hi> In all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability Christianity did not devise it new, but imitated elder patterns, I mean that mode of the 136. Psalm, where <hi>for his mercy endureth for ever,</hi> is itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no lesse then 27. times, and which versicle was used Litany-wise (that is, returned by the people) in the service of the Temple, as is evident. 1 Chron. 16. 41. &amp; 2 Chron 9. 13.</p>
               <p>The gesture proper to this service must be kneeling. This is manifest by the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick belonging to Commination, where the Litany is appointed to be read <hi>after the accustomea manner,</hi> implying thereby both the place and posture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used. Now the <hi>accustomed</hi> place was the midst of the Church, and the <hi>accustomed</hi> posture was kneeling, for so was it appointed in the <note n="n" place="margin">Injunct. 18.</note> Queens Injunctions, and in those of <note n="o" place="margin">Injunct. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt, <hi>the Priests shall kneel in the midst of the Church, and sing or say plainly and distinctly the Litany.</hi> Indeed what fitter posture can there be then kneeling. Excellently saith <note n="p" place="margin">Hom. in Psal. 4.</note> St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>it is fit that he who applies himself to prayer, should put on the outward garb and deportment, as well as the inward minde of a supplicant:</hi> what scheam sutes a supplicant better then lowly kneeling, and can we kneel too low at such supplications as these? The motions of the body ought to keep pace with the affections of the Soul, when this is most transported with Zeal, the members of the body must move at the same rate, the higher the spirit soares in Prayer, the lower falls the body. When our Saviour prayed in the Garden, his first posture was, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>falling upon his knees:</hi> Luk. 22. 41. but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>he cast himself prostrat upon his face,</hi> Matth 26. 39. Now if the Litany be, as certainly it is, our most fervent resort to God, fit it is it should be made in the most significant, that is, in the lowest posture of supplication.</p>
               <p>As for the exceptions made against this Litany, they are so few, and so contemptible, as I disdain to honour them with a reply, and shall end in this true character of it; That in all concernments, so excellently is it contrived in accommodation to our general wants, so full of Christian Rhetorick, and pious Raptures, as it justly deserves to be accounted a noble parcel of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy. Nor can all the cavils of malevolent spirits, ballance the honour it hath acquired abroad. <hi>For Gilbertus Cognatus,</hi> (a German and <hi>Amanuensis</hi> to the famous <hi>Erasmus)</hi> very neer an ICO years since, under this title, <hi>Litania veteris Ecclesiae, the Litany of the Ancient Church,</hi> presents us with a form precisely the same with ours, as then established by Act of Parliament.</p>

The reason given why these two dayes were chosen, is, because on the one, (Wednesday) <hi>Judas</hi> conspired to betray his Master, and our Saviour Christ; and on the other, (Friday) he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death upon the Crosse. And this is that which <note n="q" place="margin">Stromat. Lib. 7.</note>

all contenders, to decipher to us what this Ancient meant by stations, <hi>viz.</hi> dayes of humiliation, and the context of the place will not hear of any other construction, where pleading hard for <hi>Montanus</hi> against the Catholick Church in the point of Fasts, he appeals to her self, whether the Apostles did ever yoke her to any such observances, and whether the dayes she hath assigned for those intents, were not of her arbitrary choice: so that it being indisputably evident that the Father here intended dayes of humiliation, I cannot think it probable, though very learned men have so opined, that the word should be capable elsewhere in this Author of a sense diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, or that it should import dayes of the highest Festivity and rejoycing. For where he saith, <hi>Similiter de stationum Diebus, non putant plerique sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum orationibus interveniendum, quod statio solvenda sit accepto corpore Domini. Ergo devotum Deo obsequium Eucharistia resolvit, an magis obligat? nonne so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnior erit statio tua, si ad aram Dei steteris? Accepto corpore Domini &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servato utrumque salvum est, &amp; participatio beneficii, &amp; executio officii.</hi> 
                  <note n="t" place="margin">Tertul. de. Oration. c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>So also of dayes of Station, many think they must then forbear to come to the prayers of the sacrifices, because the station is to be dissolved by the receiving of the body of the Lord, what then doth the Eucharist countermand the duty due to God, doth it not rather oblige us to it? Shall not thy station be the more solemn, if performed before Gods Altar, the Body of our Lord being taken and reserved both are secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the participation of his blessed Son, and the discharge of the duty.</hi> Here I say some understand by <hi>Stations,</hi> those dayes, <hi>viz.</hi> All Sundayes of the year, and all the interval between Easter and Pentecost, on which, according to primitive custome, it was not permitted to kneel at prayers, and these dayes were noted as of singlar contrariety to Humiliation. The custom is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and so also is it that <hi>statio</hi> properly signifieth standing, but both these concessions will be improved no further, but onely to render their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation a specious fallacy. For, to my reading, <hi>statio</hi> is never by any Author of those early ages applied in reference to that custom: not in <hi>Tertullian</hi> I am certain, no, not withstanding his <hi>ad aram Dei steterts.</hi> For (not to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the absurdity of one word denoting in the same Author two things so contradictory, as fasting and feasting) <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us <hi>statio</hi> is of military extraction, <hi>de miluari exemplo nomen accipit; it borroweth its name from military example,</hi> if so, then not derived from the pretended custome of standing. Now the military mode was this, so many Souldiers were ordered to be upon the respctive guards, there were they to continue compleatly armed, and on horse-back ready to receive any impression of an assaulting enemy: in that posture were they to abide anciently from morning to night, until <note n="u" place="margin">Liv. l. 44. c. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Aemylius</hi> observing it to be to great a burthen both for horse and man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed these gards should at noon be relieved with fresh both men and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Now because, according to the martial discipline, none was permitted to depart the gard until the time presixt; Christians, who on the dayes of Humiliation tied themselves as strictly to Religious duty, did aptly enough impose upon those dayes the name of Stations. And this will conclude sufficiently for the figurative, against the proper sense of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Further to illustrate <hi>Tertullian,</hi> by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> elsewhere remonstrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the mischievous consequences of unequal yokes where a Christian woman marcheth with an Infidel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If a solemn fast must be observed, the husband may the same day make a feast,</hi> where <hi>statio</hi> must necessarily denote a day of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. For <hi>Tertullians</hi> designe is to shew that the Church and the Husband may be at crosse purposes, and to command things contrary to each other. And the Bath being, as the mode was then, applied to Luxury, was as opposite to humiliation as a feast to a fast, But here it seemes, say some, <hi>Tertullian</hi> did
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107079:61"/>
not consider both these under a real <hi>identity</hi> but as different things, for else one instance would have served. To which I answer, true it is <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth somewhat distinguish them, the difference being this, that stations signified the <hi>lesse,</hi> and <hi>jejunia,</hi> the more <hi>solemn fasts, these</hi> continued from morning to night, and <hi>they</hi> onely to the ninth hour or three in the after-noon, whence it is that <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls them in a scoff <note n="x" place="margin">de jajun. c. 13.</note>

               <p>Having thus, I hope, made a clear prospect into <hi>Tertullians</hi> dark minde in reference to these stations, the construction of the former passage is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile. <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas many were scrupulous of coming to the Eucharist upon wednesdayes and Fridays, lest the receiving of the Elements should prove a breaking of their Fasts, which were to be continued untill three in the after-noon, <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells them they were in the wrong, and that the Eucharist is so far from dissolving the duty of Fasting, as it makes the work more valuable in Gods sight. But if they would not credit him then, there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother expedient will salve both sores. <hi>viz.</hi> The taking of the Body, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it to be eaten at home <hi>ante omnem cibum, Fasting,</hi> as he in the same book doth hint, whereby neither the Fast will be interrupted, nor the other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty neglected.</p>

Indeed reason good our hearts should move our lungs and lips as readily to thank, as to supplicate him for his benefits: therefore whereas in our service book certain collects of prayers were framed applicable to cases of extraordinary visitations, it was noted as a great defect that set formes of thanksgiving were not also contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved relative to the same occasions in case the issues and dispensations of the Almighty proved answerable to our requests: And though it hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed by judicious Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> on our Churches behalf, that <hi>this were better provided for by select dayes assigned by supream authority for that duty, and by set formes agreeable thereunto, then by a small collect:</hi> That defence is in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but partly satisfactory. For calamities are most commonly not National, but sometimes Provinical, somtimes they quarter onely in one City, sometimes but in a petty village, and unlesse they spread to be Epidemical, they rarely reach the cognizance of the supream magistrate, or if they do, they will not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with them importance enough to perswade the indiction of dayes of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal either Humiliation or thanksgiving, for such minute mergencies: therefore, (not to defraud the reformation under king <hi>James</hi> of the honour it hath meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) the superadding of those relative Thanksgivings was not onely a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, but a necessary Act.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>First Sunday in Advent.]</hi> The first initiation of our Saviour into the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediator was his manifestation in the flesh, and incarnation; a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> thing promised all along, from the very fall of wretched man, untill as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle said <hi>the fulnesse of time was come.</hi> Gal. 4. 4. And the more remote from this time, the more obscure the prophesies, the neerer the more explicite. First, Gen. 3. <hi>the seed of the woman shall break the serpents head,</hi> go on to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Gen. 12. 3. <hi>In thy seed</hi> (declaring specificatively in whose) <hi>shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.</hi> Go on to David, <hi>of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy Throne,</hi> Psal. 132. 11. Proceed to Esay, the prophecy is more apodeictical, more demonstrative, <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and she shal call his name Emanuel.</hi> C. 7. v. 14. Go neerer to the approaching of this time, still more <hi>Ecce's, Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</hi> Luke 1. 31. And the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to her self. <hi>Behold from hence-forth all generations shall call me blessed,</hi> ib. v. 48. All this to keep up the hope of the long looked for <hi>Theophany,</hi> and the Messias his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the flesh. God himself having thus led in the Nativity of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, with such a train of anteceding predictions to assure man that he would come; the Christian Church thought it also expedient, that the day of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, that <hi>he is come,</hi> should be somewhat more then ordinarily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And upon this very account she hath assigned to this great festival the four Sundayes preceding, (the first beginning alwayes next before, or after, or on St. <hi>Andrews</hi> day) which are as it were one Christmas Eve, or, as so many heralds to proclaim the approaching of his feast, and are therefore called Advent Sundayes as fore-speaking Christs birth-day; and therefore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Author of the Nativity Sermon ascribed to <hi>Cyprian,</hi> begins it with, <hi>Adest diu expectata Nativitas</hi> i. e. <hi>the long-looked for Nativity which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected all this time of Advent, is come at length.</hi> And upon this account proper

                  <hi>Christmas day.</hi> This Anniversary solemnity cannot be denied to be as old <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> as up to <hi>Gregory Nazianzens</hi> time, he and his great intimate St. <hi>Rasil,</hi> having each an excellent Homily upon it, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith the other. <hi>We name this our Festival the Theophany.</hi> Nor is there in either Homily one syllable inferring the either usage or institution of that day to have commenced then, wherefore we may presume it was existant long before, indeed <hi>Nicephorus</hi> sadly tells us so, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating no lesse then twenty thousand Christians massacred by fire on that day, being assembled at Church under the <hi>Dioclesian</hi> persecution. A matter not incredible, for if it be true, as little doubt is to be made of it, what <hi>Gildas</hi> reports of us Brittains, that after that Persecution ceased, <hi>the Christians began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to repair their Churches and celebrated Festivals,</hi> Why should not this great day make one? what rational argument can be opposed to disswade us that we should not think it of as long duration as any other festival, (the Lords day excepted) whatsoever, considering that even Christianity it self result<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from it. In the determination of the precise and true day, <hi>Antiquity</hi> it self hath been to seek, as well as modern times. <note n="b" place="margin">Stromat. l. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> who florished about the end of the second Century, saith, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the most curious inquisitors after the year and day of Christs Nativity have fixt it, some, on the</hi> 25. <hi>of the moneth of Pachon,</hi> (our May,) <hi>and some on the</hi> 25. <hi>of Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouthi,</hi> (our April.) The <note n="c" place="margin">Cassian. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat. l. 1. c. 11.</note> Churches of <hi>Aegypt</hi> observed it constantly upon the 6. of <hi>January,</hi> celebrating both it, and his Baptism on the same day, which they called the <hi>Epiphany.</hi> The Asiatick <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Syrians</hi> turned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Baptism to another day, retaining still the 6. of <hi>January</hi> for his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pretending to a more perfect information from the <hi>Censual</hi> Rolls of <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> kept close to the 25. of <hi>December:</hi> from thence it was first transported to <hi>Antioch,</hi> as is evident from St. <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Homily preached there, upon that day, where he declareth the darknesse of incertainty wherein those Christians were in before, and from whence they were enlightened to the notion of the true day. Not long after, either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that this was the very day of Christs Nativity, or that none truer could be assigned, it became about <hi>Anno</hi> 500. the general observation of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Church. Since that, and neer home to our times an opinion hath possest some very learned men, that our Saviour was born in <hi>September,</hi> in such va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of judgements it is not safe dogmatically to determine one way, or the other. <note n="d" place="margin">Augustin.</note> 
                  <hi>Nihil opusest ut ea cum discrimine definiantur, quae absque crimine nesciuntur. What necessity is there of positively defining that, whereof it is no fault to be ignorant.</hi> And the best is, there is nothing in this particular cogent to it. The exact notion of the day precise, is no concernment of the Duty, which consists not in observing the day, but a day. God standeth not upon <hi>punctilio's</hi> with man, no, not in ceremonials of his own designation, wherein he dispenseth with the Churches liberty to vary, necessity or just occasion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting. The celebration of the blessed Eucharist is, by universal usage, <hi>mis-timed</hi> from its first institution, now in the morning, then at night. <hi>So</hi> is the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> beginning in the Apostles times at the <hi>Evening</hi> preceeding, with us at one in the <hi>morning:</hi> why may not then the memorial of our Saviours <hi>Nativity,</hi> be celebrated on a day varying from its true original, especially considering that it is not yet infallibly discovered which it is? And if so, why may we not, conforming to the practise of the Catholick <hi>Church,</hi> observe the 25. of <hi>December</hi> as our <hi>Church</hi> enjoyneth? To stand upon such niceties is but a peevish kinde of Devotion, meer superstition, and the next way to bring

               <p>And whereas we are upbraided with the practise of Reformed Churches, which have discontinued the solemnization of this day; not to repeat what I have instanced before out of the Churches of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> out of <hi>Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Zanchy,</hi> and to reach the very vitals of this objection, I must tell the opponents, that for <hi>Geneva,</hi> the place so urged against us, Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself blusheth at her Reformation, and is so concerned, so moved with the <note place="margin">Epist.

I can so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemly protest, that the Abrogation of this festival was transacted, without my knowledge, nay, against my wish.</hi> And again, <hi>Ex quo revocatus sum hoc tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum quaesivi, ut Christi Natalis celebraretur vestro more. From the very first of my return to this place, I endeavoured this moderation, that Christs Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day should be observed after your custom.</hi> If <hi>Calvins</hi> judgement, because single, will not be listened to, what say they to the very remarkable practise of the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> for which in other relations they have so high a friendship? <note n="f" place="margin">Sessio. 36. Dec. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Festum natalis Domini nostri Jesu Christi instabat, propter cujus celebrationem actiones Synodi, per aliquot jam dies interrumpendae essent. The Nativity of our Lord Jesus Christ was now at hand, in order to whose celebration, the actions of the Synod were, for some few dayes, to be interrupted:</hi> which was actually done, the Sesson being intermitted from Dec. the 22. to the 28. as appeareth by the acts of that Synod. And lest it should be thought this was done onely to complement our <hi>British</hi> Divines, I shall produce the warrant it self of its esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment from the very <note n="g" place="margin">Can. 63.</note> Canons of that Church. <hi>Ecclesiae observabunt, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Diem Dominicum, etiam diem Nativitatis Domini, Pascha item &amp; Pentecho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, cum die insequente; Et quoniam in plerisque urbibus, ac regionibus Belgiae insuper observantur festa Circumcisionis, ac Ascensionis Christi; allaborabunt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistri, quibuscunque locis id nondum est usu receptum, ut volente Magistratu, hac in parte reliquis accedant. The several Churches shall observe over and besides the Lords-day, the day also of Christs Nativity, Easter also and Whitsunday with the day following; And because in many places and Cities of Belgia, moreover the feasts of Christs Circumcision, and Ascersion, are celebrated also; The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster shall use his best endeavour, that the Magistrats consent first obtained, they, in such places where these dayes are not yet received into use, would conform to the practise of others.</hi> So this Canon, confirmed with the rest, by the Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Act of <hi>Dort Anno</hi> 1619. confirmed I say, by a ratification <hi>superinducted</hi> to a former establishment, as is evident by the Greek and Latine edition of those Canons set forth by <hi>Jacobus Revius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To be short, let our Adversaries be in their declamations against other festivals, as obstreperous and loud as they please; such clamours we can both hear, and pitty: but when they de-cry with so much noise this grand Festival, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that of our Saviours <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Ascension,</hi> and the descent of the <hi>holy Ghost;</hi> to our Christian charity they stand obliged, if we do not justly suspect, in good earnest, some designe dangerous even to Christianity it self, considering, that the main fundamentals of our faith have such direct and immediat reference to those feasts, and that the yearly celebration of them, is but a tacite <hi>Anniversary</hi> rehearsal of the chief Articles of our Creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>At the second Communion.]</hi> Some festival dayes in the Primitive Church were of higher repute then others. In the Greek Church the <hi>Nativity of Christ,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> the <hi>Epiphany, Easter, Ascension,</hi> and <hi>Pentecost,</hi> the Latine instead of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phany,</hi> advanced the passion day or <hi>good Friday.</hi> These dayes were called most commonly by the Eastern Fathers X <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>The Christian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyries,</hi> as a note of distinction from dayes of Lesser account, alluding to the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because the whole nation resorted to those solemnities, as at these feasts, the whole Diocesse did assemble, and this is the reason that in the Homilies of the ancient Fathers and Bishops, who usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached at their Cathedrals on these dayes, the Church is so often said to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>throng'd</hi> with the concourse of the people. This confluence of the multitude being so great when Christianity had once possest whole nations, few Churches could afford room convenient for so many to communicate at once; whereupon it was directed, <hi>ut cum solemnior festivitas conventum populi numerosioris indixerit quem simul recipere un a basilica non possit, sacrificii oblatio indubitanter iteretur, That when some high Festival summoneth too many for one Church at once to receive, then the celebration of the Sacrament to be without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther scruple repeated,</hi> whic practise continuing down to the reformation, and still preserved in the first Liturgy of Edw. 6. was discreetly omitted in the second, upon consideration that it was formerly the turn-key to let in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Masses, so frequent in the Romish Church.</p>

As for St. <hi>John,</hi> though there be no clear and expresse mention of his Festival in elder times, yet considering that all the Apostles had their set dayes assigned, he is in all reason to be supposed to have had his share of honour equal to the rest. As for <hi>Innocents</hi> day, that Homily upon Matth. 2. which if not <hi>Origens,</hi> is yet very Ancient, speaketh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, <hi>Horum &amp; memoria semper ut dignum est in Ecclesia celèbratur secundum inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum ordinem sanctorum, ut primorum martyrum pro Domino occisorum.

               </p>
               <p>This juncto of Festivals are not here placed as evidences of the times of the Death, or sufferings of those Persons. For if tradition faileth not, St. <hi>Stephen</hi> was stoned in <hi>August,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> died' on the feast of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi>

                  <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> and from him other Ritualists, why these feasts rather then others were ordered to accompany Christs nativity, assigneth this reason. There is, saith he, <hi>a threefold martyrdom; In will, and deed; In will, but not indeed;</hi> In deed, but not in wil. The first was undergone by <hi>St. Stephen,</hi> the second by <hi>St. John,</hi> the third by the <hi>Innocents;</hi> And who fitter to attend our Saviour then his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs? for if <hi>right-dear in the sight of the Lord is the death of all his Saints,</hi> then most precious certainly to him must the death of them be, who not onely die <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>for</hi> him. This reason of <hi>Durandus</hi> is founded upon the tradition, that <hi>St. John</hi> was miraculously preserved in a Chaldron of boyling Oyl, to which he was condemned at <hi>Rome:</hi> might I interpose mine own thoughts, I should rather conceive that <hi>St. Stephen</hi> had the first place, because he was the Proto-Martyr of Christianity, <hi>St. John</hi> the second, because his death falling upon the Festival of another <hi>John,</hi> the Baptist, and reason good they should be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with dayes apart; no day could be assigned to this <hi>John</hi> more proper, that he might be nigh his Master, he being <hi>the disciple whom Jesus loved.</hi> And the <hi>Innocents</hi> might well pretend to the third, because as <hi>St. Cyprian</hi> saith <note n="l" place="margin">Epist. l 4.

                  <hi>Ash-Wednesday and Lent.] Ash-Wednesday</hi> hath in antiquity two names. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, it is called <hi>Dies cinorum,</hi> in reference to the Penitents) whereof more under the title of <hi>Commination)</hi> who were this day sprinckled with <hi>Dust</hi> and <hi>Ashes.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Caput jejunii, the top of the Fast,</hi> or first day of <hi>Lent.</hi> Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it was by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, the occasion this, <hi>Lent,</hi> commencing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former mode on the Sunday after Quinquagessima, lasted six weeks or forty dayes: from these substract six Sundayes which were never to be fasted, there remained thirty six <hi>Lenten</hi> dayes, the just tenth of the year, abating the fraction of five dayes: for multiply 360 by 10 the quotient will be 36. so then, God by this observation received from the Christians a <hi>tenth</hi> as well of their time, as of their fruits, this was one designe of <hi>Lents</hi> original. Now St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> that the Churches practise might be more agreeable to the great exemplar of our Saviours 40. dayes (the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient observed by <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias)</hi> abstinence in the wildernesse, added these four dayes to compleat the number of 40. dayes. But though by this rule the Church conformed nigher to the pattern of our Saviour as to the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 40. yet in the appointment of that time she varied from his copy, Christ fasting immediatly after his baptisme, she fasting before Baptisme: and great reason had she so to do, there were in those dayes many persons adult, <hi>of full growth,</hi> who became converts to Christianity, and had besides origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, many actual sins to account for: these could not be cleansed by the water of Baptisme, unlesse they were first rinsed in the water of contrition, therefore to these repentance was as necessary a requisite before baptisme as faith for as St. <hi>Basil</hi> saith exellently <gap reason="foreign">

And not in this respect alone, but in several others, for at that great solemnity Penitents were to be restored to a neerer Communion with the faithful, did they shew any evident signes of Godly sorrow or contrition, which the Scleragogy, and hard treatment of so long a time of fasting and humiliation was most like to create. And as Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents were at that time to be reconciled to the faithful; so were the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then also more then ordinarily to be reconciled to God, <hi>Easter</hi> being the most solemn time alloted for the celebration of the Lords supper, whereof the Jewish Passeover was a Type.</p>

               <p>For the antiquity of the observation of this day, innumerable Authors might be produced, but in a matter not at all controverted it would edifie little. I shall therefore supersede from others, and content my self with a Reference to that known contest betwixt the Churches of the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> about it, whether it should be observed on the 14. of the first New-moon in <hi>March,</hi> as they of the <hi>East</hi> pretended, or on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> as the Western custom was, wherein both pleaded, and justly too, as I conceive, Apostolical tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Quarta decimani, or they who kept the fourteenth day,</hi> derived their practise from St. <hi>John,</hi> the other from St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The matter being adiapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, they of the <hi>Levant,</hi> the <hi>East,</hi> might in this, as they did in other things, condescend to the customs of the Jews their cohabitants, on designe to win upon them in higher matters. And the Western Churches more conversant with Gentiles, having not the same occasion, might rather make choice of the Lords day, it being the very day of Christs Resurrection, in memory whereof that feast was observed. That the celebration of this day was Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical is a truth as radient, as if it were written with the beams of the Sun, and needs no further demonstration then the consideration how early this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invaded the Church. The first news we hear of it, is, from <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> his journey to the Roman Bishop <hi>Anicetus Propter quasdam super die Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chae quaestiones, by reason of some questions raised about Easter-day.</hi> So <note n="k" place="margin">de Script.

So did not <hi>Victor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> a while after, for being a man composed of fire and tow, and inflamed with an Epistle of <hi>Policrates,</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to him: he grew so cholerick, that he renounced Communion with all <hi>Asia</hi> upon that sole account; for which <hi>Irene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> of <hi>Victors</hi> perswasion; not of his Spirit, sent him a sound rattle.

                  <hi>The fift Sunday after Easter.]</hi> This Sunday is called <hi>Rogation</hi> Sunday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> it precedeth the three dayes of <hi>Rogation</hi> before Ascension day. These three fast-dayes were first instituted by <hi>Mamercus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of a great earth-quake, and incursion of wolves, and wilde beasts, to the extream tetrour of the people. He knowing no better expedient to divert so severe a chastisment, then fasting and humiliation, ordered these dayes for that intent, and contrived a Litany apt and sutable for such humble addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. This pious course taking good effect, succeeding times continued that Fast in their Anniversary practise, so as the <note n="d" place="margin">Can. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Councel of Aurelia</hi> established it by a decree. Which custom having had so long footing in the Church, our Reformers were loth to be singular in rescinding it, and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she observed it fell casually and beyond its first intention, upon such a season as might be very agreable to the service of those dayes. For this being that critical time of the year when all the fruits of the earth are in greatest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of miscarrying, by frosts and unseasonable weather, it is therefore exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper to supplicate God for the withholding of his judgments, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his blessing upon the labours of the husband-man. And although our Liturgy hath no set office, yet hath our Church set homilies for it. And in the injunctions <hi>Anno</hi> 1559. and Advertisments <hi>Anno</hi> 7. Eliz. it was ordered, <hi>that in the Rogation dayes of procession, the Curat sing or say in English the two</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ascension Day.]</hi> I do not meet in any of the Fathers, before St. <hi>Augustines</hi> time, mention of this as of an Holy day, yet doubtless it was of as ancient <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> standing as the other four Dominical Days, for <note n="e" place="margin">Epist. 118.</note> 
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> reckons it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those days which <hi>toto terrarum orbe observantur, now observed all over the world, and which are supposed to have been instituted by the Apostles themselves, or General Councels.</hi> A little after St. <hi>Augustine, Proclus,</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> enumerating the five grand Festivals, maketh this the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <gap reason="foreign">

To apply what hath now been said to my present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it may very rationally be supposed, that those seven Weeks being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the single denomination of one Festival, what other days of sacred account did chance to happen within that time, were the less distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or considered otherwise then as parcels of the great solemnity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whitsunday.]</hi> This day is called <hi>Pentecost,</hi> being the fiftieth day from <hi>Easter.</hi> A day observed by the very Apostles themselves, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 1. And all the reason <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> in the world it should be celebrated as one of the highest Festivals; it was the day whereon the Law was given on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> called therefore <hi>the Feast of the Law,</hi> and the day whereon the Gospel was given in <hi>Sion,</hi> by the descent of the holy Ghost; and therefore venerable upon either account; but most ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable upon the last: This day was in the Jewish practice one of their great Panegyries or Generals, as I may call them, to which there was an universal confluence from all nations; and in the like maner was it observed by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, as a great Rendezvouz for persons resorting to be Baptized: This day is called Whitsunday by reason, say some of the White Garments then put on by them who were at this time Baptized, the probability whereof, as I cannot absolutely deny, so it may be free for me to offer mine own conjecture, differing from it, and then I would rather derive it from the French word <hi>huict,</hi> which signifieth <hi>eight,</hi> and then <hi>Whitsunday</hi> will be <hi>huict Sunday,</hi> the eighth Sunday accounting from <hi>Easter,</hi> which all men will yield to be the first; and that this conceit may pass the better, let me further it not onely with an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from the consonancy of the words <hi>huict</hi> and <hi>whit,</hi> which sound exactly like, but also from another word of the same denomination, used in our Law, I mean <hi>ut as,</hi> which is no more but the <hi>huictas,</hi> in Latine, the <hi>Octavo</hi> of the anteceding Feast.</p>
               <p>This Week was not intirely a Festival, like that of Easter, <note n="i" place="margin">Concil. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundense. c. 2.</note> the Wednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, Thursday and Friday being observed as Fasts, and days of Humiliation

               <p>Having thus done my respects to the Festivals, Dominical especially, &amp; of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est remark, they which follow not affording any thing of extraordinary note, I pass to the holy days of an inferior order, whereof very few will fall under consideration, in regard antiquity hath transmitted to us so little, specifically relating to them.</p>

                  <hi>St. Andrews day.]</hi> This Apostle leads the van in the Rubrick of our Saints, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="W"/> some conceive because he <hi>first came to Christ, and followed him before any of the other Apostles,</hi> John 1. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Reason good he should have that honor, were this infallibly certain, whereof the Scripture gives slender assurance, for the words of the Evangelist are <hi>[the two Disciples heard him speak, and they followed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus]</hi> so that there were two Disciples, one of them indeed was <hi>Andrew,</hi> but he being mentioned joyntly with the other (who most probably was St. <hi>John</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) Priority and Posteriority, cannot be admitted: <hi>Andrew,</hi> true it is, first revealed the <hi>Messias</hi> to his Brother <hi>Simon,</hi> yet this no argument that he came the first of Apostles unto Christ: And where it is said that these two Disciples followed Christ, yet is it not thence inferrible that they followed Christ as Disciples, but out of curiosity; for clear it is, they continued still in their vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, until they had their call, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 18. as is evidently demonstrated by the learned <hi>Annotator</hi> on that Place, and by Mr. <hi>Casaubon</hi> before him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Conversion of Paul.]</hi> This posthume Apostle, though he came late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christs Livery, yet gives us this account of his service, that he toiled, sweat, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> and <hi>labored more,</hi> in Christs vineyard, <hi>then all the rest,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath gained the reputation to be understood, when we think fit to say no more then <hi>the Apostle;</hi> and if such an eminent Saint should not be assigned a room amongst his fellow Apostles in the Memorials of the Church, it may to any seem a wonder; yet, in part, so hath it come to pass: for though he hath in the service of our Church as much respect as the best of them, yet both in the Kalendar and Catalogue, he seems with his companion <hi>Barnabas</hi> to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. The truth is, I do not observe so high a value set upon him by the Romish Church, as his labor hath merited; for in the Roman Order, where the Letany gives the names of all the other Apostles, and Canonized Saints, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly St: <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> are missing in that <hi>nomenclature:</hi> in their ancient Kalendars indeed, and in that prefixt to King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths Primer, though his conversion be not dignified with a Rubrick Note, yet is he yoked with St. <hi>Peter</hi> on the twenty ninth of <hi>June,</hi> that day bearing the Dedication of <hi>St. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>St. Paul;</hi> upon which consideration, perhaps our Reformers forbare the allotting him any other day peculiar to himself.</p>

For the Morning Prayer and Communion were not continued as one intire Service, but abrupt, broken off, and distinct, each of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice from the other, by these words, <hi>Thus endeth the Order of Morning and Evening Prayer:</hi> This was done, that the Holy-day Service might be separated from the Weekly. Whether or not the Congregation departed hence upon Sundays and Holy-days after the end of Morning Prayer, and returned again to the Communion Service, I will not positively determine, I rather think not: Because the Authors of the Admonition, whose captious curiosity nothing could escape which seemed to promove their beloved quarrel, have these words, <hi>We speak not of ringing when Mattins is done,</hi> which could not administer the least shew of blame, had it been done in absence of the Assembly, or had not the Congregation been then religiously imployed: For this Bell was usually rung in the time of the second service, <hi>viz.</hi> the Litany, to give notice to the People, <hi>not that the Communion Service,</hi> as hath been supposed, but <hi>that the Sermon</hi> was then coming on. <hi>All Ringing and Knowling of Bells, in the time of the Letany, high Mass, &amp;c.</hi> was interdicted by the Injunctions of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Except one Bell in convenient time to be rung before the Sermon:</hi> In reference to the Sermon onely it was rung, called therefore the <hi>Sermon Bell,</hi> so that when there was to be no Sermon, the Bell was not rung;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107079:90"/>
and Sermons were rare, very rare in those days, in some places but once a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and perhaps not then, had not Authority strictly enjoyned them; which usage of Sermon Bells hath been practiced, and is still, if I mistake not, in some parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> I am sure, or the Reverend <note n="a" place="margin">B. <hi>Cooper</hi> his seventh days confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> deceives me: Having persued his Narrative through all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of that Churches first Service, at length he adds, <hi>[You hear the third Bell ringing, and in this space the Reader ceaseth, and at the end of the Bell ringing, the Preacher will come.]</hi> There being then, as I have said, so apparent and visible a breach between the first and second Service, the Morning Office, and the Letany, it is very probable, though the Assembly did not dissolve, yet was there such a ceasing and rest from sacred Imployments, as might give the Curat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>And if any of them be an open and notorious evil liver, &amp;c.] Notorium</hi> amongst the Civilians and Canonists, is threefold. First, there is <hi>Notorium Praesumptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                  <hi>a notoriousness of Presumption,</hi> where <hi>Evidentia rei est evidenter à Jure prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumta, The evidence of the thing is taken for evident, by presumption of Law.</hi> As where it presumeth one to be the Son of such a man, because he was born in Wedlock. Secondly, There is <hi>Notorium Juris, a notoriousness of Law,</hi> when the offence is proved either <hi>per confessionem factam in Jure, by confession made in open Court,</hi> or <hi>per Sententiam Judicis, by the Sentence of the Judge.</hi> Lastly, There is <hi>Notorium facti, a notoriousness of Fact,</hi> when <hi>per evidentiam rei nulla potest tergiversations celari. The evidence is so clear, as the Accusation can by no shifts be avoided.</hi> Now to which of these three the term <hi>Notorious</hi> in this Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick relateth, is a great question: The learned Prelate, Bishop <note n="b" place="margin">Notes upon the Common Prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>Andrews,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth it positively to the second: <hi>Our Law of</hi> England, saith he, <hi>will not suffer the Minister to judge any Man a notorious Offender, but him who is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by some legal Sentence:</hi> The Law of <hi>England</hi> will not suffer it, so that should the Ecclesiastical permit it, the Municipal Law would not, and if it comes to an Antinomy, a justle between the Canon Laws of our Church, and the Law of the Land, this it is must over-rule. But doth our Canon Law give any such toleration? doth it impower any Minister to exclude his Parishioner, (claiming his Christian priviledge in those blessed Mysteries) from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to make his private discretion the supream Judge of the Notoriousness here mentioned? certainly no. As for the 26 and 27 <hi>Canons,</hi> which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the contrary, they neither speak explicitly enough, nor do they suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently direct in this Affair: The Canon wherein our Church declareth her minde more articulately, is the 109. <hi>If any offend their Brethren, either by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Whoredom, Incest, or Drunkenness, or by Swearing, Ribaldry, Usury, or any other uncleanness and wickedness of life, the Church Wardens, or Quest-men and Side-men, in their next Presentment to their Ordinaries, shall faithfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent all and every of the said Offenders, to the intent that they and every of them may be punished by the severity of the Laws, according to their deserts, and such notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offenders shall not be admitted to the Communion, till they be reformed;</hi> where I note, First, the Crime must be scandalous, <hi>an Offence to the Brethren.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it must be <hi>presented to the Ordinary.</hi> Thirdly, That such scandalous Offenders, so presented to the Ordinary, <hi>are not to be admitted to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But some perhaps will say this was one of the failings of an ill regulated State and Church, which justly called for a Reformation, and so indeed it was pretended by Dr. <hi>Burgess</hi> and Mr. <hi>White</hi> of <hi>Dorchester,</hi> at a Committee sitting in the Lords House, in <hi>March</hi> 1641. But, upon a full debate, it was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at that Committee, to the very conviction of the Opponents, that <hi>open</hi> and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:107079:91"/>
                  <hi>notorious evil-livers,</hi> were none but such as the Laws had adjudged to be so: Agreeable to this determination did the Parliament afterwards ordain, <note n="c" place="margin">Ordinance <hi>Oct.</hi> 20. 1645.</note> That no person be suspended from the Communion for any matter of scandal, but, <hi>either upon his confession before the Eldership to have committed such an offence, or upon the testimony of two Witnesses at least, and those examined upon oath:</hi> So was it ordained by this Parliament, sufficiently Presbyterian, against the liking of an Assembly of Presbyters, which did <hi>Enixins Dogmatis &amp; Argumentis in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, nec semel, sed frustra, contendere; vehemently, though all to little purpose, (more then once) oppose it with all the Arguments they could,</hi> as <note n="d" place="margin">

My temporal Estate no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person can deprive me of, until it be legally evicted from me by course of Law, and shall it be in the power of any mortal man to divest me of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in that blessed Banquet, before I be adjudged to have forfeited it upon fair hearing? what were this, but to expose Christians to the infirmities, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and somewhat else, <hi>quod dicere nolo,</hi> of their spiritual Pastors?</p>

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>thee, leave thy gift before the Altar, and go first and be reconciled to thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> which is very rationally thought by learned men to be the Institution of an Evangelical Ordinance, because it was not commanded under the Law to such as were to present their Oblations, and it is not like that Christ would su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce any new establishment to former Rights, when the ceremonial Law was expiring; concurrent with the Masters Precept, is the order of his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18. <hi>When ye come together in the Church, I hear that</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107079:91"/>
                  <hi>there be divisions among you.</hi> What these divisions were he tells them in the 21. verse, viz. that <hi>when they came to their Love-feasts,</hi> wherewith this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was joyned, and which were instituted for the preservation of Christian fellowship, and levelling of all, not onely <hi>animosities,</hi> but high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts; this notwithstanding, the rich, who brought plenty, presuming he might be master of what he offered, either fell to apart, or with some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and choice friends of his own exceedings fed liberally, while the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had not wherewith to stay his stomack; which inferred a disdain not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the designe of that charitable collation: upon these proceedings, the Apostle being to pronounce his judgement, he assures them they are much in the wrong, and that this is not to eat the Lords Supper <hi>i. e.</hi> that this practise and the Communion are two, inconsistent and incompatible one with the other. Charity being so essentially requisite to the right participation of the Sacrament, as it hath imposed denomination to it. It being called <hi>the Communion,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 16. why so, he tells us in the next verse <hi>[for thereby we being many are one Bread and one body, for we are all partakers of that one Bread.]</hi> Now there cannot possibly be union, where there is not charity, the breach of this grace being the same in the spiritual Body of the Church, that a wound is in the natural, <hi>Solutio continui,</hi> a rupture of the part intire. And in Symbolical reference to this, it may be here aptly hinted that in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church for certain, and probably in the Apostolick, they used in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of this Sacrament to have but one loaf, and one cup for the whole Congregation, to which in all likelihood <note n="f" place="margin">Ignatiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>difying to a <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent people.</hi> That so many, so much interested and concerned in those sacred offices, should not be totally excluded, as idle spectators, or fit for nothing but, now and then, to return an <hi>Amen</hi> to they knew not what, this expedient was devised. The people were exhorted to joyn in prayers, according to certain heads, dictated to them by the Minister in the English tongue, observing the method and materials of the then Prayer <hi>for all States,</hi> so that of all the service then used, this onely could properly be called <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> as being the onely form, wherein the whole Congregation did joyn in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort, and therefore the title of it in the Injunctions of Edw. 6. <hi>Anno</hi> 1547. is. <hi>The form of bidding the Common-prayers.</hi> Now because it was made by <hi>Allocution,</hi> or speaking to the people, agreeing with what the Primitive Church called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it was called <hi>Bidding of prayers.</hi> Thus in short, as to the ground of this ancient form: will you now see the form it self? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it here.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After a laudable custom of our Mother holy Church, ye shall kneel down, moving your hearts unto Almighty God, and making your special pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the three Estates, concerning all Christian people,</hi> i. e. <hi>for the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, the Temporalty, and the soules being in the paines of</hi> Purgatory. <hi>First for our holy Father the</hi> Pope <hi>with all his Cardinals: for all Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, and in special for my Lord Arch-Bishop of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>your Metropolitan, and also for my Lord Bishop of this Diocesse; and in general for all Parsons, Vicars, and Parish Priests having cure of souls, with the Ministers of Christs Church, as well Religious as not Religious, Secondly, ye shall pray for the unity and peace of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Realms, and especially for the Noble Realm of England, for our Sovereign Lord the</hi> King <hi>&amp;c. and for all the Lords of the Councel, and all other of the Nobility which dwell in the Countries, having protection and governance of the same. That Almighty God may send them grace, so to govern and rule the Land, that it may be pleasing unto Almighty God, wealth and profit to the Land, and salvation to their souls. Also ye shall pray for all those that have honoured the Church with light, lamp, vestment, or Bell, or with any other ornaments, by which the service of Almighty God is the better maintained and kept. Furthermore ye shall pray for all true travellers and tillers of the earth, that truely and duely done their duty to God and holy Church, as they be bound to do. Also ye shall pray for all manner of fruits that be done upon the ground, or shall be, that Almighty God of his great pitty and mercy may send such wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, that they may come to the sustenance of man. Ye shall pray also for all those that be in debt or deadly sin, that Almighty God may give them grace to come out thereof, and the sooner by our prayer. Also ye shall pray for all those that be sick or diseased, either in body or in soul, that the Almighty would send them the thing that is most profitable as well bodily as ghostly. Also ye shall pray for all</hi> Pilgrims, <hi>and</hi> Palmers, <hi>that have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the way to</hi> Rome, <hi>to saint</hi> James <hi>of Jerusalem, or to any other place: that Almighty God may give them grace to go safe, and to come safe, and give us grace to have part of their prayers, and they part of ours. Also ye shall pray for the holy Crosse, that is in possession and hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightful people: that God Almighty may send it into the hands of Christian</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:107079:95"/>
                  <hi>people, when it pleaseth him. Furthermore I commit unto your devout prayers, all women that be in our Ladies bonds: that Almighty God may send them grace, the child to receive the Sacrament of Baptisme, and the mother purification. Also ye shall pray for the good man and woman, that this day giveth bread to make the holy-loaf, and for all those that first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it, and them that longest continue. For these and for all true Christian people every man and woman say a</hi> Pater Noster <hi>and an</hi> Ave <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this followeth a Prayer <hi>for all Christian Souls,</hi> reckoning first Arch-Bishops, and Bishops, and especially Bishops of the Diocess, then for all Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then for all Kings and Queens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then for all Benefactors to the Church, then for the Souls in Purgatory, especially for the Soul of <hi>N.</hi> whose Anniversary then is kept.</p>
               <p>This was the form preceding the Reformation of it, made by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: This King having once ejected the Popes usurped Authority, used all possible Artifice to keep possession of his new-gained Power: That by the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lergy in Convocation, that by Act of Parliament he was recognized <note n="k" place="margin">Chap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Supream Head of the Church of</hi> England, he thought it not enough: But further ordered, <hi>the Popes name to be utterly rased out,</hi> (so are the words of the Proclamation) <hi>of all Prayers, Orisons, Rubrioks, Canons of Mass Books, and all other Books in the Churches, and his memory never more to be remembred, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to his contumely and reproach:</hi> Accordingly also he caused this Form to be amended, by omitting the Popes name, with all his Relations, by annexing the title of <hi>Supream head</hi> to himself, and by contracting it into a narrower mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. But though this King corrected so much as served his own turn, yet all the Popery of this form he did not reform, but left the Prayer of the Dead re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining. As for King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, the form enjoyned by him, was the same precisely with that of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth: That of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, for the better, from both these; <hi>Praying for,</hi> being changed into, <hi>Praysing God for the dead;</hi> and with her form agreeth that in the 55 Canon of our Church, almost to a syllable</p>
               <p>Before all Sermons, Lectures, and Homilies, Preachers and Ministers shall move the People to joyn with them in Prayer in this form, or to this effect, as briefly as conveniently they may. Ye shall pray for Christs holy Catholick Church, that is, for the whole Congregation of Christian People dispersed throughout the whole world, and especially for the Churches of England, Scotland and Ireland. And herein I require you most especially to pray for the Kings most excellent Majesty our Soveraign Lord <hi>James,</hi> King of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, Scotland, France and Ireland, Defendor of the Faith, and Supreme Governour in these his Realms, and all other his Dominions and Countries, over all persons, in all causes aswell Ecclesiastical as Temporal. Ye shall also pray for our gracious Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> the Noble Prince <hi>Charles, Frederick</hi> Prince Elector Palatine, and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife. Ye shall also pray for the Ministers of Gods holy word and Sacraments, aswel Arch-Bishops and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as other Pastours and Curates. Ye shall also pray for the Kings most honourable Councel, and for all the Nobility and Magistrates of this Realm, that all and every of these in their several Callings, may serve truely and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the glory of God, and the edifying and well governing of his people, remembring the account that they must make. Also ye shall pray for the whole Commons of this Realm, that they may live in true Faith and Fear of God, in humble obedience to the King, and brotherly charity one to another. Finally, let us praise God for all those which are departed out of this life in the Faith of Christ, and pray unto God that we may have grace to direct our
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107079:95"/>
lives after their good example: that this life ended, We may be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with them of the glorious Resurrection in the life Everlasting. Alwayes concluding with the Lords prayer.</p>
               <p>Having beheld the Reformation of the form, it will not be amisse to look into the practise. This upon my best inquiry, all along, the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is exhibited by onely six Authors. Two Arch-Bishops, <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Sands:</hi> Four Bishops, <hi>Gardner Latimer, Jewel</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews.</hi> In all these I observe it interveneth betwixt the Text delivered and the Sermon, Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker</hi> onely excepted, who concludeth his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with it. I observe also in them all, that it is terminated in the Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> for which reason it was stiled <hi>Bidding</hi> of <hi>Beades, Beads</hi> and <hi>Pater Nosters</hi> being then relatives. Lastly, I observe in every of them some variation, more or lesse, as occasion is administred, not onely from the precise words, but even contents of this form. And from hence I infer that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions both of Edw. the 6. and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> being framed before any reformed Liturgie was by Law established, did not bind Preachers so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the precise words of that form when the service was rendred in <hi>English,</hi> as when in <hi>Latin,</hi> for it is not presumable those eminent men would have assumed such a liberty to vary the expression and enlarge in some other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, had not they understood the Churches dispensation therein. But there were afterward some overforward to abuse this Liberty, and minding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of their owne Principles, took the boldnesse to omit the main <note n="l" place="margin">Conference at Hampt. Court 2, day.</note> 
                  <hi>who could be content to pray for James King of England, France and Ireland, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the faith, but as for supreme Governor in all causes and over all Persons (as well Ecclesiastcal as Civil) they passed that over in silence,</hi> as that very King hath it, who thereupon re-inforced the form by the Canon afore specified. As for the late practical change of Exhortation <hi>Let us pray,</hi> into Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>we pray.</hi> In my weak apprehension it is but the very same in effect and operation, and neither to be justly quarrelled at, especially when the Lords Prayer (which <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, summarily comprehendeth all we can ask, is the close to both.</p>
               <p>Having discoursed the practise of our own Church, it will not be amisse to examine that of the Primitive Church, and the rather because many have been of that opinion that no prayer before the Sermon was used in those times.

               <p>In the Apostolical age the extraordinary <hi>effluvium,</hi> and outgoing of Gods spirit governed all, both in Prayer and Preaching: nothing was premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but all performed as the spirit at that instant suggested, according to the measure of their gifts, and for trial of those gifts, it was permitted by the Apostle for the faithful at their holy meetings, to speak, prophesy, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one after another. <hi>For ye may,</hi> saith he, <hi>all prophecy one by one that all may learn and all may exhort.</hi> Nor was this custome peculiar only to the Apostolick Church, but derived lower to succeeding times.

               <p>As for the materials of the Primitive Homilies, it is rare to finde any thing polemick in them, and where it occurreth, the controversy is about matters fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental: Faith and the principles of an holy life are the main they incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, declining nice, thorny and inedifying disputes.

                  <hi>Leodecea,</hi> I shall first give you the <hi>Canon</hi> it selfintire, and then parcel it out into considerations apart: the Canon is this. <gap reason="foreign">

In these words I observe, First, that these prayers were to be <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, apart, and every one by it self. Secondly, that the prayers for the Catechumens began the service, which is demonstrable out of <note n="p" place="margin">I. 1. c. 5. &amp; 6</note> 
                  <hi>Clemens</hi> Constitutions, where it is ordered, that before this prayer, the Deacon standing upon some place or advantage, should proclaim <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, whether the prayer of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chumens</hi> for themselves, or that of the faithful for them, I am not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But assuredly both they had, and if not the very same here inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet of neer alliance to it, as is to be found in <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> second of his seven genuine Homilies (for the rest are meer Impostures) upon the second to the Corinthians. And these Prayers of St <hi>Chrysostome</hi> agree almost word for word with the form mentioned in <hi>Clemens</hi> his <hi>Constitutions,</hi> which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent peece, though I dare not father it upon so early an Author, and must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the <hi>Legerdemain</hi> and traces of some false hand are visible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in some parts thereof, yet am I convinced that it conteineth many considerable monuments of the most ancient customs, and that the genuine part of it may worthily derive it self from the first three Centuries after Christ. The prayers cited in <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> are to this effect. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> &amp;c. i e. <hi>[The Deacon pronounceth, Let us stand up with reverence, Let us pray earnestly for the Catechumens. That the most merciful God would hear their prayers, would open the eyes of their hearts that they may hear such things as the eye never saw, the ear never heard, nor can it enter into the heart of man to conceive. That he would instil into them the word of truth, would sow his fear in them, and establish his faith in their minds. That he would reveal unto them the Gospel of righteousnesse, and give them a minde divinely inspired, a prudent understanding, and a virtuous conversation, alwayes to minde, alwayes to regard what belongs to him, and to mediate upon his Law day and night. Let us pray yet more ardently for them. That God would deliver them from whatsoever is vile or inconvenient, from all diabolical works, and the circumventions of the Adversary. That he would at length in due time bring them to the Laver of Regeneration, and remission of sins. That he would all along their whole lives, blesse their goings out and comings in, their houses, and families; That he would adde increase to them, and instruct them until they come to a perfect stature of wisdom. And that he would direct all their purposes to their own benefit.]</hi> This said, the Deacon commands them to rise, having laid prostrate all along be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and bids them also pray for themselves, he dictating to them thus.] <hi>Pray to God, ye Catechumens, for his Angel of peace, that all your purposes may have a peaceable effect, that this day and all the rest of your lives, may end in Peace; Pray especially, which is profitable and becoming, and the chief of all blessings, that you may be made perfect Christians, and so commend your selves to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting God, and Jesus Christ.]</hi> After this they are commanded to bow down their heads, to receive the blessing, all the Congregation crying aloud <hi>Amen.</hi> These prayers being so declarative of the Antient formes in this particular, I could not well contract into fewer words without prejudice to my present purpose.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from this Canon (for to that I must return) I further collect, that these Catechumens (their prayers and blessings once past) were to depart the Assembly. But did the Communion service Commence upon their dispatch?
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107079:97"/>
This Canon sayes clearly, no, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: <hi>after they were sent away,</hi> the penitents turn was next, and so the Communion service not to begin until they were dismist also, wherein there is an evident diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity between the Greek Church, as it was now, and as it was in <hi>Gregory Neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caesariensis</hi> his time, as shall be demonstrated when I come to the Office of Commination. But a far greater between it and the Latine. For, with these two mentioned here, I observe no lesse then three dismissions in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church before the celebration of the Eucharist, whereas the <hi>Latines</hi> had but one. The first was, as I cited out of <hi>Clemens,</hi> that of the Infidels and Hearers, and I conceive it was consequent to their exclusion, what <note n="q" place="margin">Chrisost. advers.

                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells us of the Deacon thundring out <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> i. e. <hi>look well to your selves,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Least any Infidels, Jews or strangers to your Religion, be among you,</hi> now <hi>Catechumens</hi> were not properly either <hi>Hearers</hi> or <hi>Infidels;</hi> not <hi>Hearers,</hi> as shall be demonstrated afterwards, not <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> because they were Catechised and instructed in the principles of the true Religion, and so were moving towards Christianity: upon which very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, in the Latine service, they were considered single and apart from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.

The third that of the <hi>Penitents,</hi> and at their sending away, I conceive, it was that the Deacon usually cryed out, <note n="s" place="margin">Chrysost. in Hebr.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>you that pray the first prayer depart.</hi> But <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the first prayer</hi> cannot in that place signifie that <hi>for all states.</hi> For in that very Chapter after these words, follow the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent order of the Communion service, and towards the latter end of it the prayer for all states, so that this dismission must be dispatched before the Prayer <hi>for all States.</hi> Yet true it is according to the Primitive Rules, no man of the faithful people might stay behinde and not communicate upon pain of Excommunication, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, saith the Apostolical Canon. <hi>Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Faithful man that comes into the Church and continueth not in prayer and participation of the blessed mysteries, be excommunicated.</hi> And to the same effect is the Second Canon of the Councel of <hi>Antioch.</hi> This notwithstanding, for matter of fact, clear it is, all did not conform, St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> reproving some upon that very score <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>why stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou behinde, and dost not communicate?</hi> But as for persons who were in <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, and serving out the last years of their Ecclesiastial censure, these were permitted to remain with the faithful, as shall be made evident, when I come to discourse of them in the Commination office.</p>
               <p>Now (that I may declare the difference I mentioned before) for those three dismissions, the Latine Church had onely one, called <hi>missa Catechumenorum, The Dismission of the Catechumens,</hi> not because she had not those several sorts of <hi>Hearers, Penitents, and Energumens:</hi> but because the Catechumens were far more numerous, and so their dismission gave denomination to all.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is to be noted that of these prayers, the first was <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, as they usually called it, <hi>in a lower voice,</hi> or by the faithful praying to themselves, and so <hi>Clemens</hi> gives the rule for this very Prayer. The Hearer and unbeleevers being sent away, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> i. e. the second oblation, which is the next thing offereth it self in our service, and is called the Offertory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Offertory.</hi>] The whole action of the sacred Communion is elemented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> of nothing but sacrifices and oblations. So in our Church, so in the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which should be the grand examplar to all; and though our Church varieth somewhat in the mode, from the first original, yet in the Substance, her practice is conformable. These sacrifices and oblations we may cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four partitions, and finde them all in the primitive, and in our own service. I shall name them all, but insist onely upon the first, as incident to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose. The first is the bringing of our gifts to the Altar, that is, the species and elements of the sacred symbols, and withal some overplus accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our abilities, for relief of the poor. And this elemosinary offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a sacrifice, so called, <hi>Phillip.</hi> 4. 18. and <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13. 16. and declared to be <hi>well pleasing to God; pleasing to God,</hi> though extended to the poor: these have a warrant of Atturney from God himself to receive our Almes. <hi>He that hath</hi>

                  <hi>pitty on the poor lendeth to the Lord. Prov.</hi> 19. 17. So that when we come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>Break bread,</hi> in the Scripture notion, that is, to communicate, we must break it to the hungry, to God himself in his poor members, as ever we expect a share in that last <hi>venice, Come ye blessed</hi> &amp;c. These acts of mercy being onely set down as the reason of that <hi>venite, Come ye blessed &amp;c. for I was an hungry, and ye gave me to eat &amp;c.</hi> Matth. 25. 35.</p>
               <p>The second sacrifice is the Consecration of the Elements, and presenting them up to God by the Prayers of the Minister and Congr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The third is the sacrifice of prayers, and prayers unto God which are stiled sacrifices. Psal. 50. 23. and 141. 2 Heb. 5, 7. &amp; 13. 15.</p>
               <p>The fourth is the Oblation <hi>of our selves, of our souls, and bodies</hi>

Now to restrain my discourse, as I promised, to the sacrifice of <hi>Almes-deeds,</hi> it will be necessary to take notice of the Apostolick and primitive practise in this concerment, and thereby to observe the agreeablenesse of our own Rule with it. First then we are not ignorant, I hope, that the Apostolick custom of communicating was at their <hi>Agape's</hi> and <hi>Love-feasts.</hi> These feasts were a joynt and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral collation of all the Assembly, every man contributing, <gap reason="foreign">

For upon this very account, consideration being anciently had to the great harvest such Oblations did then in some parts annually import, some livings were estimated in the Kings Books at a rate so high, as now those wonted oblations are withdrawn, amount to the utmost value of them, to the great grievance of the incumbent, who is to answer his first fruits and other payments to the Exchequer at that great proportion.

It is an easie matter for a man to say, I will not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, because I am otherwise letted with worldly businesse: but such excuses be not so easily accepted and allowed before God. It any man say, I am a gr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When you should return to God, will you excuse your self and say that you be not ready? Consider earnestly with your selves, how little such feigned excuses shall avail before God.

I for my part am here present, and according to mine office, I bid you in the name of God, I call you in Christs behalf, I exhort you as you love your own salvation, that ye will be partakers of this holy Communion, And as the son of God did vouchsafe to yeeld up his soul by death upon the crosse for your health; even so it is your duty to receive the Communion together in the remembrance of his death, as be himself commanded. Now if you will in no wise thus do, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with your selves how great injury you do unto God, and how sore punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hangeth over your heads for the same. And whereas you offended God so sore in refusing this holy banquet, I admonish, exhort, and beseech you, that
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107079:102"/>
unto this unkindnesse ye will not adde any more: Which thing ye shall do, if ye stand by as gazers and lookers on them that do communicate, and be no partakers of the same your selves. For what thing can this be accounted els, then a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contempt and unkindnesse unto God: Truely it is a great unthankfulnesse to say nay when ye be called: but the fault is much greater, when men stand by, and yet will neither eat nor drink this holy Communion with other. I pray you what can this be else, but even to have the misteries of Christ in derision? It is said unto all, Take ye, and eat, take and drink ye all of this, Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. With what face then, or with what countenance shall ye hear these words? what will this be else, but a neglecting, a despising, and mocking of the Testament of Christ? Wherefore rather then ye should so do depart you hence, and give place to them that be godly disposed. But when you depart, I beseech you ponder with your selves from whom you depart: Ye depart from the Lords table, ye depart from your brethren, and from the banquet of most heavenly food. These things if ye earnestly consider, ye shall by Gods grace return to a better minde, for the obtaining whereof, we shall make our humble petitions, while we shall receive the holy Communion.</p>

               <p>DEarly beloved in the Lord, ye that minde to come to the holy communion of the body and blood of our Saviour Christ, must consider what Saint Paul writeth to the Corinthians, how he exhorteth all persons piligently to try and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themselves, before they presume to eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For as the benefit is great, if with a true penitent heart and lively faith we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that holy Sacrament (for then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ, and drink his blood, then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us, we be one with Christ, &amp; Christ with us) so is the danger great, if we receive the same unworthyly: For then we be guilty of the body and blood of Christ our Saviour, we eat and drink our own damnation, not considering the Lords body, we kindle Gods wrath against us, we provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundry kindes of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:107079:103"/>
Therefore if any of you be a blasphemer of God, an hinderer or slanderer of his word, an adulterer, or be in malice or envie, or in any other grievous crime, bewail your sins, and come not to this holy table, lest after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the divil enter into you, as he entred into Judas, and fil you ful of all iniquities, and bring you to destruction both of body and soul. Judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your selves (brethren that ye be not judged of the Lord. Repent you truely for your sins past. Have a lively and stedfast faith in Christ our Saviour. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your lives, and be in perfect charity with all men, so shall ye be meet partakers of those holy mysteries. And above all things, ye must give most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and hearty thanks to God the father, the son, and the holy ghost, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, by the death and passion of our saviour Christ, both God and man, who did humble him self even to the death upon the crosse, for us mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable sinners, which lay in darknesse and shadow of death, that he may make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life. And to the end that we should alway remember the exceeding great love of our master and onely saviour Jesu Christ, thus dying for us, and the innumerable benefits (which by his pretious blood-sheding) he hath obtained to us: he hath instituted and ordained holy myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as pledges of his love, and continual remembrance of his death, to our great and endlesse comfort. To him therefore, with the Father and the holy Ghost, let us give (as we are most bounden) continual thanks, submitting our selves wholly to his holy will and pleasure, and studying to serve him in true holinesse and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse all the dayes of our life, Amen.</p>

No part of that, either spiritual, or temporal food, was received without some religious application to God, relative and directed to the ends for which those Collations were prepared: which application, whither it concerned the creature destined for bodily, or for Mystical refreshment, consisted of either two prayers distinct, or two distinct members of one prayer. The first was <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>By the marginal Ascription of the 1 B. of Edw. 6. we may observe from whence the custome is derived, for the Minister to take the Elements into his hands, upon his pronouncing of the words of institution. I humbly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to better Judgements whither that direction being expunged by our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reformers, it would not be a safe, and as proper a course to begin that action at these words, <hi>Grant that we receiving these thy creatures &amp;c.</hi> and to continue the rite until the words of Institution be past. For as I said before, the words Invocation of Gods blessing, joyntly with those of Christs Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion constitute the <hi>Consecration.</hi> Now if the blessing of the symbols be, as it is, an essential part of <hi>Consecration,</hi> then reason good, that with the words whereby it is accommodated and applied, the ceremony proper to it, that I mean of imposing of hands, should be used also: neverthelesse I see not how the either precept or use thereof, as <hi>Bucer suspected,</hi> can at all officiat to the errour of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> considering that the direction referreth not to the words of Institution, which the <hi>Papists</hi> make the great operators in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, but to the words <hi>took bread,</hi> and <hi>took the cup,</hi> as is rightly noted in the <hi>Scotch</hi> Liturgy, where the same direction is revived. As to the words of Institution, I must here note, against all who pretend our service is taken out of the <hi>Masse-Book,</hi> that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath halved them, as well as the Communion it self. For whereas our Church, agreeable to the general man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of all other Liturgies, indeed agreeable to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and his associate St. <hi>Luke</hi> (who supplied what St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark</hi> had omitted) after these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> continueth, <hi>which is given for you,</hi> the Cannon of the Masse chops off the words, <hi>Quod pro vobis traditur,</hi> contenting it self with <hi>Hoc est corpus meum.</hi>

               <p>Though all our Liturgies stand silent in it, yet may I not omit what here by the way doth offer it self as observable, viz.

Nay, how absurd would it seem to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate those holy-dayes, and meerly for the defect above said, to turn out of doors so large portions of holy Scripture, as the Epistles and Gospels, these last with their Collects giving us the onely account why these dayes are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Under the notion of <hi>Holy-dayes</hi> in this place, such Sundayes are also to be comprehended, on which there is no communion, in Country villages, where congregations are thin: for Sundayes are put into the Catalogue of holy-dayes in the Act of Parliament, and order of our Church.</p>

The visitation Articles of some Bishops enjoyned it to be read at the holy Table, placed at the East end of the Chancel, and the late <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> inferreth direction for it from the Rubrick before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, appointing that the <hi>Priest standing at the North side of the holy Table, shall say the Lords prayer with that which followeth.</hi> But this order hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Communion time, the Rubriok is expresly so; and in <hi>Communion time,</hi> I have evidently demonstrated before, <hi>the Table</hi> was <hi>to be placed in the midle of the Church or Chancel,</hi> and consequently I conceive this Rubrick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth not to this service <hi>out of Communion time,</hi> where then is it to be read? I agree at the holy Table set Altarwise, at the East end; and in this I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade my self the Bishops were right, though they perhaps mistook the reason; so it was I am certain in the first Reformation, the Rubrick parallel to ours, ordering <hi>all</hi> these <hi>things to be said at the Altar.</hi> But it may be said, the second Reformation expunging this rule, as to this particular, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume it meant to reform the practise also. I answer, our Reformers are best understood by their own orders, Now this Rule constitutes this service ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a label annext to morning prayer, or parcel of the Communion service: take which you will, by the order of the Church it must be said at the holy table set <hi>Altarwise,</hi> at the East end: for there regularly ought both the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Communion office to be read <hi>out of Communion time.</hi> As for the <hi>Morning prayer,</hi> both it and Evening prayer <hi>shall be used in the acoustomed place of the Church, Chappel, or Chancel.</hi> So are the very words of the <note n="s" place="margin">Rubr. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Morn. prayer.</note> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. The accustomed place was then, without dispute, the Quire: for all along Queen Marses dayes, nay from her death being the 27. of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> to the feast of St. <hi>John Baptist</hi> when this Common prayer was to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, by the statute, Mattins and Masse, yea, all Divine offices were perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med after the <hi>popish manner,</hi> and that was undoubtedly in the Quire, at the high Altar, and consequently to that place must the word <hi>accoustomed</hi> have relation in this Rubrick. True it is, there is an exception against this rule, in case the ordinary shall otherwise determine. So that till the Ordinary shall state it otherwise, the rule holds firm, and consequently Morning prayer with all its appendants (not otherwise setled by expresse order) is to be said at the Altar. Now if it be considered as part of the Communion service, the words
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:107079:115"/>
of the Rubrick are expresse, <hi>The Priest standing at the North side of the Table,</hi> shall say &amp;c.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T appeareth by ancient writers, that the (B) Sacrament of Baptisme in the old time was not commonly ministred but at two times in the year: (C) at Easter and Whitsuntide. At which time it was openly ministred in the presence of all the Congregation, which custom now being grown out of use (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it cannot, for many considerations, be well restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) yet it is thought good to follow the same as neer as conveniently may be, wherefor the people are to be admonished, that it is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient that Baptisme should not be ministred but upon Sundayes, and other holy-dayes, when the most number of people may come together, as well for that the congregation there present may testifie the receiving of them that be newly baptized into the number of Christs Church, as also because in the Baptisme of infants, every man present may be put in remembrance of his own profession made to God in baptisme. For which cause also it is expedient, that Baptisme be ministred in the English tongue. Neverthelesse (if necessity so require) children 1 B. of Edw. 6. ought at all times to be baptised, either at the Church or else at home] may at altimes be baptised at home.</p>

And then standing there, the minister shall ask whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107079:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the children be baptised, or no? If they answer no: Then shall the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster say thus.</p>
               <p>DEarly beloved, forasmuch as all men be conceived and born in sin, and that our saviour Christ saith, None can enter into the kingdome of God, except he be regenerate and born a new of water and the holy ghost: I beseech you to call upon God the father, through our Lord Jesus Christ, that of his bounteous mercy he will grant to these children that thing which by nature they cannot have, that they may be baptised with water and the holy ghost, and received into Christs holy Church, and be made lively members of the same.</p>
               <p>Then the Minister shall say, Let us pray.</p>

               <p>Let us pray.</p>
               <p>Almighty and immortal God &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Common prayer.</p>
               <p>ALmighty and Immortal God, the did of them that need, the helper of all hat flee to thee for succour, the life of them that beleeve, and the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead: we call upon thee for these infants, that they coming to thy holy baptisme, may receive remission of their stirs by spiritual regeneration. Receive them (O Lord) as thou hast promised by thy welbeloved son, saying, Ask, and you shall have, seek, and ye shall finde, knock and it shall be opened unto you. So give now unto us that ask, let us that seek finde, open the gate unto us that knock, that these infants may enjoy the everlasting benediction of thy heavenly washing, and may come to the eternal kingdom which thou hast promised, by Christ our Lord, Amen.</p>

               <p>Then shall the Priest say,</p>
               <p>The Lord be with you,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The people.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Minister</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hear now the Gospel written by St. <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT a certain time they brought children unto Christ, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus sow it. he was displeased, and said unto them, suffer little Children to come unto me, and forbid them nor, for to such belong the kingdome of God. Uerily I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, whosoever doth not receive the kingdom of God, as a little childe, be shall not enter therein. And when he had taken them up in his armes, he put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</p>
               <p>After the Gospel is read, the Minister shall make this brief exhortation upon the words of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>FRends, you hear in this gospel the words of our saviour Christ, that be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the children to be brought unto him: how he blamed those that would have kept them from him: how be exhorteth all men to follow their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. You perceive how by his outward gesture and deed, he declared his good will toward them: For he unbraced them in his armes, he laid his hands upon them, and blessed them. Doubt not ye therefore, but earnestly beleeve, that he will likewise favourably receive these present infants: that he will imbrace them with the armes of his mercy: that he will give unto them the blessing of eternal
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107079:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
life, and make them partakers of his everlasting kingdome. Wherefore we being thus perswaded of the good will of our heavenly father toward these infants, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by his son Jesus Christ, and nothing doubting but that he favourably allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this charitable work of ours, in bringing these children to his holy baptisme: let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and say.</p>
               <p>1 B. of Edw. 6. And say the prayer which himself hath taught, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our faith, let us recite also the articles contained in our Creed.</p>
               <p>Here the Minister with the Godfathers. and Godmothers, and people present, shall say,</p>
               <p>Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And then shall say openly.</p>
               <p>I beleeve in God the Father Almigihty &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then shall he adde also this prayer.</p>
               <p>ALmighty and everlasting God, heavenly Father, we give thee humble thanks, that thou hast vouchsafed to call us to the knowledge of thy grace and faith in thee: Encrease this knowledge, and confirm this faith in us evermore, give thy holy spirit to these infants, that they may be born again, and be made heires of everlasting salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee and thy holy spirit, now and for ever, Amen.</p>
               <p>Then the Minister shall speak unto the Godfathers and Godmothers, on this wise.</p>
               <p>WE beloved friends, ye have brought these children here to be baptised, ye have prayed that our Lord Jesus Christ would vouchsafe to receive them, to lay his hands upon them, to blesse them, to release them of their sins, to give them the kingdom of heaven, and everlasting life. Ye have heard also that our Lord Jesus Christ hath promised in his Gospel, to grant all these things that ye have prayed for: Which promise, he for his part will most surely keep and perform. Wherefore, after this promise made by Christ, these infants must also faithfully for their part, promise by you that be their suerties, that they will forsake the devil and all his works, and constantly beleeve Gods holy word, and obediently keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>

For our Lord Jesus Christ doth not deny his grace and mercy unto such infants, but most lovingly doth call them unto him, as the holy Gospel doth witnesse to our comfort, on this wise.</p>
               <p>AT a certain time they brought children unto Christ, that he should touch them, and his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was displeased, and said unto them, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for to such belongeth the kingdom of God. Uerily I say unto you, whosoever doth not receive the kingdome of God as a little childe, he shall not enter therein. And when he had taken them up in his armes, he put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</p>
               <p>After the Gospel is read, the Minister shall make this exhortation upon the words of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>FRiends, you hear in this Gospel the words of our saviour Christ, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the children to be brought unto him: how he blamed those that would have kept them from him: how he exhorted all men to follow their innocency. Ye perceive how by his outward gesture and deed, he declared his good will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them: For he embraced them in his armes, he laid his hands upon them, and blessed them. Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly beleeve, that he hath likewise favourably received this present insant, that he hath imbraced him with the armes of his mercy, that he hath given unto him the blessing of eternal life, and made him partaker of his everlasting kingdom. Wherefore we being thus perswaded of the good will of our heavenly father, declared by his son Jesus Christ toward this infant: let us faithfully and devoutly give thanks unto him, and say the prayer which the Lord himself taught and in declaration of our faith, let us re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hamond,</hi> build the whole fabrick of <hi>Baptism</hi> on the customary Baptism among the <hi>Jews,</hi> as upon a Basis. This Jewish Baptism they make parallel with that of Christians, in three particulars. First, it was say they, a rite of initiating both Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, natural Jews and Proselites in the Covenant, so is ours, a Ceremony of admission into Christianity. Secondly, It was never to be iterated, so is ours. Thirdly, That the Jews had their <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> which did promise and profess for Infants, and we have our <hi>Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sores,</hi> answering them. Now all this admitted for truth, speaks perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the Laver, not so fully to the regeneration, as something else, whereof I shall take notice by and by. I say, this admitted for truth, whereof just doubt may be made. My reason is, because the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties these learned men rest upon, are onely the <hi>Talmud</hi> and <hi>Talmudical</hi> Doctors: But the eldest of the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> being accounted near five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years junior to our Saviours birth, and the other above, and both being stuft with matters so palpably fabulous, as <hi>Josephus</hi> in the account of a learned <note n="k" place="margin">Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague.</note> Bishop, is preferred before them all: these things considered, and withall that in <hi>Josephus,</hi> there is not the least
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:107079:123"/>
sillable taking notice of any such Baptism, which so faithfull an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian would certainly not have omitted, had it existed in his time. As also that as profound a silence is there in his contemporary <hi>Philo,</hi> who hath so often, and unavoidable occasion to mention it. Now these two eminent Authors, <hi>Jews</hi> both, and of the same <hi>Saeculum</hi> with our Saviour, standing thus mute in a matter of so univetsall practice (as is pretended) and so considerable remarque, make it a very disputable case, whether there was any such custom in our Saviour's time. And though for matter of fact, it be urged by those Learned men, that it was so commonly taken notice of among the Jews, that <hi>John</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 10. Christ wonders at <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his ignorance, that he understood it not. To this it may be replied, that Christ might well enough wonder at <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his ignorance, without the <hi>hypothesis</hi> or supposition of any such rite, considering that the Prophets, <hi>Isajah, Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> had declared, what regeneration there should be in the daies of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whereof so great a Doctor as <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> should not have been ignorant. This, with the famous <note n="l" place="margin">Inlocum.</note> 
                  <hi>Grotius,</hi> I take to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Christ's Expostulation. But prove the custom as it may, or as they would have it, that there really was such a custom amongst the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet may it still be questioned, whether Baptism were founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by our Saviour in its primary institution. Not that I doubt of his accomodation of his own practice to several usages of theirs. But because I perceive the Learned Doctor acknowledgeth the Jewish cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom it self, to be founded upon another, <hi>viz. that of washing of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born babes.</hi> Now if the Jewish custom was but derivative from that, why might not our Saviour resort in this particular consideration, to the fountain it self, rather than follow a transcript of it, especially considering that the Original Example would better sute his purpose than the after draught? And to that custom of washing New-born babes, Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> another very Learned man hath applied it. Indeed the Analogy and conformity between Christian Baptism and that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, is more concinne and proper, both in relation to the Laver, and also to Regeneration. In relation to the Laver, because as the Laver or elemental water doth wash away and clense our bodies of filth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; so doth the Mystical washing of the Holy Ghost purg our souls from all former pollution. In relation to Regeneration, for as it is at our Generation, so is it in our Regeneration. At our Generation or Birth, when we were born men, we were washed, so are we when we are born Christians, and washed from a pollution exactly agreeable also. When we were born, we were washed from the pollution we contracted from our Parents wombe, when we are new-born, we are washed by Baptism from that Original sin, which is derived to us from our first Parents: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Our new birth by Baptism, doth cut off that film of corruption we contract form our natural birth.</hi> Nazianzen. So that the case is clear, as we are washed at our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral birth, so are we at our spiritual. In the first, there is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the putting of the filth of the flesh, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. So is there in the second, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the laying off the Old man,</hi> Ephes. 4. 22. And a total clensing of the soul from all impurity contracted and derived from him. And though this Analogy proceedeth most regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the Baptizing of Infants, who are onely charged with onely Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal sin, yet doth it hold also in persons adult, whom our Saviour directs the same way to heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> by becomming as little children; that is, by purging our souls from the stain of actual transgressions, and making our selues thereby as innocent as those tender babes; and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:107079:124"/>
this is done by another Laver of Regeneration, called <hi>Repentance:</hi> upon which account, according to the Primitive mode, Baptism was never afforded to persons adult without Repentance, proemial and preparatory to it. This to scour away <hi>Actual,</hi> as the other <hi>Original</hi> pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A custom derived at first from the Baptist St. <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. Whos Baptism was called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>the Baptism of Repentance for the remission of sins.</hi> That it was so for matter of fact in the Primitive Church these instances may suffice to demonstrate. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin Martyr,</hi> delineating the Baptismal mode in his time, describeth it thus; first <note n="m" place="margin">Apolog.</note>

                  <hi>Vegetius</hi> hath it, and from thence it came at length to an indefinite notion, signifying whatsoever was transacted by the interposition of an Oath, which because it hath something of Religion more than ordinary, might well deserve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a Sacrament.

               <p>But if Baptisme be, as it is, the Sacrament of our initiation and entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christianity, it may be demanded, why hath not the Office belonging to it the preheminence? why is it not in our service Book inserted and marshall'd before that of the Communion; this Sacrament being in order of nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that? My answer is, the Communion was, both in the Primitive Church and in the beginning of our Reformation accounted the principle part of the Diurnal service of God in publick, it being celebrated dayly in both times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced, as I have proved before, for the ancient Church, and as may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced for the last, by the Rubrick after the exhortation to the Communion, in the first book of Edw. 6. The Eucharistical Office being then so conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant with the dayly prayers, and Baptisme more rarely happening, the Church thought fit to make them contignous in order, which were so frequent companions in use.</p>

My answer is, that this dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it in this place is no novelty, although differing from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal practice, and upon what account it came to be divided from the Office of Confirmation, I shall further declare, when I come to take a survay of that Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall make a Cross.]</hi> This Rubrique must be expounded by the thirtyeth Canon of our Church, and by that which followeth; for the signing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> is not immediatly to succeed the formal words of Baptism. But the Minister is first to say, <hi>We receive this Child into the Congregation of Christ's Flock.</hi> And then to sign, and so the words <hi>do sign,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent tence infallibly import. For the Church studions to retain this ancient and universal ceremony, of the purest Primitive times, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so careful to decline all fear of superstitious intendment; as if she thought the Sacrament imperfect without it. Therefore whereas the Primitive mode made it to usher in Baptism, our Church inverted the order, and made it come after, and so to follow it, as she expresly first declareth <note n="q" place="margin">Canon. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>the child to be received into the Congregation of Christ's Flock, as a perfect Member thereof, and not by any power ascribed to the sign of the Cross.</hi> And further to assure all distrustful minds, that she maketh
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:107079:128"/>
it not of the substance of the Sacrament, she hath totally omitted it in the Office of private Baptism. Having yeelded a Reason of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move in the Service of our Church, it will be proper and pertinent to inquire into the Original inducement to this Cermony. These I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be three. First, an ancient Rite it was, for servants or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to be stygmatized or branded with the names of their Masters on their foreheads, as it was for their souldiers enrolled, with the names of their Emperours or Generalissimo's on the hands, declaring thereby to whom they did belong. To this custome the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is thought to allude, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>vers.</hi> 4. <hi>Set a mark upon the forehead of them that mourn, and cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> To this custome the Angel in the Revelation is thought to regard, chap. 7. vers. 3. <hi>Hurt ye not the earth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>until we have sealed the Servants of God on the forehead,</hi> and <hi>chap. 14. vers. 1.</hi> where the reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the Lamb are said to <hi>have his Fathers name written on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.</hi> And as <hi>Christ's</hi> Flock carried their cognizance on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads; so did his great adversary the <hi>Beast,</hi> sign his servants there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>If any man shall receive the mark of the Beast on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or on his hand.</hi> Now that the Christian Church might hold some Analogy with those sacred applications, she conceived it a most significant ceremony for Baptism, (it being our first admission into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Profession) that all her children should be signed with the Cross, on their forehead, at their reception of it, signifying thereby their consignment up to Christ, whence it is so often called by the Fathers, <hi>Signaculum Dominicum, the Lords Signet,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

But the Church is so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly expresse, and perspicuous in her explanation of the use thereof, as nothing can be disired more; which <note n="x" place="margin">Canon. 30.</note> explication being the product of the Conference at <hi>Hampton Court,</hi> was so abundantly satisfactory to the Foreman of those Opponents <hi>Dr. Reinolds,</hi> as have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once perused it, he ingenuously profest, <hi>he would never gain-say that Ceremony any more.</hi> In that Explication not a sillable appears of any operation ascribed to this sign, therefore they who have adhered to any such opinion, cannot plead the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for their guide.

All along King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt'h, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Reign, when the <hi>Strumosi,</hi> such as had the <hi>King's evil,</hi> came to be touched, the manner was then for her to apply the sign of the Cross to the tumour, which raising cause of jealousies, as if some mysterious operation were imputed to it.

And this order is most convenient to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for divers considerations.</p>
               <p>First, because that when children come to the years of discretion, and have learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promised for them in Baptisme, they may then themselves with their own mouth, and with their own consent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly before the Church, ratifie and confirm the same: and also promise that by the grace of God, they will evermore endevour themselves faithfully to observe and keep such things as they by their own mouth and confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sion have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for as much as Confirmation is ministred to them that be baptised, that by imposition of hands and prayer, they may receive strength and defence against all temptations to sin, and the assaults of the world and the devil, it is most meet to be ministred when children come to that age, that partly by the frailty of their own flesh, partly by the assaults of the world and the devil, they begin to be in danger to fall into sundry kindes of sin.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that it is agreeable with the usage of the Church in times past, whereby it was ordeined that Confirmation should be Ministred to them that were of perfect age, that they being instructed in Christs religion, should openly professe their own faith, and promise to be obedient unto the will of God.</p>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:107079:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(B) And that no man shall think that any detriment shall come to the children by deferring of their Confirmation, he shall know for truth that it is certain by Gods word, that children being baptised, [1 B. of Edw. 6. if they depart out of this life in their infancy] have all things necessary for their salvation, and be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly saved.</p>

                  <p>And all Fathers, mothers, Masters, and Dames, shall cause their children, servants, and prentises (which have not learned their Catechisme) to come to the Church at the time appointed, and obediently to hear, and be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Curate, untill such time as they have learned all that is here ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for them to learn.

Then are they made the sons of God, when they are born again by both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> So St. <hi>Augustine</hi> mentions <hi>Chrismatis Sacramentum;</hi> and in both their sences (they applying that title to all things of mysterious import in a <note place="margin">L. 2. cont. lit.

But that it is so, in true propriety of speech, our adversaries shall never obtain from us, until they can finde <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum, et Elementum,</hi> and both of <hi>Christs</hi> Institution, to meet in it; neither of which, as they confess, are yet to be found, their great <note n="c" place="margin">Bellarm. de S. confirm. c. 8</note> 
                  <hi>Cardinal</hi> putting us off for both to <hi>tradition unwritten.</hi> But although we entertain it not as a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet being of Apostolical practise, and exercised with the product of such marvellous effects and operations: we, who pretend not to any such miraculous gifts, have not yet so slight a value for it as absolutely to reject it, being well perswaded, that, accompanied with such fervent <hi>prayers,</hi> it will be the readier way to convey those graces of the holy spirit into the soul of the party baptized, which are necessary to <hi>establish him in every good word, and work.</hi> For the gift of the Holy Ghost, in order to which this rite is used, is not so much an effect of the <hi>Hands</hi> imposed, as of the Invocation then applyed.

                  <hi>Ad invocationem sacerdotis spiritus sanctus infunditur,</hi> saith St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> very well, <hi>at the Invocation of the Byshop the holy Ghost is infused.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Ceremony was considered by the Apostles, and succeeding Fathers, as <note place="margin">De lis qui initiantur.</note> the <hi>completory</hi> and close of <hi>Baptisme,</hi> not that <hi>Baptisme</hi> was ineffectual <hi>without</hi> it, but as an assistant <hi>to</hi> it, and therefore <hi>Confirmation</hi> in persons adult imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately succeeded the very act of baptizing and dipping. And if the Primitive Church held her self obliged to preserve it upon the score of Apostolical usage, and to tender it to such as were of full growth, much more reason have we to continue it, with whom <hi>Paedo-Baptisme,</hi> is almost the sole practice. <hi>Baptism,</hi> as the Apostle St. <hi>Peter</hi> describeth it, is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>The Answer,</hi> or rather Interrogatory, <hi>of a good conscience towards God;</hi> that is, a question how the party stands disposed towards God, not unlike our <hi>Interrogatory, Doest thou for sake the Devil,</hi> &amp;c. To take of the supposed vanity of this Interrogatory administred to Infants, who are in no capacity to reply, the Church, their most tender Mother, hath devised this expedient of assigning sureties to undertake in their behalf, what Christianity requireth from them. They being thus charitably provided for, in the minority of their intellectuals, extream rational it is that the Church exact from them, and that they render to her, an account when they come to riper years, what progress they have made in learning the Elements of the christian faith; exceeding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it is they enter new security to her that they will, by Gods grace, make good those stipulations, and promises which their sureties undertook before in their behalf, and that after all these they may receive the Churches Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, administred to them by the <hi>Bishop,</hi> their spiritual Father. There is not any thing wherein the late pretended Reformers amuse me more then in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. I hear them declare, <hi>That all who are baptized in the name of Christ, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o renounce, and by their Baptisme are bound to fight against the Devil, the World, and the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Directory.</note> 
                  <hi>Flesh.</hi> And yet by abolishing of sureties, they render Infants unable to make such Abrenunciation, or take such an engagement by their proxies, and do not any where throughout all their appointments, require from persons baptized when they become adult any such actual promise. Where is then this Renunciation and obligation entred against those common Enemies these men talk of? If they say they are mental, supposed, and impli'd. I answer, that is not enough, the Church must take cognizance of all her members that they are all of a piece, that they agree in the unity of profession, which she can not, unless they give her not only some verbal account of their knowledge in the principles of Religion, but also explicite promises to live agreeable to those principles. And therefore it surpasseth my understanding with what colour of reason they can admit such persons to the highest degree of christian Society, the <hi>blessed communion,</hi> who never engaged to conform to the Rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
               <p>

But though, as children, they want nothing necessary for their Salvation, yet have they not all things necessary for years more adult, when of another Sacrament, the principles of Christianity oblige them to participate, and require from them, no procurated, but a personal, and actual faith, repentance, obedience, and what else their Baptismal engagement tyed them to perform. And until they have given better security for all these in <hi>confirmation,</hi> the Church (regularly) precludeth to them all advenues to higher mysteries: so that this excellent ceremony is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Even from the time of Mark the Evangelist, there were always successively Ecclesi astical Doctors,</hi> that is <hi>catechists;</hi> where this very <hi>Clemens</hi> was one, and so was <hi>Origen,</hi> (once his scholler) at eighteen years of age, as both <hi>Eusebius</hi> and St. <hi>Hierome</hi> witness, too young to be ordained a Clergy man.

Women being then the subject of his discourse, the Presbyter cannot be a Catechist.

Which Miracles, though <hi>Believers</hi> did afterward perform, yet were not those operations the meer results of Faith, nor did they do them as <hi>Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> but the Power enabling them thereto, was conveyed to them by the Gift of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> which Gift not onely imported an extraordinary Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, upon new regenerated Converts, of the invisible Graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, confirming their Faiths daily more and more, and assisting them in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of an holy and sanctified Life and Conversation: But also in outward Qualifications, suitable to the exigent of those times for the working of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Nor were those Believers to expect or receive those Gifts by any other <hi>Prayers,</hi> or any other <hi>Hands,</hi> then of the Apostles, that the World might know God had a more then ordinary value for their Function, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:107079:138"/>
would require the highest Honor deferr'd to it; upon this very account, the Apostles, hearing that <hi>Samaria</hi> had received the word of God, and were Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized by <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist, they sent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to them <hi>to pray for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> implying thereby, that though <hi>Philip</hi> had commission to <hi>Baptise</hi> and <hi>Preach,</hi> yet could he not give <note place="margin">Acts 8. 15.</note> the Holy Ghost. And when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> perceived what strange feats were done by those Beleevers, after such prayer and Imposition of hands of those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, he thinking it would prove a money matter, bad liberally for it, till he understood he was in the wrong. And though in tract of time, and by degrees, whole Nations being converted to the Christian Faith, the main cause of those Miracles ceasing, they themselves began to abate both in number and quality, and so <hi>Confirmation</hi> was not practised much upon that pretence; yet it being an Apostolical usage, and instituted also for another end, <hi>viz.</hi> An Invocation of Gods inward sanctifying the Person new Baptized, by the Grace of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, a Petition necessary at all times.

But Christianity beginning to spread it self into larger Precincts, and the persons Baptized growing very numerous, that such as were sick, or lay <hi>in extreamis,</hi> and therefore could not resort to the Bishop, nor he to them, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time, might not totally be deprived of all Spiritual Fortifications, which Confirmation was conceived to afford; an expedient was contrived for their solace and satisfaction; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Presbyter or Minister, who was qualified by the Bishop to Baptize, should have liberty to anoint the <hi>Neophite,</hi> but with these two Cautions. First, That the <hi>Chrismal</hi> Unguent should be first consecrated, as was the use of those times, by the Bishop. Secondly, that he should anoint without Imposition of hands: By this course the Bishop parted from the shell, and kept the kernel, reserving to himself the true Apostolical Ceremony of <hi>Imposing of hands,</hi> and also the sole power of consecrating the Unguent, to teach Presbyters their distance and eminence of their Order: This course thus setled, the Bishops kept their wonted usage of confirming at <hi>Easter</hi> and <hi>Pentecost</hi> in their Cathedral Cities; and for such as were Baptized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Countrey, their maner was, to give notice of their intentions of being at some convenient place, upon a day prefixt, and to summon all persons whom it concerned to resort to them, there to be Confirm'd. Now to make proof of what I have delivered, I shall need no more then the first Canon of the first <hi>Arausican</hi> Synod: <hi>Nullum Ministrorum qui Baptisands recepit officium</hi>

                  <hi>sine Chrismate usquam debere progredi quia inter nos placuit semel Chrismari, That no Minister who hath taken the office of Baptizing ought to go abroad without Chrism, for we have agreed it should be used once.</hi> This <hi>Chrism</hi> the Minister was to have of the Bishop of his Diocess, Presbyters being interdicted themselves to consecrate it, by the sixth Canon of the Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> decreeing, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, i. e. <hi>That Chrism be not made by a Presbyter:</hi> In case of necessity, if the party Baptized was not anointed, then the Bishop at Confirmation was to be warned of it, as it followeth in the same Canon: <hi>De eo autem qui in Baptismate quacunque necessitate faciente non Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matus fuerit sacerdos commonebitnr, But concerning him who shall happen not to be anointed in Baptism, in regard of some necessity, the Bishop must be put in minde of it:</hi> But why so? That he may sorbear confirming him, as <hi>Aurelius</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth? No, but that he may anoint him, which else he would not; for the Bishops fashion was onely to impose hands without Unction, unless he was told the party was not anointed before. True it is, <hi>Aurelius</hi> contends for two Unctions, one <hi>Baptismal,</hi> the other <hi>Confirmatory,</hi> that by the Presbyter, this by the Bishop; this he endeavors to prove, first by the last sentence of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>Ut necessaria habeatur Chrismatio repetita,</hi> i. e. <hi>That repeted Unction be held necessary:</hi> Secondly, By a Decretal of Innocent the first, <hi>Presbyteris seu extra Episcopuni, seu presente Episcopo Baptisant, Chrismate Baptisatos ungere licet non tamen frontem ex eodem oleo signare, quod solis debetur Episcopis cum tradunt sanctum Paracletum,</hi> i. c. <hi>Presbyters, be the Bishop absent or present when they Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, may anoint whom they have Baptized, but not their fore-heads with the same Unguent which onely belongs to Bishops when they give the Holy Ghost:</hi> The words of both are express enough; the question is, whether they be the words either of that Councel, or this Pope, and I conceive it without question they are not. As for the Canon, <hi>Syrmondus</hi> the Jesuite concludeth it thus, <hi>Ut non necessaria ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beatur repetita Chrismatio,</hi> i. e. <hi>That repeted Chrismation be not held necessary:</hi> This Particle <hi>Non</hi> reverseth all, and <hi>Syrmondus</hi> pleads that in his Edition he had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the best and most ancient Copies: But <hi>Aurelius</hi> says no, and this is not onely become a dispute, but a serious quarrel betwixt this <hi>Sorbonist</hi> and that <hi>Jesuite,</hi> a Quarrel that hath provoked between them a great Volumn to decide it: Having heard them both, I must pronounce for <hi>Syrmondus,</hi> that the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Syllable must stand, and that there was then at that moment but one anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in use, which both Authority and Reason will confirm. Authority <note n="y" place="margin">Adv. Lucise. rian.</note> 
                  <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> who lived near that time: <hi>Non abnuo hanc esse Ecclesiarum Consuetudinem, ut ad eos qui longe in minoribus urbibus per Presbyteros &amp; Diaconos Baptisati sunt, Episcopus ad invocationem Spiritus Sancti manum impositurus Excurrat,</hi> i. e. <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but the Custom of the Churches is this, that the Bishop rideth forth into the Countrey, for an Invocation of the Holy Ghost, and Imposition of hands upon those who far off, in Countrey Towns, have been Baptized by Presbyters and Deacons.</hi> He doth not say the Bishops were to anoint, but onely to impose Hands; and yet afterward he tells us, the Presbyters were to Baptize with Chrism. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is evident by reason, there being then no supposed necessity enforcing the use of Episcopal Chrismation, which came in long after upon another, not then dreamt on, account; for before confirmation came to be entertained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of a genuine Sacrament, which was not till near a thousand years after Christ no other Ceremony was required to the necessity of it, then laying on of hands; but when it took a degree higher then the ancient Church meant it, when it became in the corrupt opinion of superstitious men, to gain the reputation of a Sacrament, it was observed that Imposition of hands one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly would not constitute it such, unless also Chrism for the Element and material principle thereof were re-granted it: And this is the true original of the two <hi>Chrismations, Baptismal</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> and <hi>Confirmatory</hi> or <hi>Episcopal,</hi> now in use in the Romish Church.

his Edition of that Canon, I conceive is sufficient to overthrow the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Aurelius</hi> to the contrary, so also may it serve to render Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> decretal counterfeit, as indeed most are, if not all. And were this Decretal that Popes, and Popes the men they are cry'd up for, it was a strange boldness in this Councel to decree, <hi>Inter nos placuit semel Chrismari, we are agreed that Chrism be used once,</hi> when Innocent had before ordered it should be twice.</p>

One was the procreation of children, to be brought up in the fear and nurture of the Lord, and praise of God. Secondly it was ordeined for a remedy against sin, and to avoid fornication that such persons that have not the gift of continence might marry and keep themselves undefiled members of Christs body. Thirdly for the mutual society, help, and comfort, that the one ought to have of the other, both in prosperity and adversity, into the which holy estate these two persons present come now to be joyned.

               <p>At which day of mariage, if any man do alledge and declare any impediment why they may not be coupled together in Matrimony, by Gods law or the laws of this Realm, and will be bound, and sufficient suerties with him, to the parties: or else put in a caution to the full vallue of such charges, as the persons to be maried doth sustain, to proove his allegation: then the solemnization must be deferred unto such time as the truth be tried. If no impediment be alleadged, then shall the Curate say unto the man.</p>

               <p>O God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, blesse these thy servants, and sow the seed of eternal life in their mindes, that whatsoever in thy holy word they shall profitably learn, they may indeed fulfil the same: Look O Lord mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully upon them from heaven, and blesse them. And as thou didst send thy blessing upon Abraham and Sarah to their great comfort: so vouchsafe to send thy bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon these thy servants, that they obeying thy will, and alway being in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under thy protection, may avide in thy love unto their lives end, through Jesu Christ our Lord, Amen.</p>
               <p>Omitted This prayer next following, shall be omitted, where the woman is in Bucer. past childe birth.</p>
               <p>O Mercifull Lord and heavenly father, by whose gratious gift mankinde is increased: we beseech thee assist with thy blessing these two persons, that they may both be fruitful in procreation of children, and also live together so long in Godly love and honesty, that they may see their childrens children, unto the third and fourth generation, unto thy praise and honour, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.</p>
               <p>O God, which by thy mighty power hast made all things of naught, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so after other things set in order, didst appoint that out of man (created after thine own image and similitude) woman should take her beginning, and knitting them together, didst teach that it should never be lawful to put a sunder those, wham thou by matrimony hadst made one, O God which hast consecrated the state of matrimony to such an excellent mystery, that in it is signified and represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and his Church: look mercifully upon these thy servants, that both this man may love his wife, according to thy word (as Christ did love his spouse the Church, who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it even as his own flesh) and also that this woman may be loving and amiable to her husband as Rachel, wise as Rebecca, faithful and obedient as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, and in all quietnesse sobriety, and peace, be a follower of holy and Godly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons. O Lord blesse them both, and grant them to inherit thy everlasting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen.</p>
               <p>Then shall the Minister say.</p>
               <p>ALmighty God, which at the beginning did create our first parents Adam and Eve, and did sanctifie and joyn them together in mariage: poure upon you the riches of his grace, sanctifie and [1 B. of Edw. 6. †] blesse you that ye may please hun both in body and soul and live together in holy love unto your lives end, Amen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Then shall begin the Communion]</hi> and after the Gospel shall be said a Sermon, <note place="margin">The words included thus [] Omited in the 1. B. of Edw. 6.</note> wherein ordinarily (so oft as there is any mariage) the Office of man and wife shall be declared, according to holy Scripture. Or if there be no Sermon, the Minister shall read this that followeth.</p>
               <p>AL ye which be married, or which intend to take the holy estate of Matrimony upon you, here what holy Scripture doth say, as touching the duty of husbands toward their wives, and wives toward their husbands.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:107079:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Saint Paul (in his Epistle to the Ephesians the fift Chapter) doth give this commandment to all married men, ye husbands love your wives even as Christ loved the Church, and hath given himself for it, to sanctifie it, purging it in the fountain of water, through the word, that he might make it unto himself a glorious congregation, not having spot or wrinckle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy and blamlesse. So men are bound to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife, loveth himself. For never did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man hate his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord doth the congregation. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall be joyned unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. This mystery is great: but I speak of Christ and of the congregation. Neverthelesse, let every one of you so love his own wife, even as him self.</p>
               <p>Likewise the same saint Paul (writing to the Colossians) speaketh thus to all men that be married. Ye men love your wives, and be not bitter unto them. <note place="margin">Colos. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Hear also what Saint Peter the Apostle of Christ, which was himself a married man, saith unto all men that are married, ye husbands dwell with your wives ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.</note> to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as heires together of the grace of life, so that your prayers be not hindred.</p>
               <p>Hitherto ye have heard the duty of the husband toward the wife. Now likewise ye wives hear and learn your duty towards your husbands, even as it is plainly set forth in holy scripture.</p>
               <p>SAint Paul (in the forenamed Epistle to the Ephesians) teacheth you thus, Ye <note place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> women submit your selves unto your husbands, as unto the Lord: for the husband is the wives head, even as Christ is the head of the Church. And he also is the saviour of the whole body. Therefore as the Church and congregation is subject unto Christ so likewise let the wives be also in subjection unto their own hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands in all things. And again he saith, let the wife reverence her husband. And in his epistle to the Colossians) saint Paul giveth you this short Lesson, Ye wives submit your selves unto your own husbands, as it is convenient in the Lord.</p>
               <p>Saint Peter doth also instruct you very godly, thus saying, Let wives be subject to their own husbands, so that if any obey not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives, while they behold your chast conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion coupled with fear. Whose apparel let it not be outward with braided haire and trimming about with Gold, either in puting on of gorgeous apparel: but let the hid man which is in the heart, be without all corruption, so that the spirit, be milde and quiet, which is a precious thing in the sight of God. For after this manner (in the old time) did the holy women which trusted in God, apparel themselves, being subject to their own husbands: As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose daughters ye are made doing well, and not being dismaid with any fear.</p>
               <p>The new married persons (the same day of their marriage) (N) <hi>must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Communion.</hi>

                  <p>Then shall the Minister exhort the sick person after this form, or other like.</p>
                  <p>DEarly beloved, know this, that Almighty God is the Lord of life and death, and over all things to them pertaining, as youth, strength, health, age, weakness, and sickness. Wherefore, whatsoever your sickness is, know you certainly that it is Gods visitation. And for what cause soever this sickness is sent unto you, whether it be to try your patience for the example of other, and that your faith may be found in the day of the Lord laudable, glorious, and honorable, to the increase of glory and endless felicity, or else it be sent unto you to correct and amend in you whatsoever doth offend the eyes of your heavenly Father: know you certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that if you truly repent you of your sins, and bear your sickness patiently, trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Gods mercy, for his dear Son Jesus Christ sake, and render unto him humble thanks for his fatherly visitation, submitting your self wholly to his will, it shall turn to your profit, and help you forward in the right way that leadeth unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life.</p>
                  <p>If the person visited be very sick, then the Curate may end his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this place.</p>
                  <p>Take therefore in good worth the chastisment of the Lord. For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: Yea (as St. Paul saith) he scourgeth every son which he receiveth. If ye endure chastisement, he offereth himself unto you, as unto his own children. What son is he that the Father chastiseth not? If ye be not under correction (whereof all true children are pattakers) then are ye bastards, and not children. Therefore, seeing that when our carnal fathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o correct us, we reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently obey them: shall we not now much rather be obedient to our spiritual Father, and so live: And they for a few days do chastise us after their own pleasure: but he doth chastise us for our profit, to the intent he may make us partakers of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. These words (good brother) are Gods words, and written in holy scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for our comfort and instruction, that we should patiently and with thanksgiving, bear our heavenly Fathers correction, whensoever by any maner of adversity it shall please his gracious goodness to visit us. And there should be no greater comfort to Christian persons, then to be made like unto Christ, by suffering patiently adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, troubles, and sicknesses. For he himself went not up to joy, but first he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered pain, he entred not into his glory before he was cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ified. So truly our way to eternal Joy, is, to suffer here with Christ, and our door to enter into eternal life, is gladly to die with Christ, that we may rise again from death, and dwell with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>m in everlasting life. New therefore taking your sickness (which is thus profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for you) patiently, I exhort you in the name of God, to remember the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:107079:144"/>
which you made unto God in your Baptism. And forasmuch as after this life, there is account to be given unto the righteous Judge, of whom all must be judged without respect of persons: I require you to examine your self, and your state both toward God and man, so that accusing and condemning your self for your own faults, you may finde mercy at our heavenly Fathers hand for Christs sake, and not be accused and condemned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that fearful Judgement. Therefore I shall shortly rehearse the Articles of our Faith, that you may know whether you do believe as a Christian man should, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And so forth as it is in Baptism.</p>
                  <p>Then shall the Minister examine (Q) <hi>whether he be in charity with all the world:</hi> exhorting him to forgive from the bottom of his heart, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that have offended him; and if he have offended other, to ask them forgiveness.

But men must be oft admonished that they set an order for their temporal goods and lands when they be in health, and also declare his debts what he oweth, and what is owing unto him, for discharging of his conscience, and quietness of his executors.</p>

But if the sick person be not able to come to the Church, and yet is desirous to receive the Communion in his house then he must give knowledge over night, or else early in the morning to the Curate, signifying also how many be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Communicate with him: 1 B. of Edw. 6. <hi>And if the same day there be a celebration of the holy Communion in the Church,</hi> (W) then shall the Priest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>(at the open Communion, so much of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood, as shall serve the sick person, and so many as shall Communicate with him (if there be any) And so soon as conveniently he may, after the Communion ended in the Church, shall go and Minister the same, first to those that are appointed to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the sick (if there be any) and last of all to the sick person himself. But before the Curate distribute the holy Communion,</hi> the <hi>appointed</hi> general Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>must be made in the name of the Communicants, the Curate adding</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution with the Comfortable sentences of Scripture <hi>following in the open Communion, and after the Communion ended, the</hi> Collect.

Of whom may we seek for succor but of thee, O Lord, which for our sins justly are displeased? Yet O Lord God most holy, O Lord most mighty, O holy and most merciful Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death. Thou knowest Lord the secrets of our hearts, shut not up thy merciful eyes to our prayers: But spare us Lord most holy, O God most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not at our last hour for any pains of death to fall from thee.</p>

                  <p>Then shall follow this Lesson, taken out of the 15 Chapter to the Corinthians, the first Epistle.</p>
                  <p>CHrist is risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 10.</note> by a man came death, and by a man came the resurrection of the dead. For as by Adam all die, even so by Christ shall all be made alive, but every man in his own order. The first is Christ, then they that are Christs at his coming. Then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the end, when he hath delivered up the kingdom to God the Father, when he hath put down all rule, and all authority and power. For he must reign till he have put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed, is death. For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, All things are put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him. When all things are subdued unto him, then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all. Else what do they which are baptized over the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized over them? yea, and why stand we alway then in jeopardy? By our rejoycing which I have in Christ Jesu our Lord, I die daily. That I have fought with beasts at Ephesus after the maner of men, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we shall die. Be not ye deceived, evil words corrupt good maners. Awake truly out of sleep, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame. But some man will say, How arise the dead? With what body shall they come? Thou fool, that which thou sowest, is not quickned except it die. And what sowest thou? thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare corn, as of wheat or some other: But God giveth it a body at his pleasure, to every seed his own body. All flesh is not one maner of flesh: but there is one maner of flesh of men, another maner of flesh of beasts, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of fishes, another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and there are bodies terrestrial. But the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strial is another. There is one maner glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For one star differeth from another in glory: So is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it riseth again in incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it is sown in dishonor, it riseth again in honor: it is sown in weakness, it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth again in power: it is sown a natural body, it riseth again a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body: as it is also written, The first man Adam was made a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing soul, and the last Adam was made a quickning spirit. Howbeit, that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and then that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth earthy: The second man is the Lord from Heaven, heavenly. As is the earthy, such are they that be earthy. And as is the heavenly, such are they that are heavenly. And as we have born the image of the earthy, so shall we bear the image of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly. This say I brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. Behold, I shew you a mystery. We
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:107079:148"/>
shall not all sleep, but we shall be changed and that in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye, by the last trump. For the trump shall blow, and the dead shall rise incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and we shall be changed: For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. When this corruptible hath put on incorruption, and this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowen up Into victory: Death where is thy sting? Hell where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law: but thanks be unto God, which hath given us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my dear brethren, be ye stedfast and unmoveable, always rich in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know how that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The Lesson ended, the Minister shall say,</p>
                  <p>Lord have mercy upon us.</p>
                  <p>Christ have mercy upon us.</p>

                  <p>O Lord, with whom do live the Spirits of them that be dead, and in whom the souls of them that be elected, after they be delivered from the burthen of the flesh, be in joy and felicity. Grant unto this thy servant, that the sins which he committed in this world be not imputed unto him, but that he escaping the gates of hell, and pains of eternal darkness: may ever dwell in the region of light, with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the place where is no weeping, sorrow, nor heaviness, &amp; when that dreadful day of the general resurrection shall come, make him to rise also with the just and righteous, and receive this body again to glory, then made pure and incorruptible; set him on the right hand of thy Son Jesus Christ, among thy holy and elect, that then he may hear with them these most sweet and comfortable words, Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom which hath been prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ our Mediator and Redeemer, Amen.</p>

The inconveniences of an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual yoak, or marrying of a Christian with an infidel, were innumerable; the society and conversation could not be so mutual between them, the Christian woman could not keep those correspondences which were of the interest of her Religion; and possibly the secret meetings, which with much adoe were then contrived might thereby be betraied, or unhappily discovered, to the ruin and destruction of the Professors of Christianity.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, no avoidance, the solemnization of this Ordinance must be granted to have been performed by such a consecration; it is also next in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be supposed, that in this consecration set forms were used, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring withall, that they were assigned to undergraduate concernmenrs; and considering that such forms are still extant some, and others are presumable to have been so by collateral implication.

Not by the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> not by the <hi>Kalender,</hi> not by any <hi>Homily,</hi> not by any <hi>Article,</hi> not by any <hi>Canon</hi> of our Church since the Reformation. And therefore if there be any Popery, as is pretended by Mr. <hi>Pryn,</hi> in this restraint, our Reformed Church is not to bear the blame. By what Law then? By a Canon certainly, and of some General Council of this Nation; for else all <hi>Manuals,</hi> and <hi>Linwood</hi> our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Canonist, would not have agreed so punctually in all the dayes prefixt. True it is this Canon is not, to my reading, extant, but before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it was undoubtedly. And this is the reason why our prohibition exceeds that of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the last clause, viz. <hi>from Rogation Sunday, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Trinity Sunday,</hi> that Council being confirmed by <hi>Pius</hi> 4th. far up into the State of Reformation. But were not former Canons all made null upon our Reformation? No, in the Statute 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19. it is expresly provided, <hi>That such Canons as were made before that Act, which be not contrariant, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Kings Prerogative, the Laws, Statutes, and Customs of the Realm, should be still used and executed, as they were before the making of the Act.</hi> Now of these Canons this I take it was one: but whereas it is charged with Popery, I consess I apprehend not where that Popery is resident. Is it as the restraint relates to times of solemn Humiliation? Then the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> a Council to which Popery is <hi>post-nated</hi> above three hundred years, stands guilty of Popery as well as we, for that Council in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted marriages for the whole time of <hi>Lent,</hi> as hath been shewed before.

Mr. <note n="f" place="margin">Dr. Cosens Cousening Devotions.</note>

                  <hi>Wilt thou have this woman,</hi> &amp;c.] This, with its parallel place, admits of a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> twofold construction.

Secondly it is a pattern of the ancient form of Espousals, which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly did antecede the Nuptials: after these Espousals the woman in some places presently co-habited with the man, as did <hi>Rebeccah;</hi> but continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched until the marriage day. <note n="h" place="margin">Digest.

               <p>But here incidently two questions encounter me, neither of which I may decline. First, Why is not the subarration, the giving of earnest, recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and mutual? Why doth not the woman give somewhat to the man by way of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>exchange,</hi> as he the Ring to her? To which Mr. <note n="q" place="margin">Uxor. Hae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Selden</hi> lends me this answer: That this is a relique of that very ancient custome, whereby the man was wont to buy the woman, laying down as the price of her a certain piece of mony; which piece of mony might be supplied by any other thing equivalent to it: and therefore when the use of the Ring was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, solemn inquiry was made, whether or not it did answer the value of that mony, without which the marriage proceeded not. Though this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer may seem to some very retrograde, and far fetch'd, yet may it pass for default of a better. Secondly, it is enquired, why a Ring rather than any other thing is given in marriage? The general account which Ritualists ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, is to signifie the continuity of affection, and that true Love hath no termination: but <note n="r" place="margin">Paedag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that <hi>Macrobius</hi> his opinion is most probable, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was disposed there upon principle of frugality, the better to preserve it from attrition, or wearing: to which I may add, to secure it also from slipping off, being guarded on every side with others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>With my Body I thee worship]</hi> A great question it is what may be the true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> import of these words, and what expedient will be found to free them from the terrible Idolatry imputed to them by people, who worship nothing more than the Idols of their own Imaginations. The best way to interpret them, in my slender judgment, is to consider that the Languages and Phrases of Elder times, differed from this of ours so vastly, as innumerable words have quite lost their native and primary significations, and require new <hi>Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> or new intellectuals to understand them. In certain Prayers at the end of King Henry the eighth his Primer, (from whence those at the end of our Psalter are extracted) amongst other very odd oppressions, take this for one, <hi>My five wits (i. e.</hi> senses) <hi>have I fouly mis-spent.</hi> How innocent was in those dayes the word <hi>Knave?</hi> which later times have animated with a mind, so various from the former, as to apply it now to such as the early Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bible hath done, would look like an odious blasphemy. Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of instances might be produced, as the <hi>Ballad</hi> of <hi>Ballads</hi> for the <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, they have thrils and stink not,</hi> &amp;c. would the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The inference from all this is, that seeing words are not now in the mind they were; this of worship must not be bound to abide what sense our curious and subtile ones shall award it; if therefore, as we use it now, it denoteth an address of special-honour, either divine, or civil, to that wherein we acknowledg an excellency above us; it doth not therefore follow, that the first contrivers of this form so meant it. I rather think they aimed at nothing, either more or less, but that of the Apostles. <hi>The Husband had</hi>

                  </gap>; <hi>Let the Presbyters visit all such persons.</hi> A duty of all most necessary at that time, when both body and soul cry aloud for help, and present help too, or both must perish ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly. The Minister must help to ransack all the sluts-corners of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients soul, to search narrowly into all his sins, which unrepented of, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file and pollute that consecrated Temple of the Holy Ghost, help him he must by making spiritual applications of exhortation, reproof, consolation, congruous with, and suitable to, his particular necessities: and no time fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for those applications, than this, when the carnal lusts, and unruly passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons languishing with the body, they have all advantages for operation upon the soul.</p>

than that of Brotherly reconciliation; Christs aphorism enforceth it. <hi>If you forgive not men their trespasses, no more will your heavenly Father forgive you your trespasses;</hi> Where mercy and forgiveness are made the condition annext to Gods pardoning our sins. Again, Christ (whose followers we must be) his practice enforceth it. <hi>Father forgive them,</hi> Luke the 23. 34. <note place="margin">Acts 7. 60.</note> So he to his very Persecuters, and to <hi>Steven, Lord lay not this sin to their charge;</hi> what were his last and dying words, should properly be ours.

                  <hi>The Minister may not forget,</hi> &amp;c.] Charity stands upon two legs, <hi>forgiving,</hi>

And the better to excite worldlings to it, it is called, <hi>laying up in store.</hi> If then our deeds of Charity to the Poor, are our <hi>goods works,</hi> and good works are our only <hi>moveables,</hi> which shall follow us to another world, no time more seasonable for them than sickness, when we are packing up to be gone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confession and Absolution.]</hi> Here the Church approveth of, though she doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> not command, <hi>Auricular confession.</hi> Many times poor soules lye labouring under the pangs of an horrid reflex upon the number or greatness of their sins, and the dreadful wrath of God deservedly expected for them. In this case, no remedy comparable to an humble and sincere confession at large, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, and sometimes restreined to some one particular predominant sin, of whose pressure he finds the greatest weight: upon which confession, mixt with a vehement and earnest plying the Throne of God, for mercy, it becomes the Minister instantly to interpose, to lay before him the inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble treasure of Gods infinite mercies, to assure him of his interest therein, and upon the hypothesis of his contrition to be serious and unfeigned, to give him <hi>Absolution.</hi> Not that at the moment of such Absolution, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the sinners pardon is sealed in Heaven, which is done at the very first minute of his repentance, if to the great <hi>Critick of hearts,</hi> (as he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self) the All-seeing God, it appeareth cordial: but that, that Pardon be evidenced to him, and manifested by unspeakable comforts, usually flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a disconsolate soul upon the pronouncing of such Absolution, God thereby countenancing and giving reputation both to his word and Ministery. But there being two Absolutions mentioned in the former Offices, one at Morning Prayer, and the other in the Communion service, it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, why only this is in the first person, <hi>I absolve thee?</hi> The answer is, there are three Opinions concerning <hi>Absolution.</hi> The first, entertained by a few, conceive it <hi>Optative, precarious,</hi> or by petition only, as praying for the pardon of the sins of the Penitent. The second think it <hi>Declaratory</hi> only, that is pronouncing the Penitent absolved, by applying Gods promises to the signs of his cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ition. Lastly, some contend that it is <hi>Authoritative,</hi> as deriving power and commission from God, not to declare the party absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but for the Priest to do it in words denoting the first Person. All these three opinions our Church seemeth in part to favour, the first under these words, <hi>Almighty God have mercy on you, pardon, and deliver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ou,</hi> &amp;c. (Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution for the Communion) The second, under these words, <hi>Hath given charge and command to his Ministers, to declare and pronounce to his people, being Penitent, the Absolution and Remission of their sins.</hi> The last by these words, <hi>I absolve thee.</hi> Which <hi>Authoritative</hi> Absolution is rather proper here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:107079:153"/>
where the Priest absolves in his own person, his Absolution is not fitly applicable to any, but such, as have given him evident tokens of hearty sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for their sins, such as Divine chastisements usually causeth: Extendible it is not to whole Congregations (as in the former instances) where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is too general to be conceived in all real: and a confession at large can at most pretend but to an Absolution at large, effectual only to such as truly and sincerely repent.</p>

That spectacle
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:107079:155"/>
of mortality, presented to the eyes of the beholders, is lecture enough to assure them of their like change; and what must they do in the interim?

No. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</hi> Of the Resurrection of their flesh unto glory and eternal life? this undoubtedly. So then funeral solemnities ought to excite in us <hi>Hope,</hi> that is, a certain expectation of the General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: Nor will closet <hi>soli-loquies,</hi> and private contemplation of that day serve our turns; it is a sociable duty, for so the Apostle makes it, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your selves, one another with these words,</hi> 1 Thess. c. 4. v. 18.

Oblations</hi> and <hi>Doles;</hi> these still very frequent, and they continued all along Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her reign; and to give a brief account whence they issued. When once the Prayers of the living began to be believed available for the Dead, no action was thought more expedient for this end than the blessed Eucharist, wherein the Church might invocate an application of Christs merits and passion, then offered in the Symbols of bread and wine, to the benefit of those souls departed. And because even the Eucharist it self was conceived languid in its usual effects, when destitute of Offerings and Almes, they therefore who were neerest al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to the party deceased, did usually freely both offer somewhat towards the scod or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aiment of the Priest who did officiate, and also give Almes for the relief of the Poor. This being at first arbitrary, and at will, about the year 1000. began to be rated at a certainty. A King, a Duke, a Bishop, &amp;c. being taxed at what sums should be offered at their respective Funerals, as also to what number of poor people their Almes should be distributed: but this course contracting an ill savour toward the Clergy, as if they rejoyced at the death of Christians, which brought them such a booty, it was ordered that no Priest should exact any thing upon such occasions, but take he might what was freely offered him. This was the first original of these Oblations and Doles, which were not only peculiar to the <hi>Burial Office,</hi> but were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated at the <hi>eighth Day, Trental</hi> and <hi>Anniversary</hi> commemoration of the Dead. All which being proscribed at the Reformation, these donatives and largesses waited still upon the Funerals, and so continued in some places until very late years. As for <hi>Mortuaries,</hi> which must not be forgot, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still in force by the Statute 21. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 6. they became due upon a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral presumption that the deceased party did fail in the payment of the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi> Tithes, saith Sir <hi>Edw.

Wherefore will ye die, O ye house of Israel, seeing that I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord God? Turn you then, and you shall live. Although we have sinned, yet have we an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he it is that obtaineth grace for <note place="margin">i John ii.</note> our sins.

Let us therefore return unto him, who is the merciful receiver of all true penitent sinners, assuring our selves that he is ready to receive us, and most willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us, if we come to him with faithful repentance, if we will submit our selves <note place="margin">Esai liii.</note> unto him, and from henceforth walk in his ways: If we will take his easie yoke <note place="margin">Matth. xi.</note> and light burthen upon us, to follow him in holiness, patience, and charity, and be ordered by the governance of his holy spirit, seeking always his glory, and serving him duly in our vocation with thanksgiving. This if we do, Christ will deliver us from the curse of the Law, and from the extream malediction which shall light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that shall be set on the left hand, and he will set us on his right hand, and give us the blessed benediction of his Father, commanding us to take possession of his glorious kingdom, unto the which he vouchsafe to bring us all, for his infinite mercy. Amen.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THE Thanksgiving of women after Childebirth]</hi> when holy Scripture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> is concerned most graphically to describe sorrow superlative, and at the height, it assiimilateth it to that of <hi>a woman in travail.</hi> If this sorrow be so excessive, how great must the <hi>joy</hi> be to be delivered from that <hi>sorrow?</hi> commensurate certainly, and of adequate proportion: and no less must the dues of thankfulness be to the Benefactour, the Donor of that Recovery; whence a necessity of <hi>Thanksgiving of women after chide-birth.</hi> But cannot this as well be done in private, at home in her family, or in her closet, without putting the Church to the cost of contriving a solemn Office for it, considering, there are other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal deliverances, wherein the dispensations of Gods mercy are as manifest, whereof she takes no notice? I answer, Other Deliverances present themselves in so many scheames, some being from fire, some from water, some from the casual ruine of houses, and other things endangering us, some from our own precipitations, some in warr, some in peace, &amp;c. as it is scarce possible to frame formes enough to suit all emergences, and were they framed, rarely would they be made use of,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:107079:163"/>
in regard the occasions to which they relate so seldome occurr, and then what would they prove but an unnecessary cumber: whereas this Preservation out of Childe-bed pangs observeth one constant shape, so as one form is applicable to all, and almost dayly provoketh to the duty. But it may be further opposed, that Thousands are seased with corporal maladies, which are accompanied with as great pericli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whom God sometimes, even to miracle, restoreth to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer strength, that those demonstrations of his protection appear very frequent, that one forme of Thanksgiving would commodiously enough agree with all, yet hath the Church appointed no such Form. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that our Church in this offer, did not so much take measure of the peril, as accomodate her self to that note of separation which God himself had put betwixt this and other maladies; To <hi>conceive, and bring forth in sorrow</hi> was signally inflicted upon <hi>Eve,</hi> and in her upon all Mothers, as a penalty for her first disobedience; <hi>Multiplying I will</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>multiply thy sorrowes, and thy Conception,</hi> the very breeding fits, and nauseous qualmes constitute a part of this chastisement. <hi>In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children,</hi> i. e. the very fruit of thy womb, which by an almighty Power, thou shouldest otherwise have been delivered of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least sense of pain, shall, henceforward, in the very act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turition, put thee to extremity of Torment: so that, the sorrows of childe-birth have, by Gods express determination, a more direct, and peculiar reference to <hi>Eves</hi> disobedience, then any other disease what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, and though all maladies are the product of that first sin, yet is the malediction fixed and apply'd in specification to this alone. Now, when that which was ordained primarily, as a curse for the first sin, is converted to so great a blessing, God is certainly in that case more to be praised in a set and a solemn Office.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Churching of women.]</hi> The former word was <hi>Purification,</hi> worthily expunged by our second Reformers; this notwithstanding, we are charged by some weak Opponents to Judaize in the office, a slander certainly, a great, a sensless one, and it will appear no less to any, who shall compare the <hi>Jewish</hi> or Levitical, and the <hi>English</hi> practice together. First, the Jewish woman was interdicted the Sanctuary forty dayes at least. The <hi>English</hi> woman withdraweth but her moneth, No Judaizing there. Secondly, The Jewish woman was forbidden, because unclean, expresly so; the <hi>English</hi> woman abstaineth not upon any such account. If she did, First, the customary circuit of the same cause would operate, at every return, the same effect (sequestration from the Congregation) in her, as it did in the Jewish; but our Church commands no such mensurnal forbearance. Again, the same pollution would as long debar her Infant also (as it did the Jewish) which must needs take part of the Mothers impurity, but our Church not onely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mitteth, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all Infants (where necessity interposeth not) into the Church within a week at the farthest. So No Judaizing there. Thirdly, the Jewish woman was interdicted, that is excluded by necessity of Law, the English woman not so, her separation is voluntary, not constrained by any Law of our Reformed Church, no nor by the Canon Law, <hi>Nunc statim post partum Ecclesiam ingredi non prohibetur: Now under the Gospel, she may, if she please, theres no prohibition to the contrary, enter the Church as soon as she is delivered:</hi> No Judaizing here. Lastly, the Jewish <note place="margin">Dist. 5. c. Haec q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ae.</note> woman was bound to Legal offerings <hi>a Lamb, Turtles, or Pigcons.</hi> The English woman is tied to none of these, onely injoyned Evangelical Oblations, poor pittances, and inconsiderable retributions, yet such as God graciously accepts by the hands of his Ministers, as evidences
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:107079:163"/>
of a grateful heart, for so eminent a blessing. This, if any, is all the resemblance this Office beareth to the Jewish rite, which cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be blamed, but upon a false <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> that we are obliged not to be thankful to God for this mercy, because the <hi>Jews</hi> were so. Now if it be demanded upon what motives this months abstinence from Church is founded, I answer, upon Custome and uninterrupted Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Practice that had strong inducements to it. First, Some reasons of conveniency latent, and not so fit to be declared. Secondly, A provident regard to the womans personal safety. The whole structure of her body suffereth a kind of luxation through her labour, and therefore requireth no few daies to knit and reconsolidate, she becomes feeble in her strength, wasted in her spirits, and such decayes of nature are not repaired on the suddain. Thè pores of her skin by exsudati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are relaxed, and when so many wind-dores are open, the cold air (deaths usual harbinger) is ready to enter. So that her stay at home is of medical prescription.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shall come into the Church]</hi> If the woman come no further than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Church, how can she <hi>there kneel nigh unto the Table, or the Priest stand by her,</hi> when both <hi>Priest and Table</hi> are at the East end of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel? Therefore to reconcile this Rubrique with the constant practice of Churching the woman in the Chancel nigh unto the holy Table, you must understand that in this place the word Church, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the consecrated fabrique, both the Body and Chancel; no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel <note place="margin">l. 1. c. de Off Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia coni. v.

               <p>
                  <hi>I have list up mine eyes,</hi> &amp;c.] The trifling objection of the abuse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> this Psalm, by the womans usual coming in a vail is easily answered, by affirming that the Church, as she doth not forbid, so neither doth she command any such habit, but leaveth it as an indifferent thing; and if the woman, who hath an arbitrary power in this concernment, think fit to come forth vailed, that is, better armed against the cold, her act cannot constitute a ceremony of the Church, and so the Church not chargeable with the abuse. Nor can this Psalm be truly said to be abused, thus applied, when the contents thereof are expresly thus, <hi>This Psalm teacheth that the faithfull ought onely to look for help from God.</hi>

The manner you must understand was then for the Priest, who did officiate to rehearse it as our Office directeth; And this last Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not returned by the People, but by the Quire or Chorus, and that with an elevated voice. The design whereof was to give notice to the People, that the Lords Prayer was drawing on to an end, that they might be the more ready to aford their <hi>Amen.</hi> For the Service being all in Latin, a tongue unknown to them, all their business at Church was onely to joyn in the close of <hi>Amen,</hi> and for this they had no other <hi>queve</hi> to direct them, then the loud pronunciation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going member by the Chorus: in the Lords Prayer, <hi>But deliver us from</hi>

                  <hi>non saepius. But I see no reason why it should be restrained to one day</hi> (for so it was by the first Liturgy of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth) <hi>and not exhibited oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> whereupon it was appointed to be used <hi>divers times in the year.</hi> In our Church before the Reformation, its Antecessor, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or <hi>the great curse,</hi> was pronounced four times in the year: on the first <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>Advent,</hi> the first <hi>Sunday</hi> in clean <hi>Lent,</hi> on <hi>Trinity</hi> Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the next Sunday after the <hi>assumption</hi> of our <hi>Lady.</hi> The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of these <hi>divers times,</hi> is not setled by any precise rule of our Church, but in the visitation Articles of Arch-Bishop <hi>Grindal</hi> for his Province of <hi>Cantrebury</hi> Anno 1576, as a learned Collector informs me; it seems there are three daies mentioned, as relating to this Office.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>One of the three Sundaies next before Easter, one of the two Sundaies next before Pentechost, one of the two Sundaies next before Christmas.</hi> These, I take it, were added <hi>to Ash-wednesday,</hi> not exclusive <hi>of</hi> it, by cause the following Preface seems to have a peculiar relation to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Priest shall go into the Pulpit.]</hi> But why not rather into the Desk. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Answer, Because at the beginning of the Reformation, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Liturgy there was no such thing as a Desk known in the Church; not a sillable of this Reading-Pew in the Injunctions of either King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> none in any Orders or Ad, vertisements set forth by the supream Authority, none in any Canons Ecclesiastical, and to the best of my inquiry, none in any visitation Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle until the year 1603. when by the 82. Canon, it is ordained, <hi>that a convenient seat be made for the Minister to read Service in.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> was at first designed not onely for preaching, but also for other things tending to the edification of the People: there, even before our Liturgy established, and while the Romish Mass stood intire in practice was <note n="a" place="margin">Injunct. Edw. 6. 22. Anno 1547.</note> 
                  <hi>the Epistle and Gospel, and one Chapter of the New Testament in the forenoon, and one Chapter of the Old Testament in the afternoon,</hi> as also the <note n="b" place="margin">ibid. 4. &amp; Injunct. 1 Elis. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Pater Noster,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Commandements,</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be read. All these in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and the three last in the time of <hi>(c)</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> This being thus, it will be worth the inquiry, what it was, that did first dictate to us the necessity of the Reading-desk. The satisfying of which doubt, will reside in reminding you of what I discoursed upon the Rubrique before Morning Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> that the service was to be said in the <hi>Accustomed place of the Church or Chancel.</hi> That this place regularly, was the Quire or Chorus; now because in some Churches, a belfery interposing, or over great distance impeding the voice, the People would bear too slender a part in those Orations, it was therefore in such cases left to the Ordinaries discretion to vary from the former course, and to assign <hi>such a place as he should think meet for the largeness and straightness of the Church and Quire</hi> (for so are the words of the Advertisements). Now this liberty was as readily taken as freely indulged. The Ordinaries flexible at the sollicitations of their subordinate Ministres, allowing them in several places to supersead their former practice, setling the Morning and Evening Service in the Church, as a place more edifying, and in order to it tolerating the frame of a Reading-desk, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation begun at first by some few Ordinaries, became in process of time to be recommended from one to another, untill it amounted to a general and universal practice.</p>

                  <hi>they did not exhibit evident tokens of contrition before they were cast upon their death beds.</hi> So that if the <hi>Greek</hi> Church be thought <hi>severe,</hi> the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> may be called <hi>cruel.</hi> The truth is, the <hi>Africans</hi> being kept in awe by the faction of <hi>Novatus &amp; Novatianus,</hi> were forced to carry a stricter hand in discipline than otherwise they would, and therefore when their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries declined in their reputation, they relaxed and grew gentler to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards delinquents, tendring the peace of the Church to all indefinitly, who did on their death beds desire it; as did the Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> also in the vacacy of that Sea determine, <hi>cum spes vivendi secundum hominem nulla substiteret, caute &amp; sollicite subveniri, then to afford Absolution, when the offenders are given over as dead men.</hi> As the <hi>Latin</hi> Church outwent <note place="margin">Inter op.

                  <hi>Then the Bishop raising himself from prayer, laid his hands upon them, sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led holy water and cast ashes upon their heads, covering them with sackcloath, with sighs and sobs denounced against them, that as <hi>Adam</hi> was expelled out of Paradice, so were they thrust out of the Church for their iniquities; then he commanded the doores-keepers to drive them out, all the Clergy persuing them with this Responsory, In the sweat of thy brows shalt thou eat thy bread.</hi> Thus <hi>Gratian,</hi> from the Councel of <hi>Agatha.</hi> Confest it is, this <hi>Canon</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry justly suspected for an imposture, nor do I further urge this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, then as Authors of unquestionable credit furnish us with most of the same parcells scattered here and there, without method.

                  <hi>not to assemble with them: for they call him Adam, as one that hath eaten of the forbidden frute, and therefore adjudge him to be cast out of Paradice, meaning thereby their Church.</hi> Now though true it is, these <hi>Adamiani</hi> were accounted Heretiques, yet <hi>Epiphanius</hi> mentions this as their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, not as their heresy. Heresy it could not be which was embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Orthodox Fathers of that Church, who looked upon their <note place="margin">Hierom. in Hoseam. l. 2. c. 6.</note> Penitents under the same notion <hi>Praevaricati sunt pactum Dei in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia; sicut praevaricatus est Adam in Paradiso, sic isti ejiciantur de Ecclesia,</hi> saith <hi>Hierome</hi> of the excommunicated persons of his daies. <hi>They have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Covenant of their God in the Church, as Adam transgressed in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, and declare they are his followers, that, as he out of Paradise, so are they thrust out of the Church. Augustine</hi> to the same purpose, <hi>In hoc Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diso, id est Ecclesia, solent à Sacramentis Altaris visibilibus homines disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina Ecclesiastic a removeri.

                  <hi>discipline is wont to shut out some men from the visible Elements of the Altar.</hi> A thing so clear, as some derive the very institution of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical service from that President; Now if any shall say, that this expulsion was onely a sequestration of the Person excommunicated from the outward Communion and society of the faithful in <hi>Sacris,</hi> and though these Testimonies firm the comparison betwixt such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and <hi>Adam,</hi> yet speak they short of the rite mentioned by <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:</hi> viz. <hi>the driving them out of the Church,</hi> as it denoteth the place of Gods worship. I answer, that there is no absolute necessity to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Interpretation to one which is appliable to both, especially considering, that the one so naturally results from the other. And did these passages speak short, yet others there are home enough, that especially of St. <hi>Hierome</hi> who speaking of his <hi>Fabiola,</hi> her not entring <note place="margin">Epist. Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola.</note> the Church saith, <hi>Sacerdos ejecerat, the Priest had cast her out,</hi> where is full evidence both for the act of Expulsion it self, from the Church, and for the person expelling, the Priest, which according to the idiome of Antiquity alwaies imported none inferiour to the Bishop. As for the restraint of this solemne exclusion to <hi>Ashwednesday, Gratian</hi>'s word must be taken; and for ought I see, well it may, considering nothing can be urged against it, as labouring of any irrational absurdity. As concerning Penitents presenting themselves at the Church door, it is <note place="margin">Ubi supra.</note> undoubtedly true, there they were to stand during the time of Divine Service, <hi>Fabiola</hi> before mentioned, <hi>Non est ingressa Ecclesiam, did not enter into the Church.</hi> So the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy writing to St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the <note place="margin">Inter op. Cyprian. 31.</note> vacancy of that Sea. <hi>Adeant ad limen Ecclesiae sed non utique transiliant, The Penitents, may come to the threshold of the Church, but step beyond they</hi>

                  <hi>must not.</hi> And this helps us to the reading of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s <hi>Adgeniculari charis Dei,</hi> where it was <hi>aris Dei</hi> before. If Penitents might not set so much as a foot over the threshold of Gods house, they could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said <hi>adgeniculari aris,</hi> to kneel at the Altar. There was indeed a great enmity between Altars and persons of that State, so great, as he who was absolved was said to be reconciled <hi>to the holy Altar, Divino Altari.</hi> And this reconciliation was not to the Altar it self neither, <note place="margin">Concil. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thag. Can. 7. Concil. Tolet. 1. Can. 2.</note> but to the Sacramental Symbole consecrated at the Altar, and then his postliminiation gave him liberty to approach no nearer the Altar then the <hi>Cancellum,</hi> and consequently no Adgeniculation at the Altars in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged to the very faithfull themselves, and if not to them, much less to Penitents. Their stations being then assigned them without doors, there did they <hi>adgeniculari charis Dei,</hi> supplicate the dear Saints of God as they entred the Church: there did they beg <hi>patrocinium sanctae plebis ad Deum obsecrandum, the assistance of the holy Congregation to entreat God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Tertullian. de Penitent.</note> 
                  <hi>in their behalf,</hi> according to the Greek form mentioned before. As for the Ceremonies related by <hi>Gratian,</hi> which were indicative of interiour humiliation, and, as it were, silent Confessions, cause I have to think, they were rather Spontaneous Compliances with the received Fashions of those times, then the Result of any Ecclesiastical Canon; but whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so, or not so; certain it is in use they were. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> describing Penitents in their splendid Formalities, sets them out thus, that they <note place="margin">de lapsis.</note> did, <hi>stratos solo adhaerere cineri, in cilicio &amp; sordibus volutare</hi> (or, as <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian, solio &amp; cineri incubare,) cast down upon the floor, wrap themselves up in filthy and course sachin.</hi> So S. <hi>Hierome, Fabiola saccum induerat, ut errorem publice fateretur, had put on saccloth, that she might testifie to all the world, she had fallen:</hi> Nor is this all; he addeth, she stood <hi>in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine Poenitentium, in the row of Penitents, Discalceatis pedibus, barefoot, with her shoes off,</hi> which <hi>Gratian</hi> maketh another rite appendant to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Pennance: In this posture and habit, <hi>illoti, &amp; sordulenti, &amp; extra laetitiam,</hi> to use <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s phrase, <hi>nastily defiled with dirt, abandoning all signes of joy,</hi> continued they all the time of sacred Offices, untill that of the Eucharist was finished; which being done, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation risen, as they were coming forth out of the Church, the Penitents, <hi>Sozomen</hi> tells us, <hi>with howling and great lamentation fell gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling before them, and the Bishop, coming up to them, cast himself prostrate</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hist. Eccles. l. 7. c. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>also, with great mourning, the Congregation all be-drenched with tears; then the Bishop, rising up first, and the rest after him, he sent up his Prayers to God for them, and so dismissed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus laid down the several Scheams and Fashions of both Primitive Churches, during the time of Pennance, it will be now proper to survey, how they recovered those Rites from which they fell. For which work, it is very probable in both Churches, One pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar day; though not in both, One and the same; was set apart: what that day was in the Greek Church, I am not yet satisfied, what in the Latine, all those Ancient Rituallists published by <hi>Hittorph,</hi> with <hi>Durandus, Durantus,</hi> and others of Later Edition, who constantly fix it precisely upon <hi>Mandy-Thursday,</hi> seem to put it out of question, which possibly was exactly true in reference to the times wherein they wrote, and not very wide from the more ancient limitation; For S. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erom</hi> giving us an account of <hi>Fabiola</hi>'s Reception into the Comumon of the Faithfull, saith, It was <hi>sub diem Paschae, very near Easter,</hi> and must consequently fall into the holy week; But S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press in his epistle to <hi>Marcellina,</hi> who sending her a kinde of Journal of <note place="margin">Epist. 53. l. 5.</note> that great Tumult about his not delivering up of the Church, he giveth

it this date, <hi>Erat autem Dies, quo sese Dominus sese pro nobis tradidit, quo in Eccelesia Poenitentia relaxatur. Now it was the Day whereon our Lord delivered himself for us, whereon publick Pennance is released in the Church. Nor was this a day of general release,</hi> but restrained onely to such as had gone their full time of Pennance, and had compleated it, as it was prefix'd. As for the rites belonging to this Reconciliation, they were in both Churches conformably two, one proper to the <hi>Absolved,</hi> the other to the <hi>Absolving</hi> Person: the <hi>Absolved</hi> being produced in the face of the Congregation, made there publick Confession of his sinnes, then called, <hi>Exhomologesis,</hi> whereupon he was absolved with imposition of hands; in which, the Bishop, as he ought, did preside. And this is that very <hi>Imposition of hands</hi> intended by the Apostle 1 to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 5. 22. where he commands him <hi>to lay hands suddenly upon no man,</hi> as the learned <hi>Annotator</hi> of late, and <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old hath observed, to my apprehension, most truly.</p>
               <p>Thus stood the discipline of the Antient Church for the first six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, she keeping therein a decent <hi>medium,</hi> between two extreames.

               <p>That this most laudable, most edifying way of Christian <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by Ecclesiastical Censures; should, in a Church assuming the Stile of <hi>Reformed,</hi> be so almost totally abandoned: That a Discipline, so Apostolical, so Primitive, should, in a Church, justly pretending to be the very <hi>Parallelogram,</hi> and true Representation of those excellent Copies, be so very near invisible: That the restauration thereof should hitherto become the Vote of so many, and Endeavour of so few, is to me a very great wonder. Perhaps, some will say, that this strict disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline seemed rather to magnifie the Power of the Keyes, and Authority of the Clergy, then the mercies of God, Mercies so inexhaustible as all our sinnes are in comparison of them, but <gap reason="foreign">

First, that Christianity was but then in the bud, the Profession thereof thinly despersed in the crowd of Pagans, where the least moral Scandal would have been a great blemish to the whole party, and consequently impeded the gaining of Proselites. For it is a rule infallible, that No Sect whatsoever can thrive and prosper, whose Professors do not exhibite a fair front of Moral Virtues in their outward Actions: Upon this account it was expedient, that, the Church, under the penalty of the deepest of her Censures, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, from all her subordinates, such a practical and exemplary purity, as might render her most resplendent, even in the opinion of her greatest enemies. Again, Emperours and Supream Magistrates had not then embraced Christianity, and consequently, no Lawes established to punish such crimes as were of meer Ecclesiastical relation, and, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of such Lawes, the Church had all the reason in the world to exercise that spiritual Jurisdiction Christ had empowered her with, to those intents for which it was given: And though since Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates have taken the Church to nurse Political Lawes, take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of, and punish all notorious offenders, and so her Censure now

Secondly, it is evident by another Epistle of <hi>Calvin</hi> to <hi>Bucer,</hi> then here in <hi>England,</hi> referring to the former Letter. <hi>Dominum Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorem ut volebas conatus sum hortari.

This is apparent by the occanon of his leaving <hi>Strasburgh.</hi> In the year 1548. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, then Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, caused at the diet of <hi>Ausburgh</hi> a form of Religion to be drawn up, so modified in accomodation to the both Romish Catholiques and Protestants, as he expected both Parties would subscribe unto it: and because it was onely intended as the standard of Belief, until the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent</hi> should add to the points contraverted, a final determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and no longer, it was therefore called the <hi>Interim.

And amongst all others, I am commanded of God, especially to move and exhort you, to reconcile your selves to your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, whom you have offended, or who hath offended you, putting out of your hearts, all hatred and malice against them, and to be in love and charity with all the world, and to forgive other, as you would that God should forgive you. And if there be any of you, whose conscience is troubled and grieved in any thing, lacking comfort or counsel, let him come to me, or some other discreet and learned Priest, taught in the Law of God, and confess and open his sinne and grief secretly, that he may receive such ghostly counsel, advise and comfort, that his conscience may be relieved, and that of us as a Minister of God, and of the Church, he may receive comfort and absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the satisfaction of his mind, and avoiding of all scruple and doubtfulness: requiring such as shall be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a general confession, not to be offended with them that doth use, to their further satisfying, the auricular and secret confession to the Priest, nor those also, which think needful or convenient for the quietness of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, particularly to open their sinnes to the Priest, to be offended with them which are satisfied with their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble confession to God, and the general confession to the Church: But in all these things to follow and keep the rule of Charity: and every man to be satisfied with his own conscience, not judging other mens minds or acts, whereas he hath no warrant of Gods Word for the same.</p>

And that day not drink it all up himself, but taking one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sup or draught, leave the rest upon the Altar covered, and turn to them that are disposed to be partakers of the Communion, and shall thus exhort them as followeth.</hi>

                  <p>Dearly beloved in the Lord, ye comming to this holy Communion, must consider what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> how he exhorteth all persons diligently to trie and examine themselves, or ever they presume to eate of this bread and drink of this cup; for as the benefit is great, if with a truly penitent heart, and lively faith, we receive this holy Sacrament, (for then we spiritually eate the flesh

of Christ, and drink his bloud: Then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us; we be made one with Christ, and Christ with us): So is the danger great, if we receive the same unworthily, for then we become guiltie of the body, and blood of Christ our Saviour, we eat and drink our own damnation, because we make no difference of the Lords body; we kindle Gods wrath over us, we provoke him to plague us with divers diseases, and sundry kindes of death. Judge therefore your selves (brethren) that ye be not judged of the Lord. Let your minde be without desire to sinne: Repent you truly for your sinnes past, have an earnest and lively Faith in Christ our Saviour, be in perfect Charity with all men, so shall ye be meet partakers of these holy Mysteries: But, above all things, you must give most humble and hearty thanks to God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, for the Redemption of the world, by the death and passion of our Saviour Jesus Christ, both God and man, who did humble himself, even to the death, upon the Cross, for us miserable sinners, lying in darkness, and the shadow of death, that he might make us the children of God, and exalt us to everlasting life: And, to the end, that we alway should remember the exceeding love of our Master and Saviour Jesus Christ, thus doing for us; and the innumerable benefits which by his precious blood shedding he hath obtained to us, he hath left in these holy Mysteries, as a pledg of his love, and a continual remembrance of the same, his own blessed body and precious blood, for us spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually to feed upon, to our endless comfort and consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To him therefore, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, let us give, as we are bound, continually thanks, submitting our selves wholly to his holy will and pleasure, and studying to serve him in true holiness and righteousness, all the daies of our life. Amen.</p>

Compiled and digested it was, by <hi>Osmund</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> about the year 1099. The reason gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by <hi>Harpsfeild</hi> is. <hi>quoniam singulae fere Dioceses in statis &amp; precariis ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris dicendis variabant ad hanc varietatem tollendam, ut quasi absolutum quoddam precandi, quo omnes uti possent, exemplar extaret: That because almost almost all Dioceses had their seveal waies and uses in their services and Canonical houres, to take away that diversity, this should be as a standing form for all to follow.</hi> But this reason I cannot assent unto: for what had <hi>Osmund</hi> to do, to give the rule to other Dioceses?

               <note place="margin">Malmsbur. de Gestis Pontif. l. 1.</note> Anno 1075. decreed it was, according to ancient Canons, that Bishops Seas should no longer be held in Villages, but removed to Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Thereupon <hi>Hermanus</hi> translated his chair from <hi>Shirburn</hi> to <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> where he began to edify a Cathedral, but died before he finisht it. Next him succeeded this <hi>Osmund,</hi> who having compleated the structure, Clergy-men most eminent for learning from all parts were invited, by a liberal allowance there to reside. The Church being built, and furnished thus with so gallant a Colledge of Prebendaries, <hi>Osmund</hi> took it into his next care, that Divine Service might there be performed with equal splendor. Hereupon he contrived the Office called the <hi>Course of Salisbury,</hi> and provided such a set of excellent <note place="margin">Malmsb. ubi supra l. 2.</note> Singing-men to officiate it, that <hi>Emicabat</hi> (so are the words of my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>ibi magis quam alias canonicorum claritas cantibus nobilium: The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons thereof could nowhere else be matched for their Art in Musick.</hi> This Service of <hi>Salisbury</hi> being now cryd up as a most noble model.

And perhaps upon this very score his Sea obtained from posterity as a mark of honour, that preeminence whereof <hi>Lindwood</hi> gives this account. <hi>Episcopus Sarum in Collegio Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum est praecentor, &amp; tomporibus quibus Archi-Episcopus Cantuariensis solemniter celebrat Divina, praesente Collegio Episcoporum, Chorum in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinis Officiis regere debet, de Observantia &amp; consuetudine antiqua. The Bishop of Salisbury in the College of Bishops is to be the Praecentor, and at such times as the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury officiateth all the College of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops being present, he ought to govern and direct the Quire insacred Offices. And this he is to do by ancient custome and observation.</hi> And perhaps upon this very score (if it be true as some Romanists affirm) the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was before the Reformation constantly and of course Dean of the King's Chappel, and chief appointer of the Rites and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
