            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
Intelligent Readers.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ad and deplorable (Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
have been our
Sabbatarian Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies:
For while one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
pleads, there is
no other ground for
ſanctifying the Lord's-Day, than there
is for other Holy-days, to wit, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Conſtitution, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to oblige Chriſtians to as religious
Obſervation of other Holy-days as of
Sunday: They aim at an Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
ſeeing in many religious Perſons
<pb facs="tcp:53656:3"/>
there is imprinted this common Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the Lord's-Day ought to be
diſcriminated from other Days. And
this Principle ſo deeply imprinted, as
all Attempts to obliterate, do furbiſh
it and make the writing more legible:
Yea, the circumjacent Cold of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
of the contrary-minded (as by
an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis</hi>) enflames the Zeal of
Men ſeriouſly devout, beyond the due
Bounds, and puſheth them on to the
very Brink, if not into the Gulf of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing
in the manner of celebrating
the Lord's-Day: And on the other
hand, the looſer ſort obſerving, how
ſome of thoſe, that with moſt Earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
preſs the aforeſaid Ground of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Conſtitution, do themſelves
obſerve Holy-days, think they have
fully diſcharged the Office of good
Religious Chriſtians, if they ſanctify the
Lord's-Day, as they celebrate other
Holy-Days; that is, by reſting from
their ordinary Callings, frequenting
the Morning-Prayer (to attend Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſong
is a work of Supererogation)
and trifling away the remainder in
<pb facs="tcp:53656:3"/>
paſs-times. Now what hath or can be
the iſſue of this, but Ignorance and
Prophaneneſs, and an Incouragement
to profane Sundays inſtead of ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
other Holy-days? But I love not
to be querulous (<hi>motos praeſtat compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere
fluctus</hi>) I would much rather
help towards the calming of this
boiſterous Sea; in order whereunto
I ſhall propound theſe Preliminaries.</p>
            <p>1. That the Progreſs of Men's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
for Sundays above other Holy-days
into Superſtition, ought by all
means to be prevented; and the Jewiſh
Yoke of the ſtrict Ceremonial Reſt of
their Sabbath (as well as their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Day
it ſelf) ought to be taken
off the Necks of the Diſciples; becauſe
that Ceremonial Reſt, being a Shadow
of good things to come by Chriſt,
the retaining of the Shadow is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that Chriſt (the Body) is come.
And bodily Reſt, as well as bodily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,
is now under the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
except it be ordinated to
ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>2. That yet a due Reſpect to the
<pb facs="tcp:53656:4"/>
Lord's-Day ought by all means to be
incouraged.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe this ſeems to be the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notion of ſerious Chriſtians, and
that argues it to be an Infuſion from
that one Spirit, into which we are all
baptized, and by which, as their <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectus
Agens,</hi> or common Soul, all
Chriſt's living Members are animated.</p>
            <p>2. Becauſe this is one of the ſureſt
Nails, faſtened by the Maſters of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
for the Support of Religion;
eſpecially in this Age: For this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
is that, that not only brings Men
to Church to worſhip God and to be
inſtructed by him in the Miniſtry of
the Goſpel; but alſo obligeth them in
Conſcience to do ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in their Families on the Lord's-Day,
towards the educating them in
the Nurture and Fear of the Lord,
beyond what they think themſelves
bound to do on the Week-Days;
ſo that if this were an Errour, it would
be an happy Errour, as being an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of bringing Men to the Worſhip of
God and Knowledg of the Truth.
<pb facs="tcp:53656:4"/>
And truly, if I were perſwaded, that
the other Opinion (that the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Lord's-Day hath no other
Ground than Eccleſiaſtical Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
were a Truth; I ſhould think it
a Truth not neceſſary to be publiſhed.
For if Men did not apply themſelves
to the Service of God, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Intereſt of their Souls, with
more Seriouſneſs of Devotion on the
Lord's-Day, than it is poſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them to, in keeping other Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days
(the common Practice of moſt,
and the Principles of the more Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
conſidered) <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi>
would have more Service from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
than the only true God. For how,
I pray, are our very chief Holy-days
celebrated (ſuch as <hi>Chriſtmas, Eaſter,
Pentecost</hi>) Sunday excepted, but by
Carding, Dancing, Revelling, Whitſun-Ales,
<hi>&amp;c?</hi> If God therefore had not
better Sacrifices offered to him, and
Men's Souls better Suſtenance admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to them on the Lord's-Day, Men
would rob God of his Honour, and
ſtarve their own Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53656:5"/>
3. The firſt Errour in the Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Men's Thoughts touching this
Controverſy, is the common Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
of all modern <hi>Litigants,</hi> to wit, That
the Lord's-Day comes in as a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour
in the room of Saturday: Upon
which ſandy Ground it is not ſo eaſy
to lay any ſolid Foundation for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Lord's-Day. For if that
Day which God, by his Example and
Precept, firſt ſanctified for the weekly
Sabbath be Saturday; that Day can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unſanctified, and another adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in its room, but by an Equal if not
a Superiour Authority to that which
conſecrated Saturday. Now a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Authority to the Example and
Precept of God cannot be imagined:
And that which is alledged by either
Party, for the unſanctifying Saturday,
falls far ſhort of Equality to it. For
what argumentative Force can there
be in Chriſt's riſing; his appearing to
his Apoſtles; the Apoſtles aſſembling
on Sundays for the ſanctifying that
Day; comparable to the expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God for ſanctifying Saturday;
<pb facs="tcp:53656:5"/>
much leſs can the Conſtitution of the
Church counter-ballance it. Briefly,
they proclaim Sunday, an uſurping In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder
into the Priviledges of Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
rather than its legal Succeſſour,
who advance it into the Poſſeſſion of
Saturday's Crown (to be the weekly
Holy-day) upon no better claim than
can poſſibly be deduc'd for it, while
they make it a younger Brother.</p>
            <p>4. This Errour in the firſt Digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being incurable, muſt either be
removed out of the way of Men's
Thoughts, when they are pitching
them upon this Argument, or they
will be ever learning, and yet never
come to the Knowledg of the true
Ground, for the ſanctifying of the
Lord's-Day; but will endleſly draw
the Saw of Contention both ways.
That the aboveſaid Errour therefore
may be obviated, I have laid down this
contrary <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> viz. <hi>That Sunday-Sabbath
is elder Brother to Saturday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath:</hi>
That being aſſigned for the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sabbath at the beginning by God's
Precept to <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him to his
<pb facs="tcp:53656:6"/>
whole Poſterity to the end of the
World; and therefore extending to
all Ages, and all Mankind: And this
being aſſigned to the Jews only for
that ſhort time, wherein the Law-giver
was pleaſed to diſpenſe with that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to this Law given to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and that for Reaſons ſufficiently
palpable.</p>
            <p>5. This <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> enervates the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
brought againſt the Divine
Inſtitution of the Lord's-Day, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
Conſcience with a ſolid ground,
of bearing a due religious Reſpect to
it, without danger of Judaizing in the
manner of the Celebration thereof.</p>
            <p>1. To inſtance in their <hi>Herculean</hi>
Argument, drawn from the Gloſs they
put upon that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpoke by <hi>Moſes</hi> by way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation.
If that Day that God reſted
on, was not Saturday but Sunday, his
ſanctifying the Day he reſted on, could
not have reſpect to the after-Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of another Day; for what Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
can be in this, [becauſe God
<pb facs="tcp:53656:6"/>
at firſt reſted on Sunday, therefore he
appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> above two thouſand
Years after the Creation, to command
Saturday to be ſanctified] compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to what is in this [becauſe God
reſted on Sunday (the Seventh Day
in the order of the Creation) he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
bleſſed it and ſanctified it; that
is, ſeparated it by his Precept to <hi>Adam,</hi>
to be the weekly Sabbath.] Indeed
the dream of a <hi>Prolepſis</hi> in this Text,
chargeth <hi>Moſes</hi> with moſt groſs Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
in the uſe of theſe words,
[<hi>and God bleſſed;</hi>] except we fancy an
Anticipation in thoſe other Places of
his Text, where theſe words occur, as
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 22. where, ſpeaking of Fiſh
and Fowl, he ſaith, [<hi>And God bleſſed
them, ſaying, be fruitful and multiply:</hi>]
and <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. ſpeaking of <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> he ſaith, [<hi>And God bleſſed them,
ſaying, be fruitful and multiply.</hi>]</p>
            <p>2. That this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> yields a ſolid
Ground, for the conſciencious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Lord's-Day (ſo as there needs
not any new Conſtitution be made by
Chriſt or his Apoſtles for the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb facs="tcp:53656:7"/>
of it) is manifeſt of it ſelf. For
if Sunday be the Day that God ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
at firſt, to be the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
to the Patriarchs, and was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
celebrated by them, before the
giving of the Law by <hi>Moſes;</hi> the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of the Fourth Command, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging
all Mankind, muſt neceſſarily
refer to that; (and that there is a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
part of that Precept, for the Breach

have Mercy upon us;</hi>] and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obſerving whereof we are taught
to pray [<hi>Incline our Hearts to keep this

Church). And then the Temporary
and Ceremonial Part (both as to the
Day and Mode of keeping it) peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
to the Jews, being part of thoſe
carnal Ordinances, that were impoſed
upon them, until the time of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.) vaniſh of themſelves;
as being antiquated by Chriſt's Croſs,
and give way to the Antient Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Sabbath. And here now our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Riſing from the Dead, his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Appearing to his Diſciples on
<pb facs="tcp:53656:7"/>
Sunday, the Practice of the Apoſtles
and Primitive Church, come in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
with their Auxiliary Force, to
ſtrengthen my <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
the Divine Inſtitution of the
Lord's-Day. For though, as to the
firſt Conſecration therof, theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
ſignify nothing, nor are able to
ſtand upon that old Ground, againſt
the joynt Aſſaults of God's expreſs
Precept and Example for ſanctifying
Saturday: Yet upon the Ground that
I have laid, they are ſubſtantial and
ſtrenuous Seconds, to prove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
of the antient Patriarchal
Sunday-Sabbath, by the Antiquation
of the Jewiſh Ceremonial Saturday-Sabbath;
though they are not of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to appoint a new Lord's-Day,
yet they are ſafe Guides, to point us
to that old Patriarchal Lord's-Day,
whereon the Lord reſted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
commanded the Patriarchal
Church-Catholick to ſanctify it, as their
weekly Sabbath; in Conformity to,
and in Communion with which
Church, extending to all Places and
<pb facs="tcp:53656:8"/>
Ages; Our Saviour, after the rending
of the Vail, roſe upon that Day, and
upon that Day celebrated religious
weekly Aſſemblies with his Apoſtles,
and taught them to do the like, during
thoſe forty Days wherein he convers'd
with them, betwixt his Reſurrection
and Aſcenſion, ſpeaking to them of
the things appertaining to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God.</p>
            <p>3. Laſtly, this ſecures us from falling
into Jewiſh Superſtition, in the manner
of celebrating our Chriſtian Sabbath;
for with the Jewiſh Day, the Jewiſh
manner of keeping that Day vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
So that the Chriſtian Church is
not obliged to ſanctify the Lord's-Day,
in thoſe ſtrict Formalities of bodily
Reſt, and other carnal Obſervances
impoſed upon the Jews; but in the
more generous and man-becoming Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
of contemplating the Glory of
God in the Creation, compleated by
the new Creation of believing, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing
and triumphing in God through
Chriſt; of attending on Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
publick, private and ſecret; of
<pb facs="tcp:53656:8"/>
viſiting the Sick; relieving the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent;
and eating our Bread with Glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heart, on that day above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
that being the Chriſtian weekly
Feſtival, and the Day which God hath
made for us, to be glad and rejoyce
in; neither need we macerate our
ſelves with ſtudying when to begin,
when to end the Chriſtian Sabbath,
at Even, Midnight, or Morning: For
he who (having ſet his Secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in ſuch order, as they give no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
to his Sunday-Devotion)
goes to bed with God on Saturday-Night,
and riſeth with God on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Morning,
and ſpends the Day in
ſuch like Exerciſes as have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
may, after he has commended
himſelf (and his Family if he have
one) to God, go to his Reſt on
Sunday Night (without danger of
prophaning the Sabbath) at his uſual
time. Briefly, the uſefulneſs of this <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi>
is ſo great and apparent, both as
to putting an end to all Strife, even
amongſt the moſt Litigious, and ſetling
inward Peace in the truly Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious;
<pb facs="tcp:53656:9"/>
as I was ſomething jealous, leſt
the proſpect thereof might make the
Arguments I bring for proof of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi>
ſeem to have more weight, than
indeed they have; till I had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
my Papers to ſeveral Perſons
of more quick Underſtanding in the
fear of the Lord, with this humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
That they would weigh their
Contents in the Ballance of their impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Judgments, which, I heartily thank
them, they did, and thereby gave me oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to rectify ſome Paſſages, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to commit this Tract, as it
now ſtands corrected, to publick view.
If it ſhall pleaſe the divine Goodneſs, to
make uſe of ſo mean a Perſon as my
ſelf, towards the ſetling the Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Chriſtians upon a ſafe Ground,
and the binding up of thoſe Wounds,

he was <hi>Prieſt</hi> himſelf to his own Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and therefore muſt have been both
the <hi>Paymaſter</hi> and <hi>Receiver</hi> of the
<hi>Vowed Tithes</hi> (and what would this
have been but a plain mocking of God
under a ſplendid ſhew of Devotion)
except he had in his Eye an order of
<hi>Priests</hi> of the <hi>High God</hi> to pay them
unto, whoſe <hi>Office</hi> it was to <hi>Serve at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53656:16"/>
the Altar,</hi> and whoſe <hi>Priviledge</hi> it was
to <hi>live</hi> of the <hi>Altar.</hi> That is a wild
conceit of <hi>Oleaſter,</hi> that he either
meant to conſume the <hi>Tithes</hi> in <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
or that his Poſterity ſhould pay
them to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> in the time of the
<hi>Law.</hi> This laſt is ridiculous, for how
could <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity (ſo many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations
after) pay the <hi>Tithe</hi> of what
God had bleſt <hi>Jacob</hi> with: and the
firſt is not much better; for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of <hi>Beaſt</hi> and <hi>Fowl</hi> into <hi>Clean</hi>
and <hi>Vnclean,</hi> could have no other
ground before the <hi>Flood</hi> (ſeeing all
were prohibited as to Man's Eating,
till after the <hi>Flood</hi>) but God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
ſome kinds of them to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
in <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and prohibiting other
kinds: which declaration of God's
Will was ſo manifeſt to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
before the <hi>Flood,</hi> as <hi>Noah</hi> knew every
particular kind, both of <hi>Clean</hi> and <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,</hi>
and therefore took to him into
the <hi>Ark,</hi> of the <hi>Clean</hi> by <hi>Sevens,</hi> of the
<hi>Unclean</hi> by <hi>Pairs</hi> (Gen. 7. 2.) and
<hi>Sacrificed</hi> of every <hi>Clean Beast</hi> and
<hi>Clean Fowl</hi> at his coming out of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53656:17"/>
                  <hi>Ark</hi> (Chap. 8. 20.) It had been
therefore an abomination to God for
<hi>Jacob</hi> to have offered the <hi>Vnclean</hi> in
Sacrifice. Now it is apparent that God
gave him <hi>Unclean</hi> as well as <hi>Clean:</hi> if
he himſelf hath given a true Inventory
of his Goods: for he not only ſends his
Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> word, that he had <hi>Aſſes,</hi>
but ſends him a Preſent of twenty <hi>She-Aſſes</hi>
(Gen. 32. 5, 15.) And Chap.
30. 42. we find <hi>Camels</hi> and <hi>Aſſes</hi> that
God had bleſſed him with: yea, that
in his whole Flock he had not one that
he would own for his, but confeſt it
ſtollen from <hi>Laban,</hi> that was not ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ſpeckled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gen. 30. 33.
[<hi>Every one that is not ſpeckled and ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among the</hi> Goats, <hi>and brown among
the</hi> Sheep, <hi>ſhall be accounted ſtollen with
me.</hi>] The <hi>Tithe</hi> of theſe being all
<hi>Vnclean, Jacob</hi> could not offer in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi>
it remains therefore that he
paid them to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the High
God. And ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> could not be
wanting in the time of <hi>Jacob;</hi> for we
find them in being many hundreds of
years after, and yet before the giving
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53656:17"/>
of the Law; witneſs <hi>Jethro, Moſes</hi>'s
Father in Law, who was <hi>Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
(Exod. 3. 1.) and a <hi>Prieſt of the
High God, to whom he offered a Burnt-Offering</hi>
and <hi>Sacrifices, inviting</hi> Aaron
<hi>and the Elders to eat Bread with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord,</hi> Exod. 18. 12. Where,
<hi>before the Lord,</hi> can ſignifie nothing
elſe, but <hi>in the Place appointed for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip: Moſes</hi> being now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp't
at the <hi>Mount of God,</hi> ſo called
from the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> there Erected
for the <hi>Worſhip of God,</hi> the <hi>Tabernacle</hi>
not being yet Built.</p>
               <p>3. That the <hi>Patriarchal Church</hi> had
ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> who had <hi>Publick Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
may be alſo proved from <hi>Gen. 47.
22. The Prieſts Lands were not ſold in
the Famine; but they had Portions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them out of the Kings Store-houſes.
Potiphara, Joſeph</hi>'s Father in Law, was
one of thoſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and had for his
Province, <hi>On,</hi> that is, <hi>Heliopolis</hi> (Gen.
41. 45. and was probably a Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the True God, ſeeing it is hard
to conceive that ſo Religious a Man as
<hi>Joſeph</hi> would have married his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53656:18"/>
Daughter if he had been an <hi>Idolater;</hi>
conſidering how dear ſuch unequal
Matches of the Sons of God to the
Daughters of Men had coſt the <hi>Old
World:</hi> (which <hi>Joſeph</hi> could not be
ignorant of) and how careful his
Great Grandfather <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
Grandfather <hi>Iſaac</hi> were to provide
Wives for their Sons out of Religious
Families. Yea, if <hi>Joſeph</hi> was the
<hi>Egyptian Ox,</hi> their moſt Antient and
Chief <hi>Deity,</hi> as the moſt Learned
conceive: <hi>Egypt</hi> was not ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed
with <hi>Idolatry</hi> at this time,
but that there might be many <hi>Prieſts</hi>
and <hi>Servants</hi> of the True God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
For that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> who took <hi>Sarah</hi>
into his Houſe, ſeems to have had a
Religions Senſe of the True God, by
his Expoſtulating with <hi>Abraham</hi> (Gen.
12. 18.) And which is moſt ſtrange,
<hi>Abimelech</hi> King of <hi>Gerar,</hi> the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Simeon,</hi>
in the very heart of thoſe ſeven Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whoſe Sins were ripe ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others, ſeems in his Diſcourſe
with <hi>Abraham</hi> touching <hi>Sarah,</hi> to give
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53656:18"/>
great proof of the Uprightneſs of his
heart towards God, and did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the benefit of Interceſſion made
for him by the Prayer of a Prophet,
for otherwiſe God would not have
urged him by that argument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
<hi>Sarah</hi> to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now how
could he have underſtood that, if the
diſtinction of Prophets by Calling,
and the Cuſtome of Perſons ſeparate
by Calling, to put up Prayers for the
People, had not been in uſe in his
Kingdom, which he therefore ſtiles a
<hi>Righteous Nation,</hi> becauſe the Fear of
God (that is, the True Worſhip of
God, ſaith <hi>Grotius) was there, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to</hi> Abraham's <hi>uncharitable and raſh
Cenſure</hi> (Gen. 20. 9, 10.) Nay from
this inſtance of the King of <hi>Gerar</hi> and
his People, it is more than probable,
that the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> forementioned,
and his People were at that time the
Worſhippers of the True God. And
though perhaps part of the <hi>Aegyptian
Priests</hi> were in that degenerate Age
imployed in the Service of <hi>Idols,</hi> yet
the Inſtitution of the Calling it ſelf,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53656:19"/>
and the <hi>Publick Maintenance</hi> annex'd
thereto, was truly <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</p>
               <p>4thly. <hi>From</hi> Cain <hi>and</hi> Abel <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their</hi> Oblations (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 3.) And
it came to paſs, that in proceſs of time
<hi>Cain</hi> brought of the fruit of the ground,
an Offering unto the Lord, <hi>&amp;c. Where
I note,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That they brought their <hi>Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
to <hi>Adam,</hi> who was <hi>Prieſt,</hi> that he
might offer them to God, as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Doctors</hi> teach, (ſaith <hi>P. Fagius.</hi>)
And the Text makes for this: for it is
not ſaid that they themſelves offered
them, but that <hi>they brought them to be
offered to the Lord;</hi> that is, by the
hands of <hi>Adam,</hi> the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of the
Lord.</p>
               <p>2. That they brought them to the
Place appointed for <hi>Prayer,</hi> as <hi>Aben
Ezra</hi> obſerves, from whence it may
be infer'd, that they met together to
worſhip God in a Place deſtined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
and that there were always <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Meetings</hi> of Pious Men for the
Worſhip of God; and from <hi>Cain</hi>'s not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53656:19"/>
having that due reverence to this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Aſſembly</hi> which he ought to have
had, the <hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> conclude, <hi>That
he who has not a due regard to Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
ſhall have no part in the Age to
come,</hi> (P. Fagius.) And that thoſe
<hi>Oblations</hi> of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> were offer'd
in a <hi>Publick Aſſembly,</hi> is apparent from
the dejection of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Countenance
upon Gods rejecting his <hi>Offering:</hi> for
if God had declared his acceptance of
<hi>Abel</hi>'s <hi>Offering</hi> before <hi>Cain</hi>'s, only in
private to his own Conſcience, what
offence could <hi>Cain</hi> have taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at?
Nay, if God by ſome viſible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of his diſpleaſure, had not ſhamed
him before the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> he would
have been no more affected with a
private Check, then he was with that
which God gave him afterwards,
notwithſtanding which he ſlew his
Brother: beſides, the Apoſtle's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
is a confirmation of this, <hi>Heb.</hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53656:20"/>
moſt Judicious Divines, who conceive
that God gave open Teſtimony of his
acceptance of <hi>Abel</hi>'s Offering, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
it with <hi>Fire</hi> ſent down from
Heaven; ſo <hi>Fagius, Lyra,</hi> &amp;c. ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the Fathers, ſays <hi>Mede, Turi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
&amp;c. and <hi>Ainſworth</hi> obſerves, that
it was uſual for God to declare his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
of Mens <hi>Offerings,</hi> or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them; the firſt, by ſending Fire
from Heaven to conſume them to
aſhes; the other by leaving the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
untouch't. We have Inſtances
of the firſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 9. 24. when
<hi>Aaron</hi> made the firſt <hi>Oblation. 1. Chron.</hi>
21. 26. when <hi>David</hi> Sacrificed on
the <hi>Threſhing-Floor</hi> of <hi>Ornon. 2 Chron.</hi>

<hi>Temple.</hi> And of both, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.
in the Conteſt betwixt Gods <hi>Prophets</hi>
and <hi>Baals.</hi> And in this Caſe of <hi>Cain</hi>
and <hi>Abel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifice was
not toucht by that Fire that conſumed
<hi>Abel</hi>'s: See <hi>Mede, Turinus,</hi> &amp;c. See
<hi>Viccars</hi> his <hi>Decupla,</hi> Pſal. 20. 4. Nay,
ſome <hi>Hebrew Doctors,</hi> ſaith <hi>Fagius,</hi>
tells us, <hi>that in that Fire falling from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53656:20"/>
Heaven, and conſuming thoſe Sacrifices
that God accepted, there was the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Face of a Lion, God thereby
ſignifying that Mens Perſons and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are acceptable to Him only through</hi>
Chriſt, <hi>that Lion of the Tribe of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah.
(<hi>See</hi> Fagius.)</p>
               <p>3. The third Obſervation I make
from this <hi>Text,</hi> is, That <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi>
had Families and Subſtance diſtinct
from <hi>Adam</hi>'s; for <hi>Abel</hi> is commended
for bringing the <hi>Firſtlings</hi> and <hi>Fat</hi> of
the <hi>Flock;</hi> but it would have been no
thanks to him to have cut large ſhives
out of his Fathers Loaf. Which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argument that this was a <hi>Publick
Church-Aſſembly,</hi> conſiſting of many
Families.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth and laſt <hi>Note</hi> I make
upon this <hi>Text,</hi> is this: Seeing <hi>Cain</hi>'s
<hi>Oblation</hi> was not conſumed by Fire,
which way could it be diſpoſed of, but
to the uſe of the <hi>Priest</hi> that officiated.
For it having been once dedicated to
God, could not be alienated, without
<hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and therefore muſt fall to
the Portion of him that ſerved at the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53656:21"/>
                  <hi>Altar,</hi> that he might live of the <hi>Altar,</hi>
having nothing elſe of the <hi>Altar</hi> to
live upon, but the Remainder of <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
of the Fruit of the Ground.
Seeing all <hi>Oblations</hi> of <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Fowl</hi>
were whole <hi>Burnt-Offerings:</hi> (and
therefore by the way, it is a vain
Queſtion to ask, <hi>what became of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of ſuch Sacrifices</hi>) and ſeeing
alſo that Man was then confin'd to the
Fruit of the Ground for his Food. To
conclude, we ſee the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had
ſtated Publick <hi>Religious Aſſemblies,</hi>
Celebrated in Stated Places, ſeparate
to that uſe, and guided by Perſons ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
by <hi>Special Calling</hi> to that Work,
and maintained by <hi>Tithes, Oblations,</hi>
&amp;c. Now it is againſt all Reaſon, to
think that the <hi>Faithful</hi> paid <hi>Tithes</hi> to
their <hi>Prieſts</hi> upon any other account
than that of their <hi>Sowing Spirituals</hi>
in the <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> whoſe

Some Learned Men, to evade that
Mortal Stroak which this <hi>Text</hi> giveth
the <hi>Prolepſis,</hi> are pleaſed to ſay, that by
<hi>Week</hi> is here meant <hi>Seven Years,</hi> which
<hi>Jacob</hi> was to ſerve after his Marriage
to <hi>Leah,</hi> before he had <hi>Rachel</hi> given
to him for Wife: and that the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of a <hi>Seven days Nuptial Feaſt,</hi>
was invented by later <hi>Jews,</hi> and is a
manifeſt Violation of the <hi>Text,</hi> and
Contradictory in it ſelf. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in vindication of that ſenſe of this
<hi>Text</hi> that I give (to wit, that by <hi>her
Week,</hi> is meant the ſeven days of <hi>Leah's
Nuptial Feaſt</hi>) offer theſe things to
Conſideration.</p>
               <p>1. [Fulfil her <hi>Week,</hi> and we will
give thee <hi>this</hi> alſo] Here <hi>her</hi> and
<hi>this</hi> are contra-diſtinguiſh't. And
by <hi>this</hi> is meant <hi>Rachel,</hi> as is manifeſt
of it ſelf; and therefore by <hi>her,</hi> muſt
be meant <hi>Leah;</hi> and by <hi>her Week, Leah</hi>'s
Week. Which can be nothing elſe
but her <hi>Nuptial Feaſt</hi> of ſeven days:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53656:23"/>
for <hi>Jacob</hi> never ſerved ſeven years for
<hi>Leah.</hi> Nay, he would not have ſerved
ſeven days for her, if it had not been
for the love he bare to <hi>Rachel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. [<hi>And</hi> Jacob <hi>did ſo: he fulfilled
her</hi> Week; <hi>and he gave him</hi> Rachel <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to Wife] This anſwers exactly to</hi>
Laban<hi>'s Propoſal: ſo that</hi> her Week,
<hi>both here and there, is</hi> Leah<hi>'s</hi> Week:
<hi>and, the</hi> this alſo, <hi>there, is</hi> Rachel alſo,
<hi>here. The meaning therefore of</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban<hi>'s

this,</hi> Fulfil her Week; <hi>that is, the ſeven
days of</hi> Leah's Nuptial Feaſt: Do not
diſturb the Marriage Feaſt by renouncing
<hi>Leah,</hi> and we will give thee <hi>Rachel</hi> alſo
at the end of the ſeven Nuptial days, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

other ſeven Years; for ſeeing I have cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee of thy Wages for one ſeven Years,
I cannot think thee ſo great a fool, as to
truſt me for one ſeven Years more: and
therefore conſummate thy Marriage with
<hi>Leah</hi> by a voluntary lying with her the
remaining Nights of the <hi>Marriage Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>

thou lay with her this Night) And I

But the reaſons they bring againſt the
other Interpretation, ſway more with
me, than the authority of their great
Names; from the reſt I ſhall Cull this
one of <hi>Tirinus</hi> and <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> Viz.
<q>That it is utterly inconſiſtant with
Scripture Chronologie. For <hi>Jacob</hi>
lived only twenty years with <hi>Laban</hi>
(Gen. 31. 41.) The firſt ſeven where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he ſerved before he Married <hi>Leah,</hi>
and if he had ſerved other ſeven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he Married <hi>Rachel,</hi> the ſix re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53656:24"/>
years would prove too ſhort
a ſpace of time for the Conception,
Birth, and Suckling of the Children
that were born to him after his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of <hi>Rachel.</hi>
                  </q> For the evincing of
this, note,</p>
               <p>1. That it was the Cuſtome of
<hi>Patriarchal Matrons</hi> to Nurſe their
Children. (<hi>Gen.</hi> 21.)</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Reuben, Leah</hi>'s Firſt Born,
was not conceived till ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
time after the Marriage of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel:</hi>
for it was in pity of <hi>Leah</hi> that
God opened her Womb (<hi>Gen. 29. 31.)
[And when the</hi> Lord <hi>ſaw that</hi> Leah <hi>was
hated, he opened her Womb, but</hi> Rachel
<hi>was Barren</hi>] A Barren Virgin ſounds
harſhly in <hi>Phyſicks;</hi> and <hi>Jacob's</hi> loving
<hi>Rachel</hi> before he was Married to her,
more than his Wife <hi>Leah,</hi> ſounds
worſe in Morals.</p>
               <p>3. After <hi>Reuben, Leah</hi> bears three
Sons more, and then ceaſeth Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing,
while <hi>Bilha, Rachel</hi>'s Maid
bare <hi>Jacob</hi> two Sons, and while <hi>Zilpa</hi>
(after <hi>Bilha</hi> had given over Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing)
bare two Sons: after all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53656:25"/>
which <hi>Leah</hi> bears two Sons and one
Daughter: and after that <hi>Rachel</hi> bears
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 30. and is ſo far gone in
Child with <hi>Benjamin</hi> before ſhe left
her Father's Country, as in her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
thence ſhe was <hi>Brought to Bed,</hi>
Gen. 30. So that after <hi>Rachel's</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
<hi>Jacob</hi> had twelve Children born
unto him at ſingle Births, and in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
years; for the Bearing and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
whereof, thirteen years ſpace is
little enough. The <hi>Week</hi> therefore
that <hi>Jacob</hi> fulfil'd, before <hi>Laban</hi> gave
him <hi>Rachel</hi> to Wife, and he went in
unto her (which was the Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Marriage) cannot, without
manifeſt Contradiction of Scripture,
be expounded a <hi>Week of Years,</hi> but of
<hi>Days;</hi> and that <hi>Week of Days</hi> can be
no other than the ſeven Days of <hi>Leah's
Nuptial Feaſt:</hi> and this fulfilling of
<hi>Leah's</hi> Week, did both ſute <hi>Labans</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
humour, who by this means
put off two Daughters with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of one weeks Feaſting; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
<hi>Jacob</hi> from being defrauded of
<hi>Rachel,</hi> after other ſeven Years Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53656:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as he had been the firſt ſeven
years. And laſtly, ſecure <hi>Leah</hi>'s Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
whom <hi>Jacob</hi> might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in the Morning, if his lying
with her that night in-voluntarily, had
not been ſeconded with his voluntary
lying with her the ſucceeding Nights
of the <hi>Feaſt:</hi> No Evaſion here but the
Sanctuary of a <hi>Prolepſis, Jacob</hi> got
Children by Anticipation.</p>
               <p>This argument is ſo cogent, as to
make room for theſe ſo many Births.
From the Premiſes it is apparent, that
the diſtinction of Time by Weeks, was
in uſe in the <hi>Patriarchal Age,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

at large: From whence may be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,</p>
               <p>1. That it is the only certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of Time wherein all Nations
unanimouſly agree. For though the
diviſion of Time into <hi>Months</hi> &amp; <hi>Years,</hi>
be univerſally embraced, yet, about
the Compution of both, there have
been as many different Practiſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
as Nations; ſome reckoning to
a Month more, ſome fewer days, ſome
reckoning to a Year more, ſome few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Months; as the <hi>Romans</hi> before <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius
Caeſar,</hi> had but ten Months in their
Year; and even his emendation of
the <hi>Kalendar</hi> was not exact. But for
this, ſee <hi>Scaliger, De Emendatione
Temporum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That which I infer from the
Premiſes in the next Place, is this,
That the Calculation of Time by
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:53656:26"/>
Months and Years was of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
as being perfected by degrees;
and though the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the
<hi>Flood,</hi> in reſpect of their Longevity,
had a very great advantage of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Courſe of <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> yet
they attained not to ſo perfect a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
thereof, as to ſettle and fix an
<hi>Aſtr onomical Canon,</hi> but left that to
the Induſtry of future Ages: for
otherwiſe <hi>Noah</hi> would have commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
that <hi>Canon</hi> to his Poſterity,
and ſome of them would have kept in
memory, and have delivered down by
uninterruped Succeſſion, a Tradition
ſo univerſally advantagious to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>3. That the Computation of Time
by <hi>Weeks</hi> was of divine Inſtitution, as
being perfect at firſt (as all God's
Works are, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 4.) communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to, and received of the whole
Race of Mankind without diſpute, or
leaſt difference in Practice: till God
was pleaſed to appoint the <hi>Jews</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beginning of <hi>Weeks</hi> (as alſo of
<hi>Years</hi>) than he had inſtituted at the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53656:27"/>

how the whole World could thus una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
agree in this diviſion of
Time by ſevens of Days, if they had
not received it by uninterrupted tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
from the Patriarchs; nor from
whence the Patriarchs could derive it
but from God's reſting upon, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
the <hi>Seventh Day:</hi> Of the

the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors, underſtand

<hi>by dayes, years.</hi> They that
by days underſtand a year of dayes,
conceive theſe Oblations brought by
<hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> to have been brought
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53656:27"/>
at the end of the year, when they had
gathered the Fruits of the Earth; that

crave leave to diſſent, not ſo much
upon the account of the authority of
judicious Mr. <hi>Gataker,</hi> as of the ſtrength
of the reaſon he brings for his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<hi>At the end of dayes,</hi> (i. e.) ſaith
he, that is, on the <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> which
concludes the days of the Week. For
no other diſtinction of days had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been mentioned by <hi>Moſes,</hi> than
that which comprehends the <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
Gen. 2. 2, 3. An Argument of
more weight, if ſeriouſly conſidered,
than it ſeems to have at a tranſitory
Glance, for</p>
               <p>1. It is very probable, that <hi>Adam</hi>

of Gods Mercy to him, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
him by the Blood of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
Seed,</hi> that he greatly minded not
any other Computation of Time, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:53656:28"/>
that which God had appointed him,
in Commemoration of his Perfecting
the Work of <hi>Creation,</hi> by making
<hi>Adam</hi> a New Creature; (of which,
more in the Sequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe)</p>
               <p>2. However, moſt certain it is, that
hitherto no Diviſion of Time but that,
is mentioned; and if <hi>Moſes</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

Years had as ſoon been ſaid as Days:

<hi>Phraſe,</hi> that renders the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
abſurd and unintelligible without

Interpretation at hand of that <hi>Phraſe</hi>
that renders the whole Sentence, in
every Letter of it, every way conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to right Reaſon, and the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of Faith, and is not incumbred with
any abſurd conſequence: for <hi>Satan</hi>
might come into the Preſence of God,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53656:30"/>
in this Senſe, as he entred into <hi>Judas</hi>
while he was celebrating the Paſſover
with our Saviour and the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<hi>John</hi> 13. 27. And God might
diſcourſe with him in this Aſſembly of
God's People without diſturbing the
Congregation, as well as he diſcours'd
with <hi>Moſes</hi> while he ſtood before <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh.</hi>
Divine Revelations may well
be communicated to faithful men,
even in the preſence of bad men
(<hi>Mede</hi> upon <hi>Exo.</hi> 11. 1.) and why may
not God as well diſcourſe with Satan
in the preſence of good men? Why
therefore ſhould we recede from this
literal ſence? eſpecially when we have
the onely Text beſides this <hi>appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Age, where the
ſame Phraſe occurs intire, without
addition or diminution, to warrant me
to make that interpretation, from the
plain and indubitable ſenſe of that
Phraſe in that parallel Text.</p>
               <p>To explain my ſelf more particularly;
the only Text relating to the <hi>Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi>
Age, where this phraſe, <hi>the Sons of
God,</hi> occurs intire, is that, <hi>Gen. 6. 2. the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53656:30"/>
Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of men
that they were fair, and they took them
Wives of all that they Choſe.</hi> I know
ſome of ours are ſo inamour'd of
<hi>Rabbinical Whimſies as to follow the
Hebrew Doctors</hi> in their interpreting
[<hi>Sons of God</hi>] here to be as Angels.
But it's ſtrange how any man not
prejudic'd, and in his Right wits, can
put that Senſe upon the Text; ſeeing
the good Angels neither marry nor are
given in Marriage (<hi>Mar.</hi> 12. 25.) And
though we have ſtories not altogether
improbable, of <hi>Incuby</hi> and <hi>Succuby,</hi> yet a
man may look his Eyes out, before he
find a text where evil Angels are called,
<hi>the Sons of God.</hi> I therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expect the
aſſent of all pious and ſober-minded
men to the <hi>common</hi> expoſition of theſe
Words, to wit; That by <hi>the Sons of God</hi>

members of the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Church:
And by <hi>Daughters of men,</hi> the female
Offspring of <hi>Cain,</hi> the members of that
Synagogue of Satan, which he erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

themſelves before the Lord,</hi> to
tender their Homage, and bring Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
the Preſents of themſelves, and
Devout Services into the Court
of the Lord, into the Lord's Houſe:
ſeeing this is exactly after the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal</hi>
ſtyle, and is not attended with
any abſurd conſequence, as that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
(<hi>by Angels</hi>) is, why
ſhould we not to chooſe expound
one <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Text by another, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then by Texts relating to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times?
The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church might, for
Reaſons then emerging, give An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
the Title of the Sons of God. It's
no new thing, for various Ages to
vary Phraſes: But what is that
to the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Churches ſtyle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſeeing that in the <hi>verſe</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

ſaith, <hi>Grotius,</hi> celebrating a Faſt, and
praying for them, that the Sacrifices
of attonement which he offered for
them might be accepted of God. So
that we have here, <hi>the Sons of God,</hi>
that is,</p>
               <p>1. The members of the Church
conven'd to preſent themſelves before

                  <hi>There is indeed one Text in</hi> Job,
<hi>where this phraſe occurs, with the
Addition of one word, where</hi> Angels
<hi>ſeem to be called,</hi> the Sons of God,
<hi>Chap. 28. 4. where God thus chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth</hi>
Job. Where waſt thou when I laid
the foundations of the Earth? Declare
if thou haſt Vnderſtanding, who hath laid
the Meaſures thereof, if thou knoweſt; or,
who hath ſtretched the line upon it?
Whereupon are the Foundations thereof
faſtned? Or, who laid the Corner-ſtone
thereof? When the Morning-ſtars ſang
together, and all the ſons of God ſhouted
for Joy? <hi>For the removal of this</hi> Remora,
<hi>which at firſt did very much retard
my mind in coming to a poſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion;
let it be obſerved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53656:32"/>
1. That a twofold Ground of ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Adoring God is here laid
down.</p>
               <p>1. His laying the Foundations of the
Earth, his laying the Meaſures thereof,
his ſtretching the Line upon it.</p>
               <p>2. His laying the Corner-ſtone there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
whereupon its Foundations are
faſtned.</p>
               <p>3. That it was at the laying of the
Foundations of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that the
<hi>Morning-ſtars ſang together;</hi> by which
Phraſe nothing elſe can be meant, but
the Angels. For the Stars in theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Heavens were not then created:
and though thoſe Stars of Light are
ſaid to praiſe God; that is meant only
of their prayſing him <hi>objectivè,</hi> as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioning
rational and intellectual
creatures to praiſe the Maker of ſuch
reſplendent Creatures. But the Angels
of Light, thoſe Morning Stars, being
created with the Emperial Heaven,
though they did not aſſiſt God (as the
<hi>Hebrew Doctors</hi> fancied) yet they ſtood
by, and looked on the production of
each Creature, adoring God's Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53656:33"/>
therein, and ſounding out
their own Joy and his Praiſes at the
laying of the Foundations of the Earth.</p>
               <p>4. But the chief Corner-Stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Foundations thereof
were faſtned, was neither its <hi>Center,</hi>
nor the Waters, nor whatever elſe
hath either been fancied to be its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
or comprehended in that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but the Foundation of its Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that Stone that bears up all
things, which was then laid when
Chriſt was tendered to <hi>fallen Adam,</hi>
in the Promiſe of the Womans ſeed;
which Promiſe our firſt Parents em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
by Faith, were, as Living-Stones,
built upon that ſure Corner-Stone,
that tried Corner-Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Names appropriated to Chriſt and
him only, through the whole Volume
of Gods Book, at the laying whereof
(when he was to be exhibited in the
Fleſh) <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 7. it was prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
there ſhould be Shoutings [<hi>He
ſhall lay the Head-Stone thereof with
ſhoutings, Grace, Grace unto it</hi>] It was
at the laying of this Corner-Stone in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53656:33"/>
the Promiſe of the ſeed of the Woman,
that the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy.
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) in the ſtrict literal Sence, our
firſt Parents, now made the Children
of God by Adoption. If you <hi>Object,</hi>
That here was but one Son of God. I
anſwer, both our firſt Parents are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
in this Term, <hi>Eve</hi> being
reckoned with <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the
more worthy <hi>Gender.</hi> Thus <hi>Lucan,</hi>
ſpeaking of the Entertainment that
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> gave <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Diſcubuere Toris Reges at ſumma Poteſtas
Caeſar:</hi> Meaning by <hi>Reges</hi> both the
<hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> This is ſo
pat as there needs no further Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Anſwer. But you will ſay,
this was a poor All to make a <hi>Chorus.</hi>
I anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. However theſe two Perſons
were all the Adopted Children that
God then had.</p>
               <p>2. If we take the Natural Son of God
into the <hi>Chorus</hi> (who doubtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
with our firſt Parents, as well
as with <hi>Jeruſalem) Iſa.</hi> 65. 19. How
many may we reckon him for?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53656:34"/>
3. We may take <hi>Angels</hi> into the
<hi>Chorus</hi> without prejudice to our Cauſe,
and include them within the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Sons of God, conſidered
as imbodied in the <hi>Chorus,</hi> with the
Adopted Sons of God in propriety of
ſpeech. As the whole Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi>
is denominated <hi>Saints,</hi> from the
better part, though that probably was
the far leſs part. Or as we call a Bay
of Wheat <hi>unthraſhed,</hi> or an Heap of
Wheat <hi>unwinnowed,</hi> a Bay or an Heap
of Wheat: though there be in the one
incomparably more <hi>ſtraw,</hi> in the other
more <hi>Chaff,</hi> than <hi>Wheat.</hi> Even ſo Men
and Angels making up one Quire, to
ſing the praiſes of God, <hi>Redeemer,</hi> at his
firſt Appearance in the Promiſe, the
whole <hi>Quire</hi> is denominated, from the
moſt chief and nobler part, the <hi>Sons of
God.</hi> Yet I would not hear be miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
as if in reſpect of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
I prefer'd <hi>Men</hi> before <hi>Angels</hi> (no
ſuch arrogance ever entred into my
Soul) but only in regard of the Office
and Part they bare in this <hi>Doxologie.</hi>
Men (for whoſe Salvation Chriſt was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53656:34"/>
manifeſted in the Promiſe) leading
the <hi>Chorus,</hi> and <hi>Angles</hi> condeſcending
to follow them as <hi>Miniſtring-Spirits.</hi>
Briefly we have here the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of the <hi>Firſt-Born</hi> (though but
two) attended with an innumerable
Company of Angels, ſhouting to ſee
the <hi>Cornor-Stone</hi> laid. And becauſe
the <hi>Firſt-Born</hi> are in the Propriety of
the <hi>Patriarchal Language,</hi> ſtyled, the
<hi>Sons of God:</hi> Therefore the whole
Quire is denominated from them, the
<hi>Sons of God.</hi> So that we are to ſeek
for a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Text, where Angels,
when they are diſtinctly ſpoken of, are
ſtiled, the <hi>Sons of God.</hi>

               <p>For the more manifeſt Proof of this,
that the Text, <hi>Gen. 6. 2. [The Sons of
God ſaw the Daughters of Men, &amp;c.</hi>]
is the only text in the whole <hi>Bible</hi>
whereby this Text in <hi>Job</hi> ought to be
interpreted.</p>
               <p>Let us conſider the Proximity of
the <hi>Stories.</hi> The firſt beginning 120.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53656:35"/>
years before the <hi>Flood. (Gen.</hi> 6. 3.) and
the latter not much above 100. years
after the <hi>Flood,</hi> the <hi>Flood</hi> happening
<hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 1657. and <hi>Phaleg,</hi> in
whoſe days the Earth was divided,
being born, <hi>Anno Mundi,</hi> 1757, as the
learned <hi>Uſher</hi> Computes. Now I
humbly conceive <hi>Job</hi> was <hi>contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
with <hi>Phaleg,</hi> or not long after him,
which I gather, firſt from the length
of <hi>Jobs</hi> Age, compared with <hi>Phalegs,</hi>
and ground that Collection upon that
common obſervation, that the Age of
<hi>Arphaxad,</hi> and thoſe after him till
<hi>Phaleg,</hi> reached but to the half of the
Age of the Fathers before the <hi>Flood,</hi>
and the Age of <hi>Phaleg</hi> ſcarce to the half
of the years of <hi>the Patriarchs</hi> after the
<hi>Flood,</hi> that lived before him: which
was the common ſtandard of the Age
of <hi>Plalegs</hi> Poſterity, unto <hi>Nahor,</hi> who
attained to little more then half of the
years of his fore-fathers. Now we
may calculate <hi>Job's</hi> Longavity to
have exceeded <hi>Phalegs:</hi> If we conſider,</p>
               <p>1. That all his Sons were married,
and had Familes of their own, before
his trial; ſay then he was thirty at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53656:35"/>
birth of his firſt Child, he could not
in reaſon but be well towards fifty at
birth of his laſt: Conſidering he had
them all by one Wife (<hi>Job.</hi> 19. 17.)
[intreated my Wife for the Childrens
ſake of mine own Bodie] this had
been a weak Argument if the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of his Loins had not been the
Children of her Womb: and that ſhe
gave them ſuck her ſelfe; and before
the laſt of ten could reach to that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie
as to have a Familie of his own,
<hi>Job</hi> muſt be towards fourty more; So
that <hi>Job</hi> could be no leſs then ninety
at his trial.</p>
               <p>2. After his trial the time wherein
his Children were born to him, and
diſpoſed of to Inheritances, could not
be ſo few as fourty.</p>
               <p>3. And after this diſpoſal of his
Children, at what time he was an
hundred and thirty Years old, he lived
an hundred and fourty Years, and
ſaw his Sons, and Sons Sons, even
four Generations. (<hi>Job.</hi> 42. 15, 16.)
So that <hi>Job</hi> lived, 270 Years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<hi>Phaleg</hi> lived but, 239. The <hi>Jewes</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53656:36"/>
ſay God doubled <hi>Job's</hi> Age beyond the
time that Men then lived. But <hi>Mercer</hi>
hath ſufficiently confuted that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
and proved that God's giving <hi>Job</hi>
twice as much as he had before, hath
not reſpect either to his own Life, or
the number of his Children, but onely
to his Poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>2. The Antiquity of <hi>Job</hi> may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
from hence, that the Sons of
<hi>Joctan</hi> were the Conducters of ſeveral
Colonies at what time the Earth was
divided. Now <hi>Joctan</hi> was <hi>Phaleg's</hi>
Brother, and which of them was the
Eldeſt is diſputed, but it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be <hi>Joctan,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid, the
Earth was divided, in the dayes of
<hi>Phaleg:</hi> So that it ſeems <hi>Joctan's</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Sons were grown to Mans
eſtate, and fit to be Captain's of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
in the time of <hi>Phaleg:</hi> The
youngeſt whereof, <hi>Jobab,</hi> I take to be
<hi>Job. Scultetus</hi> indeed fancies that
<hi>Jobab</hi> (one of <hi>Eſau's</hi> poſteritie) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 36. 33. to be <hi>Job:</hi> I am
glad I have the ſuffrage of ſo learned a
man in this particular, that <hi>Jobab</hi> is
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53656:36"/>
                  <hi>Job.</hi> But <hi>Scultetus</hi> was led to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the later <hi>Jobab</hi> as himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
by the Authority of thoſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, who think <hi>Job</hi> to have been an
<hi>Idumean,</hi> becauſe his Country <hi>Vz,</hi> or
<hi>Vts,</hi> is ſaid to be the Land of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Edom (Lament. 4. 21.) Rejoice,
O Daughter of Edom, that dwelleſt in
the Land of VZ, the Cup alſo ſhall paſs to

is a manifeſt Alluſion to <hi>Jer. 25. 7.
Then took I the Cup at the Lord's hand,
and made all the Nations drink it, &amp;c.</hi>
But in that Context, <hi>Vz</hi> is clearly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd
from <hi>Idumaea. verſ.</hi> 20.
All the Kings of the Land of <hi>Vz,</hi> and
all the Kings of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Edom, Moab,</hi> and <hi>Ammon.</hi> Who ſees
not that the Land of <hi>Vz</hi> and of <hi>Edom</hi>
are different? the meaning therefore of
(<hi>Daughter of Edom that dwelleſt in
the Land of Vz</hi>) is this, that a Colony
of <hi>Edom,</hi> expelling the old Inhabitants
thence, f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

whereby I am induced to believe that
<hi>Jobab</hi> the youngeſt Son of <hi>Joctan,</hi> is
<hi>Job,</hi> are theſe;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53656:37"/>
1. The Main Current of the moſt
Judicious Expoſiters are of Opinion
that <hi>Vz, Job's</hi> Countrie, was <hi>Arabia
Petraea.</hi> Now <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bochartus,</hi>
is the Countrie where the Sons of
<hi>Joctan</hi> at the diviſion of the Earth,
planted themſelves. <hi>Mihi Certum eſt
hos Arabie faelicis, intima inſediſſe:</hi> I am
ſure, ſaith he (in his <hi>Phaleg</hi>) that
theſe Colonies ſate down in the very
heart of <hi>Arabia felix,</hi> for proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he ſhew's that the <hi>Arabians</hi> ſay
their firſt Founder was <hi>Joctan;</hi> and
produceth Memorials of the names of
all his Sons retained in the names of
<hi>Arabian</hi> Cities, <hi>Rivers, Hills</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</hi>
That <hi>of Jobab</hi> for Inſtance,
in <hi>Ptolomies,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or as <hi>Sculte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
corrects it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Ptolomi's</hi> Text needs no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
ſeeing that People of <hi>Arabia</hi>
might be ſo called from <hi>Job,</hi> the abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation
of <hi>Jobab,</hi> and he being the
youngeſt, his Brethren might abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate
his Name.</p>
               <p>2. He is ſaid to dwell in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi>
which if it be meant <hi>Eaſt</hi> from <hi>Judea</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53656:37"/>
it can be no other then <hi>Arabia Petrea,</hi>
which ſtandeth Eaſt-ward of <hi>Judaea;</hi>
whereas <hi>Arabia Felix</hi> ſtandeth full
<hi>South.</hi> But ſeeing the <hi>Jewes</hi> did not
inhabit <hi>Paleſtine</hi> till above 500 years
after <hi>Job,</hi> his Countrie is here ſtyled
the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi>
which lies <hi>Weſt</hi> of <hi>Arabia Petrea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. According to this Situation of
<hi>Vz,</hi> it hath the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> a People of
<hi>Arabia Felix,</hi> on one hand, and the
<hi>Chaldeans</hi> on the other hand: The one
whereof Drove away <hi>Jobs</hi> Oxen and
Aſſes, the other his Camels.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>Job</hi> was the greateſt of all the
men of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> (that is the moſt
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which denotes
<hi>Arabia Petrea</hi>) and he being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
there, muſt in reaſon be judged to
have been the Captain of the Colonie
there ſeated.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Job</hi> or <hi>Jobab</hi> being the youngeſt
brother, his elder brethren might more
then probablie ſeat themſelves in the
Richeſt part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> famous for the
plenty of <hi>Gold, Frankincenſe,</hi> &amp;c. and
he be forc't to ſit down in <hi>Arabia</hi> the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53656:38"/>
Stony, or perhaps choſe that for his
ſeat, as fitteſt for the breed of Cattel,
wherein lay his wealth. The <hi>Arabians,</hi>
ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>—(Hiſt. 9. 50.) have
ſome of them 3000 <hi>Camels</hi> apiece;
and from them they compute their
Wealth (ſaith <hi>Leo Affrican</hi> Lib. 9.)
For when they would expreſs their
Riches, they uſe to ſay, <hi>He poſſeſſeth ſo
many thouſand Camels.</hi> And this is
another Argument that <hi>Job</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<hi>Vz,</hi> is <hi>Arabia,</hi> where the thirteen
Sons of <hi>Joctan</hi> ſeated their Families.</p>
               <p>3. That <hi>Job</hi> lived very early after
the <hi>Flood,</hi> is, I think, demonſtrable
from that Text, <hi>Job 31. 26. If I beheld
the Sun when it ſhined,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and my heart
hath been ſecretly enticed, or my Mouth
hath kiſſed my hand, this were an Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to be puniſhed by the Judge.</hi> Whence
it appears that <hi>Idolatry</hi> was in <hi>Job</hi>'s
time, accounted by the Law of Man,
criminal and puniſhable in the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Court,</hi> which in the Days of <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
was ſet up by a Law, from the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
whereof <hi>Terah</hi> fled (ſaith <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>)
from his Native Country, <hi>Vz,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53656:38"/>
of the <hi>Caldees,</hi> being condemned to be
burnt for refuſing to worſhip the <hi>Sun.</hi>
From the Premiſes we collect, that
<hi>Job</hi> was the moſt antient Practitioner
of the <hi>Patriarchal Religion</hi> after the
<hi>Flood,</hi> that we read of (except <hi>Noah</hi>)
and lived two hundred years before
the death of <hi>Noah;</hi> what then can be
more incredible, than that ſo pious a
Perſon could ſo ſoon forget what the
<hi>Patriarchal Church</hi> before the <hi>Flood</hi>
meant by this Phraſe, [<hi>the Sons of
God.</hi>]</p>

               <p>I have weighted all the Arguments
produced for the Proof of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
opinion, <hi>Viz. That</hi> Job <hi>lived not
thus early in the New World as I affirm
him to have done.</hi> But there is not one
of them worth anſwering, but that
drawn from <hi>Job 36. 14. They dye in
Youth, and their Life is amongst the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
(the Sodomites</hi>) according to
the Marginal reading, <hi>Innuit</hi> his <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi>

the <hi>Sodomites</hi> and their Deſtruction:

intimating that <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends had
heard of <hi>Sodoms</hi> Deſtruction., and
therefore were younger than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
But if it had been <hi>Sodomites</hi> in

have been no Argument that <hi>Job</hi> had
heard of <hi>Sodoms</hi> deſtruction. For <hi>Sodom</hi>
migh the infamous for its Uncleanneſs

men do not arrive at ſuch an height
of impudent ſinning, but by degrees:
neither doth God inflict ſuch ſtrange
and exemplary Judgments, till his Long

               <p>I have but one Note more to evince
that the Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. is the moſt
proper Text to expound this of <hi>Job</hi> by,
<hi>Viz.</hi> That the beſt account I find given

                  <hi>they were amazed;</hi> which is not the
form of ſpeech wherein we ſpeak to
men that are preſent; It muſt be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to them that ſhould read this Book
that he here ſpeaks. Again it is
in anſwer to <hi>Job's</hi> wiſh, that he offers
himſelf to him in God's ſtead (<hi>Ch.</hi> 33.
6.) it is probable therefore that in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the gratifying of another, as an
earneſt wiſh of <hi>Jobs,</hi> he might write
<hi>Job's</hi> words, and by Conſequence this
whole Hiſtorie of his trial in a Book:
(<hi>Job. 19. 23.) O that my Words
were Written, that they were Printed in
a Book;</hi> that they might remain for
ever. And ſuch a wiſh as he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
with very paſſionate expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
immediatly before <hi>Elihu</hi> began
his ſpeech to <hi>Job's</hi> friends, and <hi>Job</hi>
himſelf, <hi>Chap. 31. 3, 5. 10. That one
would hear me, behold my deſire is that
the Almighty would anſwer me,</hi> and that
mine Adverſary had written (or as it
is in moſt Tranſlations) would write
a Book <hi>ſurely I would take it upon
my Shoulders, and bind it as a Crown to
me, as a Prince would I go near unto him.</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53656:40"/>
Well, ſaith <hi>Elihu</hi> I am here in Gods ſtead
according to thy wiſh. Now if <hi>Elihu</hi>
had onely diſcours'd with <hi>Job</hi> in God's
ſtead as his adverſary, and not writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
that diſcourſe in a Book, this had
not been according to <hi>Job's</hi> wiſh, who
with the ſame breath requeſts that God
would anſwer him, and record that
anſwer in a Book. Briefly, I cannot
imagine how <hi>Elihu</hi> could more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have intimated himſelf to have
been the Penman than he doth here.
And indeed, who more fit to write
this Book then <hi>Elihu,</hi> who was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the whole diſcourſe, an Interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor
therein; an unbiaſt perſon, whoſe
diſcourſe God was ſo far from blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as he purſues <hi>Elihu's</hi> laſt argument
to convince <hi>Job.</hi> And beſides all this,
a perſon divinely inſpiried. It was
God's Spirit, the <hi>Inſpiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>
that gave him underſtanding,
<hi>chap.</hi> 32. 8. and, <hi>verſ. 17. I will
anſwer alſo my part: I alſo will ſhew my
Opinion</hi> (or, rather my Wiſdom, or my
Science as <hi>Pagnine</hi> renders it; and
the following words enforce, <hi>for I am
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53656:41"/>
full of matter, the Spirit within me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jeremie</hi> expreſſeth
the prophetick Spirit in like terms,
chap. 20. 9. <hi>I ſaid I would not ſpeak
any more in his Name: but his Word was
in my heart as a burning Fire, ſhut up in
my bones. And I was weary with forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I could not ſtay.</hi> Now if <hi>Elihu</hi> was
the Penman of this Book. It cannot
be imagined but that he would keep
exactly to the propriety of the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
Idiome;</hi> and therefore cannot
mean any other by [<hi>the Sons of God</hi>]
then are meant, Gen. 6. 2.</p>

by removing the rubbiſh that lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

ſhew what this Text in <hi>Job</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
towards the proof of the Point
in hand. In order to which,</p>
               <p>1. I obſerve, that here is mention of a
<hi>Publick Church-Aſſembly,</hi> a Convention
of the Sons of God before the Lord.
That being the <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Phraſe
whereby they expreſt the profeſſors of
the true Religion: <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 2. as all
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> confeſs, except ſuch as are
led by the <hi>Noſe</hi> to follow the <hi>Jewiſh
Rabbies:</hi> whom God hath ſo infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſince their ſhutting out the true
Light, as of all men living, they are
moſt ignorant of their own Law.</p>
               <p>2. That this Convention before the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53656:42"/>
Lord conſiſted not of <hi>Job's</hi> Family and
his Sons alone, but of the Religious
alſo of Neighbouring Families; as
<hi>Liban</hi> is ſaid to call the men of the
place to celebrate <hi>Jacob's</hi> marriage
(Gen. 2. 9. 22.) for before the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
convention <hi>Job</hi> was ſtript of his
Sons.</p>
               <p>3. I note that in theſe Publick-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<hi>Job</hi> did not officiate as <hi>Prieſt,</hi>
though he did in his own Family:
for this ſecond convention before the
Lord falling out in the Days of his
<hi>Mourning,</hi> makes it very probable that
he did not manage the <hi>Miniſterial
Work</hi> of that day; yea it ſeems more
then probable, that <hi>Job</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at that convention: from chap. 2. 7.
<hi>ſo went Satan forth from the preſence of
the Lord, and ſmote Job, &amp;c.</hi> Had <hi>Job</hi>
been there, he would have ſmote him
there. But more clearly from the verſe
following; <hi>And he took a Potſherd to
ſcrape himſelf withal, and ſat down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Aſhes.</hi>] This laſt clauſe is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
renderd in moſt other Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as <hi>Vatablus, Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremol.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53656:42"/>
&amp;c.</hi> by <hi>ſitting among the Aſhes.</hi> And
the plain ſenſe of the whole verſe, is
this; <hi>Job ſitting among the Aſhes</hi> (when
Satan ſmote him) <hi>took what was next
at hand, a Potſherd to ſcrape himſelf</hi>
withal. So that Satan found <hi>Job</hi> not
in the Church-Aſſemblie, but on the
Aſhes-heap (the uſual poſture of men
deeply touched with the ſenſe of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.)
And therefore the ſacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in that, and by conſequence in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick Aſſemblies, were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
by Publick Perſons, aſſigned
to that holy Function.</p>
               <p>4. We find here certain ſtated times
for celebrating Religious Worſhip, <hi>A
day when the Sons of God preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
before the Lord,</hi> and that day oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
again: and how could ſeveral
Families convene (as I have proved
there did here) if they had not had
Set Times for thoſe Conventions.</p>
               <p>5. As to our third Propoſition now
before us, let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p>1. That ſeeing in <hi>Job</hi>'s Time there
was no other ſtated Dayes for Divine
publick Worſhip ſave weekly, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53656:43"/>
thoſe weekly Days inſtituted by God
himſelf. What Time for ſacred Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
can we imagine the Sons of
God could pitch upon, but that which
their Heavenly Father had preſcribed
them by his example and precept?</p>
               <p>2. Had theſe Dayes of the Sons of
God, their appearance before the Lord,
not occurred in a leſs ſpace of time
than either a Year or a Moneth, it is
very improbable that Satan would
have had ſo much patience at <hi>Jobs</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
as to have deferred his making
an <hi>Addreſs</hi> to God for the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Commiſſion, before this
ſecond Church-Aſſembly. Could
that malitious Adverſary, who had,
after the obtaining of his firſt commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſtript <hi>Job</hi> naked in one day;
whoſe finger did ſo itch to be ſcratch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Jobs</hi> Body, that as ſoon as ever
the word [<hi>he is in thy hand</hi>] was gone
out of God's Mouth, immediatly goes
out of God's Preſence, and ſmites <hi>Job's</hi>
bodie; could he (I ſay) forbear to
make ſuite for that Commiſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the leaſt diviſion of time by
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53656:43"/>
Days, ſeeing <hi>Job's</hi> Heroical patience
could not but make every hour of that
forbearance a greater torment to Satan
than he could inflict upon <hi>Job.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Origen</hi> from this very <hi>Text (in
his Homilies upon Job.</hi> Chap. 1. verſ. 5,
6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> draws the ſame Inference.
<hi>Thoſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
commanded in the Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Sabbath, Job before the give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Law, did both obſerve himſelf,
and taught his Children to obſerve. R.
Abraham</hi> alſo, as he is quoted by <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brard,</hi>
affirmeth, that <hi>Job</hi> obſerved the
Sabbath. And therefore Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>
might have ſpared his Exclamations
againſt <hi>Beza,</hi> for ſaying that <hi>Job</hi> did
ſanctifie every ſeventh day at leaſt:
as if in ſo ſaying he had only vented
his own humor, and oppoſed the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Fathers, from which latter Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny
I ſhall clear <hi>Beza</hi> in the next

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53656:44"/>
Aſſemblies, and that the Church in
the time of <hi>Job,</hi> did in all probability
celebrate ſuch Aſſemblies weekly. I
may venture, with this Light in my
hand, to proceed without fear of
ſtumbling, or ſtraying, to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Text, <hi>Gen. 2. 3. And God bleſſed
the ſeventh Day, and ſanctified it, becauſe
that in it God reſted from all his Works
which he created and made.</hi> For the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
whereof, and applying it
for the ſupport of a weekly <hi>Patriarchal
Sabbath:</hi> Let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p>1. That the conceit of a Prolepſis
in theſe words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> is clearly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown
by the Premiſes; for if
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> had ſtated dayes of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip, ſo long before <hi>Moſes,</hi>
that practice of theirs could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be grounded upon any other bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
but God's reſting upon the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day,</hi>
and therefore <hi>ſanctifying</hi> it
to be a day of <hi>Reſt,</hi> by his Precept to
<hi>Adam.</hi> Seeing that their appointing
ſtated dayes for ſuch Worſhip on their
own heads, would have been no better
than Will-Worſhip, and ſuch as God
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53656:44"/>
might juſtlie have expoſtulated with
them about, ſaying, <hi>Who hath required
this at your hands?</hi> and ſo much a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
affront to the divine Majeſtie, as
they were further off from all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of Ignorance of God's reſting the
<hi>Seventh day.</hi> Nay what preſumption
had it been in the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> to have
expected God's bleſſing upon their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating
other ſtated Days than God
had ſancti<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

but that they waited upon God
for his bleſſing upon their ſacred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.
Thus the practice of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi>
is a full Comment on this Text.</p>
               <p>2. It being granted, that this Text

For what humane Authority

that Ceremonial or temporary Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath

nay caſts up a great Gulph be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, appears from hence.</p>
                  <p>1. The fourth Precept was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the audience of all the People,
immediately by God's own Mouth on
Mount <hi>Sinai (Deut.</hi> 4. 12.) But the
Law of Saturday-Sabbath was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God unto <hi>Moſes</hi> alone, and by
him to the Rulers of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 20.) This difference is
intimated by <hi>Pethaliah, Nehem.</hi> 9. 13,
14. [Thou cameſt down alſo upon
Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſpakeſt with them
from Heaven, and gaveſt them right
Judgment, and true Laws, good Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and Commandments] (<hi>verſ.</hi> 14.)
And thou madeſt known unto them
thy holy Sabbath, and commandeſt
them Precepts, Statutes and Laws
by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> thy Servant.]
Here the Decalogue is plainly diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from that Law of the Sabbath,
which was peculiar to the Jews.</p>
                  <p>1. By this, that the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were ſpoken by God himſelf,
ſpeaking on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> But the
Law of the Sabbath, together with the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53656:49"/>
reſt of thoſe temporary Laws, were
made known to the Iſraelites by the
hand of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. By his ſtyling the Laws of the
Decalogue [right, true, good]; but not
vouchſafing to give any of thoſe titles
to the Law of the Jewiſh Sabbath, and
other Ceremonials; which ſpeak the
firſt to be bottom'd upon their own
innate Righteouſneſs and Goodneſs,
and therefore to be permanent and
univerſal to all Mankind; but the laſt
to want theſe Properties, and therefore
to have been carnal Ordinances impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on them, until the time of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.) not to have
been faultleſs, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8.) to have
been Statutes that were not good, and
Judgments whereby they could not
have lived, (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 25.) It is not
unworthy of obſervation, that through
the <hi>20th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it is ſaid of his Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that if a Man do them he ſhall
even live in them; the Sabbaths that
God gave them are excluded from that
priviledg, and mentioned diſtinctly as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53656:49"/>
ſeparated, in regard thereof, from the
Moral Law. As <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11. [I brought
them into the Wilderneſs, and gave
them my Statutes, and ſhewed them
my Judgments, which if a Man do, he
ſhall even live in them. Moreover alſo,
[I gave them my Sabbaths,] and <hi>verſ.</hi>
21. [they walked not in my Statutes,
neither kept my Judgments, which
if a Man do he ſhall even live in them,
they polluted my Sabbaths.] If the
Prophet had not meant here to put
this difference betwixt the Decalogue
and the Ceremonial Law (whereof
that of the Saturday-Sabbath, with the
reſt of their Sabbaths, monthly, yearly,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> was the prime, and therefore
mentioned in the name of the other
Ceremonials.) That in doing the Law
of the Decalogue a Man may live, but
not in keeping the Ceremonial Law,
whereof that of their Sabbath was a
part. He would have ſaid, [Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Statutes, and Sabbaths, which
if a Man, &amp;c.] Now what can be more
manifeſtly demonſtrated, than the vaſt
difference betwixt theſe Laws is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53656:50"/>
to be in theſe Texts, which
preſent that Law of the Sabbath which
God gave the Jews, to have been a
Law that could not perfect him that
kept it as to Conſcience; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to have been temporary and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to the Jews.</p>
                  <p>3. By his ſaying of the firſt, <hi>that God
gave them.</hi> Of the Jewiſh Sabbath,
that God made it known unto them,
as a thing they were ignorant of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which cannot be applied to the
Patriarchal Sabbath, to which the 4th
Precept relates, for they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with that by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Tradition from the Patriarchs.
But of that Sabbath that was inſtituted
at the gathering of Manna, to wit,
their Saturday-Sabbath, which was
then, and not till then firſt inſtituted,
and ſo ſtrange that when the People
had gathered a double portion on the
ſixth day (the ſixth day of their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering,
not of the antient Patriarchal
Week) the Elders went and told <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
as not knowing what that meant,
which a Child might have known, if
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53656:50"/>
Saturday, the day following, had been
their antient Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>From the Premiſes may be gathered,
not only that the Scripture puts a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betwixt the fourth Precept,
and the Law for Saturday-Sabbath:
by declaring the firſt to have been
delivered by God's own Mouth, the
other by the hand of <hi>Moſes;</hi> But alſo,
by attributing thoſe Titles of True,
Good, Righteous, to the fourth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
which it gives to the other nine,
and are incompatible to the Law of
the Saturday-Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>3. And by affirming the Law of
the Jewiſh Sabbath to have been firſt
publiſhed at the gathering of Manna:
whereas the Sabbath of the fourth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
was made known to <hi>Adam,</hi> and
obſerved by him and his ſucceſſive ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations.
To proceed to other dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
betwixt theſe Laws.</p>
                  <p>4. The fourth Precept was writ in
Tables of Stone by God's own Finger,
(<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 13.) But the Law of the
Saturday-Sabbath with other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials
were written by <hi>Moſes</hi> in a Book,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53656:51"/>
5. The two Tables were put into
the Ark (<hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 2, 5.) which was
never opened that we read of, ſave
when the Philiſtines looked into it,
and at <hi>Solomon's</hi> tranſlating it into
his Temple: at what time nothing was
found within the Ark, ſave the two
Tables, no not ſo much as <hi>Aron's</hi> Rod
and Pot of Manna, as <hi>Sanctius</hi> and
others conceive, becauſe <hi>Aaron's</hi> Rod
and Pot of Manna were placed not
in the Ark, but Tabernacle, (<hi>Exod.
16. 33.) Numb.</hi> 17. 10. or as others
think, becauſe no part of the Law, but
only the two Tables, were put under
the propitiatory, into the Ark: though
the Pot, and Rod were placed there
alſo (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 4.) But that all other
Laws (wrote by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf) were
placed on the outward ſide of the
Ark, is the common opinion, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially
grounded upon that Text,
(<hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 26.) [Take this Book of
the Law, and put it in the ſide of the
Ark.]</p>
                  <p>6. God's placing the fourth Precept
in the Decalogue, declares it to be of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53656:51"/>
the ſame nature with the reſt of the
Ten: for how can it ſtand with the
Wiſdom of the God of Order (who
forbad plowing with an Ox and an
Aſs, who prohibited the wearing of
Linſy-woolſy; and was ſo careful that
the Male and Female Sex ſhould wear
different Apparel) to ſhuffle a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
Law amongſt his Moral Laws?
ſeeing that would have been a far
greater <hi>Indecorum</hi> than the yoking of
an Ox and an Aſs together; would
have rendred the Decalogue a piece
of Linſie-woolſie, and have been the
apparalling of permanent and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
of perpetual and temporary Laws,
which in their own nature differ more
than Male and Female (that is, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fically)
in the ſame garb.</p>

are grounded upon different Reaſons.

               <p>1. That it might be a ſign to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
the Jews from all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. [It is a ſign between

I am the
Lord your God which have ſeparated
you from all other Nations, (<hi>Lev.</hi> 20.
24.) Now if other Nations had cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Saturday as their weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and not another day of the
week, the Jews could not have been
diſcriminated from them by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the ſame day, this would have
been no part of the Wall of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. The Jews weekly as well as their
monthly Sabbaths, were Shadows of
good things to come, the Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is Chriſt, (<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.) If therefore
the Sabbath of the fourth Precept had
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53656:52"/>
been the Jewiſh Sabbath, it ought to
have been aboliſhed when Chriſt the
Subſtance is come, as well as other
Ceremonial Laws. But this is contrary
to the ſenſe of the Univerſal Church,
which reckons this one of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
And our Church hath
appointed this Precept, with the reſt
of the Decalogue, to be pronounced
at the Lord's Table, and enjoyned her
Children to beg pardon for the breach
of this, and Grace to encline their
Hearts to keep it; which would be
the putting of a Cheat upon them, if
that Precept in the plain Letter of it
were not ſtill in force: and the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a figurative ſenſe upon it would
make it as unintelligible to vulgar ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
as if it were in Latine: And
ſo much the more hard to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
as the Church in her Liturgies
and Catechiſms (wherein ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
Milk to Babes) affects the
greateſt plainneſs of Speech. Upon
which account moſt ſerious Perſons
have been prejudic'd againſt <hi>Calvin's</hi>
Interpretation of Chriſt's deſcent into
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53656:53"/>
Hell: that being an Article of the
common Faith, and therefore to be
interpreted in the plain literal ſenſe.
Let me add, that the Church no where
declares her Sentiments more plainly,
than in publick Liturgies: upon
which Conſideration St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
appeals from thoſe Teſtimonies of
Fathers, which <hi>Pelagius</hi> urged, to the
forms of Common-Prayer. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tho a thouſand private Doctors
Opinion ſhould thwart me, yet I hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Opinion of the whole Church,
declared in her Liturgies, for me; if
not in ſo many words, yet in her ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
practice, unavoidably inferring
what I maintain, to wit, that the fourth
Precept of the Decalogue is ſtill in full
force; this is ſufficient to acquit my
Aſſertion from the imputation of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
or ſingularity, as being no other
but what I drew from my Mother's
(the Church of <hi>England's</hi>) Breaſts, not
only by good conſequence, as hath
been ſhewed, but in plain words:
for in the Homily of the time and place
of Prayer ſhe tells us, that [God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53656:53"/>
in the fourth Precept command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the celebration of the Sabbath,
which is our Sunday. But I have
greater Authority than this of the
Church, even Chriſt himſelf: who
could not endure that he ſhould be
thought to come to deſtroy the Law;
and aſſures us that not one jot or tittle
ſhould fall from the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 17.
which all interpret to be meant of the
Decalogue, whoſe fourth Precept muſt
therefore be concluded to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it that is ceremonial, typical,
and upon that account to be aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as inſtituting a Sabbath to be a
ſhadow of good things to come.</p>
               <p>3. The Sabbath appropriate to the
Jews, was commanded them to be a
Memorial of God's giving them reſt
from Egyptian Servitude, <hi>Deut. 5. 15.
Remember that thou waſt a Servant in
the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and that the Lord
thy God brought thee out thence—:
therefore the Lord thy God commanded
thee to keep the Sabbath Day.</hi> Obſerve
here the difference betwixt the Law
of the Sabbath given on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:53656:54"/>
and this in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> tho it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in the Decalogue. For this
Book containing an explanation of
the Law, (whether Moral, Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
or Judicial) and application of it
to the particular ſtate of the Jews:
<hi>Moſes</hi> in this Text Judaizeth the
fourth Precept, and therefore aſſigns,
as the reaſon of its inſtitution (thus
applied and limited) not God's reſting
on the Seventh Day from his Work,
which is common to all Mankind, but
his cauſing them to reſt from their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
work under the Egyptians: which
was peculiar to the Jews. Which is
a manifeſt Argument that the Sabbath
of the Decalogue, engraven in the
Tables, was of larger extent than this
mentioned in <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> or elſe
why ſhould the Reaſon of the one be
univerſal, of the other particular? As
alſo that the Jews were obliged to the
obſervation of their Sabbath, not from
the literal and primary ſenſe of the
fourth Precept, (as all Mankind are,
and always were, except the Jews, to
whom God appointed another Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath)
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53656:54"/>
but only from the equity of it:
For ſeeing God had ſanctified the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
Seventh Day, whereon he had
reſted, to be obſerved by all Men; it
was meet that the Jews ſhould keep
holy one Day of ſeven, and that Day
which God had peculiarly enjoyned
them, <hi>viz.</hi> Saturday, tho that was not
the Sabbath of the fourth Precept, the
Lawgiver having Right to diſpenſe
with his own Law. And this is clearly
the plain meaning of <hi>Moſes</hi> his inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(<hi>verſ.</hi> 12. [as the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
thee] or rather <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
had commanded thee] <hi>viz.</hi> before the
publiſhing of the Decalogue on Mount
<hi>Sinai:</hi> and of his leaving out [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>remember</hi>] the firſt word of the fourth
Precept, as it was delivered on <hi>Sinai;</hi>
by which word, mankind was called
upon to call to mind the Patriarchal
Sabbath: or rather his transferring it
to his mentioning their Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
verſ. 15. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that thou waſt a Bondſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] As if <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you may interpret the fourth
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53656:55"/>
Precept (repeating the Law of the
Patriarchal Sabbath) as either vacat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Law of the Sabbath he gave
you a little before the promulgation
of that on Mount <hi>Sinai, viz.</hi> at the
firſt gathering of Manna, or as laying
an obligation upon you to obſerve
that alſo, ſo as you muſt keep two
Sabbaths in a week: for the preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of either of which miſtakes, now
that I am come to the mentioning of
the fourth Precept, I will let you
know, that though indeed as you are
Men, you are obliged to keep in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
the Reſt of the Creation; yet
as you are Jews, a Nation ſeparated
to God from all Nations, God hath
diſpenſed with you as to the preciſe
day, and expects; that you ſhould keep
that day which he hath peculiarly
appointed you to celebrate in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
of his giving you reſt
from Egyptian Bondage, which was
ſo ſevere and afflicting, that in regard
thereof it had been better for you that
you had not been created, or died as
ſoon as you were born. Note from
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53656:55"/>
hence that the fourth Precept, when
applied to the Jews, ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,
as commanding one day of
ſeven. But as it ſtands in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
and appertains to all Nations
and Ages, it commands the celebration
of the preciſe Seventh day, whereon
God reſted: So directly contrary to
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Expoſition of this Law, does
the common cry of modern Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
go, who make it command <hi>A</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
day to all, and <hi>The</hi> ſeventh day
to the Jews. Obſerve how unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
theſe Expoſitors make the Chriſtian
Practiſe of keeping Sunday, if that be
not the ſeventh day of the fourth Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
but only one of the ſeven: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Precept enjoyns the ſeventh
on which God reſted and, that upon
this reaſon, becauſe God reſted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And how juſtifiable the Jewiſh
practiſe was of keeping Saturday,
though that was not the ſeventh day
whereon God reſted, for they had for
their ſo doing a plain Divine Precept
of their Ceremonial and peculiar
Law, diſpencing in reſpect of the day
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53656:56"/>
with the Law of the Sabbath, which
was given to <hi>Adam</hi> and his whole Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
from the beginning. Let it
be noted in the next place, that all
the other nine Precepts, repeated here
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> are the very ſame <hi>verbatim</hi>
with thoſe that were writ on the two
Tables, as they were ſpoken on the
Mount: but the fourth Precept, as it
is repeated here, is not the ſame fourth
Precept that was ſpoken by God's
Mouth and writ by God's Finger, but
vaſtly different from that, both in its
form and reaſon: and both peculiar
to the Jews, but neither of them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
to other Nations. Not the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
for as the Jews were a part of the
Patriarchal Church (ſeeing God had
for that time of their Separation from
other Nations aſſigned them another
day than that of the fourth Precept as
it ſtands in the Decalogue) it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
requiſit that a <hi>Memento</hi> ſhould be
preſixt before that Command to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
the Patriarchal-Sabbath, which
was to take place again when the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition-Wall
ſhould be broken down,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53656:56"/>
that they might then after ſo long an
intermiſſion call to mind, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
God's primitive Seventh-day
to ſanctifie it: And therefore the
fourth Precept in the Decalogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
with <hi>Remember.</hi> But there is no
Remember prefixt before this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
as it is here repeated by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and adapted to the Jewiſh ſtate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
as ſuch they were to ſanctify Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,
and to obſerve the Precept,
as enjoining to them the Sanctification
of that Day as their peculiar Sabbath,
only till the time of Reformation, and
then they were to forget it thus Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiz'd,
as well as the reſt of their Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
Laws. At which time of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration
this their new Saturday-Sabbath
would be grown old, and
muſt come no more in remembrance,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. And then the Covering of
the Ark, where the two Tables of the
everlaſting Law was laid up, being
taken away, the Jews might reade the
fourth Precept, as it was uttered from
the Lord's Mouth, vvith a <hi>Memento</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, to put them in remembrance of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53656:57"/>
that ſeventh day whereon God reſted.
I would thank that Man who will
give me any better, or indeed any
other Reaſon than this, why a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento</hi>
ſhould begin this Precept and
none of the reſt; ſeeing we ought as
well remember to obſerve them as
this: or why <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould prefix <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi>
before the fourth Precept as
it ſtands in the Decalogue, and not as
he repeats it here. Or why he ſhould
aſſign God's reſting as the ground of
the fourth Precept there, and the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
reſting from Egyptian Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
as the reaſon of it here. Or
laſtly, how <hi>Moſes</hi> can be acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from ſelf-contradiction, from
adding to, and taking from the words
of the Law, when in the twentieth
of <hi>Exodus,</hi> he ſaith, God ſpake thus,
[<hi>Remember, &amp;c. for in ſix days the
Lord made, &amp;c. wherefore the Lord
bleſſed, &amp;c.</hi>] And yet in this 5th of
<hi>Deut.</hi> he not only leaves out the [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member]
and the Reaſon of the fourth
Precept in the Decalogue, but aſſigns
another reaſon, and yet after all tells
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53656:57"/>
them, [<hi>Theſe words the Lord ſpake unto
all your Aſſembly in the Mount, and he
added no more, and he wrote them in two
Tables of Stone.</hi>] How can <hi>Moſes</hi> his
Fidelity in this caſe be vindicated but
by this <hi>Salvo,</hi> That the other nine do
indifferently appertain to Jew and
Gentile, and therefore they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
intirely as they came from God's
Mouth. But the fourth Precept for
that time did not appertain to the
Jews (either as to the Day command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be ſanctified, or the reaſon for
its Sanctification, but only in regard
of its equity, in reſpect of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of time) but to all Mankind, ſave
the Jews, at all times, and would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain
to the Jews when Chriſt had
made of that twain (Jew and Gentile)
one: and therefore <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſecure
that entirely againſt that time, ſets it
down in the Decalogue word by word
as God ſpake it: But when he applies
that Precept to the peculiar ſtate of
the Jews at that preſent, to whom God
had (before the promulgation of the
Law on the holy Mount) appointed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53656:58"/>
another Day for their weekly Sabbath,
than that whereon God had reſted;
it had been ridiculous to have menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
God's finiſhing his Work of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in ſix Days, and his reſting on
the ſeventh, as the reaſon why the
Jews ſhould reſt on that Day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God wrought: and therefore he
omits that, and aſſigns another reaſon
moſt proper and cogent, and repeats
no more of the Precept, but what was
common to them and other Nations.
And thus it's true what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Theſe words the Lord ſpake in the Mount
unto your whole Aſſembly, and he added
no more;</hi> that is, that you are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
concern'd in. And as to the words
expreſſing the reaſon, God ſpake them
in the Preface to the whole Decalogue
as the reaſon of your being obliged,
above other Nations, to keep all and
every one of thoſe Laws; and my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
them to the Law of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
is a faithful expoſition of both
the Laws concerning the Sabbath; to
wit, the Ceremonial, which concerns
you alone, and the Moral ſo far as it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53656:58"/>
concerns you, that is, in the equity of
it. He ſpake indeed more words, but
not unto your whole Aſſembly in its
preſent Conſtitution, but as you ſhall
be at the rending of the Vail; he
would have you hear that which I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to repeat, for that time to come,
ſeeing the preſſing of you upon that
reaſon, to keep that Sabbath-Day God
hath commanded you to obſerve,
would be a ſtrong Argument againſt
your keeping it.</p>

               <p>I could name other differences the
Sacred Scripture makes betwixt the
Patriarchal and Jewiſh Sabbath: but
theſe already mentioned are ſufficient
to convince rational Men that the
Jewiſh Saturday-Sabbath was not the
Patriarchal Sabbath commanded in the
fourth Precept.</p>
               <p>I come now to ſhew that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
celebrated Sunday for their
weekly Sabbath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53656:59"/>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. And here firſt I urge the
Premiſes. If Saturday was not the
Patriarchal Sabbath, either Sunday
muſt be it, or it will follow that there
have been three ſeveral Sabbaths, one
of the Patriarchs before the Law, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Jews under the Law, and a
third of Chriſtians under the Goſpel.
A conſequence which a <hi>Mahometan</hi>
may perhaps not diſguſt, but I am
ſure it will ſound harſh in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
Ear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. There can no other juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
account be given of Chriſtians
celebrating Sunday, but this. That
the Jewiſh Saturday-Sabbath was Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial
and Temporary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to give place to that day that was
ſanctified from the beginning by God's
Example and Precept; gave place, I
ſay, to that at the expiration of the
<hi>Moſaical</hi> Law without any new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</p>
               <p>1. For if Saturday-Sabbath had
been the day on which God reſted,
and commanded <hi>Adam</hi> to reſt on, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53656:59"/>
keep holy, it could not have been
unſanctified but by a Precept as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
and of as great Authority as
that was whereby it was inſtituted,
which I am confident can never be
made to appear in the tranſlation of
the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday.
And that which is alledged for this
comes far ſhort: For what Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
force can there be in Chriſt's
riſing, his appearing after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and celebrating religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
with his Apoſtles ordinarily
on Sundays, in the Apoſtles aſſembling
on that day for religious Worſhip;
what force, I ſay, can there be in all
this for the unſanctifying of Saturday,
and giving its Crown to Sunday,
comparable to the expreſs Command
of God grounded upon his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to ſanctifie Saturday? Nay, what
are Mens pleading ſuch things as theſe
for the change of the Sabbath (upon
ſuppoſition that Saturday was God's
day of reſt, and commanded by him
to be kept) but a ſetting up of their
own conceits, and miſcollected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53656:60"/>
(that becauſe Saturday was
inſtituted in memory of the Creation,
and Sunday was the day wherein
Chriſt perfected Man's Redemption
by his Reſurrection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore
Saturday muſt give place to Sunday)
in direct oppoſition to God's expreſs
precept; If Saturday be the day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the fourth Precept, or <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>2. But then I would not have the
Saturday-Sabbatarians crow as if I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
the victory to them. For upon
the ground that I have laid the Jewiſh
Saturday-Sabbath, being calculated
particularly to that Nation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Temporary and Ceremonial, muſt
with other Moſaick Ceremonies be
abrogated by Chriſt's Death, and give
place to the Antient Patriarchal Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
on courſe without any new Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
And here now our Saviour's riſing
from the dead, his frequent appearing
to his Diſciples on Sundays, the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of the Apoſtles and primitive
Church, come in ſeaſonably with their
Auxiliary force to ſupport the divine
Inſtitution of the Lords-day—. For
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53656:60"/>
though as to the firſt Conſecration
thereof, their Examples ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor are able to ſtand their
ground againſt the Aſſaults of God's
both Example and Precept: yet upon
that ground I have laid they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
and ſtrenuous Seconds to
prove the Reſtauration of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Patriarchal Sabbath by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation
of the Judaick. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
influence could our Saviour's riſing
on Sunday have upon that day to the
ſanctifying thereof, than his ſuffering
on Friday, or his Aſcenſion on Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
could have upon either of thoſe
days to ſanctifie either of them for the
weekly Sabbath?</p>
               <p>3. But yet Chriſt choſe to riſe on
Sunday, becauſe God had ſanctified
that day from the beginning. And
therefore his Reſurrection, and the
Apoſtles celebrating Church-Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
on that day, though they are not
of Authority ſufficient to appoint a
new Lord's-Day, yet they are ſafe
Guides to point us to that old Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Lord's-Day whereon the Lord
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53656:61"/>
reſted, and therefore commanded the
Patriarchal Church Catholique to
ſanctifie it—in Conformity to, and
Communion with which Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to all Ages and Places (ſave
<hi>Judea,</hi> which never was any other
but a particular Church, God having
in all Nations ſome that feared God
and wrought Righteouſneſs, and
therefore were accepted of him.) Our
Saviour after the rending or the Vail,
and removal of the Partition-Wall,
roſe upon that Day, and upon that
Day celebrated Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was ſufficient to revoke
the Sabbath to its firſt beginning (to
which all things were revoked by
Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi> (in <hi>Monogamia</hi>)
and to intimate that Sunday was the
Patriarchal Sabbath. It being manifeſt
that the Jewiſh Sabbath inſtituted not
only four hundred, but three thouſand
years after the inſtitution of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal,
could not make that void,
any more than the Moſaick Law could
vacate the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53656:61"/>
before that Law was given, according
to the Apoſtles way of Arguing, (<hi>Gal.</hi>
3, 17.) [The Covenant that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
confirmed of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Law which was 430 years after, could
not diſanul, that it ſhould make the
Promiſe of none effect.] And that
therefore that Moſaic Law of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
being made void, the Patriarchal
muſt of courſe take effect without any
new Injunction. The neceſſity of
which Couſequence will be made more
apparent by the next Argument. <hi>Viz.</hi>

                  <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. That the Patriarchs did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
the Sunday-Sabbath before the
Inſtitution of Saturday-Sabbath, may
be proved, if not demonſtrated, from
Scripture-Inſtances.</p>
               <p>It were indeed unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
Mathematical Demonſtrations in
this caſe, ſeeing <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hiſtory of

conciſe, as his Narrative thereof
for above two thouſand years may be
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53656:62"/>

Yet if we diligently ſearch, I doubt
not but we ſhall find Inſtances next to
Demonſtrations, in two places, <hi>viz.
Exod.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. I will begin
with the laſt, becauſe it leads to the
change of the Patriarchal Sabbath to
the Jewiſh: which ſeeing we all know
to be Saturday, by reckoning back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
till we come to the day on which
that general Church-Aſſembly, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
ver. 2. was kept, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
find on what day of the week it
fell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Inſt.</hi> 1 The firſt Inſtance therefore
that I ſhall give of a Religious week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Aſſembly kept on courſe by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
on Sundays, is from <hi>Exod.
16. 1, &amp;c. And they took their Journey
from</hi> Elim, <hi>and all the Congregation of
the Children of Iſrael came into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of</hi> Sin, <hi>which is between</hi> Elim <hi>and</hi>
Sinai, <hi>on the fifteenth day of the ſecond
Month after their departure out of the
Land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>And the whole Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Children of Iſrael murmured
againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron.] For the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53656:62"/>
right ſtating of the ſenſe of this Text,
I muſt crave leave to rectify the Point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which, as it ſtands, refers the ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day to their marching, which
ought to be referred to the time of
this Aſſembly: For of what uſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
could it be to know the day
of the Month when they took their
Journey, any more than the reſt of
their Journeyings, except that from
Mount <hi>Sinai (Numb.</hi> 10. 11.) for the
ſpace of forty years? But as God at
the Inſtitution of the Paſſover had
changed the beginning of the Year,
and appointed that Month to be the
firſt to the Iſraelites, which was not
the ſirſt in reſpect of the Creation. So
when he was purpoſed to change
the beginning of Weeks to the Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,
and appoint that Day their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
which was the ſixth in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Account, and of the whole
World beſide the Jews: It was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to leave ſome plain Note and
Character of Time, whereby it might
be known on what day of the Week
the Sabbath was kept before that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53656:63"/>
change. Now this miſapplication of
the fifteenth day may eaſily be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by having recourſe to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> thus,—<hi>and
they journeyed from Elim. And the whole
Congregation of the Children of Iſrael
came into the Wilderneſs of</hi> Sin, <hi>which is
between Elim and Sinai,</hi> ver. 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
[<hi>And</hi>] or [<hi>But] on the
fifteenth day of the ſecond Month after
their departure out of the Land of</hi> Egypt,
<hi>the whole Congregation of the Children of</hi>
Iſrael <hi>murmured,</hi> &amp;c. This is therefore
the firſt Collection I make from this
Text.</p>
               <p>That the whole Congregation are
not ſaid to March but to Murmur, on
the fifteenth day, their Sabbath Songs
were turned into <hi>Howlings,</hi> like thoſe,
<hi>Amos</hi> 8. 3.</p>
               <p>As to the Reaſon I aſſign why the
day of the Month is named here, and
not in any of their Marching ſaving
that from Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> a Perſon
eminent for Learning and Place in our
Church is pleaſed to except againſt
it, by giving this as the Reaſon why
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53656:63"/>
the day of the Month is here named,
<hi>viz.</hi> leſt the firſt part of the verſe ſhould
be miſtaken as if they had gone from
<hi>Elim,</hi> and come to <hi>Sin</hi> the ſame day.
Whereas they departed from <hi>Elim</hi> to
the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> and came from the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi>
into the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sin, Numb.</hi>
33. To this exception therefore I here
humbly offer theſe two things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 33. (where
he purpoſely Records their Marchings
in order, and mentions that by the
<hi>Red-Sea</hi> immediately before their
coming into the Wilderneſs) doth
ſufficiently prevent all poſſibility of
miſtaking the ſenſe of <hi>Ex.</hi> 16. except
by ſuch negligent Readers as in their
reading his Writings, ſlip over that
Chapter in <hi>Numbers,</hi> which kind of
Perſons I ſuppoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was not very
careful to gratifie.</p>
               <p>2. This Reaſon is ſo far from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
the ſuppoſed miſtake, as it
neceſſarily leads to it: For read the
Text thus: <hi>They departed from Elim,
and came into the Wilderneſs of Sin the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:53656:64"/>
fifteenth day:</hi> and this pointing makes
their departure from <hi>Elim,</hi> and coming
into the Wilderneſs, to have been on
the ſame day. The firſt being the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
a quo,</hi> the other the <hi>terminus
ad quem</hi> of their motion: Except we
fancy they came into the Wilderneſs
the fifteenth day from no place. But
refer the fifteenth day to their Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
not Marching, and both the
extream tearms of their March ſtand
firm, and there is ſpace enough betwixt
them left for their intermediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping
at the <hi>Red-Sea.</hi> As if a Man
ſhould ſay, I removed from <hi>London,</hi>
and came to <hi>York</hi> the <hi>15th</hi> day of <hi>April:</hi>
we would conclude that he came to
<hi>York</hi> the ſame day he removed from
<hi>London.</hi> But if he ſhould ſay, I came
from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>York</hi> without ſpecify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time, none would imagine but
that he had lodging-places betwixt
<hi>London</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> So that this Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
furniſhes me with one Argument
more for my applying the 15th day
to their Murmuring not Marching.</p>
               <p>The ſame eminent Perſon adviſeth
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53656:64"/>
me to conſider whether the <hi>Septuagint</hi>
can weigh down the <hi>Hebrew, Samaritan,
Syriac, Arabick, Targum,</hi> &amp;c. all which
refer the 15th day to their Marching.</p>
               <p>I have conſidered this, and am very
apprehenſive what a difficult and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Task I undertake, if I ſhould
prefer the <hi>Septuagint</hi> above the <hi>Hebrew.</hi>
I remember how angry <hi>Jerom</hi> was
with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> for preferring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his <hi>Hebraica Veritas,</hi> and what
oppoſition the late attempt of <hi>Voſius</hi>
hath met with: And yet I cannot but
retain a ſingular honour in my heart
for it.</p>
               <p>1. As being better ſecured from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
corrupted by the faithleſs <hi>Jews;</hi>
when the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> by reaſon of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
communicated many hundred
years before the Chriſtian <hi>Aera</hi> to the
Gentile World, and depoſited in <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomies</hi>
famous Library, whither the
Philoſophers flocked from all parts
of the World, ſaith <hi>Elian;</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence foreſeeing what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful
Keepers of the divine Oracles,
that People to whom they were firſt
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53656:65"/>
committed would prove [when for
their rejecting Chriſt they became <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ammi</hi>]
provided that the Gentiles
ſhould come to the light thereof by
means of the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> ſo long before
our Saviour's coming, the contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
of whoſe appearance ſo enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Learned Party of the Jews,
who had the Hebrew Copies in their
cuſtody, (for the vulgar Jews under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
not Hebrew in our Saviour's
time) as in revenge they defaced his
Image drawn by their own Prophets,
for repreſenting him ſuch as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
proclaimed him to be: whence
proceeded thoſe numerous Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
mentioned by <hi>Voſſius</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>2. The Apoſtles making ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
if not conſtant uſe of it in their
quotations of the old Teſtament, ſeems
to me a Canonization of the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a commending it above the
Hebrew.</p>
               <p>3. If the Hebrew be to be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
where it affronts the <hi>Septuagiut,</hi> it
ought to be ſo, eſpecially in ſuch Texts
as have relation to their Sabbath. Their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53656:65"/>
idolizing of which might prompt them
to diſturb the Pointing of this Text,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. which according to the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint,</hi>
ſpeaks it to be a younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Sunday-Sabbath.</p>
               <p>4. And for my preferring the <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint</hi>
before the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in thoſe
Texts that have relation to the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
I have the example of our own
Church to be my warrant; which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres
to that Verſion in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of thef ourth Precept, both in the
Catechiſm, where ſhe feeds her Babes
with Milk, and in the Office of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
where ſhe reminds her adult
Members of that part of their Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Vow, whereby they ſtand obliged
to keep God's holy Will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.
Altho the <hi>Hebrew, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,
Spaniſh,</hi> and that of <hi>Jerom,</hi> and
all I have peruſed, ſaith <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi>
render it [<hi>wherefore the Lord bleſſed the
Sabbath-Day</hi>] except the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
which renders it, [<hi>The Seventh Day,</hi>]
altho our laſt Tranſlation of the Bible
follows the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> Altho the <hi>Puritans</hi>
(as they were called) have called long
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53656:66"/>
and loud to our Church to rectify the
Reading, and conform it to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
as knowing that their opinion
of the fourth Precept commandeth
[a] Seventh, not [the] Seventh Day,
is utterly overthrown by rendring
it, <hi>Wherefore the Lord Bleſſed [the]
Seventh-day.</hi> And altho our Church
hath gratified their Clamours, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Epiſtles and Goſpels to
our laſt Tranſlation, yet in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
verſions of the fourth Precept
ſhe adheres ſtill to the <hi>Septuagint,</hi>
and perſiſteth in teaching her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
young and old, that the Sabbath
of the fourth Precept in the plain li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral
ſenſe of it, is the <hi>Seventh day,</hi>
wherein God reſted, and therefore
ſanctified, and ſeparated to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by us Chriſtians in obedience to
that Precept, and in conformity to
God's Example. Or, to give her ſenſe
of this Precept thus tranſlated in her
own words, (<hi>Homilie of the time and
place of Prayer</hi> 
                  <q>[God expreſly in the
fourth Precept commandeth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Sabbath, which is our
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53656:66"/>
Sunday: And not only command<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth
it, but alſo by his own example
doth ſtir and provoke us to diligent
keeping of the ſame.] And a little
after [this Example and Command of
God, the Godly Chriſtian People
began to follow immediately after
the Aſcenſion of our Lord Chriſt.]</q>
It was, you ſee, in obedience to this
Command, urged by this Example,
that the Chriſtians began to celebrate
<hi>Sunday</hi> in our Churche's Judgment.
In Obedience (I ſay) to this Precept,
in the plain literal ſenſe of it: For ſure
the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
Mother, than to teach her
Babes by Tropes and Figures, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetch'd
Conſequences, what that holy
Will of God is, to the keeping whereof
their Baptiſmal Vow obligeth them,
or to oblige them to ſay, <hi>Lord have
Mercy upon us, and incline our hearts
to keep this Law,</hi> after the pronounc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the fourth Precept at the Lord's
Table, if that did not ſtand intirely in
every tittle of it, according to its plain
and primitive ſenſe, in as full force
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53656:67"/>
now under the Goſpel, as any of the
reſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in God's
Houſe, and therefore at his repeating
of the Decalogue, and applying it to
the Iſraelites, he lets them know that
they were not concerned in that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for ſanctifying of that Sabbath
which God publiſhed on the Mount,
to wit, [<hi>becauſe God reſted on the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth-day</hi>]
but urgeth the keeping of
their Sabbath, by another Reaſon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to themſelves, to wit, their reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Egyptian Bondage, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.
which very Reaſon is an Argument
that their <hi>Saturday-Sabbath</hi> was not
the day on which God reſted, but local
and temporary. And God's urging the
ſanctifying of the Sabbath of the
fourth Precept from his own Example,
argues the day therein commanded to
be the day whereon God reſted, and
to concern all Ages and Nations.
The reaſon of it being common to all,
and therefore to be our <hi>Sunday.</hi> And
this ſpeaks the faithfulneſs of our
Church, <hi>viz.</hi> her informing her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that the whole and intire both
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53656:67"/>
Precept and Reaſon, appertains to us
Chriſtians, and therefore we are bound
to beg pardon for the breach thereof,
and Grace to obſerve it.</p>
               <p>I had never much Artificial, yet
have ſo much Natural Logick, as to
think this a very ſtrange Inference:
God reſted the Seventh-day, that is,
<hi>Saturday:</hi> wherefore the Lord bleſſed
the Sabbath day, that is <hi>Sunday;</hi> and
the common Opinion to be void of
Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> That the day command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this Precept is gon, but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
remains: ſeeing all that's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
is the ſanctifying of the day
whereon God reſted.</p>
               <p>It may with every whit as much
reaſon be ſaid, the honouring of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Mother is gone, but the Law
commanding that Honour is ſtill in
force, as that the day whereon the
Command bids us reſt, is gone, but
the Precept commanding that Day of
Reſt remains; as if that day injoyned
belonged to the Jews, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
enjoyning, to us. My reſentment
of ſuch horrible abſurdities unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53656:68"/>
iſſuing from the common Opinion,
that <hi>Saturday</hi> is the Day whereon
God reſted, and that Day which he
commanded the Jews to ſanctifie, in
the fourth Precept: And yet that the
Precept is ſtill in force to us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
obliging us to ſanctifie another
day, <hi>Sunday;</hi> in Conjunction with the
reverence I bear to the ſounder Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England, viz.</hi>
That the fourth Precept commands us
to celebrate <hi>Sunday,</hi> upon the Account
of God's reſting on that day, firſt
put me upon that enquiry, whereof
my <hi>Treatiſe of the Sabbath</hi> is the reſult,
<hi>viz.</hi> whether that <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> could be
proved from Scripture and Reaſon;
and if proved, whether it would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
unto us our <hi>Sunday-Sabbath,</hi>
without any new Inſtitution by
Chriſt's Precept, upon better grounds
than can be laid by the vulgar opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and ſuch as free our Necks from
the yoak of thoſe carnal auſterities
which attend the Jewiſh Temporary
and Ceremonial <hi>Saturday-Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Deſign I confeſs affronts the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53656:68"/>
whole World of private modern
Writers: but I have ſtanding on my
ſide the Church of <hi>England</hi> which
carried on the Reformation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion from Papal Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
more pecately, regularly, cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
and with a greater reſpect to
Catholick Antiquity, than any other
Reformed Church did. And that which
inclined me the rather to follow her
Conduct through my whole Tract of
the Sabbath, was this; becauſe I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
that the Writers upon the
fourth Precept have fallen into inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable
perplexities, meerly through
this one miſtake, That the Sabbath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
in that Precept is <hi>Saturday,</hi>
and not (as our Church teacheth)
<hi>Sunday.</hi> And that if they had followed
our Churches Clew, they would have
found the way out of thoſe Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths,
wherein they have loſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>For if Sunday be the Day whereon
God reſted, and therefore commanded
in that Precept to be ſanctified after
God's Example (and unleſs it be that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53656:69"/>
day wereon God reſted, that Precept
does not command the ſanctification
of it) how naturally will theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
follow;</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Adam</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs</hi>
could not be ignorant of that Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, which was laid down in
the Precept, as the Reaſon why we
are to ſanctifie it: for if that reaſon
oblige us who only hear it; It muſt
much more oblige <hi>Adam</hi> who after
a ſort ſaw it.</p>
               <p>2. That the Law of the <hi>Saturday-Sabbath</hi>
is not expreſly commanded
in that Precept, but only reducible to
it in regard of its equity and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of time, <hi>viz.</hi> one of ſeven. And
therefore Saturday-Sabbath may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
and the Precept continue in full
force. Nay, that Sabbath, together
with the Ceremonial Precepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, muſt (as the reſt of <hi>Moſaick</hi>
Ceremonies) depart at the rending of
the Vail, and give way to the Sunday-Sabbath.
And thus the Chriſtian Church
is disburdened of thoſe Auſterities,
about which there hath been ſo much
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53656:69"/>
wrangling amongſt Modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>3. That there was no need of a
new Goſpel-Precept for the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of Sunday-Sabbath; and that
therefore Chriſt's Reſurrection, his
Converſe with his Diſciples, and their
celebration of holy Aſſemblies on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
do warrant us to keep that day
as ſure and infallible Guides to the
Old Patriarchal Sunday-Sabbath,
mentioned in the fourth Precept;
which was to take place again on
courſe at the expiration of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
and Ceremonial Sabbath, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
the Jews for a time, as a badge
to difference them from other Nations;
but is too ſandy a ground whereon to
build the Inſtitution of a new Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day,
in direct oppoſition to the
expreſs Precept and example of God:
And thus the mouth of the Saturday-Sabbatarians
is ſtopt.</p>
               <p>But tho I might without deſerved
blame (being back'd with ſo great
Authorities) prefer the <hi>Septuagint</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Hebrew, Exod.</hi> 16. 1. yet I
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53656:70"/>
preſume not to prefer the Text of the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> before the Text of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
but only compare the Text of
the <hi>Septuagint</hi> (which is utterly inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any other pointing than
what I urge) with the pointing of the
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> which referrs to the 15th day
of their coming into the Wilderneſs.</p>
               <p>And here the preference may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſparagement to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text,
be given to the <hi>Septuagint;</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p>1. That it is a queſtion amongſt
the Learned, whether the <hi>Pentateuch</hi>
had any Vowels, or ſo much as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Words, but was all as one
word before the <hi>Maſorites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That it is not agreed who thoſe
<hi>Maſorites</hi> were that diſtinguiſh'd the
Old Teſtament into Sections and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
whether the wiſe Men of <hi>Tiberias,</hi>
or thoſe of <hi>Ezra's</hi> Synagogue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſtortion is capable of the ſame
pointing that I urge, but the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint</hi>
capable of no other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53656:70"/>
to ask whether the immoveable
pointing of the <hi>Septuagint</hi> ſhould yeild
to the moveable point of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi>
is to queſtion whether the Mountain
ſhould come to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet</hi>
to the Mountain.</p>
               <p>4. I have the Suffrage of Learned
Men to ſtand by me, in aſſerting that
the Quails fell and were gathered on
the fifteenth day. For <hi>Bochart</hi> in his
<hi>Hierozoicon, Cornelius a Lapide, Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi>
&amp;c. on <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. affirm that the
Quails mentioned, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. fell on
the fifteenth day of the ſecond month,
and it is certain from the Text that
the Quails fell on that day they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured.</p>

               <p>The next Inference I draw from
this Text is this, That this Aſſembly
hath all the Characters of a Church-Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>1. It is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the
whole Congregation,</hi> or Church of the
Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to difference it
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53656:71"/>
from the People or mixt multitude
that murmured at <hi>Marah: Chap.</hi> 15. 24.
that marched in one Body with the
Iſraelites, and are implied in the firſt
clauſe of verſe 1. <hi>They took their
Journey from Elim.</hi> And in that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
15. 27. <hi>and they came to Elim,</hi>
meaning the Iſraelites, with the mixt
multitude. <hi>And as they came to Elim:</hi>
ſo here the ſame [they] are ſaid to
journy from <hi>Elim;</hi> but when <hi>Moſes</hi>
gives an account of what fell out when
they came into the Wilderneſs of <hi>Sin,</hi>
he ſhakes off the mixt multitude, and
leaves them out of his Diſcourſe, by
changing the phraſe he uſed, when he
ſpeaks of their Journeying, and ſaying,
<hi>The whole Congregation of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Iſrael <hi>came into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
And the whole Congregation
of the Children of Iſrael on the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day murmured.</hi> By which he
intimates this Aſſembly to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
wholly and ſolely of Iſraelites,
and to have been of the ſame make
with that which St. <hi>Stephen</hi> calls the
Church in the Wilderneſs, conſiſting
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:53656:71"/>
of <hi>our Fathers,</hi> as he ſtiles them, he,
and thoſe he ſpake to, being Jews, <hi>Act.</hi>
7. 28. Briefly, this was not a murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their Tents, like that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.
25. and that <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 2. at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of the Spies; or that through their
Families, every Man at his own Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door,
(<hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 10) where we have
the mixed multitude repreſented as
the fomenters thereof: And therefore
if they had been of this Murmuring.
Aſſembly in my Text, they would
have been mentioned here as well as
there.</p>
               <p>2. Here is the whole Church of
Iſrael aſſembled on courſe before the
Lord; for <hi>Moſes</hi> did not call them, but
finds them together. <hi>Aaron</hi> indeed bids
them come near before the Lord,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, before the face of the
Lord: but all he meant by that, was,
that they ſhould turn their faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Pillar, the then token of
God's ſpecial Preſence: for that was
all they did in compliance with that
Injunction, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. [And as <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake
unto them they looked toward the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:53656:72"/>
Wilderneſs, and the Glory of the
Lord appeared in the Pilar of Cloud.]
And that is an Argument they were
already before the Lord, though not
ſo as to face the cloudy Pillar as they
did in their Journyings, yet they were
aſſembled before, or about the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
the ancient token of God's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
I mean that little Tabernacle
which they had, before the erecting
of that which <hi>Moſes</hi> received the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of in the Mount; and therefore
brought with them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to
which they had uſed to repair for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip, for the ſake of publick
Prayer, ſo <hi>Mede, Rivet, Willet.</hi> It was,
ſaith <hi>Vatablus,</hi> a little portable Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;
this was it that <hi>Moſes,</hi> after they
had worſhipped the Golden Calf, took
and pitched far off from the Camp, to
which every one that ſought the Lord
went out, <hi>Num.</hi> 33. 7. this was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of the ſacred Convention, ſo
<hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius:</hi> of the Church,
<hi>Pagn.</hi> The Hebrew word is <hi>Mogned,</hi>
whence is derived <hi>Lemognedim, Gen.</hi> 1.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53656:72"/>
which ſignifies ſolemn ſtated Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
as hath been obſerved before.
Towards this they directed their Faces
in their ſacred Aſſemblies: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Aaron</hi> withdraws their Faces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Pillar of Cloud, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11.
where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood praying, while
<hi>Aaron</hi> was ſpeaking to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſaith Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> upon the place.</p>
               <p>3 This Aſſembly hath this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Religious Convention, that
it was inſtructed by an Eccleſiaſtical
Miniſter, <hi>Aaron</hi> the Prieſt; for <hi>Moſes</hi>
commanded <hi>Aaron</hi> expreſly that he
ſhould ſpeak to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. Now if
this had not been <hi>Coetus Eccleſiaſticus,</hi>
a Church Aſſembly, it had been more
proper for <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf to have come
with his Rod in his hand, and have
ſpoken to them: for he might with
Authority have ſilenced their mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring,
as he did <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 24. when
they murmured for want of Fleſh:
And as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſtilled them,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 6. after the return of the
Searchers. It is ſaid indeed <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53656:73"/>
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake to them, but
the meaning of that is no more than
thus, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake mediately and
<hi>Aaron</hi> immediately, <hi>Moſes</hi> by putting
words into <hi>Aarons</hi> mouth, and <hi>Aaron</hi>
by conveying thoſe words into the
Peoples Ears, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
given, <hi>Exod. 4. 15. Thou ſhalt
ſpeak to</hi> Aaron <hi>the Levite, and put words
into his Mouth, and I will be with thy
Mouth, and with his Mouth: and he
ſhall be thy ſpokeſman unto the People.</hi>
It is alſo ſaid <hi>verſ. 8. That</hi> Moſes
<hi>ſaid, &amp;c.</hi> but that muſt have the ſame
interpretation, or be rendred by the
<hi>Preterpluperfect tenſe [Moſes had ſaid</hi>]
that is, had inſtructed <hi>Aaron</hi> what he
ſhould ſay; and ſo muſt <hi>verſ. 11. And
the Lord had ſaid to Moſes;</hi> for it is
manifeſt that God had ſaid that to
<hi>Moſes</hi> before: And the reſon why
it is repeated over and over, that the
Lord had ſaid, and <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſaid, is
to ſhew what part of that Revelation
of his mind that God made to <hi>Moſes,
verſ.</hi> 4, 5. was communicated at that
time by <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and by <hi>Aaron</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:53656:73"/>
to the Aſſembly, and what part of it
was not then, but afterwards commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated;
It being manifeſt that <hi>Moſes</hi>
did not acquaint them with the reaſon
of God's precept to gather a double
portion on the Sixth day till they had
gathered it. It remains therefore, that
ſeeing <hi>Aaron</hi> was not a Prophet, who
received Revelations immediatly from
God, but publiſhed Divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
received by <hi>Moſes</hi> unto the
People, (which is the proper Work of
an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter in a Church-Aſſembly,
1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23, 24.) his being
appointed by <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſpeak, argues
this Aſſembly to have been a Church-Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, if what hath been offer'd
for the proof of this ſecond Inference,
ſhall upon ſerious ponderation ſeem
too light, the main Cauſe will ſuffer
no other detriment than the loſs of
one peice of an Argument; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
my main aim in urging this Text
was to find ſure footing for calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time backward unto the tenth
day of the firſt month, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53656:74"/>
whereon undoubtedly the Iſraelites
kept a religious publick Aſſembly on
courſe. And that tenth day will be
demonſtrated to have been Sunday.
If it be made apparent that the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day of the ſecond month, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Quails were gathered, be to be
reckoned the firſt of the ſix gathering
dayes. And that is,</p>
            </div>
            <div n="6" type="section">
               <head>SECT. VI.</head>
               <p>The third Inference I draw from
this Inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> that the fifteenth
day of the ſecond month, whereon this
ſolemn Church-Aſſembly conven'd on
courſe, was Sunday. And that it was
ſo, will appear by computing the ſix
gathering dayes immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Jewiſh Saturday-Sabbath,
concerning which there is this only
Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the fifteenth
day be to be brought into the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of thoſe ſix gathering days.
For the reſolution of which doubt, let
the divine Oracle be conſulted, <hi>verſ. 4.
[I will rain Bread for you from Heaven,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53656:74"/>
and you ſhall go out and gather it</hi>—. <hi>And
the ſixth day you ſhall gather twice as
much.</hi>] and verſ. 12. [<hi>ye ſhall eat Fleſh
to the full this day at even] intor duas
veſperas,</hi> betwixt the two Evenings,
<hi>i.e.</hi> betwixt three a Clock in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
and the ſhutting in. This is that
very time of the day wherein our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
was Crucified, Dead, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried:
and therefore their gathering,
dreſſing and eating their Belly full of
Quails does as properly belong to this
fifteenth day, as our Saviour's Death
and Burial unto Friday.</p>
               <p>2. Obſerve, That the Precept to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
twice as much the Sixth day was
given before any mention was made
of Fleſh and Bread diſtinctly, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moſes</hi> knew what they were to
gather, any further than was expreſt
by [<hi>Bread rained down from Heaven.</hi>]
Now Bread implies (<hi>ver.</hi> 4.) all kind of
Victuals, as every one knows that can
ſay the Lord's Prayer, except ſuch
profound Clerks as are of that Boy's
humour, who when he came to the
Petition for <hi>daily Bread</hi> was wont
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53656:75"/>
to add [<hi>and Butter too good Mother</hi>]
And what ſatisfaction could it have
been to <hi>Moſes</hi> to hear God promiſe
Bread, when the People murmured
for want of Fleſh, as well as Bread, if
he had not conceived that both were
comprehended under the name of
Bread. Beſides, <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 105. 40.
called the Quails the Bread of Heaven,
which <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78. 27. he ſaith God rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon them from Heaven, the very
word that God uſeth, <hi>verſ. 4. I will
rain Bread from Heaven.</hi> Add to all
this that our Saviour, (<hi>Joh. 6. 55, &amp;c.</hi>)
alluding to this very Hiſtory of Quails
and Manna, uſeth the ſame form of
expreſſion, [<hi>The Bread that I will give
is my Fleſh,</hi>] Bread therefore as well
here as there includes fleſh, and
Bread, Quails and Manna. And to
put this beyond all poſſibility of
doubt, the <hi>Septuagint</hi> and vulgar <hi>Latin</hi>
expreſs what they gathered on the
ſixth day, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>cibos duplices:</hi>
double neceſſaries, double Victuals.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, It was not for all kind of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53656:75"/>
Fleſh that they murmured; for tho
their Proviſion of Bread might poſſibly
be ſpent, yet that they ſhould conſume
the Herds and Flocks they brought
out of <hi>Egypt</hi> (where they left not one
Hoof behind) <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 26. in one
months ſpace, is utterly incredible; or
that in that ſpace they were grown ſo
lean as to be unfit for Food, ſeeing
they had for that forty years long,
Oxen, Sheep, and Goats, fit for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
<hi>Act.</hi> 7. 42. But for want of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Fleſh, and ſuch potted Fleſh as
they had plenty of in <hi>Egypt;</hi> And that
was no other than Quails, which were
ſo plentiful in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
could not conſume them while
they were freſh, (tho <hi>Joſephus</hi> affirms
that <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſo populous as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
750 Myriades, beſides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of <hi>Alexandria</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they potted them up for the
whole year, as ſaith <hi>Atheneus, l. 1. c. 11.
de Coturnicibus.</hi> Now can it in reaſon
be imagined that the Jews ſhould

they gathered Quails, their beloved

and longed for Fleſh, that was <hi>Judaeis

               </p>
               <p>From all which it is manifeſt that
the fifteenth day on which the Quails
were gathered, was the firſt of the ſix
gathering days: The laſt whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Friday the Eve of their Saturday-Sabbath,
<hi>verſ.</hi> 22. the firſt muſt needs
be Sunday, the fifteenth day of the
ſecond month whereon this Aſſembly
before the Lord was kept. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
before this following Inſtitution
of the Jewiſh Saturday-Sabbath, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
was their weekly Sabbath. For the

               <p>This fourth Inference from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Saturday after
this fifteenth day was the firſt Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
Sabbath that ever was kept.</p>
               <p>This is apparent from <hi>ver.</hi> 22. [On
the ſixth day they gathered twice as
much: And all the Rulers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
came and told <hi>Moſes.</hi>] Now
there cannot be imagined any other
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53656:76"/>
reaſon of their acquainting <hi>Moſes</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
but that they might underſtand
by him what was to be done with the
overplus, and to what purpoſe they
were ordered to gather that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that day, ſeeing what had been
kept over-night ſtank the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<hi>verſ. 20. Vt ex eo cognoſcerent
quorſum hoc fuiſſet Juſſum; neque enim
adhuc Dominus declaraverat ſe ob Sabbati
Religionem id praeſcripſiſſe, quod ſtatim
Moſes explicat,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius
a Lapide</hi> obſerve: [They came
to <hi>Moſes</hi> to know of him wherefore
this was commanded, for the Lord
had not as yet declared that he had
preſcribed this double portion with a
religious reſpect to the Sabbath, which
<hi>Moſes</hi> forthwith explains] <hi>verſ. 23.
[To morrow is the reſt of the holy Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi>
&amp;c.] and verſ. 29. [<hi>See becauſe
the Lord hath given you this Sabbath,
therefore he hath given you on the ſixth
day the Bread of two days.] Philo Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeus</hi>
ſaith, that the Hebrews were
taught by this, which was the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
of the World, whereof their
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53656:77"/>
Forefathers were ignorant; a very
likely thing! that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould not
know the <hi>Patriarchal Sabbath. L'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange</hi>
will have it thus: That the
Elders made not ſtrange at the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
but at the ſtrictneſs of the Reſt
now commanded; But he ſhould have
called to mind that nothing was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of that till after the Elders were
come to <hi>Moſes.</hi> And if we duly weigh
the Story, the Elders will be found to
have thought it ſtrange, why the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
gathered this double portion on
Friday, for the Elders knew that a
double portion was to be gathered on
the ſixth day, ſix days before: And
therefore would doubtleſs have appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves to <hi>Moſes</hi> before now,
for a reſolution, if they had then que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
for what end they were to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
double on the ſixth day; and
no other reaſon can be imagined of
that delay, but that their thoughts
were ſuſpended all that while upon
the ſixth day of the <hi>Patriarchal-week,</hi>
which is Saturday, till they ſaw the
People gather on the ſixth day in the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:53656:77"/>
order of the gathering days; and
then and not till then they came to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> that he might reſolve them
whether the Precept was to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
of the ſixth day in the order of
the Creation, which had hitherto
been the preparation for the Sabbath,
or whether it was God's purpoſe to
alter the Sabbath, and transfer it from
Sunday to Saturday, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Friday now muſt be their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
day, or (which comes all to
one) whether the ſix days were to
comenſe at the firſt gathering-day, or
the firſt of the <hi>Patriarchal week.</hi> And
this ſeruple propounded by all the
Elders, that is, all the grave men of the
Congregation, who had been longeſt
acquainted with the Ancient Sabbath;
for Elders in the Text does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
a name of Office but of Age, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
by Office not being conſtituted
till <hi>Jethro</hi> had adviſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18. 21. Theſe it
ſeems had not themſelves gathered a
double portion, but thought the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
ſort timerarious in their account
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53656:78"/>
of days, and therefore acquaint <hi>Moſes</hi>
with it, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> thus reſolves:
[This is that the Lord hath ſaid, <hi>to
morrow is the reſt of the holy Sabbath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord.</hi>] When did God ſay this,
but in his Precept to gather twice as
much on the ſixth day? So that here
<hi>Moſes</hi> comments upon the Precept,
telling them that thereby God appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Jews the morrow following
to be thence-forward their weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.
Whereas if they had been uſed
before to keep Saturday-Sabbath, the
Rulers needed not to have applied
themſelves to <hi>Moſes</hi> for the reſolution
of ſuch a queſtion, as a Child might
have unriddled: for it cannot be
imagined but the day before the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Sabbath</hi> was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
a preparation to it: whereon
Reaſon would tell Men that they
ought to ſet their ſecular Affairs in ſuch
good order, as they might not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted
by them in the ſacred exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
of the Sabbath, which from the
firſt was ſo to be ſanctified, as no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile
work was to be done thereon.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53656:78"/>
And ſeeing the Iſraelites at this time
had no other ſervile work to do but
gathering, and dreſſing of Manna; if
they had not been reſtrained from
that on the Sabbath, there would have
been no difference betwixt that and
other days in reſpect of ceſſation from
common work. And therefore upon
that ſuppoſition that Saturday was
their ancient Sabbath, the Elders muſt
have been Children in underſtanding,
if they perceived not the reaſon of
the Precept, for gathering twice as
much on Friday. To ſum up the
whole of this Argument: This is the
firſt Saturday-Sabbath we find cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the Wrold for 2453 Years
at the loweſt account, and that the
whole World ſhould live to that age
without a Sabbath, is the moſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
of Incredibles. In order to the
vindication of the <hi>Patriarchal-Church</hi>
from ſo black a Crime, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to ſhew that Sunday-Sabbath
was obſerved before the Inſtitution of
the Jewiſh Saturday-Sabbath, from
the firſt inſtance: And I ſhall give
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53656:79"/>
more clear and unexceptionable proof
thereof in the other forenamed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
drawn from <hi>Exod. 12. 3. Speak
ye unto all the Congregation of Iſrael,
ſaying, On the tenth day of this mouth they
ſhall take to them a Lamb,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>2d Inſtance.</hi> If we reckon backward
from the <hi>15th</hi> day of the ſecond
month, which we demonſtrated to have
been Sunday, till we come to the tenth
day of the firſt month, we ſhall find
that tenth day to have been Sunday,
and to have been celebrated by the
Iſraelites, (and by conſequence the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
alſo) their keeping thereon
a ſolemn, religious, ſtated Aſſembly on
courſe.</p>
               <p>1. That this tenth day fell on Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
may be thus collected by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde
calculation of days, from the
fifteenth of the ſecond month to the
tenth of the firſt.</p>

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:53656:79"/>
For the proof of this Account,
wherein I aſſign 30 days to a month,
I have the plain teſtimony of <hi>Moſes,
Gen.</hi> 7. 24. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 4.
where the beginning of the 150 days
of the Waters prevailing above the
Earth, is ſaid to be the 17th day of the
month, and the end of thoſe days the
17th of the 7th month, that is, juſt five
months, if we aſſign to each month 30
days. And <hi>Deut. 12. 13. [She ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
her Father and Mother a month of
days.</hi>] This would have been a <hi>Lesbian</hi>
Rule, if their months had not conſiſted
of an equal number of days. And
if the days of every of thoſe months
wherein the Waters prevailed, had not
been thirty, the ſpace from the 17th
of the ſecond to the 17th of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
month, would not have amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to 150 days.</p>
               <p>Theſe Texs are ſo plain, as I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how ſo many Men of great and
deſerved name came to be lulled (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

deep a ſleep, as to dream of the Jewiſh
months having aſſigned to them, <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natim,</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:53656:80"/>
30 and 29 days; and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<hi>Moſes</hi> his conduct in ſo plain a
path. An Errour which the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and learned <hi>Vſher</hi> gives his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
againſt, in the Preface to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals:
<hi>The Year</hi> (ſaith he there) <hi>of the
Patriarchs, Egyptians, and Hebrews,
conſiſted of twelve equal months of thirty
days aepiece.</hi> For that the Hebrews u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Lunary months before the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh
Captivity, is more than can be
proved from this ſo infallible an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that the Patriarchs reckoned
thirty days to the month, (what ever
Innovation after-Ages introduc'd is not
here material.) A demonſtrative proof
may be drawn of the truth of the firſt
Inſtance alſo: that the 15th of the
ſecond month, (<hi>Exod.</hi> 16.) fell on
Sunday. Thus, the firſt month days,
10, 17, 24. The ſecond month days,
1, 8, 15, were Sundays. And thus theſe
Inſtances will mutually illuſtrate one
another, as we ſhall ſee in the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Inferences, alſo which we ſhall

2. The next thing I infer hence is
this, That on this Sunday, falling on
the tenth of the firſt month, <hi>Moſes</hi>
and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake unto the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
concerning the Ceremonies
and inſtitution of the Paſſover, <hi>Exod.
12. 1, 2, 3. [Speak ye unto all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi>
(the whole Church of the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo <hi>Ainſworth) ſaying on the
tenth day, that they take up a Lamb, &amp;c.</hi>]
So <hi>Ainſworth</hi> (verbatim) after the He-Hebrew;
ſaying that the Hebrew re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
the 10th day to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron's</hi>
ſpeaking to them more diſtinctly,
[<hi>Speak ye—on the tenth day. And they
ſhall take up a Lamb.</hi>] And <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.
where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks then to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſaying, [<hi>Draw you out a Lamb.</hi>]
And <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. Where the Text ſaith,
[<hi>They went and did as</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron
had commanded them.] From theſe
Texts it is clear as day, that it was the
tenth day whereon this Speech was
made to the Church-Aſſemhly. For
this term [<hi>Then</hi>] can ſpeak nothing
leſs: and the ſequel implies, that at
the breaking up of the Aſſembly they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53656:81"/>
went immediately and took up their
Lambs the ſame day for the Paſſover,
that was to be kept the 14th day. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
ſeeing the taking up the Paſchals
on the tenth day, was peculiar to this
firſt Paſſover (as alſo were ſeveral
other Ceremonies of it) as the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practice
of the Jews, and of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
himſelf, evinceth. It had been mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to have bid them, on the 14th
day, take up Lambs on the tenth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going.
And therefore I wonder to ſee
wiſe Men, like ſo many Geeſe in a
miſt, ſtraggle in ſo much light, from
the plain path of moſt obvious truth,
into that maze of vulgar errour, <hi>viz.</hi>
that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake to the Congregation
on the 14th day, touching the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of the Paſſover: eſpecially
when I conſider the weakneſs of the
Argument inducing them into that
opinion, this being their <hi>Herculean;</hi>
becauſe it is ſaid [<hi>This night will I
paſs through Egypt, and ſtay,</hi> &amp;c.] But
who, ſave one that hath his Eyes in
the ends of the Earth, can over-look
this eaſy anſwer; that that is ſpoken
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53656:81"/>
of the night of that day, whereof there
he ſpeaks, not of that whereon he
ſpake.</p>
               <p>From the Premiſes alſo appears the
over-ſight of them, who prolong the
three days darkneſs, unto the 14th
day, dreaming (as if they had been
frighted out of their Senſes, by ſome
of thoſe <hi>Hob-Goblins</hi> which they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
appear'd to the Egyptians during
that darkneſs) that the Iſraelites took
that opportunity, to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for their Journey, of Egyptian
Jewels and other neceſſaries. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
had been a robbing of the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians
with a witneſs. But they muſt
have had Cats Eyes, if they could ſee
where their Prey lay in that palpable
darkneſs. For, though the Iſraelites
had light where they dwelt, yet I do
not think that they could find, in the
dwellings of the Egyptians, light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to pilfer by, if they did not
bring it with them, in their Eyes or
Cloakbags, from <hi>Goſhan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, How oppoſite is this to the
whole ſeries of the Hiſtory, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53656:82"/>
tells us that the Egyptians lent them
freely, what they had occaſion for:
That <hi>Moſes</hi> was in high eſteem of
<hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Servants and all the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
who would have <hi>lent,</hi> or given,
the Iſraelites <hi>the Shirts</hi> off their backs,
to have been quit of them and their
Plagues together.</p>
               <p>3. From the foreſaid Texts, and the
circumſtances of the ſtory, it appears,
that this Aſſembly was not called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gather,
by ſpecial Summons upon an
extraordinary account; but met upon
ordinary courſe. For</p>
               <p>1. How could <hi>Moſes</hi> (or any body
elſe) convene them on ſuch a ſudden,
who were ſcattered throughout all
the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> to gather ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
               <p>2. Or is it probable that their
Taskmaſters would have permitted
them to leave their work, to aſſemble
on ſuch a Summons?</p>
               <p>3. Or if the Iſraelites had obtain'd
a play-day of their Taskmaſters, is it
like they would have met together,
upon the Summons of <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53656:82"/>
they look'd upon as a Perſon that
came to make their bondage more
heavy? <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 21. and to whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
they gave no heed, the laſt
time before this he had occaſion to
ſpeak with them? <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9. They
muſt therefore either be aſſembled
now upon courſe, or by immediate
inſpiration of them, one by one, for
there can be no other ſubterfuge here.
And there is no disputeing with Men
that betake themſelves to ſuch faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Briefly, the matter ſtands thus: The
tenth day, being the weekly Sabbath,
whereon they uſually met to worſhip
God; <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by God, to take the opportunity of
that Convention to ſpeak unto them.
And conſidering the Circumſtances the
Jews were then in, it is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that theſe Conventions were of
the like nature, when they met with
<hi>Moſes,</hi> to chide and curſe him: And
when <hi>Moſes</hi> applied himſelf to them,
with promiſes of a good iſſue to his
Meſſage, and they regarded not; As
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53656:83"/>
alſo, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> (and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
all other Nations) celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame day of the week, Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>
               <p>For can it be imagined, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who were kept ſo cloſe
to their work, as to have their task
ſet them, day by day <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (which
the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Tranſlation renders,
<hi>Penſum quotidianum,</hi> their daily Task;

every ſeveral day. And the Hebrew

allowed to reſt from their daily work
on Sundays; if their Taskmaſters, and
the reſt of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> had not
themſelves alſo reſted on that day?</p>
               <p>On the other hand, it was as much
the intereſt of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to have
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> reſt on Sunday, as it was
to the <hi>Jews</hi> to have the Stranger with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

theirs, they would have diverted the

gain of that work from the Natives.
<hi>Grotius in exp. Decalogue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The laſt Inference I draw from
this ſecond Inſtance, is, that this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Aſſembly was for Religious
Worſhip. Which the Premiſes, duly
conſidered, evince: For it was an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
upon courſe, celebrated by the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> at what time the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
alſo reſted: for what elſe can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they met together but to worſhip
God?</p>
               <p>And ſeeing their Bondage was ſo
hard, that their Taskmaſters would not
let them reſt, while themſelves were
at their daily labour, it may be ſafely
concluded that on whatſoever day
they had remiſſion from their daily
Tasks, ſo as to meet together, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
alſo ceaſed from their works.
I cannot ſee what poſſibly can invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
this Conſequence, but the Dream
of this Aſſembly's being kept during
the time of Darkneſs, when the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians
could not ſtir from the place
where they ſate down: upon which
ſuppoſition, indeed, the Iſraelites
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53656:84"/>
might have had a conveniency of
meeting without check. But how
weak their Arguments are, who are
of that Opinion, hath been ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready:
And I will now ſhew the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of it, from the plain order
of the ſacred Hiſtory. For it is
thence manifeſt, that what paſſed in
the whole 11th Chapter, was after the
end of the Darkneſs, and before <hi>Moſes</hi>
went from <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s preſence. That
is, as ſoon as <hi>Moſes</hi> (Chap. 10. <hi>ult.</hi>) had
anſwered <hi>Pharoah, [Thou ſhalt ſee my
face no more.</hi>] God tells <hi>Moſes,</hi> while
he yet ſtood before <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that he
would bring one Plague more upon
<hi>Egypt</hi> that would force <hi>Pharoah</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
them, not only with their own
Goods, but with the Jewels, Silver,
and Gold, &amp;c. of the Egyptians alſo.
And <hi>Moſes</hi> reports this Meſſage to
<hi>Pharoah;</hi> and then, and not till then,
<hi>Moſes</hi> goes out from <hi>Pharoah</hi> in a rage
(<hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 8.) Now it was after all this
that God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
to ſpeak to the whole Congregation
(that ſhould be aſſembled then) on
the 10th day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:53656:84"/>
                  <hi>Beſides, God's bidding both</hi> Moſes
<hi>and</hi> Aaron <hi>ſpeak to the Congregation,
argues it to have been a Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly:
Chap.</hi> 4. 15. Thou ſhalt ſpeak
to Aaron the Levite, and put words in his
mouth; and I will be with thy mouth,
and his mouth. And he ſhall be thy Spokes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
unto the People: And (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 1.)
Aaron thy Brother ſhall be thy Prophet.</p>
               <p>The meaning therefore of [<hi>Speak ye,
&amp;c.</hi>] Chap. 12. 1. is, That <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſhould ſpeak to <hi>Aaron,</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
ſpeak to the People. Now why muſt
<hi>Aaron</hi> ſpeak to the People, if they had
not been a Church-Aſſembly; ſeeing
he was not a temporary, but ſtanding
Prophet; nor a Prophet who received
Revelations from God, but publiſh'd
to the People divine Revelations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by <hi>Moſes?</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
work of an Eccleſiaſtical Miniſter
in a Church-Aſſembly, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23,
24.) But what is reported of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 27. that at its break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up [the People bowed the head
and worſhipped] puts it beyond all
doubt, that it was conven'd for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53656:85"/>
Worſhip. And yet let me add,
as a joint-confirmation of the whole
premiſes, that it is ſcarce conceivable
whence, in more likelihood than from
the Patriarchal Cuſtom of celebrating
Sunday-Sabbath, could flow that moſt
ancient and univerſal Idolatry of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping
the Sun; as the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
beneficient and ſalvifick Deity?
Or, from whence elſe could proceed
the change of the Name of the City
<hi>On</hi> (where <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Father-in-law the
Prince-Prieſt, or Metropolitan of all
<hi>Egypt</hi> had his reſidence) into that of
<hi>Heliopolis,</hi> or the City of the Sun, but
from the abuſe and miſinterpretation
of the Patriarchal Sabbath? conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Planet, whoſe name that Day
bore, which was celebrated as the chief
Day of the Week, to be the chief God.
For that the Sun was worſhipped of
the Egyptians, and all Nations, as the
general all-healing all-ſaving Deity, is
affirmed by <hi>Diodorus, Macrobius, Agel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
and all the Ancients, with unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
conſent, <hi>A quovis ſalubris ſubvenit
animis corporibuſque mortalium. Macrob.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53656:85"/>
Saturnal. l. 1. c.</hi> 20. And ſo decry the
Opinion of the Heathen, that the Sun
was a God, becauſe the Day called by
his Name was dedicated, of all the
Days of the Week, to divine Worſhip:
it ſeemed good to the Chriſtian Church,
to give it a new name [<hi>the Lords Day</hi>]
as being celebrated in memory of our
Lord's Reſurrection, who on that Day
entred into his Reſt, and ceaſed from
his Works, as God did from his. So
that we have in theſe two Inſtances,
which fell within the ſpace of five
Weeks, an account given of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches
keeping <hi>two Sunday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths:</hi>
whereas we hear not of two
Saturday-Sabbaths kept either by the
<hi>Patriarchs</hi> or the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the whole
Old-Teſtament, though that contains
an Hiſtory of the Church, for above
3500 years: I mean <hi>Saturday-Sabbaths</hi>
circumſtanced, as theſe <hi>Sunday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths</hi>
are, with the nomination of the
day and month whereon they were
celebrated.</p>

               <p>The new Creature (Man reſtored by faith

               <p>FOR the proof of this in general,
let us conſider the order of Time
reſpecting <hi>Moſes</hi> his Narrative of Man's
Creation Male and Female, and the
immediate Conſequents thereof till
they were turned out of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe:
and thence we may certainly
collect, that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, and was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on the ſixth day.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Eve</hi> was formed the ſixth
day, is without all doubt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Hiſtory in the whole ſecond
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53656:86"/>
Chapter from the end of <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. in
order of time immediately follows
the mention of God's creating them
Male and Female, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 27. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes
what is recorded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Verſ. 28. Chap. 1. [And God
bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them, be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul

<hi>Moſes</hi> would not interpoſe ſo long
a <hi>Parentheſis</hi> in his breviate of the

and diſpoſal of the Female makes.</p>
               <p>2. The whole third Chapter touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Temptation, Fall, Promiſe of
Chriſt, and turning out of <hi>Eden,</hi> in
time, precedes God's Grant to <hi>Adam</hi>
and <hi>Eve,</hi> made, Chap. 1. verſ. 29.
<hi>Behold, I have given you every Herb up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the face of the whole Earth, and every
Tree, &amp;c.</hi> For while they were in
<hi>Eden,</hi> they had leave only to eat of the
Trees of the Garden, and not of all
them neither, Chap. 2. 17. They muſt
therefore have ſtarv'd after they were
turn'd out of Paradiſe, if God had not
enlarged their Charter: And to find
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53656:87"/>
what that was, and when granted, we
muſt recur back from the end of the
third Chapter (where God takes away
the Table he had furniſh'd for them in
<hi>Eden</hi>) unto the forequoted <hi>chap.</hi> 1. 29.
where he ſpreads a larger Table for
them, furniſh'd with every Herb and
Tree upon the face of the whole
Earth. For it is to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Beaſts, and Birds, and Fiſhes,
fall to't without ſaying Grace; and
thoſe that live by prey ſuſtain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
not only with Vegitables but
Animals, without asking other leave
than their own natures give them—
yet Man as he had not right to feed
on Animals till God granted him that
power after the Flood, Gen. 9. 3. <hi>Every
moving thing that liveth ſhall be meat for
you, even as the green Herb have I given
you all things.</hi> So neither could he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
Vegitables of life, for the ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his own, till God granted
him liberty.</p>
               <p>3. From this Grant therefore (<hi>Chap.</hi>

if we will bring it into due order of

               <p>It is moſt manifeſt from this plain
Chronological account of the ſacred
Hiſtory, that Man fell, was reſtored,
and thruſt out of Paradiſe, the ſixth
day. Cherubims being plac'd with
flaming Swords to guard the Tree of
Life, leaving <hi>Adam</hi> no hope of life by
the firſt Covenant: whither then

Luke 2. 7. [<hi>There was no place for them

taken up to lodg in for that Night,
(<hi>Shindler Pentaglot.</hi>) So early began
our Saviour to have the Chaſtiſment

to <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; he with his

Inn the Hour he was born; as <hi>Adam</hi>
was thruſt out of Paradiſe the day he
was created.</p>
               <p>Thus our Saviour gives his Suffrage
to <hi>John</hi> 8. 44. where he ſtiles the
Devil [<hi>a Murderer from the beginning:</hi>]
for this term [<hi>in the beginning</hi>] de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
the ſix days of the Creation, and
preciſely terminates where God finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Work, as is apparent from
<hi>Gen. 1. 1. [In the Beginning God made
Heaven and Earth];</hi> that is, in the
ſpace of ſix days, wherein the whole
Species of things in Heaven and Earth
had their beginning: Or, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:53656:90"/>
explains it, <hi>Mark 13. 19. [In
thoſe days ſhall be Afflictions, ſuch as was
not from the beginning of the Creation

whereof, ſpeaking of the ſame thing
he calls [<hi>the World,</hi>] and the ſpace
wherein it was made [<hi>the beginning of
the World] Mat.</hi> 24. 21. or, as it is
rendred <hi>John 9. 33. [ſince the World
began, was it not heard, that,</hi> &amp;c.] that
is, ſince God finiſhed the Work of
Creation: Thus [<hi>the beginning</hi>] cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed
the whole Work of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Heb. 1. 10. [Thou, Lord, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
founded the Earth,</hi> &amp;c.] And
though ſometimes it may ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
the Duration before, when it is
ſpoken of God, <hi>Prov. 8. 22. [The Lord
poſſeſſed me in the beginning of his way,
before his Works of old</hi>] yet it no where
extends its Signification beyound the
ſix days Work, when it is applied to
the Creature: It was therefore within
the compaſs of the ſix days that this
Murderer ſlew our firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>Adam</hi> was reſtored through
the Promiſe of the Woman's Seed the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53656:91"/>
ſame day whereon he fell, is apparent
from our Saviour his being ſtiled, <hi>Rev.
13. 8. [the Lamb ſlain from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World];</hi> for this is of the
very ſame Latitude with [<hi>the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>]
Heb. 1. 10. and Heb. 4. 3. [<hi>Though
the Works were finiſhed from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World];</hi> that is, in the ſixth
day diſtinguished from the ſeventh
day, <hi>verſ. 4. [For he ſpake of the ſeventh
day on this wiſe; and God reſted the
ſeventh day from all his Works]:</hi> ſo that
the time ſpecified by [<hi>from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the World] verſ.</hi> 3. concludes
with the ſixth day, before the ſeventh
whereon God reſted. Now, Chriſt
cannot be ſaid to be ſlain then actually
(for ſo he was not ſlain till the fulneſs
of Time, till the Hour appointed of the
Father); nor in the divine Decree (for
ſo he was ſlain before the Foundation
of the World) but only in reſpect of the
Promiſe then made to <hi>Adam:</hi> In which
Promiſe he was exhibited as God-man;
as Man, in regard of the Serpent's bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
his Heel; as God, in regard of
his breaking the Serpent's Head. This
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53656:91"/>
leads me into a Flowry Field of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
wherein I muſt crave leave
to <hi>expatiate</hi> and refreſh my ſelf after
my tedious Walk through dark and
controverted Texts, in the purſuit of
Truth; I ſhall therefore offer here
theſe things to Conſideration.</p>
               <p>1. When things are once put into a
divine Promiſe, they are then in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Language ſaid to be; for tho they
attain not to actual Exiſtence till long
after, yet the Promiſe gives them a real
being, or metaphyſical Eſſence, as <hi>rosa in
Hieme.</hi> Hence God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
Gen. 17. 15. [<hi>I have made thee a Father
of many Nations</hi>] when as yet <hi>Iſaac</hi>
(through whom he was to be the Father
of many Nations) was not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in the Womb, nor in human pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
ever like to be conceived in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>'s
Womb. From which Inſtance the
Apoſtle draws this Inference, that God
calls things that be not (as to actual
Exiſtence) as if they were (in real
Eſſence) becauſe he that promiſed
was able to perform it, and was then
engaged to perform it upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53656:92"/>
of his Veracity; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. ſo
that it was as impoſſible that it could
miſcarry, or prove abortive, as that
God can lye. From which Promiſe
we have a thouſand times greater <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance</hi>
to ſay the Lamb was then ſlain,
then we have to ſay (while the Fruit
is only in the Root, and not brought
forth) this is a Pippin, this a Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> For this latter is grounded on
a Lie, upon the immutability of God's
Covenant with Day and Night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which though we cannot, yet God can
break, yea hath broke, as when he
made the Sun ſtand ſtill in the days of
<hi>Joſhua;</hi> go back at <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Prayer,
and ſuſpended its Light at our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
Paſſion; as the Fire did alſo its
burning property in the Caſe of the
three Children: but the former is
grounded on the Immutability of God's
Promiſe by Oath, and the moſt ſacred
Oath, even by Himſelf, than whom he
hath not a greater to ſwear by. In
reſpect of this Immutability the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
Doctors, upon <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 18. have
this Obſervation [He ſaith not, I will
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53656:92"/>
give, but, <hi>I have given;</hi> and yet <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
had now begotten no Children,
becauſe the Word of the holy bleſſed
God is a Deed; therefore he ſo ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>Ainſworth.</hi> Thus the Son of
God was tendered to fallen Man, as
the Lamb ſlain; he was in this Promiſe
as manifeſtly held out to <hi>Adam,</hi> as
crucified, as making an Atonement for
Sinners, by the Oblation of his Blood,
as he was, after his actual Crucifixion
and Aſcention held out to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
(Chap. 3. 1.)</p>
               <p>2. The Son of God in the Virtue
of this his future Oblation of himſelf,
and Mediation by Merit, entred upon
the Exerciſe of his Mediatory Office,
by Interceſſion, immediately upon
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; he did not ſuffer the
mortal Wound to feſter, but applied
the healing Balm (flowing from his
bruiſed Heel) to it, while it was
green: as ſoon as ever he ſaw <hi>Adam</hi>
naked and in his Blood, he poured
clean Water upon him, caſt his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over him, and entred into a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with him, and ſaid unto him,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53656:93"/>
                  <hi>Live.</hi> No ſooner had Man made a
League with the Serpent and proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
War againſt God; but God was
in Chriſt reconciling the World to
himſelf. <hi>In the Cool of the day</hi> (that is, in
the Evening of that Day whereon he
fell) <hi>Adam heard the Voice of the Lord
God</hi> (that is, the Word or Son of
God, as both Chriſtians and Jews
expound that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 8. See
Dr. <hi>Owen's Exercit.</hi> 10. 2.) calling him
to Repentance by Arraignment; to
Faith, by the Promiſe of the Woman's
Seed; yea, to Glory, by preſenting
himſelf in the Form of an human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and that glorious Body, ſuch as he
ſhewed himſelf in at the Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and hath now at the Right-hand
of the Father. Dr. <hi>More Append.</hi> to

Lord pleaded with <hi>Adam</hi> by his Son
in the Form of God manifeſt in the
Fleſh.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but the Son of God in
human ſhape was all this ſeventh Day
buſied in moſt holy Colloquies with
<hi>Adam;</hi> but that he fully revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to him and <hi>Eve,</hi> ſhewed him how
and in what order he created all things,
wiſh'd him to meditate upon theſe
Works, and in them to praiſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
the true God, his Creator;
and taught him that after his Example
every ſeventh Day all Labour ſet
aſide, he ſhould ſpend in the Exerciſe
of Piety: <hi>Zanchy de Creatione Hom.</hi> l. 1.

the Voice of the Lord God walking in the

[By this Voice I underſtand

3. This his mediating to reconcile
Man to God, argues he had upon the
inſtant of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, ſo far recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
God to Man (by becoming his
Surety, by giving Bond to make Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
pay Man's Ranſome at the day
appointed, at the <hi>fulneſs of Time</hi>) as
the Father (upon Conſideration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
would not take the Forefeiture,
but delegated the Son to treat with
his Rebels, and offer them Pardon
(and a better State than that they
were fallen from) on the Condition
of their accepting the Covenant of
Grace.</p>
               <p>For Chriſt did not take this Honour
(of the Melchiſedochian Prieſt-hood)
upon himſelf, but was <hi>called of God an
High-Prieſt after this order.</hi> Heb. 5. 10.)
and made a Prieſt by Oath, by him
that ſaid unto him, <hi>The Lord ſware,
and will not repent, thou art a Prieſt for
ever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 21. He was ſworn
to this Office of Mediation, and ſent
to manage it by bleſſing <hi>Adam,</hi> in
turning him from his Iniquity, before
the beginning of Days (natural)
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53656:94"/>
on the ſixth Creating-Day, and will
continue the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of it to the end
of Days (natural) otherwiſe he would
not be a Prieſt without <hi>beginning and
end of Days.</hi> Heb. 7. 3.</p>
               <p>4. That <hi>Adam</hi> did not defer his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
but forthwith complied with
the gracious Terms that were tendred
him, cannot be doubted, if we ſeriouſly
conſider how utterly incredible it is,
that he who was ſo aſhamed of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Nakedneſs, ſhould refuſe
to beg (at any rate) Raiment of
Chriſt to cover his Nakedneſs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
That he who was ſo confounded in
himſelf, as he ran to hide himſelf in the
Buſhes from the Preſence of God,
ſhould ſtand conſulting whether he
ſhould accept or refuſe Mercy offered.
That he whoſe own Conſcience, and
God greater than his Conſcience, had
condemned, ſo as he ſaw his Soul
drawing nigh unto the Grave, and his
Life to the Murderers; ſhould, when
God, not by a Servant, but his Son,
ſent this Meſſage to him [<hi>I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Atonement, I have accepted
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53656:95"/>
the Ranſom</hi>] Job. 33. reject the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of that Atonement, the Fruit
of that Ranſom. That he who had
known what it was to have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, ſhould under the
deepeſt and moſt deplorable ſenſe of
its loſs, not be ready to imbrace the
means of recovering that Communion.
Eſpecially if we duly ponderate to
what end thoſe Beaſts were ſlain, of
whoſe Skins God made them Coats of
Honour, ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> could
not ſlay them for Food; for the Fleſh
of Animals was not allowed Mankind
for Meat till after the Flood.</p>
               <p>That their Fleſh was offered in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
is the common Tenet of moſt
judicious Divines; and that partly it
was diſpoſed of that way, ſeems very
probable; but the Scripture does
more than hint two other ends of ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Beaſts, (which I wonder
have not been taken notice of).
The firſt for the ſtriking of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
betwixt God the Father and the
Son, when that Oath which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scripture ſo frequently mentions,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53656:95"/>
paſt betwixt them; <hi>Pſalm 110. 4.
[The Lord ſware, and will not repent.</hi>]
This Oath paſt at Chriſt's Initiation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Mediatorſhip; [<hi>Foraſmuch as that
was not without an Oath,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.
20. By this Oath Chriſt became, or
was made the Surety of that better
Covenant, and more antient than that
of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Covenants by Oath, for the
greater ſolemnity thereof, were made
thus: Beaſts being cut in twain, and the
parts laid a ſunder one againſt another,
as Shoulder againſt Shoulder, and Leg
againſt Leg, with a ſpace to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween.
The Parties covenanting paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
betwixt the Pieces, made Oath,
<hi>Gen. 15. 18. Jer.</hi> 24. 18. [The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
which they made, when they
cut the Bullock in twain, and paſſed
between the parts of it] ſaying, <hi>Let
me be ſtruck, as this Beaſt is ſtruck,
if I break this Covenant:</hi> whence came
the Phraſe of <hi>ferire foedus,</hi> to ſtrike or
ſmite Covenant. Now this Oath was
given and taken betwixt God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and the Son, before Chriſt called
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53656:96"/>
to <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaying [<hi>Where art thou?</hi>] for
otherwiſe he would have entred upon
his Mediatory Office without an Oath;
And it is very probable that the Voice
of God walking in the Garden, which
<hi>Adam</hi> heard before that Call, was
the Voice of the Son of God paſſing
through the Parts of the divided
Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The Second end of ſlaying Beaſts,
was for the ſtriking of the Covenant
betwixt God and <hi>Adam,</hi> a thing uſual
in the Ratification of all other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
betwixt God and Man; as that
with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 18. That with
the Jews, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 5. [half of the
Blood (<hi>of the Sacrifices</hi>) was ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon the Altar] which repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
God [and the other half upon the
People]; or the twelve Pillars, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
the twelve Tribes, after they
had conſented to the Covenant at the
reading of the Book, ſaying, [<hi>Behold
the Blood of the Covenant which the Lord
hath ſtricken with you concerning all theſe
Words.</hi>] See <hi>Ainſworth</hi> on <hi>Pſal. 50. 5.
[My Saints that have ſtricken a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53656:96"/>
with me by Sacrifice:</hi>] But the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's
Argument, <hi>Heb. 9. 16. [Where
a Teſtament is, there muſt of neceſſity be
the Death of the Teſtator: For a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of no force at all while the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
liveth</hi>] from whence he inferreth
that [therefore the firſt Teſtament
was not without Blood] will with
equal Firmneſs ſupport this Inference.</p>
               <p>That the firſt Covenant of Grace
with <hi>Adam,</hi> was ratified by Blood:
And that the Teſtator muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be dead in Type and Effigy as well
at the ſealing of that as this.</p>
               <p>And now in the third place, comes
in that other uſe of the Fleſh of theſe
ſlain Beaſts, to wit, <hi>Adam</hi>'s offering
them in Sacrifice, as a Burnt-Offering
for the Lord. Thus at that mutual Stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
betwixt God and <hi>Iſrael, (Ex. 24.
5.) They offered Burnt-Offerings and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
of Peace unto the Lord.</hi> And at
God's covenanting with <hi>Noah</hi> he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Burnt-Offerings, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 8. 20.) in all
likelihood of the Beaſts that had been
firſt cut in twain: For this was a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
by Oath, <hi>Iſa. 54. 9. [I have
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53656:97"/>
ſworn that the Waters of Noah ſhall
no more go over the Earth]:</hi> and
therefore ſtruck, not only by God's
ſtretching out his Right-hand and
ſwearing (as the Hebrew Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
but by paſſing between the
pieces of the Bullock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that being
the moſt ancient Patriarchal Mode of
ratifying a Covenant by Oath; and
taken up from this Primitive Example
of God's Covenanting with <hi>Adam.</hi>
Here we have an account of the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of the Fleſh of thoſe Beaſts, with
whoſe Skins God apparell'd <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> fully conſonant to the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and ſuch as ſpeaks <hi>Adam</hi> to
have conſented to the Covenant upon
its firſt propoſal, and the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(Man reſtored by Faith in Chriſt)
to have been brought forth into actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Exiſtence before that Seventh Day,
whereon God reſted.</p>
               <p>5. And now, and not till now, the
Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed;
and all the Hoaſt of them, when
this Captain of the Lord's Hoaſt, had
his Commiſſion ſealed, had muſtered
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53656:97"/>
his Army, and adminiſtred <hi>Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
Militare,</hi> the Military Oath to his
holy Elect, and faithful Ones; his
Army on Earth was but a ſmall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
(conſiſting but of two) but it was
terrible with Banners (the Banner of
Love over it, the Banner of defiance
againſt the Enemy) who took this
Captain of their Salvation for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and beheld in theſe two ſuch a
Troop coming (tho but of Sheep,
yet led on by the Lion of the Tribe
of <hi>Judah</hi>) as at its firſt looking out
in this Morning of the day of Grace,
the ramping and roaring Lion was
Thunder-ſtrook, proſtrate, laid flat
upon the Ground, and made to creep
upon his Belly; had none to ſide with
him ever ſince ſave his own profliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Angels, (that had forſaken their
firſt Station) and a cripled crew of
Kaitiffs that were bowed together by
Satan, and could not ſtand upright;
a Company of Monſters in human
ſhape with two-legg'd Bodies, and
four-footed Souls; and had nothing
left for Forrage to himſelf and's Army,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53656:98"/>
nothing to feed on, but Duſt (the
carnal, ſenſual, deviliſh part of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind).
Now, and not till now, every
Tree brought forth Fruit in its kind;
when the true Vine began to flouriſh,
when the Tree of Life had thus put
forth its Leaves and Fruit for the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Mankind: Till God thus ſhined
in Man's Heart to give the Light of
the Knowledg of the Glory of God
in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, he had not
commanded the Light to ſhine out of
Darkneſs, out of that more diſmal
Darkneſs then ſate upon the Face of
the unformed Earth, even that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin had invelop'd the
whole Creation, and made it a more
confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> than that rude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted
Lump, out of which it had
been reduced. For hereby <hi>Adam</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd
the Image of God; ſo far loſt the
the Dominion of the Creature, as he
retained not ſo much thereof as the
Rule over himſelf. Nay, the whole
Fabrick of the World was looſned and
ready to fall (this Keiſtone of the
Arch being crumbled into Duſt) If
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53656:98"/>
Chriſt had not ſuſtained the Weight
of that ruinous Building upon his own
Shoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while it was a repairing, by
God's making <hi>Adam</hi> anew, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him upon a new Foundation, even

whereof <hi>the Morning Stars ſang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

Joy.</hi> Job 38. 6, 7. [Waſt thou by when

Earth was thus finiſhed, by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the new Creature, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction
of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> God
had not made ſufficient Preparation
for his reſting in his Works, as very
good and altogether adequate to the
bringing about of his own glorious
and gracious ends: But now this
<hi>Workmanſhip of God created in Chriſt
for good Works: Eph.</hi> 2. 9. being made,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53656:99"/>
Chriſt's perſonal being exhibited in the
Promiſe, as adopted into Man's Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Chriſt myſtical being born of
the immortal Seed of that Word of
Promiſe, and by Faith adopted into
the Family of God; the Pleaſure of
the Lord thus proſpering in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator's
Hands, and Chriſt's ſeeing and
reaping the Fruit of the travel of his
Soul; what could the iſſue of this be
but Satisfaction, Acquieſcency, &amp; Reſt?
Man renewed and reſtored into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, through the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the Son of God, was in the
fore-Appointment of it, the mutual
Pleaſure of God the Father, and God
the Son, from all Eternity, (<hi>Prov. 8.
29, 30, 31.) [When he appointed the
Foundations of the Earth, then was I by
him—. I was daily his delight, rejoycing
always before him, in the habitable Parts of
the Earth, and my Delights were with the
Sons of Men.</hi>] The Son's delight was
among the Sons of Men in the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
parts of the Earth, before Man
was created, or the Foundations of the
Earth laid, ſave only in the Decree
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53656:100"/>
and Appointment of God. And this
rejoycing of the Son was the Father's
delight: And for this Pleaſures ſake,
Heaven and Earth, and the whole
Furniture of both were created. [<hi>Rev.
4. 11. Thou haſt created all things, and
for thy Pleaſure they are and were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</hi>]
The whole World (ſay the
Jewiſh Doctors) was created for the
<hi>Meſſias;</hi> and the <hi>Meſſias</hi> (ſay all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians)
was exhibited for the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mankind, from that ſtate of
Sin and Miſery, into which we fell
through the Tranſgreſſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to-plaſt.
This Redemption was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to <hi>Adam</hi> in the Promiſe of the
Woman's Seed, and accepted by <hi>Adam</hi>
through Faith in that Promiſe, and
that acceptance ratified by a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Salt, by a Sacrifice ſalted with
Fire, the Sacrifice of a whole Burnt-Offering;
<hi>which burning upon the Altar
all Night unto the Morning.</hi> (Lev. 6. 9.)
And figuring the Oblation of Chriſt's
Body, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s Oblation of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
as a living Sacrifice, holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to God through Chriſt, muſt
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53656:100"/>
needs come up with Acceptance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and ſend forth a ſweet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Reſt unto God at the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ſeventh Day. The <hi>Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts</hi>
ſay, that God created Fire on
the ſeventh day: I ſuppoſe they mean
that Fire that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sacrifice in token of
God's Approbation. So that God
having perfected his Work on the
ſeventh Day, even all the Work that
he had made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 2. Or, all the
Work that he created to make, <hi>verſ. 3.
Reſted on the Seventh Day, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hebrews</hi> diſtinguiſh betwixt
creating, forming, and making, thus;
To create, is the Production of any
thing out of nothing; to from, is the
beſtowing of Form and Shape upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing created; to make, is to perfect,
finiſh, and to adapt to its proper uſe,
that that is created and formed. They
are all three uſed to this ſenſe in one
Verſe, (<hi>Iſa. 43. 7.) I have created him
for my Glory, I have formed him; yea,
I have made him;</hi> that is, every way
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53656:101"/>
fitted him for the attaining that end
for which I created and formed him.
(<hi>P. Fagius in Targ. <hi>Onkelos</hi>
                  </hi>). Now
<hi>Adam,</hi> being created to bring forth
<hi>good Works in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> was not
God's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, his Workmanſhip fitted
for the Production of the end of his
Creation, while he was either in a ſtate
of Innocence or of the Lapſe; which
alone is ſufficient to prove that <hi>Adam</hi>
fell and was reſtored by Faith in the
promiſed Seed the day of his Creation:
for otherwiſe, God could not have
reſted; that is, have taken Delight
and Complacency in all the Work he
created to make as very (that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly)
good and compleated for the
effecting the end of Creation, to wit,
the glorifying of God by good Works
done in Chriſt. And therefore that
ſeventh Day's reſt on Sunday (where
God ſaw all very good, as good as
Heart could wiſh) was the Reſt of
Redemption: And the Jewiſh Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath,
the reſt of the Creation
uncompleated on the ſixth day, before
Man was capacitated by Faith in Chriſt,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53656:101"/>
to glorify God through his Redeemer.
Saturday and Sunday-Sabbath came
into the World, not like <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
but like <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zara.</hi> The
Jewiſh Saturday-Sabbath was not born
firſt, and afterwards the Chriſtian Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Sabbath,
catching the Jewiſh by
the Heel, ſupplanted it, and obtained
the Bleſſing of Primogeniture: But the
Chriſtian Sabbath, like <hi>Zara,</hi> firſt put
out its Hand, and upon Sunday's
Wriſt was tied the Thred, the Bond
of God's Injunction to ſanctify that
Day; and the Scarlet-Thred, the Bond
of the Covenant of Grace, ſealed in
the Blood of the promiſed Seed: for
by binding is ſignified the impoſing of
the Law of hallowing the Sunday-Sabbath;
whence God's Laws are called
Bonds and Cords [<hi>Let us break their
Bonds aſunder, and caſt their Cords from
us</hi>] that is, the Laws of God and of
his Chriſt (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2, 3.) And a Bond
or Cord of Scarlet Thred was to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
a ſign of the Covenant, confirmed
by the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2. 18.
compared with <hi>Heb. 11. 31. [By Faith
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53656:102"/>
the Harlot</hi> Rahab <hi>periſhed not.</hi>] And
the Patriarchal Church unto the Flood
(and all ſince the Flood, who adhered
to that Church) in their Sunday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
<hi>Celebrities</hi> had an Eye of Faith
upon that Scarlet-Thred bound to the
Wriſt of that Day. But when the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous
Subtilty of ſuch Politicians, as
deſigned to make themſelves abſolute
Soveraigns over the Nations inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
from God, had perverted that
cuſtom of worſhipping God in publick
Aſſemblies on Sundays, by inacting
the Worſhip of the Sun on that day
that bare the name of that Planet,
(making that Hand which God had
ſet at the end of the Volumn of his
Book, as the Index pointing to the
chief Contents of that Volumn, the
eternal Word making Propitiation
through his Blood) to point the
contrary way, to the Worſhip of the
Creature: Then the Scarlet-Thred
was drawn back out of the Jews ſight,
till the fullneſs of time; and now
comes forth the Jewiſh Saturday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
more than 2400 Years after the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53656:102"/>
Patriarchal Sunday-Sabbath; which
Saturday-Sabbath was not impoſed
upon any Nation but the Jews; nor
upon them in room of the Patriarcal,
but upon other accounts, as will be
ſhewed in the handling of the ſixt and

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:53656:103"/>
in Sacred Scripture, in theſe, or equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Terms, [<hi>It is a ſign between me
and you throughout your Generations, that
you may know that I am the Lord that
ſanctifieth you.</hi>] As all that is requiſite
for the proof hereof, is to ſhew that in
thoſe places by God's ſanctifying of
them is meant, his viſible ſeparating
them, from all other People for his
own Inheritance by a Covenant of
Peculiarity. For evincing of which,
let it be conſidered, that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.
God's giving them Statutes and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(that is, Moral and Judicial
Laws) is not ſaid to be to this end,
that they might know that he was the
Lord that ſanctified them; as his
<hi>giving them his Sabbaths to be a ſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and them,</hi> was, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11, 12.
and <hi>verſ. 19, 20. [I am the Lord your
God; hallow my Sabbaths, and they ſhall
be a Sign between me and you, that ye
may know that I am the Lord your God]:</hi>
That is, [That I have taken you to
be unto me <hi>a People and an Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
as ye are at this day.</hi>] Deut. 4.
20. <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 24. And yet more plain,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:53656:103"/>
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. it is affirmed of all the
Sabbaths Indefinitely, that the keeping
of them is a ſign between God and
the Jews, <hi>That he is the Lord their
God,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>verſ. 16. The Children
of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall keep my Sabbaths through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Generations, by an everlaſting
Ordinance. It is a Sign betwixt me and
the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The reaſon why God would not
have the Jews to celebrate the Sunday
which the Patriarchs and themſelves,
till the Inſtitution of the Saturday-Sabbath
celebrated as the week<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Sabbath, but appointed them ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day, was to ſecure them from
idolizing the Sun with the Heathens,
who had perverted Sunday-Sabbath
from the Worſhip of God to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Sun; from the Guilt of
which Idolatry in celebrating the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Sabbath, <hi>Job</hi> purgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<hi>Job 31. 26, 27, 28. [If I beheld
the Sun when it ſhined, and my Heart
hath been ſecretly enticed, or my Mouth
hath kiſſed my Hand; this alſo were an
Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judg: For
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53656:104"/>
I ſhould have denied the God that is
above.</hi>] That is, if I had worſhip'd the
the Sun ſecretly in my Heart, it would
have been a denying of God: But if
I had worſhip'd it openly, by kiſſing
my Hand at the ſight of it, I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
obnoxious to the ſentence of the
Judg; where note, that in <hi>Job</hi>'s time
(who lived ſome Generations before
<hi>Abram</hi>) the World grew propenſe to
this idolizing of the Sun; but hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Noachal Religion was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
as the publick Law of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
oppoſed its Incroachment, (<hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in locum) Vnde videatur Jobi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneos
tum non fuiſſe idolatras, quia
dicit ſe non clam id feciſſe nedum palam,

                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>

                     </expan> plurium ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſerint.
Job</hi>'s Contemporaries and
Country-men were not Idolaters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaith, he did not worſhip the
Sun either ſecretly or openly: ſuch
Temerity as this doth not forthwith
appear in publick, but after that the
Heart is altogether blinded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:53656:104"/>
Conſent and Favour come to
take its part. However in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
time this idolizing of the Sun had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally
prevail'd; and even in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
time was back't by the ſecular
Law in <hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees,</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
whereof in his refuſing to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Caldean Emblem of the Sun,
<hi>Abraham,</hi> with his Father <hi>Terah,</hi> found
<hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Caldees</hi> too hot for them.
By the way obſerve that the word
which in this place of <hi>Job</hi> is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Sun,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] is that from whence
<hi>Vr</hi> of the <hi>Caldees</hi> deriv'd its Name;
and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> the Name they give
<hi>the Sun,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (<hi>Macrob. Saturnal.</hi> 1. 21.)
Hence <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo frequently reneweth
this Caution, that the Jews ſhould take
heed of making any Repreſentations
of the Sun, or any of the Hoſt of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
(<hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 19.) and (<hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 3.)
in ſpecial to the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> that
they ſhould not inquire after the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
way of Worſhip, [ſaying, <hi>How
did thoſe Nations ſerve their Gods? even
ſo will I do:</hi>] that is, after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
will I ſerve God. And in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53656:105"/>
not after their <hi>burning of their
Sons and Daughters in the Fire to their
Gods:</hi> Deut. 12. 30, 31. Now the God
to whom the Gentiles ſacrificed their
Children was the <hi>Sun,</hi> whoſe Idol was
called <hi>Moloch</hi> and <hi>Milchom; Amos 5. 26.
1 Kings</hi> 11. 5, 7. as being <hi>Molech,</hi> or King
of all the Planets; and therefore by the
70 tranſlated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Prince; and
by the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (Door-Neighbours
to the Jews) called <hi>Beel-Samen,</hi> the Lord
of Heaven (as <hi>Sanchoniatho</hi> witneſſeth
in <hi>Euſeb. Evang. Prep.</hi> l. 1.) And yet
notwithſtanding all theſe Prohibitions,
and God's diſcharging them from the
publick Worſhip of himſelf on that
day whereon the Heathens in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy
from the firſt Inſtitution wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped
the <hi>Sun;</hi> the Jews imitated
the Heathens in this moſt barbarous
Cuſtom of <hi>burning their Sons and
Daughters in the Fire,</hi> the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the <hi>Sun: Jer.</hi> 7. 31. &amp; 19. 5.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 37, 38. So exceeding prone
was that People to imbrace ſtrange
Gods: And therefore they ſtood ſo
much more in need to have all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53656:105"/>
thereto removed from them; and
eſpecially ſuch as God had inſtituted
at firſt for the ſecuring his own, but
were in proceſs of Time perverted to
the Introduction and countenancing of
the Worſhip of falſe Gods, as was the
fate of the Patriarchal Sunday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.
Upon the like account the Jews
were prohibited very many other
Cuſtoms, if not of divine Inſtitution,
yet of Patriarchal Practice; yea, ſome
of them ſeeming to be the natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults
of the Law of Humanity: ſuch
was mourning at the Funerals of dear
and near Relations, wherein the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
exceeded even to the Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of other Nations; <hi>Gen. 50. 10, 11.
[And they wailed there with a very great
and heavy Wailing; and he (Joſeph</hi>
with his Brethren) <hi>made a mourning
for his Father ſeven days: And the</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites
<hi>ſaw the Mourning, and they ſaid,
This is an heavy Mourning to the</hi> Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians;
<hi>therefore the name of that Place
was called, The Mourning of the</hi> Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.]
Yet this ſo natural a Duty was
prohibited the High-Prieſt, for he muſt
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:53656:106"/>
not mourn <hi>for his Father or Mother;
(Levit.</hi> 21. 11.) and that becauſe he
had the holy Anointing, and the holy
Garments upon him, which were holy
only in Type. So that here the Law
of Nature muſt yield to the Levitical
in this particular Caſe, where the
High-Prieſt's honouring of Father and
Mother could do the Dead no good,
but might be an occaſion of Evil to
the Living; (by the way, this makes
the Caſe of the High-Prieſts wholly
different from the Phariſees pleading
<hi>Carban).</hi> But where lay the Danger?
Anſwer, in drawing the Jews to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the idolatrous Heathens in
their manner of mourning. <hi>Baruch 6.
31, 32. [And the Prieſts ſit in their
Temples, having their Cloaths rent, and
their Heads and Beards ſhaven, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
upon their Heads: They roar and
cry before their Gods, as Men do at
the Feaſt when one is dead.</hi>] Hence all
Communion with the Nations is ſo
pathetically forbidden the Jews, leſt
they ſhould by that means be drawn
to Idolatry. So much leſs reaſon have
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53656:106"/>
we to wonder that God ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
the Jews another Day for their
weekly Sabbath, than that which was
inſtituted at firſt to all Mankind,
when the Gentiles had perverted the
Celebration of that Day to the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
the Worſhip of the Sun. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the like reaſon at the Reſtitution
of Sunday-Sabbath (upon the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Ceremonial Saturday-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath)
the Chriſtian Church changed
the name of Sunday into that of the
Lord's-Day, that ſhe might ſecure her
Children from the Opinion of the
Heathen World, that it was in honour
of the Planet of the Sun, that that day
of the Week which bore its name was
ſeparated for holy Aſſembles.</p>
               <p>3. And now we need not go far to
ſeek for a Reaſon why God appointed
Saturday to be the Jewiſh Sabbath;
for that being the week-day immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
preceding Sunday, and the whole
Oeconomy of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, as of a thing
imperfect, pointing <hi>to good things to
come: (Heb.</hi> 10. 1.) It was neceſſary that
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53656:107"/>
their typical Day of Reſt ſhould be ſo
placed in the order of the <hi>Septiman,</hi>
as from thence they might look imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
unto that Day of true Reſt that
was to come at the riſing of the Sun
of Righteouſneſs out of the Grave.
But beſides this, the more ſpecial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of God's appointing them Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
for their Sabbath, was, becauſe
Saturday was the firſt day of Reſt
they had from Egyptian Bondage;
for they marched from <hi>Rameſes</hi> on
Friday, the <hi>15th</hi> day of the <hi>1ſt</hi> Month,
and ſet up their Booths at <hi>Succoth</hi> on
Saturday, where they ſtayed two days,
according to the common Opinion of
Learned Men, on the latter whereof
Sunday, the Premiſes conſidered, it
may be preſumed that they kept an
holy Reſt unto the Lord according to
the Patriarchal Cuſtom; and that it
was in that Aſſembly that <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
the Ordinances of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and ſeparated the firſt-born of
<hi>Males and Firſtlings of the Flocks and
Herds to be holy to the Lord.</hi>

               <p>And that this Precept for Saturday-Sabbath
did not vacate the Patriarchal,
either to all Nations, or to the Jews
themſelves for ever; but was only
impoſed upon them as a <hi>Carnal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of divine Service until the time of

thoſe good things, the Body whereof is
Chriſt, whereof it was a Shadow; God
gave the Jews many plain Intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>1. In his aſſigning their Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their reſting
from their hard Labour in that Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,
as the peculiar Reaſon of his
commanding the Jews to celebrate his
Sabbaths; <hi>Deut. 5. 15. That thy Man-Servant,</hi>
&amp;c. may reſt as well as thou;
<hi>and remember that thou waſt a Servant
in the Land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and that the
Lord thy God brought thee out thence
through a mighty Hand, and by a ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-out
Arm: Therefore the Lord thy
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53656:108"/>
God commanded thee to keep the Sabbath-day;</hi>
whether weekly, monthly, or
yearly, as alſo the Sabbaths of Years
and Jubilees; which Reaſon cannot
reach other Nations, but is wholly
accommodated to the Jews, and to
them only till the time of Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>2. In his ſuſpending the Raigning
of Mannah on their Sabbaths, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it fall on Sunday's Manna, being
reputed by thoſe that could not look
under the Vail, Angels Food, the Bread
of Heaven (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. 40.) its not
falling on their Sabbath was interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the giving of true <hi>Manna</hi>
(that of which <hi>whoſoever eateth ſhall
live for ever</hi>) was reſerved for Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
and the Reſtauration of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal
Sabbath; when he whom
the Father ſealed, would give his Fleſh
for the Life of the World, <hi>that true
Bread of Life</hi> (Joh. 6.) that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Food which was the deſire of all
that hungred after Righteouſneſs; of
the Diſtribution whereof in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of the Goſpel, when they heard
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53656:108"/>
Chriſt diſcourſe, they cried out [<hi>Lord,
evermore give us of this Bread:</hi>] Not ſo
much as the Type of that Bread, which
can give Satisfaction and Reſt to the
Soul, was communicated on their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
and that was a plain enough
Indication that their Sabbath was not
the true Reſt.</p>
               <p>3. In the very form of its firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 23. the Impoſition
of the Name bewrays the nature of the
thing [is the Reſt of the Sabbath,
<hi>Sabbathon,</hi> Sabbath, the Sabbatiſm, the
Sabbath holy to the Lord] ſo <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>
reads it. But he is exceeding
wide of the ſenſe of the Hebrew Word
[<hi>Sabbathon</hi>] in tranſlating it [<hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batiſm,</hi>]
except he takes Sabbatiſm for
a Diminitive; for <hi>Schindler in his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teglot,</hi>
and <hi>P. Fagius</hi> on the Chaldee
Paraphraſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 15. affirm that
<hi>Sabbathon</hi> hath the form of a Dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
which, ſaith he, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> form
by adding [<hi>on</hi>] to the end of the
Primitive, as <hi>Iſch,</hi> viz. <hi>Iſhcon viruncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
ſo of Sabbath comes <hi>Sabbathon,
Sabbatulum:</hi> And <hi>Fagius</hi> obſerves,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53656:109"/>
that the Hebrew Doctors do thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
theſe two words, that Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
ſignifies the whole day from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to end; <hi>Sabbathon,</hi> that part of
the Eve before the juſt beginning of
the Sabbath, which was taken from
the prophane, and added to the ſacred
Time, by ſuch as choſe rather to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
than to come ſhort. The Name
therefore given <hi>Saturday-Sabbath</hi> at
firſt was the [<hi>Puny Sabbath] [the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my-Reſt</hi>]
or the [<hi>Eve-reſt of the true
Sabbath.</hi>] A Diminitive Reſt for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
under Age, preparative to that
holy Reſt ſuitable to Men which was
to ſucceed.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking of another day
of Reſt than that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had
inſtituted the Celebration of, and of
another Reſt than that which <hi>Joſhua</hi>
brought them into the Poſſeſſion of,
made ſo clear a Comment upon the
Precept of the Sabbath, as well as of
their Reſt in <hi>Canaan,</hi> as from thence
the Jews might have collected, that
both were but ſhadows of a better
Reſt, and better Day of Reſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53656:109"/>
by the ſame way of Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination
that the Apoſtle uſeth in the
<hi>3d</hi> and <hi>4th</hi> Chapters to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
Touching the Reſt of <hi>Canaan,</hi> it is not
material to my Buſineſs, and therefore
I ſhall not ſpeak of that but occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
But what the Author of that
Epiſtle argueth, from <hi>David</hi>'s ſpeaking
of another day, ſo long a time after
the giving of the Precept touching
Saturday-Sabbath, is of ſuch moment
towards the right Perception of the
Strenuouſneſs of his Arguments for
both, and of ſo great Concernment
towards the Illuſtration of that Point I
am now handling, as I ſhall for the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe on that
Subject, commit to the Cenſure of the
pious and learned theſe Annotations.</p>
               <p>1. The Reſt of <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as reflected on by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
are that Yoke of Heifers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Apoſtle plows to find out the
Riddle of the Lord's-day-Sabbath, and
the not making them to draw equally,
is the main reaſon why Commentators
make no better Work of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:53656:110"/>
Arguments touching another Day;
and why they make a balk or a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
of the Chriſtian Sabbath; though
all the Texts alledged, not only in their
own moſt natural Tendency, but in
the Apoſtle's expreſs Application of
them, look directly thitherward. I
will begin with that which <hi>Beza</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
to be a moſt obſcure place;
<hi>Heb. 4. 3. [For we which have believed
do enter</hi>

It is the Miſ-tranſlation of this laſt
Clauſe makes this Text unintelligible;
but if Men did not ſhut their Eyes, for
fear of ſeeing the Light of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an-Sabbath
dart in upon them from
hence; or caſt the Vail of their own
Pre-occupations upon the face of it,
there would be no Obſcurity at all in
it; for, take it as the Apoſtle gave it (if
it were writ by him in Greek) and it
is as light as Day; <gap reason="foreign">

Reſt of God there meant, is God's
reſting in the Contemplation of the
Perfections of his Works on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth

<hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of cannot be the Jewiſh
Saturday-Sabbath, for the Jews were
very zealous in keeping that carnal
Commandment (inſomuch as he that
did but gather a few Sticks was ſtoned
to death); and in recompence thereof
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53656:111"/>

the Sabbatiſm remains, or is left,
or falls to the ſhare of the People of
God] (<hi>i.e.</hi>) to the Chriſtian Church;
according to that (<hi>Rom. 9. 25.) I will
call them my People that were not my

hard to be underſtood, but that the
Signification thereof might eaſily be
found out, if Men could digeſt it as
<hi>Platoniſm, Latiniſm, Graeciſm,</hi> ſignifies
the pure, natural, and genuine Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Plato,</hi> of the Latine or Greek
Tongue; ſo Sabbatiſm is nothing elſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:53656:112"/>
but the genuine Imitation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
and (according to the Tenor
of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe) of that
complacential Reſt which God took
on the ſeventh Day. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Chriſtian, or Lord's-day-Sabbath,
is the moſt natural and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Copy of God's Reſt: But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my Intention to make a juſt
Comment; I intended theſe ſhort Notes
as Inſtances only to ſhew how Men's
diſguſting the Notion of a Chriſtian-Sabbath,
makes them caſt up from their
nauceating Stomacks, the Apoſtle's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
undigeſted.</p>
               <p>2. The next Bugbear that frights
Men out of the plain way of Truth,
is a Conceit, that when they hear the
ſound of a ſeventh-day Sabbath, they
think they hear the Man-drakes Voice
of the Jewiſh Sabbath: I need not
here give Inſtances of this, for they
occur every-where in all Men's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
concerning the Sabbath: And it is
too too common an Opinion, that the
Jewiſh Sabbath is the ſeventh Day in the
order of the Creation, and our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53656:112"/>
Sabbath the Firſt [<hi>de Die autem
primo Mundi conſtat inter omnes illum
fuiſſe Diem Dominicum,] Gregor. de
Valentia, Tom. 1. Diſp. 5. Queſt. 3. Pun.
1. Quando quidem Dies ſeptimus ab eo
fuit Dies Sabbati:</hi> Concerning the Firſt
Day of the World it is agreed amongſt
all Men, that it was the Lord's-day,
ſeeing the Seventh from that was the
day of the Sabbath: yea, his Conceit
is, that it was called <hi>Sunday</hi> from the
beginning, becauſe the Light created
on the firſt Day was the Light of the
Sun, not yet endowed with its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Motion, North and South, which
it received the fourth Day, but only
with that of the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> from
Eaſt and Weſt. But I have ſufficiently
proved the contrary, to wit, that the
Jewiſh Sabbath was not the ſeventh,
but ſixth Day in order of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but only of gathering <hi>Quails</hi> and
<hi>Mannah.</hi> And that our Lord's-day, tho
according to the Jewiſh Idiom it be
called the Firſt Day (the firſt Day of
their Week after that God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
them to obſerve another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53656:113"/>
of their Work as well as Year
then was in uſe before) yet it is in
reality the Seventh Day of the Week,
commencing that Account from the
Creation, and the ſame Day of the
Week whereon God reſted.</p>
               <p>3. The laſt thing I ſhall name here,
is as a <hi>remora</hi> to Mens arrival at the
true meaning of the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe
is a Tincture with that Spirit which
<hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>Aerij Daemones</hi> were of; or
with that wherein they in the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi>
Church were immerſt, who
would be of Chriſt in oppoſition to
<hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollos.</hi> Theſe Men's high-flown
Minds will not ſtoop to the
Contemplation of any Sabbath-Day,
to be celebrated under the Goſpel, in
the viſible Communion of Saints; but
hang hovering in the Clouds about a
Day of Reſt, purely ſpiritual; nor of
any Reſt but everlaſting; and in this
humour ſo ſpiritualize the Apoſtle's
Arguments, as they leave nothing in
them, after their Chymical Operations,
but thin etherial <hi>Vehicles,</hi> or flitting
<hi>Elizian</hi> Shades. But can a certain
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53656:113"/>
Day limited to the ſeventh, be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuum
vagum?</hi> or a limited Day be
the eternal Sabbath? What ever mean
Thoughts ſuch Men may have of the
Chriſtian, or Lord's-Day-Sabbath; the
divinely inſpired Pen-man had ſuch an
high Eſteem of it, as he thought it a
Subject worthy to be treated on, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a very ſovereign means to prevent
Apoſtacy, and to hold Chriſtians to
their Profeſſion: For that's the mark
he aimed at, and concludes his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the Sabbath with the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that as his aim, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 14.) as
he had begun that Diſcourſe with an
Exhortation of the ſame Tendency,
<hi>viz. To hold faſt their Profeſſion:</hi> Yea,
it is the main Scope of the whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
to diſſwade the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Chriſtians
from forſaking Church-Aſſemblies, as
ſome had done, and drawn back to the
Perdition of their Souls; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
them to a firm adhering to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-Fellowſhip
in the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sabbath-Ordinances. On which
Days alſo he ſtrictly chargeth the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
to be inſtant in preaching; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53656:114"/>
that a <hi>Preaching in Seaſon;</hi> and
with the ſame Breath, ſtiling Preaching
in the Synagogues of the Jews on their
Saturday-Sabbath, <hi>Preaching out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
(2 Tim.</hi> 4. 2.) That I do not by
this Expoſition of them pervert the
Apoſtle's Words, will be manifeſt, if,</p>
               <p>1. We conſider, that the Precept for
Preaching preſuppoſeth an Audience
of Men. I think none will imagine
that <hi>Timothy</hi> was bound by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
to preach to Stones, as they
ſay Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> did once, nor to
Sheep, Hogs and Birds, as that goodly
Saint (of the Pope's making) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
is fabled to have done frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>2. That a publick Audience could
not be had, but upon ſtated Days of
meeting, either upon a civil account,
as in Markets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or upon a religious
account, as in the Jewiſh Synagogues
every of their Sabbath-Days, and in
Chriſtian Churches on the Lord's-Day
(the firſt Day of the Week in the
Jewiſh Reckoning.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:53656:114"/>
3. That the Apoſtles took all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of ſuch publick Aſſemblies to
preach the Goſpel, beſides their teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from Houſe to Houſe.</p>
               <p>4. That their Attendance upon the
Adminiſtration of Goſpel-Ordinances
to the Church, would not permit
them on the Lord's-Days to preach
to Forreign Aſſembles either of Jews
or Gentiles, and therefore preaching
to them was out of ſeaſon, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
on Week-Days; Days that
were not then, appointed of God to
be Seaſons for ſacred Solemnities; for
even the Jewiſh Sabbath, though it
had been appointed to that Nation,
for a time, to be their weekly Sabbath;
yet not it's grown out of Seaſon, and
the Patriarchal Sunday-Sabbath came
into ſeaſon, whence Preaching on that
day is ſtiled <hi>Preaching in Seaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How much Light this Obſervation
caſts upon the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe, and
what Darkneſs the vulgar Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi>
(that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a ſpiritual
and eternal Reſt) hath drawn-over
the Hearts of Men, in their reading this
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53656:115"/>
part even of the New Teſtament, is
apparent from this one Inſtance, <hi>verſ.
10. [For he that is entred into his Reſt,
hath ceaſed from his own Works as God
did from his.</hi>] Learned Men are puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
how to give ſuch a Sence of this
Clauſe, as is coherent with the Context:
But underſtand the Apoſtle to ſpeak
here of the Chriſtian Lord's-Day-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
and the ſence is as clear as the
Sun at Noon-day, and that ſence ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
conſonant with what precedes
and follows, thus. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Church in ſanctifying the
Lord's-Day doth moſt properly imitate
God's ſeventh Day Reſt [<hi>For he that
is entred</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, into

to whom the Sabbatiſm appertains
(for <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) [<hi>he alſo hath ceaſed from his
own Works, as God did from his.</hi>] For
as God reſted on the ſeventh Day from
his proper Works as Creator, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proper Work of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(who made me and all the World)
though as to other kind of Works the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53656:115"/>
Father worketh hitherto. Even ſo
he that is entred into the Reſt of the
People of God (the Chriſtian-Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath)
doth therein moſt genuinely
imitate God, in that he alſo hath <hi>ceaſed
from his Works;</hi> that is, the Works of
the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Notion of [Works] in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Sence, whenſoever he makes Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
betwixt the Law and the Goſpel.
And the Works of the Law, being the
proper Works of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to
whom this Epiſtle was directed, as
differencing them from all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
He hath caſt off that Yoak of
Ceremonies, which neither we nor our
Fathers could bear, and hath taken
the eaſy Yoke of Chriſt upon him, that
he may find reſt to his Soul. And
what an apt Introduction is this to
what is immediately ſubjoyned,
<hi>verſ. 11. [Let us therefore ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into this ſame Reſt, leſt any Man fall
after the ſame Example of Vnbelief.</hi>]
Let me therefore perſwade you to
imitate God in his Seventh-Day's Reſt,
leſt you imitate your fore-Fathers in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53656:116"/>
Unbelief, and be excluded from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reſt: From which fearful State,
the beſt way to be ſecured, is to attend
upon Chriſtian Lord's-Day's Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Adminiſtrations, where you
ſhall hear <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Newneſs of
his Spirit, not in the Oldneſs of the
Letter; you will ſee that Vail that
<hi>Moſes</hi> put upon his Face done away,
if you will turn unto the Lord; and
will find the Word of God, as a ſharp
two-edged Sword, drawn out of the
Scabbard of Types and Ceremonies
(wherein it could not do any Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon the Soul) and ſo weilded,
[as it ſhall pierce <hi>even to the dividing
aſunder of the Soul and Spirit;</hi>] which
is the plain Importance of <hi>verſ. 12.
[For the Word of God is quick,</hi> &amp;c.]
that is, as it is diſpenc'd in Chriſtian-Aſſembles;
into which if an Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſhould come, while they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying
(1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24.) that is, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
Old-Teſtament Propheſies unto
Chriſt, and proving thence that Jeſus
is the Chriſt [<hi>he is judg'd, convinc'd
of all</hi>] convinc'd of the Sin of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53656:116"/>
(<hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 8.) convinc'd and judg'd
of all; that is, all that <hi>propheſy one by
one (1 Cor.</hi> 14. 31.) not only by the
propheſying of ſuch as like <hi>Apollos</hi> are
mighty in the Scriptures, (<hi>Act.</hi> 18. 28.)
but is ſo mightily convinc'd that Jeſus
is the Chriſt, even of the weakeſt of
them that have the Gift of Propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that is, of applying the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
for proof of the truth of the
Goſpel; he is, I ſay, by this powerful
Word ſo convinc'd, as the <hi>Secrets of his
Heart are made manifeſt, and ſo falling
down on his Face, he glorifieth God, and
confeſſeth that God is in you of a Truth.</hi>
(1 Cor. 14. 25.) By the Premiſes it
appears, that the Apoſtle's ſcope in his
Diſcourſe of the Sabbath, is to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
the Jews from the Celebration
of their Fruitleſs Sabbath, to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the Chriſtian-Sabbath:
As alſo how well God provided for
the Settlement of publick-ſtated Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
in the Church, when the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Sabbaths were antiquated, by letting
the Apoſtles ſee, that though the Law
for that was out of date, (<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 16.)
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:53656:117"/>
yet there remained a Sabbath to the
People of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That which was
inſtituted from the beginning, and
commanded in the Decalogue. Had
the Apoſtle indeed only decried that,
and not eſtabliſh'd this; it might have
been thought, that the Church had been
left to her choice, what Day of the
Week to have celebrated, as <hi>Calvin</hi>
and the <hi>Prolepſarians</hi> conceive: But
as if the holy Ghoſt had purpoſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to obviate that Errour, the
admitting whereof would unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bring Confuſion into the Chriſtian
World; he was pleaſed to direct the
ſame Apoſtle, whoſe Pen had cancel'd
the Jewiſh, to write in Vindication of
the Chriſtian-Sabbath; and to inform
him, that ſeeing the Partition-wall was
taken down, there was a plain and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
way made, for the Reſtauration of
the Patriarchal Sunday-Sabbath, that
Sabbath in the ſanctifying whereof the
greateſt part of thoſe Worthies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
(<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) had received Grace
to offer acceptable Sacrifices to God
by Faith in the promiſed Seed, to walk
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:53656:117"/>
with God, to be upright before him
in the moſt general Apoſtacies; to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his Call unreſervedly, though they
knew not whither. To exert ſuch He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick
Acts of Faith, Patience, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the World, Dependance on
God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as made them the Wonders
of that World which was unworthy of
them, and Paterns to the beſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
That Sabbath in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, the Chriſtian-Church
forſook the Jewiſh Synagogue, (then
became the Synagogue of Satan) and
betook themſelves to the Communion
of the General-Aſſembly and Church
of the Firſt-born, conſiſting of all
thoſe who from the Publication of the
Promiſe of Chriſt to <hi>Adam,</hi> had been
begotten again of the immortal Seed
of that ever-induring Word admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to the Patriarchs, and all that
adhere to the Patriarchal Religion in
all Nations and Ages; and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
without thoſe carnal Ordinances
and unprofitable bodily Exerciſes,
wherewith the Jews Sabbath was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred,
if not wholly taken up
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:53656:118"/>
therewith. For the Jews that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
the Ox and Aſs in keeping the
Moſaical Sabbath as ſuch, did not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
them in the Strength of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
thereof, which could not perfect
them that frequented them, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conſcience; but in the ſtrength
of the Ordinances of the Patriarchal
Sabbath; ſo that it was their doing
Sunday's Work on their Saturdays,
that ſanctified the Jews as to Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Their own Sabbath's Reſt from
Work ſanctifying them only by the
external viſible ſeparating of them
from other Nations; to the end that
our Saviour's Deſcent from <hi>Abraham</hi>
might be more conſpicuous. And
therefore as their fore-Fathers ſell
ſhort through their looking no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo thoſe then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Jews, to whom he writes, would
alſo fall ſhort of Eternal Reſt, if they
did not look forward beyond their
Sabbath-Day to Sunday, or the Lord's-Day-Sabbath;
in the Ordinances
whereof Saving Grace is ſo plentifully
diſpenc'd, as the Eunuch, ſhall have no
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53656:118"/>
cauſe to ſay, <hi>I am a dry Tree;</hi> nor the
Sun of the Stranger to complain, <hi>I
am utterly cut off from God's People.</hi>
If they take hold of God's Covenant,
and keep his Sabbaths now under the
Goſpel, tho they were excluded from
the Congregation of the Lord, under
the Moſaical Sabbath; (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4, &amp;c.)
but their Sacrifices ſhall be accepted
upon his Altar, and he will make them
joyful in his Houſe of Prayer. <hi>To
this God of all Grace, who deals thus
bountifully with us Gentiles; even to the
Father, Son, and Holy-Ghost, be given
all Praiſes, and Adoration, now and for
ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
