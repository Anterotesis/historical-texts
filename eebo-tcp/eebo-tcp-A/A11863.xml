            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Common weale to bee prepared
for the one and the other. which moued
wise Princes and Magistrates, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deuise Lawes how men might siue
peaceably, but also to prepare Armes,
both defen siue against forraine inuasion, and correctiue against dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical

vnto Armes: th'one command, th'other to execute: yet because they are
in nature diuers, or rather contrary, it prooueth a matter of much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.
For well we see, betweene equitie and force is no proportion.
Lawes are friends to peace and rest: but war is alwayes accompanied with
men of audatious, sudden, and seuerest spirit. The Philosophers and wise
Lawmakers therfore haue endeuoured more, to make such warres as might
assure peace, then to enioy such peace as might not be able to withstand
warre. <hi>Iustinianus</hi> desiring to vnite Lawes and Armes, authorised one
Officer to command both Martially and Ciuilly, whom be called <hi>Praetor;</hi>
and so the <hi>Romanes</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued that name for their General of warre. His
office was mixed both of authoritie Martial, and Ciuile. It seemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that as our bodies cannot without sinowes and blood be strong, so the
warre without ayde of Lawe and equitie may not endure: which moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
wise men of former ages to be perswaded, that Prudence and Power
ought neuer to be disioyned. Of which opinion the ancient Poet <hi>Horace</hi>
seemed to be, saying, <hi>Vis expers consilij mole ruit sua.</hi> The same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

<hi>Croesus</hi> they coupled <hi>Solon:</hi> with <hi>Simonides, Pausanias: Pericles</hi>

with <hi>Nestor: Diomedes</hi> with <hi>Vlisses:</hi> meaning to mixe
force with policie, and ciuile Lawes with power and Armes. The Kings of

requisite to say, that Militarie Iustice generally
is a Law made by consent of all Nations, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
whereof is to repulse force, and to redresse iniurie.
For who so in defence of his owne person doth resist
force with force, shallbe thought to haue so done iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And albeit bruit beastes do seeme in some sort to
offend, and defend without the aide of wit, and humane forecast, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all they do, is without discourse of reason or election, it cannot be said
that they vse force according to Iustice, but rather mooued by naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
consequently attempt without order, or warrantie of any lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
which indeed liueth onely among men. For admit that no Lawes
were, and all things left subiect to Fortune and chance, yet such is the force
of equitie and reason, and the root thereof so firmely fixed in the minds of
men, as though neuer so much defaced &amp; obscured in sauage and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
natures, may not yet vtterly be razed out of the mindes of any, be they
neuer so outrageous, but that at one time or other, either openly to the
world, or inwardly to themselues, will they, nill they, some vigorous and
liuely sparkes thereof will appeare. The like may be particularly said of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17413:4"/>
Militarie, whereof in the minds of Souldiers so deepe an impression is
made, as no force or time can raze it out. And touching the execution of
Iuridiction Militarie, we say the same was euer performed by Iudges and
Magistrates thereunto purposely appointed, and that men of Armes and
all other Souldiers were in al Militarie matters, directed, punished, &amp; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their proper Commanders, as in ancient time they were in <hi>Rome,</hi> and
since in <hi>France</hi> hath bene vsed. But first, to touch the original of Martial iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
it seemeth to haue bene taken from the <hi>Romanes,</hi> who for causes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
bestowed vpon men of warte great priuiledges, dignities and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
afterwards confirmed and increased by diuers Emperous. By
whose example some Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and other princes haue done the
like. Yet true it is, that at the beginning, such iurisdiction was executed one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the field, by the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> or their deputies, I meane in ordinary offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or els by the Legate in their absence, or els by the Consul or Generall,
in causes capitall, and faults of most importance. But in processe of time,
the insolencie of Souldiers increasing, the sayd iustice became more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
and the authoritie thereof extended into all townes and places whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
inflicting exemplarie punishment according to the qualitie of eche
mans offence, yea, in the end the reputation of Martial iurisdiction became
equall to that of ciuill Iustice.</p>

either by persuasion or force: the one proper to men,
the other to brute beasts: and where the first cannot
preuaile, the other may be excused. Reasonably there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are those warres to be taken in hand, where iniurie
can not be otherwise repulsed, nor peace by other meane
preserued. And most apparant it is, that nature hath bestowed vpon all
creatures certaine armes or weapons wherewith to defend themselues, and
offend their enemies, yea, whoso obserueth shall see, that ech liuing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
is in some sort by nature disposed to make warre: as the calfe, before

himselfe. <hi>Fortior est qui se, quàm qui fortissima vincit moenia: nec virtus
altior ire potest,</hi> sayeth <hi>Ouid.</hi> Seeing then that each man hath warre within
himselfe, and against others, and cities contend for honor and empire, one
taking from the other, what can be sayd Ours, more then that, which is
gotten and defended by armes? Yet true it is, that some warres are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
so called; as where one part of the people doth assault the other: for
that kinde of contending ought be named sedition: but when one Nation
taketh Armes to offend an other, there wee say is warre. When the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
were diuided, one faction labouring to oppresse another, (who by
nature ought to haue ioyned together) such enimitie was called Sedition:
but when the <hi>Galls,</hi> the <hi>Carthagenians,</hi> or other forreigne people assaulted
the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or were by them assailed, that contention was truely called
Warre. But omitting to say more of ciuil or domesticall dissention, let vs
discourse of that Warre which is ordinarily made with forreine people, for
Empire and glory, as when the <hi>Romanes</hi> tooke Armes against the <hi>Latines,
Sabines</hi> and <hi>Carthaginenses,</hi> or when they fought with the <hi>Celtiberi</hi> and <hi>Cim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bri,</hi>
not who should command, but who should liue: yet ought the cause
whereof the Warre groweth be iust, and such as the enemie cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
reasonable. For who is so impudent as will deny that if iniury
be done, or the goods or honour of other men be taken, but hee from
whom the same was taken, is iustly caused to become an enemie? <hi>Non licet
cum alterius incommodo suum augere commodum.</hi> Yet <hi>Aristotle</hi> proueth that
some men are by nature borne to command, others to obey, whereof may
be inferred, that Warres are necessary as well to compell those to subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that are destenied thereunto, as also for others (who ought to gouerne)
to hold their auctoritie. The <hi>Romanes</hi> also did thinke good sometimes to
make Warre onely to entertaine the youth fit for seruice; as when they
sent their Armie vnto <hi>Carthage,</hi> being perswaded that ouerlong idlenesse
might corrupt. For indeed, the labour and discipline of Warre, doth make
men honest and temperate. It seemeth therefore that Princes martially
disposed, haue not onely thereby purchased renowne, but also much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
their dominions For which reason the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> do seeme to
accuse <hi>Pausanias</hi> iustly, for inhibiting them to extend the bounds of their
dominion. But contrarywise <hi>Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Minos</hi> are much praised per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> and the people of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to aduance their glory,
by Warre: whereof wee may inferre, that Peace is not the onely ende of
Warre: yet not doubt the chiefest and most necessary cause thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the opinion of <hi>Cicero,</hi> saying, <hi>Nullum bellum esse iustum, nisi quod aut
rebus repet tis geratur, aut denuntiatum antè sit &amp; indictum.</hi> Whereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that Warres ought not to be made without iust cause, and publique
expostulation. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> writing the life of <hi>Numa,</hi> saith it was not lawful
for a King or any Souldier to take Armes, vntill the <hi>Foecials</hi> had so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
or allowed. Wise Princes and commanders therefore ought to
deliberate maturely before they take Armes, to the ende the Warre may
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17413:5"/>
be iust, and the proceeding thereof aduised. In which point they shall doe
well to imitate the example of <hi>Traianus,</hi> who vsed to obserue these cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
viz. carefully to supply the places of Souldiers slaine: couragiously to
represse the enemies pride: and according to discipline Militarie, compell
Muteners to obedience and order. To that purpose also, <hi>Octauianus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi>
did say, No warre ought be taken in hand, vnlesse the same did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
more hope of profit, then feare of losse. For who so shall otherwise
doe, may be compared vnto a Fisher, that angleth with an hooke of gold,
which being broken, or lost, al the fish hehath gotten, sufficeth not to make

that were, sure it is that anciently who so would become a Souldier,
it behooued him to procure his name to bee enrolled in the Generals
booke. For necessarie it is, that he who commandeth should know what
number, and so what qualitie his souldiers be. Which reason mooued <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander
Scuerus</hi> to keepe in his chamber a Catalogue or Rolle of his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and at his leisure, considered of their suites, their number, their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and wages. Hee likewise cautiously prouided, that no man should
aspire to priuiledges Militarie, by ambition, but for vertue and skill. And
who so desireth to enjoy the honours appertaining to Armes, ought first
to prooue he is a Souldier. In which case the lawes of <hi>Cossus, Crassus</hi> and
<hi>Sceuola</hi> must be remembred; for thereby is decreed, that as a man being no
citizen, should not take vpon him to be a citizen, so he that is not enrolled
a souldier, cannot anow himselfe a souldier. By the lawes Ciuill, three
wayes there are for souldiers to proue their profession: which done, they
shall not afterwardes endure any vnworthie or vnreasonable imposition.
The first proofe is by letters &amp; certificate of Captaines or Officers. <hi>Charles</hi>
the seuenth king of <hi>France</hi> commanded that no man should be capeable of
charge or office in the warre, vnlesse he were authorised by the Kings let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, in testimonie of the publique honour and degree hee had.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17413:6"/>
Secondly he ought to make proofe, that in former time he had behaued
himselfe as a good Souldier, and such a one as serued long with commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
Lastly, to be recorded among the number of receiued souldiers,
for that testimoniall cannot be disproued. It was also anciently vsed, that
in token of honour due vnto souldiers of good merit, a girdle was giuen;
for it is written in the law Imperiall, <hi>Militia exornatos confestimcingi debere.</hi>
And <hi>Charles</hi> the seuenth king of <hi>France</hi> in his Edict saith thus: <hi>Edictum est,

called <hi>Equites</hi>) vsed to carry on their left arme a certaine shield or
buckler, and in the right hand a lance, and vnto their side a Spanish sword
was girded. Thus appeareth it that the girdle was the first Ensigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
vpon souldiers, and without it no man might accompt himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the number of militarie men, nor claime the priuiledges due vnto
souldiers. For only they that were inrolled and girded were properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
souldiers: and they that were newly elected to supply the bands, were
named <hi>Tirones.</hi> It was also an vse among the Romanes, that when any
Captaine attained this Ensigne of the Generall, he then deliuered a Rolle
or list wherein his number was conteined. By which meanes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
generall might be informed of his whole Armie. It is also to bee
remembred, that besides these inrolled men, doe appertaine to euery ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie

                  <p>And for asmuch as the name and dignitie of a souldier is honourable,
all persons hauing committed any infamous crime, and thereof conuicted,
ought not afterwards beare armes. Also because the warre requireth beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and force in men, no souldier should bee allowed, that wanteth any
member or limme of his person, which moued the Emperour <hi>Domitianus</hi>
and <hi>Nerua</hi> to decree, that no childe should be gelded. And <hi>Constantinus</hi>
commanded that vpon paine of death no Eunuch should be made, being
perswaded that gelding did take from men the courage and viuacitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in warre. Yet was it allowed by the ordinance of the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Traianus,</hi> that albeit a man were borne with one onely stone, or by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
mishap did loose it, yet might he by the lawe Militarie beare Armes;
for <hi>Silla,</hi> and <hi>Cotta</hi> had naturally that imperfection. Wee conclude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that some fort of Eunuches (but no gelded man) may beare Armes.
And histories doe make mention that the Enunch <hi>Narcete</hi> in the reigne
of <hi>Iustinian</hi> expulsed the Goths out of <hi>Italy.</hi> Likewise <hi>Eucherius</hi> a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
fauourite of the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> was both an Eunuch and a
Captaine very notable. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> hauing conquered <hi>Babylon</hi> made choice
of Eunuches onely to guard his person, holding them of no lesse force then
other men, and by example of horses gelded, was perswaded, their bodies
were no whit disabled for the warre.</p>
                  <p>But as these before may not be receiued, in respect of natural debilitie,
so others for respect of qualification, are priuiledged and excused, as

the like grace was giuen to the Druides in <hi>France,</hi> by <hi>Caesar:</hi> also all

                  <p>The same Immunitie is also due to men aged, and those youths that are
not of perfect strenght; for so was it iudged by <hi>Gordianus</hi> the yonger: In
which point the law of <hi>Gracchus</hi> is also much to bee liked, for thereby hee
commaundeth that no person of lesse age then seuenteene yeeres should

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is said of <hi>Hercules Prodicus,</hi> That hee growing towards
mans estate, retired himselfe into a solitarie place; and there
sitting alone, considered, that two waies there were to passe
the course of his life: the one was of pleasure, the other of
industrie and vertue. This consideration I recommend to
all yong men, yet therewith wish, the choise should not be left vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
For the greatest number affecting idlenesse or sensuall delight, or
else wanting mature iudgement, would follow that way they finde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
inclined vnto. It therefore behooueth they should be compelled to
the exercise of vertue and Armes. And as great pitie it were to withholde
the rewards due to militarie merit, so not to incite young men to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Armes, were an errour inexcusable. For so was it decreed by lawe
of <hi>Dioclesianus</hi> and <hi>Maximianus:</hi> which also was more anciently obserued
of the Romanes, as by their histories appeareth: For when <hi>Quintus Serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
(being <hi>Tribunus Plebis,</hi> with authoritie Consulare) was to assemble an
armie against the <hi>Lucanes</hi> and <hi>Equians,</hi> he refused to make a confuse choise
of the people, and elected of the yonger sort onely. After that time, the
Dictator <hi>Camillus</hi> with his General of horse <hi>Seruilius Hala,</hi> did the like. And
<hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> with <hi>Lucius Furius Camillus,</hi> beeing Consuls, by direction
of the Senate, in a warre against the <hi>Gauls,</hi> did choose only yong men, both
of the Citie and of the Countrey: yea sometimes for want of them, priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
and persons condemned were pressed to beare Armes. In some other
ages by reason of scarcitie of able bodies, some youths before they were
seuenteene yeeres old, and others that exceeded fiftie, were forced to the
warre. But here is to be remembred, that neither these <hi>Tyrones,</hi> nor others
for necessitie chosen, ought be of equall reputation vnto more ancient sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers:
yet thus much priuiledge the Romanes did allow them, That when
any errour was committed, they were (in respect of youth and want of
experience) the sooner pardoned. In the flourishing state of the Romane
Empire, the <hi>Tyrones</hi> were chosen out of the free borne, at the age of 17.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Romanes called those soldiers <hi>Veterani,</hi> that had serued
long either in the Legion, or elsewhere, and behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
dutifully as beseemed honest men. The time ascribed
vnto that name of <hi>Veteranus,</hi> was commonly twenty yeeres,
which beeing passed, the souldier was called also <hi>Emeritus.</hi>
The priuiledges bestowed vpon such persons were so great, as diuers Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
did contend who should be most liberall. Also <hi>Canutus</hi> king of
<hi>Denmarke</hi> decreed, That when souldiers did meet to eat, the yonger should
giue place to him that was his ancient in Armes, because his meaning was
(euen in ordinarie ceremonies) to obserue the honour due vnto ancient
seruice, and whosoeuer in that case failed to performe the Kings comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
should be cassed with ignominie. <hi>Constantinus</hi> the Emperour pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledged
old soldiers so much, as to exempt them from all imposition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,
and exaction, The great <hi>Antoninus,</hi> and his father before him,
commanded that all <hi>Veterani</hi> should be free from paying vnto the building
of ships; also in buying of wares in faire, or market, they should passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
paiment of custome. They were also permitted, without molestation,
to liue in ease and rest. Also to them it was lawfull to vse commerce, fell,
employ money, traffique, and doe all things for their owne best commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.
So concluding, we say, that the Emperour <hi>Dioclesianus</hi> and <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianus</hi>
ordained, That vnto euery <hi>Veteran,</hi> hauing honestly serued in any
Legion, or vnder any ensigne the space of twentie yeeres, an honourable
or causarie dismission should be granted. After which time, he enioyed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other immunities, which extended also to his children, but no further.
And <hi>Constantinus,</hi> besides many other graces, commanded they should be
offered no sort of iniurie, thinking it vnmeete that men so much priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by their Prince, should endure any wrong or indignitie. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
if they, or any of them did steale, or commit felonie, then without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of priuiledge, the punishment due by law should be inflicted. But
rarely is it seene, that men hauing long liued vertuously, and enioying the
degrees of honour, should offend or doe any act of slander or infamie.
Lastly, the <hi>Veterani</hi> might marry wiues, they could not be put to tortour,
nor condemned to the Mines nor publique workes, they night manure
their lands: for <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great assigned them lands that would fall to
husbandry, and to euery one of them to buy necessaries 25000, pieces of
money called <hi>Folles,</hi> one yoke of oxen, and an hundred bushels of graine.

danger, toile, and trauell of the warre, should be suffered
to leade the rest of their liues in ease and rest: for so hath
their long and loyall seruice deserued. We read that the
Legionarie souldiers of Rome that had many yeeres con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in pay (without committing any crime) were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
to depart at their pleasure, notwithstanding the Oath formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
and euery man hauing so serued the state, might also claime the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
appertaining to old souldiers: for so was it decreed by <hi>Tiberius</hi> the
Emperour: and <hi>Caligula</hi> (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayth) taking view of his bands, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with diuers Captaines before they had gray haires: as one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
rather their imbecilitie and strength decayed, then the time they
had serued: beeing perswaded that age approching, was a cause sufficient
to merit honest libertie. It was therefore thought fit, that all souldiers that
had well serued, should bee left to their libertie. <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour
commanded that such men should be dismissed with honour, and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
rewarded. Which fauour was granted, not onely to men armed,
but also vnto all officers that followed the Generall, and serued in place of
reputation: yet were they inhibited to keepe company with other men,
then such as made profession of Armes, or to intermeddle in any affaires,
not appertaining vnto the warre, vpon paine to forfeit ten pounds in gold.
These <hi>Emeriti</hi> were alwayes ancient seruitours, and professours of Armes,

more, and sometimes lesse, as hath bene formerly said: yet in shorter space

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst it is to be knowen, that some crimes be common, and
punishable in all men: and some are proper to men of war
onely: of the first are forgeries, adulterie, publique and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
violence, sedition, manslaughter, burning of houses,
treason, sacrilege &amp; other enormities: for whosoeuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
any such offence, whether he be a man of warre or not, the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
due is all one. Crimes proper to souldiers, are such only as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
contrarie to discipline Militarie, and excuseable in other men, not
being souldiers. Now is it necessarie to vnderstand how crimes contrary
to Militarie Iustice ought be punished. We call that discipline Militarie,
whereby men are made obedient, and instructed in all such qualities as are
required in a souldier. And for so much as the readiest way vnto vertue, is
first to restraine vice, we must endeuour by discipline to hold men in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And notwithstanding al humane policie and lawes, both diuine and
humane, some men there are so vile and malicious, as (without respect) will
commit all actes or iniuries that can be inuented, yet good gouernours do
forecast, not onely what men doe, but also what may be done: which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Romanes to consider that some men did commit faultes beyond
expectation, in so much as there wanted not of those that haue slaine their
owne fathers. For which offence, <hi>Solon</hi> in his lawes prouided no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
and being asked why he did not inflict penaltie vpon those offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
answered, he thought not that any man would haue bene so wocked.
We therefore thinke fit, to prescribe punishments vnto all crimes: for
souldiers (like vnto others) be neither gods nor perfect creatures, but men
apt to erre, and without restraint of law not to be gouerned. <hi>Arrius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
in his first booke <hi>Dere Militari</hi> saith, Crimes properly Militarie are
those which a man (as a souldier) doth commit. And here a certaine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene errour and crime is to be noted: for we call that an error
when any thing is done contrary to common discipline: as to be slouthful,
disobedient, and vnwilling: but he is said to commit a crime, when the
fault is accompanied with intent to hurt: for without that intent, the acte
may be imputed to destenie or chance, and as a thing happened vnwares:
therefore <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour did command <hi>Herculianus</hi> and other
Captaines, that if a souldier hauing stroken another man, did prooue the
act was without intent to kill, that then he should not bee condemned of
manslaughter: as if a man be slaine when souldiers be trained, or in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of armes, then that act is not accounted criminall, but casuall: yet if
such an act be done in any other place, the doer thereof shall be re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the enemie, are well entreated and greatly esteemed, so
long as their seruice is thought profitable: yet afterwardes
(their condition being knowen) that credit doth decay, and
consequently the fauour they finde becommeth euery day
lesse then other. The law calleth them Traytors that indeuour to betray
their Prince or the libertie of their countrey: they are also called Traytors
that hauing a charge, doe yeeld the same vp vnto the enemie, of whom it
is by law decreed, they ought to be capitally punished, or at the least dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.
Likewise all Explorators or spies that bewray our secrets and
enforme the enemie, are accounted Traytors, and worthy capitall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
With these offendors the Aegyptians vsed to deale more mildly, for
in that case the offendors had their tongues cut out, and so suffered to liue.
They were also accounted to haue committed a crime treasonable, that
furnished the enemie with weapon or munition, whereby they might of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
vs, and we with more difficultie offend them. The goods of such men
ought be confiscate, and their liues subiect vnto death. The doctor <hi>Paulus</hi>
iudged that who so did sell any armour vnto the enemie, did thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the forfeiture of his life. <hi>Edward</hi> the third, king of <hi>England,</hi> in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
holden at <hi>Winchester,</hi> caused <hi>Edmond</hi> Earle of <hi>Kent</hi> to be conuicted

are diuersly punished, according to the qualitie of the crime, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the countrey, and the discretion of the Prince. <hi>Tullus Hostilius</hi>
king of <hi>Rome,</hi> caused <hi>Metius Suffetius</hi> guiltie of Treason, to be beaten by
the <hi>Littori,</hi> and after torne in pieces with horses. <hi>Antony de Leua</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<hi>Pauia,</hi> discouered a souldier of his had informed the French, that in
that citie small store of powder remained, he called him to be examined:
and the fault confessed, the souldier was put to death and quartered. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Athenians it was not lawfull to burie a Traitor, which was the
cause that the bones of <hi>Themistocles</hi> were secretly caried into his friendes
house and there buried. <hi>Bellesarius</hi> finding that a Citizen of <hi>Athens</hi> called
<hi>Laurus,</hi> had complotted treason, commanded his bodie should be brought
vnto a hill before the citie, and there thrust thorow with a stake, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of death is at this day vsed in <hi>Turkie. Charles</hi> the Emperour making
warre vpon <hi>Philip</hi> duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> practized with certaine of the Captains
to perswade <hi>Philip</hi> to leaue the fielde, who hauing compassed so much as
the Emperour required, they demanded a reward of their treason: which
was foorthwith payed in counterfeit money, and caried home. But the

Traytors perceiuing the money not to be good, returned therewith, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

sometimes omission of due respect is criminall, though not euer capitall.

three, <hi>viz.</hi> Cowardise, Treason, and Disobedience: yet
will wee speake more particularly. Touching the first, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
may it be conceiued, that Cowardise is the cause and
occasion of many other transgressions, for who so is irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
or apt to entertaine feare, is also soon perswaded to saue himselfe with
dishonour. By Cowardise souldiers doe forsake their rankes: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
abandon their Ensigne: which faults the Romanes punished with
death. It was long since by an Edict commanded in <hi>France,</hi> that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
did forsake his colours, or the ranke wherein he was placed, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
punishment by passing the pikes. Another kinde of Cowardise is to
faine sickenesse, or without leaue to be absent from the Armie. He is also
culpable of that crime, that leaueth his place of standing vpon the wall,
during the assault: or shall abandon the trench. Yet true it is, if any such
fault bee committed at any other time then during the assault, the same is
not absolutely capitall, but is arbitrable. It hath bene also anciently vsed,
that if a souldier without lawfull excuse did goe from the Watch, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Scout, or any other seruice allotted vnto him by the Sergeant, that
then he should be iudged to passe the Pikes, or Harquebuzies, according
to that kinde of weapon wherewith he serued. And if many souldiers (as
a whole Ensigne or troupe) did commit that crime, the Roman vse was to
execute euery tenth man, in presence of the rest: to the end the pain might
fall vpon fewe, and the terrour to all. And in such cases of Cowardise the
Generall ought to be inexorable, because seueritie doth make an army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible.
The experience whereof was seene when <hi>Spartacus</hi> defeated the
Romanes conducted by <hi>Crassus.</hi> For presently vpon that dishonour, <hi>Cras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi>
commanded a decimation, and put to death a tenth man in euery Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for not hauing fought manfully. That being done, he begun to fight a-new:
And albeit the number of Romans was diminished, yet were they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
and cut the enemies in pieces. But here is to be noted, that of flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there is two sorts, the one proceeding of a sudden and vnlooked for
terror, which is least blameable: the other is voluntary, and as it were a
determinate intention to giue place vnto the enemie: A fault exceeding
foule, and not excusable.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Esides these crimes formerly touched, many other there
are that merit seuere punishment, and chiefly, To abandon
the Armie, and flee to the enemie. For what iniurie can
be greater, or what offence more foule in a souldier, then
being instructed, trained, and well entertained, to employ
his vertue in seruice of an enemie? This crime was therefore in ancient
time grieuously punished, and the greater the qualitie was of him that did
offend, the more was the punishment inflicted. Yet doe we not finde any
particular paine ascribed to this offence, but left to discretion of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
Neuerthelesse in that case it shall not be amisse to imitate the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proceeding of ancient Chieftaines. The Romanes therefore for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of the <hi>Brutij,</hi> who fled vnto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> protested them to be from
thenceforth neither souldiers, nor companions in armes, but persons ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious,
and seruants vnto the Armie. And when <hi>Cyrus</hi> intercepted a
letter, which one of his Captaines called <hi>Orontes</hi> had written, offering to
serue the enemie with a company of horse, <hi>Cyrus</hi> assembled the Leaders,
and in their presence condemned <hi>Orontes</hi> to death. <hi>Fredericus</hi> the second
possessing the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> was by his sonne <hi>Henrie</hi> abandoned,
and being with the enemie he pardoned him, yet with condition he should
confine himselfe to the bounds of <hi>Apulia,</hi> vntill his father returned from
<hi>Germany:</hi> during which time, <hi>Henry</hi> practised some other innouation, and
therefore was put in prison, and in the end suffered death. <hi>Elfricus</hi> a chiefe
Leader vnder <hi>Etheldred</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> pretending to doe seruice, fled
vnto the Danes: but the warre being ended, he returned vnto his Prince,
desiring his life: which with difficulty he obtained, yet did the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his eyes should be put out.</p>
                  <p>To these offendors, we may adde all such as secretly doe relieue the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
with counsell, money, meate, or by any other meane whatsoeuer. In
which case the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> decreed, that if a souldier, Captaine,
or Leader did vtter any word, signe, or voice, to encourage the enemie, that
for so doing he should be tied in chaines, and as a beast be led whersoeuer
the Armie went.</p>
                  <p>Of this kinde we may account two other sorts of men, whom the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
called <hi>Emansores</hi> &amp; <hi>Desertores.</hi> They named him <hi>Desertor</hi> that went
from the Armie, and did not onely secretly depart, but stayed long with
the enemie, as one intending neuer to returne. But <hi>Emansor</hi> was hee that
without licence went away, and very shortly did come againe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his offence reputed the lesse. This error is most commonly found in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17413:12"/>
yong souldiers whom we call <hi>Tyrones.</hi> Neither are they to be all punished
alike, but the Iudge is to examine the circumstances of the cause. The law
willeth that who so is found a Desertor in warre, is to be capitally puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
whether hee were horseman or souldier on foote. But if a horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
doe prooue a Desertor in peace, he thereby forfeiteth his degree: or
if he were a footman he looseth his pay. If such an offender be found in the
citie, he incurreth the losse of his head: but being elswhere found (and that
the first fault) hee may be restored, but offending the second time, shall
loose his life. He that to this fault shall adde any other, ought be the more
sharpely punished: and hauing so offended, he shall be in case, as if he had
bene twise a <hi>Desertor.</hi> To this kind of offence, in diuers ages, and by diuers
Princes, diuers penalties were appointed. The Spartanes repulsed such men
from being capable of any office, and to liue euer vnmarried: also to giue
place to all other men, and haue the one side of their beards shauen. <hi>Aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi>
the vsurper commanded, that some should haue their hands cut off,
and other their legges broken. <hi>Dauid</hi> King of Scottes, and second of that
name, being forced to flee his kingdome, at his returne (as one mindfull of
those that abandoned him in time of danger) caused all Chiefetaines and
Captaines to pay money, and would haue disinherited <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> who
was before named his heire. Also for an example to posteritie, he imposed
a pecuniary punishment vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al those that did abandon their king in fight.</p>
                  <p>Another sort of fugitiues be they, that beeing taken prisoners, will not
returne (although so they might:) of which number, some doe onely rest
with the enemie, and others doe take part and fight on his side, which is an
offence of great importance. <hi>Paulus</hi> the Ciuilian writeth, That such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
should be either burned aliue, or hanged. <hi>Vlpianus</hi> would haue them
also burned.<note place="margin">Or, rather, as some report, he was not executed by the King for lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him, but by the factious Lords for adhering firmely to the King.</note> 
                     <hi>Nicholas Brembre</hi> an Alderman of London at a battell in Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,
or neere Oxford (as others say) fled from King <hi>Richard</hi> the second, and
after being found in Wales, was brought from thence to London, where
hee was publikely put to death. Also at the siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> seuen hundred
fugitiues were taken, beaten with roddes, and their hands cut off. By these
examples appeareth, that no certeine punishment was inflicted for this
offence.</p>
                  <p>To these we may adde all seditious persons, who desirous of innouation
doe attempt diuers enterprises to mooue mutenie or rebellion. These se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
are most commonly in armies composed of diuers nations, or
where strangers are called for aide. In <hi>Cybaris</hi> a great number of <hi>Achaians</hi>
and <hi>Troezenians</hi> did dwell quietly, vntill the <hi>Achei</hi> finding their number the
greater, tooke Armes and expulsed the <hi>Troezeni.</hi> In <hi>Constantinople</hi> likewise
the strangers did conspire to oppresse the Citizens, but in a battell were all
forced to flie. Also after the suppression of the tyrants in <hi>Syracusa,</hi> the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and hired souldiers fell into great dissention. For reformation of this
fault, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> is to be followed, who finding such a mischiefe to arise,
cleared the armie of all busie heads, sware the souldiers, and at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
repressed the sedition. <hi>Modestinus</hi> the doctor did giue counsell, that
whosoeuer did begin any muteny, should loose his life, if the sedition were
dangerous; but beeing of lesse moment, the beginner thereof should be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17413:12"/>
cassed. The law of <hi>Naples</hi> commandeth, that souldiers or others, mouing
any sedition, should forfeit both life and goods. <hi>Trebonius</hi> a chiefe conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour
against <hi>Caesar,</hi> was put to death by <hi>Dolabella:</hi> and <hi>Marinas Phalerius</hi>
Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> for conspiring against that state, was beheaded: yet in some
places and times the punishment of these offences was onely pecuniall, or
infamie.</p>
                  <p>Another crime of greater consequence it is, to yeeld vp, or abandon a
place of strength, or depart from a standing giuen in charge: for by the
Romane lawe, those crimes were euer accounted capitall. It is likewise
capital for feare of an enemie, to forsake the trench, the wall, or other place
to be defended. Therefore <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> caused certaine Captaines (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
abandoned a place) vpon paine of death to recouer it. <hi>Modestinus</hi>
saith, That he who leaueth his place of watch or warde, is to be reputed
worse then an Emansor, and consequently for such a fault to be punished,
or at the least be discharged his seruice: and he that forsaketh the trench,
incurreth the same penaltie, though the enemie doe make no approch:
but if the enemie be at hand, then so to doe, is capitall. Euery man may
reade that <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> sent certaine bands against the Volses, and they
abandoning their ranks, were beaten with rods, and after executed: which
proceeding seemeth extreame, and therefore in like case some fewe haue
bene put to death to terrifie the rest. <hi>Antonius</hi> leading an armie against
the Parthians, executed onely euery tenth man of those that first did runne
away. The like was done by <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> in the warre against the Volses,
putting a few of those souldiers to death, that first abandoned their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes.
<hi>Caius Caesar,</hi> according to the Lawes of <hi>Petreius</hi> (at suite of the
Legions) did put to death onely twelue persons that were the chiefe moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of sedition; so great was his mercie. Neuerthelesse, the vse was euer
to put him to death that did flee first. It is sayd that <hi>Epaminondas</hi> walking
the round where the watch was set, hapned to finde a souldier fast asleepe,
whom forth with he slew with his sword: saying, As he found him, so hee
left him. The like penaltie doe they incurre that sleepe, or depart from
their place of watch: which moued <hi>Epaminondas</hi> to account a souldier slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
like a man without life.</p>
                  <p>By the law Militarie it is prouided, that if any Souldier doe loose his
Armes, or sell them, hee shall for so doing be capitally punished, or at the
least disabled to beare Armes, at the discretion of the Iudge. Or if any soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
doe cast away his Armes, and not defend himselfe against the enemie,
shall thereby incurre infamy. The old <hi>Romanes</hi> reputed him worthy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
a <hi>bastonado</hi> that abandoned his Ensigne. The like punishment they
thought due to him that did forsake the Generall. If any Captaine did flee
from his Company, or any Ensigne-bearer did let fall his Colours, he was
beheaded, or beaten to death with cudgels. <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> being sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Volses,</hi> caused certaine Ensigne-bearers, for loosing their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
and others that fled out of their rankes, to be beaten with rods. <hi>Paulus</hi>
the doctor holdeth it a great fault for any Souldier to sell his Armes: yet
seemeth hee lesse culpable then the former. But that kinde of crime is
thought equal vnto desertion: and whether he sell all or part of his Armes,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17413:13"/>
the fault is one. Yet that doctour maketh this difference, viz. he that selleth
his <hi>greaues</hi> or his <hi>powldro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> s,</hi> ought to be beaten: But who so selleth his shield,
his head-peece or sword, shalbe punished as a <hi>Desertor.</hi> In this age to
loose, exchange, or borrow the Armes belonging to another Ensigne, is an
offence very great, and so punished by the Edict of <hi>Francis</hi> the French
King. Likewise by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if any Souldier doe empawne his
sword, hee should be reputed vnworthy the company of other Souldiers,
and iudged infamous; yet true it is, that if any yong Souldier (whom the
Romanes called <hi>Tyro</hi>) do commit that fault, he ought to be punished with
more fauour. Now concluding wee say, that seeing the losse or selling of
Armes, argueth no magnaimitie, courage, or care of a Souldier, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a signe of slouth and pusillanimitie, incurring that error, hee is not to
be esteemed better then a base or abiect companion. And for that reason
it seemeth the <hi>Spartans</hi> did well to banish <hi>Archilocus</hi> the Poet, writing these
words, <hi>Melius est arma abijcere, quàm mori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among these Militarie crimes, we may not forget that which the lawe
calleth <hi>crimen falsi.</hi> This fault may be diuers wayes committed, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by fayning sicknesse, which is a signe of cowardise, and vnworthy a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier.
The Lawyers assigne to that offence, a beating with cudgels. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way this fault may be incurred, if a man that is no souldier, wil affirme
he is a souldier, or weareth an Ensigne which he ought not: the one was
punishable by the law <hi>Cornelia,</hi> the other to be more seuerely punished, by
the opinion of <hi>Modestinus.</hi> The Egyptians made a law that who so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited
false letters, or razed any writing, should haue both his handes
cut off. <hi>Kenethus</hi> king of <hi>Scots</hi> made an ordinance in his kingdome, that
who so committed this fault, should be hanged, and forthwith cast into a
graue. Of this crime are they also guiltie, that make any counterfeit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
and they that forge false keyes to escape out of prison. Yet <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi>
the Emperour referreth this last fault to the discretion of competent
Iudges.</p>
                  <p>It is also a fault very infamous to commit any theft, either in the fielde
or towne, and consequently seuerely to be punished. The Romanes vsed
therefore to sweare souldiers (were they seruants or freemen) to carie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
out of the campe: or if by hap any thing were found, then the finder
to bring it vnto the Tribune: But if neither loue of vertue nor othe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
to withhold men from stealing, then were they with great seueritie
by the Romane law punished. <hi>Valentinus</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> consented, that if
any souldier did spoile houses or fields, the countrey people might then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
and kill them. The like was permitted by the Edict of <hi>Francis</hi> the
French King 1523: yet with this caution, that if any of those theeues were
taken aliue, that then they should be brought before the Iudges or Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the prouince, and by their discretion receiue correction. This
crime was euer accounted so detestable, as whosoeuer therein did offend
(though the goods taken were of small worth) yet was the offendour se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
chastified. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour caused a souldiers head to be cut
off, for stealing a Peacoke. <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> commanded a soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
to be nailed vnto a post, for taking a hen from a poore woman. <hi>Selim</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:17413:13"/>
the Turkish Emperour caused <hi>Bostangi Bassa</hi> his sonne in law to be behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for spoiling the Prouinces where he was gouernor. <hi>Francis</hi> the French
King decreed, That if any purueyour or victualler of the Campe, contrary
to his Commission, did exact or cary away the commodities of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
it should be capitall, were it in towne or countrey.</p>
                  <p>For many respects also the vice of adultery ought be seuerely punished,
as well in warre as peace: which caused <hi>Lucius Cautilius Scriba,</hi> the same
yeere the Romanes were defeated at <hi>Canna</hi> (by commaundement of the
chiefe Bishop) to be beaten extreamely, for hauing committed that crime
with <hi>Florina. Iulius Caesar</hi> likewise caused a speciall fauorite of his to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitally
punished, for dishonoring the wife of a Romane gentleman, though
no complaint was made thereof. <hi>Papinianus</hi> the doctor sayth, That if any
souldier doe keepe in his house his owne sisters daughter, hee may be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an adulterer. And as a Maxime or Rule it was decreed by all doctors
of Law, That no souldier condemned of adultery may after beare Armes.
By the law <hi>Iulia</hi> the crime of adultery was thought worthy of infamie, and
the offenders disabled to beare Armes. <hi>Aurelianus</hi> commanded, that if any
souldier did rauish the wife of his host, he should be tyed vnto two trees,
and torne in pieces. <hi>Frotho</hi> king of Scots made a law, That if any man by
force defloured a virgine, he should be gelded. The Egyptians proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
That whosoeuer was found in adultery (although it were with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent)
yet the man should be beaten with a thousand stripes, and the woman
haue her nose cut of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Diuers other military offences there are, which for
breuitie I omit: wishing all Princes, Generals, and other soueraigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in Armes, to encline rather to mercy then extreame seueritie:
following the aduice of <hi>Salustius,</hi> who perswadeth, that souldiers should
not (for ordinary errours) be punished like vnto vulgar people; and euer
respect to be had vnto those that were ancient seruants and <hi>Emeriti.</hi> For
in the raigne of <hi>Antoninus,</hi> so great honour was giuen to old souldiers (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Veterani</hi> or <hi>Emeriti</hi>) as if any of their sonnes had offended, they were
not (like to others) condemned to labour in the mines of mettall or other
publike workes, but sent into a certaine Iland. And heere is to be noted,
that this fauour extended no further then the first degree. It is also to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that as punishments are diuers, so ought they be diuersly infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted:
for no Captaine or other commander of greater qualitie, ought be
condemned to the mine, or forced to labour in those workes; neither may
hee be hanged or burned, vnlesse the crime be capitall. Also souldiers
should not bee cast vnto beasts to be eaten, nor put vnto torture: which
priuiledge is precisely obserued in Italy. And in this point, Magistrates
are to regard the qualitie of crimes, and the circumstances: for hee that
committeth an outrage vpon his father, meriteth an extreame punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but he that is drunke or wanton, deserueth not so great an inflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The qualitie of offenders is also to be looked vnto: for freemen and
bondmen are not to be equally vsed. Nowe to conclude this matter of
crimes military, we say that the Romanes practised all these punishments,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome crimes are of such quality as souldiers are onely chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in their pay, for negligence: or otherwise taxed for
their absence: yet ought they not be reproued as <hi>Desertors,</hi>
or loyterers, if by sickenesse, imprisonment, or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
they were forced to commit offence. For to such
faults the law assigneth no other punishment then at the discretion of the
Chieftaine. Yet doth it appeare, that in the yeare 153. <hi>ab vrbe condita,
Publius Varro,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Sergius Tribuni militum,</hi> hauing receiued a defeat
of the <hi>Vienti,</hi> they &amp; the souldiers were commanded to pay a great summe
of money, notwithstanding that <hi>Sergius</hi> affirmed the losse to proceed only
from the fortune of warre. And <hi>Virginius</hi> desired he might not bee made
more vnfortunate at home, then he had bene in the field. <hi>Zeno</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
punished a souldier for taking vpon him to let another mans house, his
owne terme being therein determined: because <hi>Iustinianus</hi> had inhibited
souldiers to dispose or meddle with goods not their own. Vnto like pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
is hee subiect that shall require his Prince to permit him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
pay, in two diuers armies. If any souldier did take vpon him other
function then that of the warre, or so do, as deputie vnto another, he was
taxed in ten pounds of gold. <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> made a lawe that if any
souldier disturbed a victualer, he should pay an hundred pounds of gold.
The same Emperors ordeined, that if any Captaine or other Commander
whatsoeuer did vse a greater part of an house or lodging, then the Harben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had allotted vnto him, he should incurre the penaltie of three hundred
pounds in gold, &amp; if any souldier of lesse quality so did, he should be cassed.
<hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour to suppresse all euill customes in the war, decreed,
that if a souldier required any thing that was appertaining to his host, he
should be taxed to pay ten pounds. The French King made a law, that if
souldiers did take the goods of any Citizen, or man of the countrey, hee
should be capitally punished, as if they had committed theft. <hi>Kanutus</hi> King
of <hi>Denmarke</hi> ordeined, that all military paines might be satisfied and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by money, excepting only the chastisement of beating: therfore who
so had incurred the crime of manslaughter was condemned in forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
talents of money: one part thereof to be payd vnto the King, another
to the souldiers, and the third to the kinsfolke of the party slaine.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as great Captaines did finde by experience, that
hope of impunitie, was the occasion of many Militarie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
and to the end no fault should be free from chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
they therefore appointed paines to be inflicted vpon
euery offence. A souldier that resisted correction offered
by his Captaine, was beaten with a cudgell: and if he laid holde or hand
thereof, he was cassed: and if he brake it or laid hand vpon his Captaine,
he was put to death: whereof may be inferred, that souldiers were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17413:15"/>
beaten. The Romane vse in this kinde of punishment was thus: A
Captaine comming to correct a souldier, at the first sleightly touched his
person with a cudgell, or (as some haue written) with a withy made of a
vine tree, which done, all other men present in the Armie did strike the
condemned man with staues and stones: yet when many had offended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
they were not thus handled, but out of a great number some eight
or ten of the seditious were slaine, the rest sent away. In the meane space
all were in feare of equall punishment. The Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> vsed to deliuer
vnto their Captaines a certaine short staffe or cudgell, wherewith to beat
the souldiers that offended, which serued also to direct them in their
march and rankes. This punishment they called <hi>Castigatio per vitem. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus</hi>
the Emperour refused to deliuer any such staffe, but onely to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
of discretion and good fame. It is also written that <hi>Lucilius</hi> a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion
hauing broken his staffe required another, and breaking that also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
a third. Whereupon (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> noteth) he was nicknamed, <hi>Cedò al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram,</hi>
i. Reach me another. <hi>Caluinus</hi> called also <hi>Domitius</hi> obteined license of
the Senate to beat a Captaine named <hi>Iubillius</hi> for fleeing the field coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
It is also extant that certain Legions, abandoning a Consul were beaten
(or as now by the Italian phrase wee terme it) did receiue the <hi>Bastonado.</hi>
This kind of punishment was euer accompanicd with infamy: which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Kanutus</hi> king of <hi>Denmarke</hi> to decree, that all punishments of that kind,
might be dispensed with for money: alledging that because dogges were
so corrected, therefore it was of all other chastisements most ignominious,
and consequently to be abhorred, perswading all great Captaines to vse
temperance, and to punish rarely and aduisedly: remembring that <hi>Phaleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>
a Generall of the Phocenses was slaine by a souldier, to whom he had
giuen a <hi>Bastonado:</hi> much more cautious and slow ought Collonels, and
priuate Captaines to be, in offering this kind of correction.</p>

be furnished with ordinary and dayly wages. Yet
true it is that in times long since passed, men of warre
serued at their owne charge, and without pay: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at what time the Romanes begun to giue wages
is not (I thinke) certainely knowen. Some histories
say, that vntill the reigne of king <hi>Tullus,</hi> the Romanes receiued no wages.
Others affirme that giuing of pay began when <hi>Massinissa</hi> made warre with
<hi>Syphax</hi> king of <hi>Numidia,</hi> for then <hi>Scipio</hi> hired certaine mercenary souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17413:15"/>
a course neuer before knowen among the Romanes. <hi>Liuy</hi> writeth that
in the yeere 348. <hi>ab vrbe conditae,</hi> when <hi>Gneus Cornelius Cossus, Valerius Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Publius Cornelius Cossus,</hi> and <hi>Claudius Fabius Ambustus</hi> were Tribunes
militarie with authoritie Consulate at the siege and sacke of <hi>Anxur,</hi> (now
called <hi>Terracina</hi>) the Senate decreed the soldiers should receiue pay out of
the common treasurie: for (saith he) vntill that time euery man prouided
for himselfe. Howsoeuer these payments began, sure it is (as <hi>Thucydides</hi>
writeth) that in the warre of <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> to euery footman two <hi>drachmae</hi>
was daily giuen: which in the moneth amounted vnto 60. How that pay
may be compared to ours, or the entertainement of souldiers in this part
of <hi>Europe</hi> I know not. Omitting therfore to say more therof, let vs see how
those payes were anciently bestowed. <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperor decreed that
in his reigne, no wages nor donatiue should be giuen to any souldier for
the time he did remaine with the enemie: although at his returne he were
allowed <hi>Postliminium.</hi> It therefore seemeth strange that <hi>Modestinus</hi> hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
that if a souldier taken by the enemy, and hauing serued his full time,
doe returne home, he ought not to be intreated as an old souldier, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
reward as an <hi>Emeritus.</hi> Whereunto <hi>Arrius Menander</hi> in his booke <hi>de
re Militari</hi> assenteth: yet here is to be noted, that to receiue a donatiue, and
to receiue wages, are diuers. For Donatiues are bestowed onely on those
men that haue performed their full time of seruice, and called <hi>Emeriti:</hi> but
wages or ordinarie pay is due as a yeerely or monethly entertainement.
To me therefore it seemeth not necessarie that donatiues should be giuen
vnto any man being a prisoner, nor that he can challenge pay to be due du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his absence, vnlesse the same be granted by speciall grace and fauour
of the Prince. For who so is a prisoner in the enemies hand, may be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a dead man: and who can say a dead man deserueth pay? Moreouer,
as he who without lawfull leaue absenteth himselfe, ought to be checked,
so those souldiers that are slouthfull or lazie, doe woorthily merite to lose
their wages, according to the censure of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> the Emperour, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That nothing was more vnreasonable then slouthfull folke to deuoure
the common weale, when by their labour they did not encrease the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
thereof. Yet reason it is that sicke men should receiue their pay,
because they are supposed to serue, although they be by want of health
impeached: neither ought they be abridged of pay that are imployed in
their owne particular affaires so long as they depart not from the Armie,
nor the seruice receiueth preiudice.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Romanes and other free people made Lawes whereby
such lands or goods as were taken from them by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
should be restored. For what is lost in the warre or by
meane of the warre, the same was redeliuered vnto the
owner by force of the said Law called <hi>Postliminij ius:</hi> and it
seemeth a course of naturall equitie, that whatsoeuer hath bene taken and
kept by force in absence, the same should bee restored vnto the owner
when he returneth. As therefore by going out of our confines, a man loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his lands and goods; so by entring againe, hee may claime his owne.
This grace is granted not onely vnto men able for fight, but also to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that with counsell, seruice, or otherwise may stand the State in stead.
Likewise if a sonne be taken by the enemy, and during his imprisonment
the father dieth, he may at his returne home, enter into the possessions of
the father. Or if a mother were taken, and her sonne yet vnborne in her
body, when he is borne he may be ransomed for the prise of one souldier,
and returne to the lands hee is to inherit: yet true it is that freemen may
not enioy the benefit of this Law, vnlesse they returne with intention to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
in their countrey; which was the reason that <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> could
not be admitted to receiue his owne, hauing sworne to go againe vnto <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
and not continue at <hi>Rome.</hi> The same titles also haue they that bee
owners of great ships and Galleys fit for the warre, but Fishers and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are denied that aduantage, because their vessels are made onely for
profit or pleasure, and not for the warre. Neither may any fugitiue receiue
this fauour: for he that leaueth his countrey with intent to do euill, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a traitour, must be accounted among the number of enemies. But if
a man doe goe vnto another countrey that is in league with vs, and then
returne, albeit that countrey be distant from ours, he shall not need to be
restored by vertue of this Law, but enioy his owne, as if he had neuer gone
from home. Yet true it is, that sometimes in peace a man may claime the
benefit of <hi>Postliminium,</hi> as when a freeman is deteined by force and made a
captiue: yet can hee not be said taken by the enemy, because those violen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which are vsed before the warre is published, are not properly called
actions of the warre; though the difference seemeth small, when they take
from vs, and we from them. But if a captiue doe flee from vs and returne,
he shal not be allowed <hi>Postliminium.</hi> Whoso is taken prisoner during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
may be reputed as dead; for so the law doth account him: which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
percase mooued <hi>Caius Cotta</hi> (returned home fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prison) to say, he was
twise borne. But here is to be remembred, that no prisoner returned, can
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17413:16"/>
by the lawe of <hi>Postliminium</hi> receiue wages or donatiue for the time of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
vnlesse it be by grace. If a Citizen of Rome did goe from the Citie
without licence of the Senate (vnlesse he were taken by the enemy) he lost
the priuiledges of Rome, but being taken and returned, hee might recouer
his citie and libertie. It was also decreed by the Romanes, that if a father,
or the people did giue or sell a man, and the enemy receiue him, he might
not after be allowed <hi>Postliminium:</hi> but if the gift were not accepted, then
he might; because there is no giuer where a receiuer wanteth.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ancient Emperours, and before them the Consuls and
other commanders in the warre, had in vse to bestow vpon
Captaines and Souldiers certaine giftes to encourage them
to serue well. Those great Magistrates did also vse after or
before any action of much importance, to assemble their
armie, and then selecting out of the whole number some fewe men of most
merite did giue vnto them notable commendation. They likewise vsed to
bestow a launce or sword vpon him that had wounded an enemie, or some
such weapon. To him that had vnhorsed or spoiled an enemie (if he were
a footeman) was giuen a pot of gold or other piece of plate. If hee were a
horseman, he receiued an ornament or fauour to be set on his crest. Hee
that mounted first vpon the wall of an enemies towne, receiued a crowne
of gold. These donations or fauours did not only encourage men to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
but also made them much honoured at home: for besides glory and
fame, they were also receiued into their countreys with much pompe and
applause: which incited others to attempt the like. <hi>Octauius Caesar</hi> after the
<hi>Philippian</hi> warre, did giue vnto the Legionarie souldiers certaine crownes,
and vnto euery Captaine a garment of purple: but <hi>Hostilius,</hi> one of those
Tribunes, saying those crowns and garments were like vnto boyes bables,
they were rewarded with land and money. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> did giue vnto the
sonnes of <hi>Adbucillus</hi> (the one called <hi>Rocillus,</hi> the other <hi>Aegus</hi>) in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their great seruice in <hi>Gallia,</hi> certaine lands there, besides diuers
summes of money, whereby they became inriched. The same <hi>Caesar,</hi> after
his triumph for victory against <hi>Pharnax,</hi> performed all the promises hee
had made; and gaue vnto euery souldier fiue thousand groats, to euery lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

fiue hundred groats, and vpon the Captaines a farre greater reward.
The <hi>Scipiones</hi> and <hi>Metelli</hi> were likewise most careful to reward and honour
their souldiers. <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> was woont to say, That souldiers would
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17413:17"/>
not liue in awe of their Generall, vnlesse they were well apparelled, well
armed, full fed, and some pence in their purses. Sometimes also souldiers
were honoured with other giftes, as crownes, lances, furniture of horses,
bracelets, lands, images of brasse or stone, with diuers other ensignes of
honour, as <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> haue written. Which gifts were by the
Doctors of Law anciently called <hi>Donatiues.</hi> But here it shall not be amisse
to remember the dishonourable Donations of <hi>Lucius Sylla,</hi> who vsed to
take money from the true owners, and giue the same to others.</p>

be clothed: which moued great Commanders to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
that men of war might be euer furnished as wel of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
as of food. <hi>Caius Gracchus</hi> first procured a law to be made,
that garments might be giuen vnto souldiers without dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
their pay. Long after, the Emperors <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
certaine money to be giuen vnto euery souldier for the prouision of his
coate: which order was in <hi>Illyria</hi> only. It was also anciently ordered that
military garments were prouided in this sort: <hi>viz.</hi> euery thirty inhabitants
payed for one souldiers coate in <hi>Thracia.</hi> The like was done in <hi>Scythia,
Mysia, Egypt,</hi> and euery other prouince subiect vnto the Empire. These
Countreyes were also sometimes taxed according to the acres of land, and
sometimes according to the number of dwellers, and the money payed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the military treasury. <hi>Francis</hi> the French king proclaimed an Edict,
that souldiers resting in any citie or village in the winter, should haue gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
there: and being furnished for the summer, should vse their sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
suits vntill the winter following: and then resume them againe. And
in case the keeper of those garments did not truely restore them, then vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
complaint vnto the Generall, order should be taken for the souldiers
satisfaction. By which meanes the souldiers were euer honestly clothed,
well armed, and comely furnished both on horsebacke and on foote. Yet
<hi>Pesceninus Niger</hi> inhibited souldiers to vse in the waare any girdle garni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
with gold or siluer, to the end the enemie should not be inriched. He
therefore commanded such ornaments to be reserued for their wiues and
children. <hi>Adrianus</hi> the Emperour vsed to weare in the warre plaine gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
without garnishing of gold, or strings set with stone. The scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd
of his sword was also seldome wrought with Iuory. In the reigne of
<hi>Maximinus Caesar,</hi> after the Persian warre, a priuate souldier happened to
finde a purse or sachel set full of <hi>Margarites</hi> and precious stones, which hee
tooke off, contenting himselfe with the beaty of the leather whereof it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17413:17"/>
was made. For indeed garments of cloth and skinnes to keepe out colde
and raine, are onely needfull for souldiers. Yet true it is, that in the time of
the Emperour <hi>Iulianus,</hi> the maners of souldiers were changed. And <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianus</hi>
the yonger, vsed to weare a Iacke of golden maile, after the Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
guise: he also had his Armour and Launce gilded. <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> after a
great victory, suffered his souldiers to become wanton, and called them
companions in Armes, permitting them also to ornifie their weapons
with siluer and gold. And here it shall not be amisse, to tell how great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the Emperour <hi>Aurelianus</hi> had to discipline, notwithstanding the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
he afforded to all men of warre, charging his Captaines to obserue
these instructions: <hi>Sivis Tribunus esse, imò sivis viuere, manus militum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi>
adding these commandements, let no man take away the Pullen of
of another, his sheepe, his oyle, his wood, his grapes, his salt, but rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with his victuall. Let souldiers liue vpon spoyle of the enemie, not
of the countrey. His armes shall be bright, and his garments strong, let
his new apparell supply the old, and his wages remaine in his purse, not in
the Tauerne: let him lay by his chaine and ring, and keep his horse fat. Let
no beast taken be sold, but euery man helpe another. Let the Physicians
cure infirmities freely, and without rewards. Let nothing be giuen to the
soothsayers. Let euery one be quiet in his lodging, for who so moueth any
mutenie or misrule shall be punished. This is in effect the summe of such
precepts as are to be obserued by souldiers: wherby appeareth what they
are to doe, what to leaue vndone, and what garments ancient Emperours
and souldiers were wont to vse. Yet true it is that the hope of all good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
and successe, doth consist in valour, conioyned with policie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

the fortune of warre, and therein also hazarded his owne
life, (falling into the enemies hand) should be depriued
of any priuiledge or profit to him due. The Emperours
<hi>Dioclesianus</hi> and <hi>Maximinianus</hi> commaunded that souldiers
taken by the enemy, and returned home, should be restored to all they lost,
although their goods were seazed and confiscate: yet diligent inquisition
to be made, whether that soldier were remaining with the enemy willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or by force. In this case the opinion of <hi>Adrianus</hi> the Emperour is to be
allowed, saying, A souldier willingly taken and let loose, ought be retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
backe to the enemy: but if he were taken in seruice, and after escaped,
then ought he be restored to his former estate. But thereof good proofe is
to be made, for if before that time he had bene esteemed a faithful souldier,
then some credit ought be giuen him: but if hee were an <hi>Emansor,</hi> a man
negligent, or one that had bene long absent, &amp; after returned, then should
he be little beleeued. The doubt therefore is, whether a souldier thus retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
hath bene a fugitiue or a prisoner. In the one case he shalbe punished,
in the other he ought be restored and receiue his pay with recompence, as
a <hi>veteranus</hi> or old souldier. We conclude therefore that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon souldiers,

might be demanded in the name of the souldier remaining prisoner, if his

and if a souldier together with his father and mother were taken prisoner,
the father and mother dying in prison, the sonne may (by the law <hi>Cornelia</hi>)
challenge their goods and lands. For considering his absence was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Romanes vsed diuers <hi>Especes</hi> or kindes of Cassing, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
one honourable, an other causary, and the third igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious;
which diuers names did proceed from diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
But first is to be considered that the Romane souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
were Legionary and perpetuall, but ours are onely vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
and temporal. Their Legions were continually in being without
discontinuance, euer in exercise, and in time of peace preparing for the
warre. But our bands do assemble extraordinarily and casually when pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill
doeth approch, or when the Prince is pleased vpon any sudden to call
them. And as our souldiers are by vnlooked for occasion assembled, so are
they returned home, so soone as the warre (which was cause of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation)
ceaseth. This is the reason that Cassation, which the Romanes
did accompt dishonorable or infamous, seemeth to vs little or no disgrace
at all. For indeed the Romanes did hold no dismission honourable, vnles
he who was dismissed did depart by licence of the Emperour or Generall,
and that with speciall grace and fauour. The Romane custome was also
such, as no man of Armes was Cassed with honour, vntill he had serued a
horseman tenne yeeres, a footman twenty yeeres, and sea souldiers twenty
fiue yeeres. In the end of which termes, the men of warre were licensed to
depart with commendation: (and for the most part) with recompense of
seruice, to some more, and to some lesse, according to their merits. From
which time forwards they continued or discontinued at their pleasure, or
if they were required to stay in the Legion, the same was by way of intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and no compulsion, and during that abode, to be free from all seruices
and impositions, saue onely to fight with the enemie. Also whensoeuer
those men marched, they followed a particular Banner, purposely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for old souldiers, leauing the Standard ordinary, and the Eagle. And
if they or any of them desired to returne vnto his owne house, they were
permitted so to doe, and receiued diuers priuiledges, confirmed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by <hi>Constantine</hi> the great. Thus much concerning Cassing ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.</p>
                  <p>Touching Cassation causary or reasonable, that was euer in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sicknesse or disability accidentall and vncurable, as if any Souldier
became blinde, or lame: or happened to haue any such impediment as
might make him vnfit for Armes.</p>
                  <p>Cassation ignominious, was for some offence or crime worthy of lesse
punishment then death: and who so was in that sort cassed, might no more
abide in Rome, nor approch the Emperiall Court. By an Edict of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17413:19"/>
a souldier was noted of infamy, if he departed from the Armie, and so
iudged by the commandement of the Emperour or generall Captaine:
and euery souldier so sent away, shalbe iudged infamous, whether he be a
common man, or a particular Captaine, or other inferiour commander.
<hi>Pomponius</hi> addeth, that if a Chieftaine or other officer (although he weare
the ensignes of a Consul) may be cassed with infamie and rest ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
but the sentence of his discharge must be particularly expressed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the iudgement of Ignominie, he that is discharged, shall not be capable
of any office or dignitie. <hi>Traianus</hi> accounted no idle person or other man
noted of ignominie, worthy to enter his court. The Germanes will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
such a one to repaire vnto diuine seruice, to take any pay, to enioy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge,
or haue ought to doe with the sword or other weapon; and neither
they nor their sonnes to haue any immunitie. Likewise a souldier that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
or woundeth himselfe, shalbe guiltie of ignominie. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> cassed
<hi>Caius Amenus</hi> a Tribune of souldiers in the tenth Legion, for inciting the
Romane souldiers to mutiny, and spoile a part of Italy; iudging him to be
ignominious and worthy to be banished. In ages more ancient, persons
condemned for infamie, were also let blood, <hi>nomine poenae.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost sure and certein it seemeth, that for diuision of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
establishment of kingdomes, distinction of Signio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
limitation of lands, and building of houses, the wars
were first deuised: yet is no warre iust vnlesse the same be
maintained by reason: for before Armes are taken in
hand, it behooueth to prooue all other meanes, by curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and humanitie to compasse that which is desired. But because it falleth
out more then often, that the enemie cannot be perswaded by reason, nor
acknowledge to haue done wrong, and most seldome to make voluntary
restitution; no other hope of helpe resteth, then to force and constraine
him. For two wayes there be wherby we are to defend our selues; the one
by reason, which is proper to men; the other by force, which is common
to bruit beasts: So as the first not preuailing, it behooueth to vse the other.
And because man is so farre in loue with his owne affections, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he layeth hold of shadowes in stead of substance, inclining to that which
appeareth, in lieu of that is perfect, and preferreth passion before iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
he thereby becommeth blind, as well in determining publike as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
affaires. Either else through a violent selfeloue, or a certaine insatiable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17413:20"/>
desire to possesse more then commeth to his share, he easily inclineth to
iniurie others, whensoeuer he may be Iudge in his owne cause: So hard a
thing is it for a man to determine between himselfe and others, as though
he were forced either to doe iniustice, or suffer it. Here of it commeth, that
as the fire doth naturally come forth of flints, being beaten one against an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
so the discord of mens affaires encountring, doth occasion so great
troubles as would vtterly ruine all, if by vertue of curtesie and moderation
the sharpnesse of reason were not reabated. Whereunto may be added,
that the successe of warres is euer doubtfull, notwithstanding the greatest
aduantages, and that warre may be begun how and when we will, yet can
it not be ended when and how the vanquisher pleaseth. So seemeth it in all
respects a great simplicity, or rather plaine folly to exchange tranquilitie
for trouble, being thereunto perswaded, by couetous desire or hopes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.
Concluding therefore, I say, that no warre offensiue ought be
enterprised without mature consideration, and for causes iust, not onely in
our owne conceit, but also irreprehensible in the conscience of the enemy.
And so shal euer be, if we do as we would be done vnto, entring into warre
for occasions ordinary, accustomed and receiued of all nations, <hi>viz.</hi> To
recouer those things which are vniustly deteined, and to force the authors
of iniury to be deliuered; if the same were not done by publike counsell
and consent; or for reuenge of iniuries enterprised against vs without
cause, and publikely; or for recouery of passage into forraine countreys,
paying al duties: for by law of Nations, passages ought be open to all men,
so long as the same may be without preiudice, or probable suspition.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O warre can be properly called defensiue, but that onely
which is made for defence of our selues, and to resist forain
inuasions: thereby also to assure, not onely vs and ours, but
also to protect Allies and neighbours vniustly oppressed:
whensoeuer they desire aide against those that wrongfully
and without cause will oppresse them. In all which cases this kind of warre
is iustifiable: because the same is warranted not onely by law of Nations,
but also by Iustice naturall, seeing nothing can be more reasonable and
lawfull then to repulse force with force. For apparant it is that euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vntaught and without instruction, before it hath power to doe any
thing, will endeuour (in some sort) to repulse iniurie and violence, and
consequently saue it selfe. And very naturall it is in all men to be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
when they are of others vnworthily &amp; vnreasonably oppressed, which
is the cause that lawes doe permit that men in their owne defence may kill
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17413:20"/>
those that shall assault them: so as the same be done with moderation, aud
that our perill cannot otherwise be eschewed. But here may be noted the
difference betweene defence and offence. For those whom we haue slaine
in the field and without intermission of time, are properly said to be slaine
in our defence, and is a thing allowable: but they that after the conflict are
killed, cannot be iudged slaine in our defence: because that warre or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
is deemed offensiue, and therefore absolutely forbidden in euery
particular person, and the reuenge thereof appertaineth vnto authoritie
publique: which mooued <hi>Cicero</hi> to say, <hi>Iustum bellum est quibus necessarium,
&amp; pia arma quibus nulla nisi in armis spes relinquitur.</hi> Nowe it resteth to tell
what warre is truely called iust and necessary. We say therefore that warre
to be necessarie when our enemy endeuoureth to take from vs those things
without which we cannot liue, or when they assaile vs with daily and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
incursions. Secondly when they take from vs those things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which we cannot take comfort in our liues: as religion, libertie,
and iustice. Thirdly, when they take from vs those things wherein we haue
our only delight, as our children, our kinsfolke, our friends, our familiars,
and such commodities as we haue long enioyed, and without which, our
breath and being must needes be displeasing. In all which cases, it is more
then necessary for Princes to defend their subiects, and giue vnto al others
their friends and Allies aide, and protection.</p>

ceremonies and rites in confirming and establishing
of peace, truce and leagues, haue bene diuersly vsed.
We reade that the Grecians (after the death of <hi>Cyrus</hi>
the yonger) concluding a peace with <hi>Arieno</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
of certaine barbarous people, vsed these cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.
First they caused a Bull, a Boare, a Wolfe,
and a ramme to be slaine, and laid them vpon a shield:
into the blood of those beasts the Grecians did dip their swords: and then
the Barbarians did put into the same blood their launces, either of them
promising and protesting to obserue fidelitie, friendship and societie.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Hiberia,</hi> to confirme peace betweene them,
consented the thombes of their right handes should be fast tied together,
which done, then either thombe was stricken with a knife, and the blood
comming out, they licked thereof in signe of mutuall loue. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
did euer command that no peace should bee concluded without
consent of the Senate and people. For their custome was, that whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17413:21"/>
peace was to be made, the <hi>Praetor,</hi> the <hi>Consul,</hi> or <hi>Senate,</hi> did deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Foecial</hi> a certaine herbe called <hi>Verbena,</hi> or els grasse pulled vp by the
roote, and therewith some boughes of <hi>Verbena,</hi> together with a flint stone
taken out of the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Feretrius:</hi> which done the <hi>Foecial</hi> caused
a sowe to be brought into the market place, and holding a scepter in his
hand, like vnto <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and couering his head with a cloth, crowned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with a crowne of <hi>Verbena:</hi> Which rites being ended, he obtested and
beseeched <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> and th'other gods, that if any of the parties
did faile to performe the capitulations, that then hee should be striken and
slaine like vnto the sow. After which obtestation her body was cut with
the flint: then they cast vpon it water and fire, and so the sacrifice was fully
solemnized according to the verse of <hi>Virgil,</hi>
                     <q>Antiqui coesa firmabant foedera porca.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Menippus</hi> in his answere to <hi>Quintus Lincius</hi> the Consul, affirmed there
were three kinds of treaties. The first was, where the victorious in warre
did giue Lawes vnto him that was victored: for he who was most potent
in Armes, may euer dispose of all things at his discretion. The second was
when the aduersaries, being of equall force, the peace was concluded <hi>aequo
foedere,</hi> that is with equall conditions, and all things restored as they had
bene taken: and that he whose possession was by warre disturbed, should
be restored. Of this kinde were treaties betweene <hi>Octauius Caesar, Antonius</hi>
and <hi>Pompeius,</hi> and the conditions being signed and sealed were sent vnto
<hi>Rome,</hi> to rest in the custodie of the <hi>Virgins Vestall.</hi> The third kinde of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
is betweene those that neuer were enemies, and notwithstanding do
ioyne in league and amitie. In that case, if any of them were victorious or
victored, yet did they neither giue nor take Law, th'one from th'other.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartarians</hi> concluding any peace or treatie, did sanctifie the same
in this sort. First they caused a Partizan, a sword or other weapon of warre
to be brought, and thereupon they took an oath, which done, they dranke
of the water wherein the Partizan, sword or other weapon was washed,
pronouncing these words, <hi>Quicunque pacta, &amp; fraternitatem violarit, aut
contraeam violandam insurrexerit, vel aliquid intentauerit, àframeis inciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
occidendusque pereat, ac tanquam aqua, defluat, ac euanescat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> confirmed their treaty with great sacraments, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing
to obserue them iustly, simply, without fraud or deceit, and renued
the same yerely. As therefore treaties of this kinde doe binde either
party equally, so are they both equally and lawfully conioyned in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation.</p>
                  <p>Truce is a peace for a short time: to the end the enemie may take breath
and be aduised. <hi>Varro</hi> calleth truce an abstinence of Armes, and as it were
the holydayes of warre. For albeit the fight ceaseth, yet the warre conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth.
The terme of truce is neither more nor lesse, but as the enemies
shall agree. <hi>Lucius Pontius</hi> Generall of the Samnits, desired a truce for sixe
houres onely. The second truce betweene the Romanes and the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians
was to continue for fifty yeeres. The Vients also obteined a truce
of the Romanes for an hundreth yeeres. The first truce whereof we reade,
was taken in the reigne of <hi>Romulus</hi> when then Sabins made warre vpon the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17413:21"/>
Romanes vnder <hi>Titus Tacius</hi> their king. In which expedition certaine La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of <hi>Rome</hi> were imployed and conducted by <hi>Hersilia,</hi> whose perswasion
preuailed with those kings. The nature of truce is such, as during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
thereof, the enemies (without offending) may meete and speake
together. It is also lawfull for euery souldier (during that terme) to goe
and returne safe at his pleasure. But here is to be noted, that euery Treatie
as well of truce, as peace, ought be faithfull and sincere: and therefore I
much disallow <hi>Cleomenes</hi> king of <hi>Lacedaemon,</hi> who hauing concluded a
truce for an hundred and thirty daies, did neuerthelesse (in the night) spoile
the enemies countrey, alleaging the truce was made for dayes, but not
for nights; which crafty construction ought be misliked. Howsoeuer that
were, sure it is that no matter of State is of more difficultie, then the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Treaties, and leagues betweene Princes and common weales, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
friends or enemies, newters or subiects. For some require onely mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
protestation or oath, others demand ostages: some would be posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of townes and strong places, and others would haue the enemy vtterly
disarmed; Yet experience hath proued that league to be best, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
by alliance and consanguinitie. But this subiect ought be discoursed
by doctors and expert polititians.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N certaine causes, and for some reasons, Captaines Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and other Commanders in the warre, were wont to
grant License vnto their souldiers to be absent from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
or other places of seruice, with allowance of time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,
for their going and returne. Yet true it is, that such
Licenses ought not to be giuen without earnest occasion, and for good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
whereunto we will adde, that meet it is, that not onely souldiers, but
also horses ought to be restrained, and seldome suffered to passe out of the
Armie. Neither ought any horse of seruice be employed in hunting, hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or other needlesse exercise: for so was it decreed in the discipline of
<hi>Augustus.</hi> The Emperours <hi>Archadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> commanded all Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and Commanders to be warie in giuing License to souldiers, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when the enemie is at hand, or when hee maketh incursion: for at such
times to giue License was accompted capital: or if any souldier did absent
himselfe from his Ensigne without leaue, that crime was also punished by
death. Licenses are therefore to be rarely granted, and for necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.
Yet no License may be denied, when vrgent occasion so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth:
which error <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the <hi>Decemuir</hi> incurred, when by his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17413:22"/>
letters he required that <hi>Luctus Virginius</hi> might not be suffered to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Rome:</hi> fearing he would accuse him for the rauishing his daughter: but
by good hap <hi>Virginius</hi> departed from the Armie one day before the letter
arriued there. Howsoeuer that were, yet true it is, that no souldier of anie
Armie well gouerned, ought demand Pasport or License to depart at any
vnseasonable time, neither should any Captain condescend to license him:
which moued <hi>Hannibal</hi> after the taking of <hi>Saguntum</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to proclaim
that euery souldier occasioned to goe vnto his countrey or friends, ought
before he went to desire license. Likewise by an Edict of <hi>Francis</hi> the French
king all souldiers were inhibited to goe from the Armie without License.
It was also the Romane vse, that euery souldier did aske leaue of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and the Captaine to haue License of the Generall of horse, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
general, before he departed from the Armie: also during his absence
to leaue a sufficient man to supplie the place, and he himselfe to returne at
the time prefixed: which done he receiued his whole pay without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as though hee had neuer bene absent. As touching the limitation
of time, and the number of souldiers who were licensed to be absent, we
reade that <hi>Scipio</hi> in the warre of <hi>Carthage</hi> gaue license vnto three hundred
Sicilian souldiers, and put three hundred other men to serue in their places:
and <hi>Francis</hi> the French king commanded, that more then thirty horsemen
should not be licensed to go from the Armie at one time: and they not to
be absent longer then three moneths, vpon paine to be checked of their
whole wages. <hi>William Rufus</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> did inhibit souldiers and all
other subiects of reputation to depart the land without leaue, which is yet
obserued.<note place="margin">It seemeth by <hi>Pol. Virg.</hi> that rather the hand of God, then the King punished this attempt: for he was there slaine in the battell.</note> And <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> writeth that one <hi>Edward Wooduile</hi> (chiefe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
of the <hi>Isle of Wight</hi>) for going forth of the Realme without license
was put to death vnder King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth. But <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperour
(punishing that offence more mildely) ordained, that if any souldier were
absent one whole yere without license, he should be put after tenne; if he
were absent two yeres, he should giue place to twenty; if three yeres, then
to be vtterly discharged from the Armie at his returne thither. <hi>Theodosius</hi>
and <hi>Valentinianus</hi> in that case, would not vtterly discharge them the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
vntill foure yeeres absence was complete. If any souldier were sent
vnto a Prince to performe any seruice, and at his returne did signifie such
employment, together with his diligence to returne, in that case he ought
be excused, because his absence was by commandement, and in seruice of
the State, not for his owne profit or priuate commoditie. But who so for

both honourable and sacred, including as well power
of commandement, as dignitie. Whensoeuer therfore any
Ambassadour did come to Rome, he was first brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Temple of <hi>Saturnus,</hi> there to haue his name written
before the <hi>Praefectiaerarij:</hi> from thence he went to deliuer his legation vnto
the Senate. But first it ought be remembred, that men meetest to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
for Ambassadours, are they indeed who are of most sagacitie and
greatest skill how to discouer the counsels and designes of the enemy. <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio
Africanus</hi> hauing occasion to send an ambassage to <hi>Syphax,</hi> elected cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Tribunes and Centurions, and caused them to be basely apparelled.
<hi>Cato</hi> beholding certaine Ambassadors to be sent by the Senate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
a peace betweene <hi>Nicomedes</hi> and <hi>Prusias,</hi> the one of them had his
headfull of skarres, the second was impotent of his feet, &amp; the third timer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
said, This Legation hath neither good head, feet, nor heart. Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
ought be in all countreys inuiolable: in signe whereof they anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
caried about them the herbe <hi>Sagmen,</hi> which we call <hi>Veruen,</hi> to shewe
they were sacred, and that no man should dare to lay hold on them; &amp; who
so offred them violence, was thought to haue done contrary to law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Which moued <hi>Publius Mutius</hi> to command, that whosoeuer did strike
an Ambassadour, should be deliuered vnto that enemy from whome the
Ambassadour was sent. And though the enemy receiued him not, yet
should he remaine an exile, as if he were interdicted from fire and water,
according to the sentence of <hi>Publius Mutius.</hi> Yet doe we read, that <hi>Diosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides</hi>
and <hi>Scrapion</hi> Ambassadors sent from <hi>Caesar</hi> to <hi>Achillas,</hi> so soone as they
came within his sight, and before he heard them, or for what affaires they
were sent, commanded them to be taken and slaine. <hi>Caesar</hi> likewise sent
<hi>Marcus Valerius Porcillus</hi> vnto king <hi>Ariouistus,</hi> who being there arriued, was
presently taken and put into prison, notwithstanding he were a young man
of great vertue and curtesie. Likewise <hi>Comius Attrebas</hi> being sent by <hi>Caesar</hi>
into Britane, was cast into prison by the Britanes. <hi>Laërtes Tolumnius</hi> king

long in the market place. Such honour the Romanes vsed to giue
vnto those men that dyed for their country. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great besieging
a Citie called Tyrus, sent Ambassadours vnto the inhabitants thereof, who
contrary to the lawe of Nations, slewe them, and from an high tower cast

that are thus taken, were by the Romanes called <hi>Serui, quod
seruantur:</hi> as much to say, as being taken, they ought be kept,
not killed: whereof may bee inferred, it is vnlawfull to kill a man hauing
yeelded himselfe: because that acte is inhumane, and all great Captaines
haue forbidden it, according to the saying of <hi>Horace, Vendere cum possis cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuum
occidere noli.</hi> Herein also wee are to follow the example of ancient
Princes and chiefe commanders in warre. <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great tooke to
wife <hi>Roxanes</hi> whom he had taken prisoner in the warre. <hi>Henry</hi> the seuenth
king of England hauing taken <hi>Lambert</hi> a king of Ireland together with his
schoolemaster, pardoned both their liues; the one because he was a childe,
the other a person Ecclesiasticall and dedicated to God: so sayth <hi>Polydor
Virgil. Romulus</hi> made a law, that cities taken by warre should not be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demolished, nor all beasts in the field slaine: but setling there certaine
Colonies, they did participate of the commodities with the naturall peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Yet true it is, that some conquerors haue anciently vsed great crueltie.
For reade wee may, that the Africans caused many Cathaginians their
prisoners, together with their Captaine <hi>Gestones,</hi> to haue their hands cut
off and their legs broken with a wheele. Likewise <hi>Hasdrubal</hi> after <hi>Megarae</hi>
was recouered from the Romanes, caused their eyes, their tongues, &amp; secret
parts to be torne with yron hookes: he also cut off their fingers and flayed
their bodies; and before they were dead, hung them vpon the walles. We
may also here remember the terrible custome of the <hi>Thuliti,</hi> who vsed to
sacrifice the bodies of men taken in warre, as an oblation to the gods most
acceptable. Howsoeuer these people handled the matter, it is, no doubt,
lawfull for men that are victorious, peaceably to rule and command those
that are victored. And <hi>Ariouistus</hi> answering <hi>Caesar,</hi> sayd, that the people of
Rome vsed to command nations conquered, according to their owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
not the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of an enemy, becommeth his captiue: neither can he be owner of any thing
when he himselfe is possessed by another. This only remaineth, that in him
there resteth a right and title to his owne, notwithstanding possession be
lost. Here we may also remember, that all places taken by the enemy, doe
cease to be sacred or religious, yet being deliuered from that calamity, they
returne to their former estate <hi>Iure postliminio.</hi> Therefore seeing the graues
of the enemy are not to vs sacred, the violation of them do beare no action.</p>

he ought not remaine prisoner to the rescuers,
but shall forthwith be restored to liberty, and enioy
his former estate: for souldiers must be defenders
of fellowes in Armes, not their masters. Likewise
if any stranger do redeeme a prisoner from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
the souldier redeemed shall not be accounted
the strangers prisoner, but remaine with him as a
pledge vntill the ransome be paid: for so was it decreed by <hi>Gordianus</hi> the
Emperour. If a woman prisoner be redeemed from the enemy, and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with him that redeemeth her, in that case, she and her children shall be
discharged, both of bondage and paiment of money. If any man shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
a prisoner taken by the enemy, the prisoner is forthwith at liberty,
and the redeemer shall be compelled to accept the price offered, without
further question. If a man contracteth marriage with a woman his priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
hee shall be iudged to haue forgiuen her ransome. Yet if a dishonest
woman redeeme her daughter from the enemie, and (knowing her to be
honest) shall deliuer her to be dishonoured, and the daughter (to preserue
her chastity) fleeth to her father: in that case the mother maketh her selfe
vnworthy to receiue the prize, in respect of her lewd intention, and the
daughter shalbe restored freely to her liberty. This is also a rule generall,
that a freeman taken by the enemy and redeemed, so soone as his ransome
be paid, or his body by other meane set at liberty, he thereby recouereth his
former estate, in the meane space although the ransome is not fully satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
yet may he challenge his right of succession, so as thereby hee shall
in time be able to discharge the debt. Moreouer, if he who redeemeth a
prisoner, shall remit the bondage of his pawne, yet is not the redeemed at
libertie, from his redeemer, albeit he be restored to that freedome which
formerly he had lost: but hee shall not be compelled to doe seruice vnto
the children of the redeemer. The first beginning to giue ransome for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
of captiue Souldiers was after the defeate of <hi>Canna,</hi> at which
time <hi>Hannibal</hi> did grant leaue that the Romanes might ransome them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
The price then of a horseman was fiue hundred pieces of money,
a footman three hundred, and for a seruant one hundred. And if any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
or other goods were left <hi>in deposito,</hi> or giuen to redeeme a captiue,
they might be lawfully demanded during an hundred yeeres after. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought it be thought strange that a part or an whole inheritance belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
vnto a captiue, and left vnto persons vnknowne, ought be bestowed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17413:24"/>
to redeeme him. For heretofore the Emperours, moued with pitie and
compassion of poore Souldiers misaduentures, haue by Law decreed that
an whole inheritance may be giuen to ransome captiues: because nothing
should be withholden from redeeming men that haue endured the fortune
of warre in defence of our countrey.</p>

                  <p>The people that moued warre against the Romanes, were euer thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
mooued, either by ambition, as the <hi>Parthians,</hi> or by desire of libertie as
the <hi>Germans,</hi> by whom at length the Romane Empire was subuerted. The
<hi>Athenians</hi> vsed to contend with some enemies for victory: but with the
<hi>Barbarians</hi> they fought vntill death, because they were reputed their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemies, to whom if any man did giue aide, or meanes to spoyle the
countrey, he was burned aliue: if he sold any port or hauen, he deserued
losse of life: and he that furnished the enemy with hay or come, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
capitally punished. The Romanes would not receiue conditions
from any enemy being in Armes: because (as <hi>Quintus Cicero</hi> said) an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
ought with hands and feete to be repulsed. In <hi>Macedon</hi> a Law there
was that whosoeuer did returne from the warre, and had not slaine an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
should be strangled with a cord. The <hi>Scythians</hi> had an vse, that at so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
feastes, no man should drinke of the great cup which was caried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
vnlesse he had slaine an enemy. The <hi>Iberi</hi> had a custome to set about
the tombe of euery dead man, so many <hi>Pyramids,</hi> as he had slaine enemies.
The <hi>Persians</hi> made a Law, that <hi>Explorators</hi> and spies, in consideration of the
dangers they indured, should be mainteined by publique contribution.
And albeit the hate which enemies haue one towards the other be great,
yet the <hi>Indians</hi> in time of warre, did refraine to vse force against Plowmen,
or molest them, being reputed ministers of common vtility. <hi>Pomponius</hi>
writeth, that in <hi>Rome</hi> it was not lawfull for any man to passe out of the City
by other way then the gates: for otherwise doing he should be reputed an

when he climed vpon the wall: yet was hee no enemy. Howsoeuer that
was, <hi>Martianus</hi> affirmeth resolutely, that wheresoeuer a fugetiue is found,
there may he lawfully be killed as an enemy: yet is he not so called.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit vnfit it were, that souldiers discontinuing the warre,
whom we formerly called <hi>Emansores,</hi> or other men newly
entred into that profession should be protected or excused
from payment of debts, or otherwise priuiledged, yet meet
it is, that men of long and loyall seruice should be in some
sort borne with, and fauoured. In that case therefore diuers immunities
haue bene anciently granted vnto souldiers of great seruice or good merit,
as appeareth by diuers decrees made by the Emperours <hi>Seuerus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus,</hi>
who dispensed with an execution awarded against one man called
<hi>Marcellus,</hi> commanding that his pay should not be arested to the vse of his
creditors: if other meane of satisfaction might be found. Because the law
compelleth souldiers to pay only so much as they are able, yet that fauour
extendeth not to all men professing armes, but those in particular, that
haue serued long, and for such debtes as they incurred, during the time
they continued in the warre. Here is it also to be remembred, that no gift
bestowed for seruice, may be vpon any priuate contract, impawned. For
if the creditor can be otherwise satisfied, then the law determineth no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
shall be taken vpon gifts or goods bestowed for seruice, anciently
reputed sacred: which reason mooued the most Christian king <hi>Francis</hi> to
make an Edict, whereby he commanded, that vnto such souldiers as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
money, victuall should be sold in credit: but, if after a conuenient time
that debt were not payd, then the Treasorer should make stay of the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
pay, and deliuer it vnto the creditor. Likewise <hi>Charles</hi> the seuenth
did forbid, that the Armes of souldiers should be sold to satisfie creditors.
The law of <hi>Graecia</hi> did also inhibit the taking of Armes for satisfaction of
debt: yet by the same law power is permitted vnto creditors to arrest any
souldiers person that is indebted. The same lawe likewise commaundeth
that no artificer appertaining to the warre, should be personally impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for money, yet was it lawfull to extend his goods. <hi>Solon</hi> in his law cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Sisacthia</hi> made for the Athenians, seemeth to thinke it vnreasonable,
that the body of any Citizen should be imprisoned vpon debt due for vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Summarily therefore we say, That souldiers are bound to pay so much
as they are able, and no more: which happily mooued <hi>Tertullianus</hi> to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
that who so hath possession of any stocke of goods (chiefly appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
vnto the warre) he may be forced to pay vnto his creditors, so much
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17413:25"/>
as is properly his owne, but not take any thing belonging vnto the State:
neither is it lawfull for the father to sell the lands or goods entayled or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured

other chiefe Commanders.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N <hi>Athens</hi> a man called <hi>Dionysiodorus</hi> did take vpon him to
reade an art of conducting and trayning souldiers, which
skill albeit he had knowen, yet could he not enforme any of
his auditory how to become a good Commander: because
the leading of men is indeede the least part of Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For it behoueth a Generall not only to conduct an armie, but also to
prouide things needfull both for the warre, and mainteining of men. A
carefull chieftaine therefore is to shew himselfe patient, prudent, cautious,
liberall, and such a one as loueth more to giue then to keepe. <hi>Homer</hi> vsed
to call <hi>Agamemnon</hi> a Pastor of people, because he carefully intended the
safety of his Army. <hi>Antonius</hi> for many qualities no commendable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
yet in one point much to be praised, because he liked better to be
called a companion of armes, then a Prince. He also sometimes vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
to march on foot, and in his owne hand carry the generall ensigne of
the armie, which was of great poyze, and not to be borne of the strongest
souldiers, without much paine. <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperor did not command
the meanest souldier to do any thing, but that he himselfe would sometimes
doe: wherein he performed the part of a stout souldier, and an excellent
chiefetaine: which example percase mooued ancient men of warre (after
victory) to elect their Emperour, out of the number of notable souldiers:
for so it seemeth <hi>Germanicus</hi> was aduanced. We likewise reade that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
was pleased to consent that <hi>Blesus</hi> should be called of the Legions
<hi>Imperator,</hi> for that was the ancient title due to Commanders generall. The
historie of <hi>Maximinus</hi> sheweth, that he became preferred by the warre,
being borne of obscure parents in <hi>Thracia,</hi> and (as some write) the sonne
of a shepheard. Yet because he was a man of great fortune, courage and
strength, by the degrees of warre he aspired to gouerne many Countreys.
After that time, he became Liuetenant generall vnto <hi>Alexander:</hi> and in
the end, by the Romane armie chosen Emperour. Thus much concerning
generall Commanders, aduanced for proper vertue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> in his common weale, wisheth a Chiefetaine to be elected in this
sort; A General of horse (saith he) ought be made by consent of the whole
Armie. The <hi>Praefecti</hi> whom we call great commanders, were elected by
those souldiers that bare targets: The <hi>Tribunimilitum</hi> had their aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17413:25"/>
by voice of men at armes: and other Captains of meaner place were
appointed by the chiefe General. The horsemen did euer giue their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
first, in presence of the foot bands, and two of them that gained most
voices, were appointed to commaund the rest. The Captaines also did
name him for Emperour, that was in seruice most painefull, in perill most
resolute, in action most industrious, in execution most quicke, and in
counsell most prouident. In this election no respect was had, whether
the person elected were a Senator, or recommended by the Senate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the qualities aforesayd sufficed to make a Generall, as appeared in
<hi>Maximinus</hi> the Emperour: in whose election the Senate did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle.
That General therefore seemeth of most sufficiencie, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
(as a souldier) how to offend his enemie, gouerne his owne forces, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
heate and cold, sleepe on the ground, patiently suffer both labour
and lacke. For sometimes we see, that he who hath authority to command,
needeth another to command him. Some others also are called to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
and command in the warre, before they haue skill how to doe it, or
haue read any precepts military, or are by the rules of predecessors enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
For a matter of more difficultie it is to know what appertaineth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Captaine, then to execute the office of that place, seeing skill must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede
action, and vse goe before commandement. In this point we haue
heard <hi>Francis</hi> the French king much commended, who kept in memorie
the historie of all his predecessors: and to witnesse his proper valor, at the
battel of <hi>Pauia</hi> (wherin albeit he was vnfortunate) yet with his owne hand
he slew a German Ensignebearer, to his eternall glory. It seemeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
expedient, for all Princes and commanders in warre, to be well studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in histories, and chiefly those that concerne the actions of their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors;
which perhaps moued <hi>Edward</hi> the third, king of <hi>England,</hi> at such
time as he made warre vpon <hi>Robert</hi> the second, king of Scots, to command
a certaine Monke to attend his Maiestie in that expedition, and with his
penne to expresse in verse (being indeed an excellent Poet) all the actions
and proceedings of that enterprise. <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second, king of <hi>Turkie,</hi>
endeuoured much to know the histories of his predecessors, and gaue
bountifull rewards vnto one writer called <hi>Iohn Maria</hi> of <hi>Vincenza,</hi> for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
the victorie he obtained against <hi>Vssancassan</hi> king of <hi>Persia,</hi> as <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus
Iouius</hi> noteth: much more praise and honour is due vnto those Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
that haue by long seruice and due degrees of warre deserued the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
appertaining to armes, and beare about them the scarres and tokens of
true valour. <hi>Adrianus</hi> the Emperour would not permit any man to bee a
<hi>Tribune,</hi> or take charge in the warre, whose beard was not full growen, or
whose witte or yeres were vncapable of that office: neither would he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a Captaine to take any thing from his souldier.</p>
                  <p>Among many other parts of commendation required in a soueraigne
commander, there is not any more to bee honoured then liberalitie: and
contrariwise auarice ought to be extreamely abhorted. For hard it is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the affaires of warre, and ouer much to affect money. Great reason
therefore had <hi>Nicomedes</hi> to thinke himselfe vsed with indignitie by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynians,
when he hauing borne all the offices of warre, and was wounded
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17413:26"/>
in many places of his body, was then repulsed. All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
<hi>Antisthenes</hi> was preferred, and made General, when hee had
neuer performed any action praise worthy or memorable, nor had ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured
more then to make himselfe mighty in mony: yet is not that Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to be misliked, that can with honour and good conscience purchase
wealth, for thereby he hath meane and power to supply the wants, both of
priuate souldiers, and publique scarcitie. The office of a souereigne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
may be compared vnto the skill of him that gouerneth well a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
house: which is to command things fit, to make men obedient, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the good and punish the euill. In which offices, the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these commanders shall not faile to finde enemies, and therefore
may be called a warre. Here may we also remember that the <hi>Mauritanes</hi>
being confederate with <hi>Iustinianus</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> consented that no man
should be their Generall, but such a one as was a friend vnto the Romanes,
or had receiued the Ensignes from a commander of the Romane armie,
which were these: <hi>A staffe of siluer gilded: a cuppe of leather ornified with sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
and a white vesture of small price.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Romanes called these officers <hi>Magistri militum,</hi> or <hi>Praefecti,</hi> when
they were sent to gouerne an army against the enemy, or to giue counsell
in the warre, or had in charge to dispose of the campe: for so was it decreed
by <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> Sometimes also their lieutenants were called
<hi>Praefecti,</hi> hauing in charge the defence of a particular prouince against the
enemie, and were in authoritie equall to him that led the army called <hi>Dux,</hi>
and before the Proconsul. To this dignity, <hi>Cabades</hi> being restored vnto the
kingdome of Persia, preferred <hi>Selanem</hi> a man of great fame and reputation
in the warre, and therefore called him <hi>Seosen,</hi> which is the title of that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
who commandeth all sorts of souldiers, as the Constable doeth in
France, and the High Marshall in England. The office of the Tribunes in
Rome, was, to hold the soldiers in order, to see them trained, to keepe the
keyes of gates, to suruey the watch, to dispose of the vittaile, to correct false
measures, to punish offenders according to the quality of their faults, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
often the order of the army, to here the quarels in question betweene
souldiers, and to visit the sicke. For in deed the office of euery commander
consisteth in doing iustice and obseruation of discipline. He is also to be
spare in giuing licence vnto Souldiers, or to permit any horses to passe
out of his countrey, neither should he suffer them to be employed in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
hauking, or such like exercises, a matter specially inhibited by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of <hi>Augustus.</hi> A soueraigne Magistrate militarie, ought also to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that after his commission be expired, he ought not to depart the
place of his charge, within the space of fiftie dayes: for so doing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
licence of his superior, he incurreth an offence capital: such
was the instruction which <hi>Zeno</hi> the Emperor did giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Sebastianus,</hi> notwithstanding his authority was
ceassed, and a successor come to receiue
charge of the Armie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Orasmuch as the Actions of Armes
(chiefly on horsebacke) are, and euer
haue been vsed of Noble personages,
and Gentlemen of best quailitie, whom
the Romanes in their flourishing time
by a generall tearme called <hi>Equites,</hi>
and are presently of the Italians and
Spaniards named <hi>Caualieri,</hi> without
respect of priuate dignitie, or other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction:
wee will for this time (yet
with respect, and vnder correction) aduenture to English the word <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi>
a Gentleman that professeth honour, vertue, and Armes, or any
of them: particularly discoursing of what qualitie hee ought bee, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>First, he must be of good constitution and conuenient strength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
trauell in Actions appertaining to Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he should be well fauoured of face and comely: for common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God and Nature giueth beauty to such persons as are destined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and from others borne to obey, hee hath withholden that fauour,
which moued some writers to affirme, that the princely presence of <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
did shew him to be worthy of gouernement, and to commaund o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, hee should be of bold aspect, rather inclined to seuerity then
softnesse: which countenace the Swisses and Turkes do much affect.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, hee must be sober, and discreete, not inclined to vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
or effeminate pleasures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:17413:28"/>
Fiftly, hee ought bee obedient: for of obedience proceedeth that the
meaner are content to bee commanded by the better, and the ignorant
by those that know. This vertue was greatly imbraced of the Romanes,
and occasioned their often victories. For the punishment of disobedience
inflicted by military Magistrates, the Romanes haue left two most nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
examples: the one of <hi>Manlius Torquatus,</hi> who caused his owne
sonne, for that fault to be slaine, notwithstanding he had vanquished the
enemie: The other of <hi>Papirius</hi> the Dictator, who for the like offence
was punished by <hi>Fabius Rutilius</hi> General of the horsemen in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Armie.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, hee ought hee vigilant, and patient: for in the one consisteth
the execution of warlike Actions: by the other all trauailes, paines, and
misfortunes are endured.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, he must be faithfull and loyall, which qualitie is required in
all sorts of subiects, but chiefly in souldiers: for thereupon dependeth his
Princes securitie, and State also, which moued <hi>Vegetius</hi> to say, That the
safety of a Prince consisteth in the well chusing his souldiers. This is the
cause, that men professing Armes, doe commonly sweare by the faith of a
Souldier: The French man, <hi>a foy de Soldat:</hi> The Italian, <hi>a fe di
Soldato &amp;c.</hi> Yea the Kings of <hi>France</hi> doe commonly vse this phrase,
<hi>a foy de gentil homme: a foy du cheualier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eightly, he ought be constant and resolute, because resolution maketh
all difficulties easie, and constancie or perseuerance bringeth perfection in
that he professeth.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, that he should be charitable, because warres are not taken in
hand for the destruction of Countries, and towns, but the defence of lawes
and people.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he should bee fortunate, sith Fortune is the Ladie of Armes,
and sheweth her power in nothing more then in the aduentures of
warre.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ho so desireth to knowe the originall name
and dignitie of Knighthood, it behooueth
him to be enformed, that the Romanes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom Martiall discipline was first
esteemed, and titles giuen to men for valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
merit, diuided their people into <hi>Patritij</hi>
and <hi>Plebaei.</hi> After that time, another diuision
was made, as <hi>Senatores, Equites,</hi> and <hi>Plebs:</hi> as
the French haue at this day <hi>Les Nobles &amp; la
populaire,</hi> or <hi>Gentils hommes &amp; villains.</hi> And
we in England doe diuide our men into fiue
sorts: Gentlemen, Citizens, Yeomen, Artificers, and Labourers. Of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
the first and principal is the King, Prince, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls,
Vicounts, and Barons. These are the Nobilitie, and be called Lords, or
Noblemen. Next to these be Knights, Esquiers, and simple Gentlemen,
which last number may be called <hi>Nobilitas minor:</hi> for they in Parliament
haue no place among the Lords; therefore the Barons or degree of Lords
doe resemble the dignity of <hi>Senatores</hi> in Rome, and the title of our Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
is like vnto <hi>Patritij,</hi> when the <hi>Patritij</hi> did signifie <hi>Senatores aut Senato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
filij.</hi> But that degree which we doe now call Knighthood, is most like
vnto the title in <hi>Rome</hi> named <hi>Equestris ordo.</hi> Yet other opinions there are,
both of the beginning and name of Knight, as well among the Italians as
the Spaniards. But howsoeuer it was, most certaine it seemeth, that vntill
<hi>Equestris ordo</hi> was erected in <hi>Rome,</hi> there was no such degree of men as we
call Knights, neither was that name giuen with such ceremony and shewe
of dignitie, as since it hath beene vsed. Yet some there are that faile not to
affirme, that Knighthood had the originall from <hi>Romulus,</hi> in this sort.</p>
                  <p>That King hauing set led his gouernment in <hi>Rome,</hi> partly for security, and
partly for magnificence erected three bands of horsemen; the first called
<hi>Romence</hi> after his owne name, the next <hi>Titience</hi> after <hi>Titus Tacius,</hi> and the
third <hi>Luceria,</hi> whereof only I thinke <hi>Liuie</hi> maketh mention. Hereupon they
will inferre, that Knighthood begun vnder <hi>Romulus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spaniards doe hold opinion, that when faith and plaine dealing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed,
those men that made profession of warre, euery thousand did chuse
one man whom they thought to be of greatest wisdome, courage, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie
among the rest. That being done, they made choise of such an horse
as was reputed to excell the rest, for beautie, force, and other perfections,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17413:29"/>
and forthwith gaue that beast vnto that man whome they had chosen: as
though their intention were to conioyne that singular beast vnto that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
man: naming him <hi>Caualiero,</hi> which signifieth Horseman, though we
improperly English it Knight.</p>
                  <p>Thus much is said in generall concerning gentlemen that make profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Armes, whom the Romanes (as it seemeth) sometimes called <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and some other times <hi>Equites:</hi> the Italians and Spaniards <hi>Caualieri,</hi> the
French <hi>Cheualiers:</hi> but in our language (as is now vsed) none are called
Knights, but only they that haue that title giuen by the Prince or his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
with a ceremony thereunto belonging. And of Knights made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the vse of England, are diuers degrees, as shall hereafter bee

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is affirmed by some writers, that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great
with the aduise of his learned tutor <hi>Aristotle,</hi> resolued to
bestow vpon such persons as performed any notable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
in the warre, certaine honours and aduancements, in
token of their extraordinary vertue and notable merit: and
therefore he gaue vnto some badges, to some chaines, to some immunities,
or some such other demonstration of fauour and honour.</p>
                  <p>The Romane Emperours in like manner sometimes before the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a seruice, and sometimes after, bestowed not only commendation,
but also dignity on those whose vertue they thought so worthy: as crowns
of Bayes, of Golde, of Myrtle, or some other gift thought fit by the giuer.
They gaue also horses, swords, armour, arming coats, and such like: &amp; they
that receiued them as a token of honour, kept them carefully in perpetuall
memory of their valour, and the honour of the Prince that gaue them. By
this meane also they became much admired and esteemed of other soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, for more encouragement of vertuous minds, other Princes
thought good that the memorable acts of soldiers should be in perpetuall
memory written, and such priuiledges as were giuen them to be recorded,
calling them in those writings, Valiant men, Companions in Arms, Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
souldiers and Knights. Which maner of proceeding did encourage
the men of warre, no lesse then the great pou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Touching the making of Knights, we say, That euery Prince souereigne
hath power to giue that dignitie to what person it pleaseth him, as well in
time of peace as warre. But here is to be noted, that the Knights made, are
of more or lesse reputation according to the qualitie of that Prince that
made them. For he that is made knight by a King, shall be preferred before
a knight made by a Prince of meaner title. To conclude therefore we say,
that all Emperours, Kings, Dukes and other Princes acknowledging no
Superiour, may make Knights, and so may common-weales, as the State
of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi> The Popes doe also sometimes make Knights for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney:
calling them commonly after their owne names: <hi>Caualieri di San Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro,
San Paulo, Guiliani, Pij. &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that age, a Prince determining to make a Knight, did
command a Scaffold or Stage to be builded in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
Church of his kingdome, or other spacious place
neere vnto it. Thither the Gentleman was brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
that honour: and being come, was forthwith placed
in a chaire of siluer, adorned with greene silke. Then was demaunded of
him if he were healthy of bodie, and able to endure the trauell required in
a souldier: also whether he were a man of honest conuersation, and what
witnesses worthy credit he could produce so to affirme. That being done,
the Bishop or chiefe Prelate of the Church tooke the Bible, and holding it
open before the Knight, in presence of the King and all others spake these
words: Sir, you that desire to receiue the order of Knighthood, sweare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, and by this holy booke, that ye shal not fight against this mightie
and excellent Prince that now bestoweth the order of Knighthood vpon
you, vnlesse you shall be commanded so to do, in the seruice of your owne
King and naturall Prince: for in that case, hauing first yeelded vp the coller,
deuice and other ensignes of honour now receiued, it shall be lawfull for
you to serue against him, without reproch, or offence to all other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in Armes: but otherwise doing, ye shall incurre infamy, and being
taken in warre, shall be subiect to the paines of death. Ye shall also sweare
with all your force and power to maintaine and defend all Ladies, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
Orphans, Widdowes, women distressed and abandoned. The
like must ye doe for wiues, being desired, and shun no aduenture of your
person, in euery good warre wherein ye happen to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:17413:30"/>
This oath taken, two of the chiefe Lords led him vnto the King, who
presently drew foorth his sword and layd the same vpon the Gentlemans
head, and said, God and Saint <hi>George</hi> (or what other Saint the King plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to name) make thee a good Knight. Then came vnto the Knight, seuen
noble Ladies, attired in white, and girt a sword vnto his side.</p>
                  <p>That done, foure Knights of the most honourable in that presence put
on his spurs.</p>
                  <p>These Ceremonies past, the Queene tooke him by the right arme, and
a Dutchesse by the left, and led him vnto a rich seat made on high, and
thereupon set him, the King sitting downe on the right hande, and the
Queene on the other.</p>
                  <p>After the King and Queene were thus set, and the new Knight between
them, al the rest of the Lords and Ladies sate downe also vpon other seats
prepared for them, three descents vnder the kings seat.</p>
                  <p>Euery Lord and Lady being thus placed, thither was brought a solemn
collation or banquet of delicate meates, whereof the Knight, the King, the
Queene, and whole company did eate. And so the ceremony ended.</p>

offensiue as defensiue, which one after another were thrown to the ground:
and at the instant when any peece of armour was cast downe, the King of
Armes first, and after him all other Heralds cryed aloud, saying, this is the
head-peece of a disloyall and miscreant Knight. Then was brought thither
a basen of golde or siluer full of warme water: which being holden vp, the
Heralds with a loud voice saide, What is the Knights name? The Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17413:30"/>
answered that which in trueth was his name. Then the chiefe King
of Armes said, That is not true, for he is a miscreant and false traitour, and
hath transgressed the ordinances of Knighthood. Thereunto answered
the Chaplains, Let vs giue him his right name. Then spake the Trumpets,
What shall be done with him? To which wordes the King answered, Let
him with dishonour and shame be banished my kingdome as a vile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
man that hath offended the honour of Knighthood. So soone as
the King had so said, the King of Armes and other Heralds cast the warme
water vpon the disgraded Knights face, as though he were new baptized,
saying, Henceforth thou shalt be called by thy right name, Traitour. Then
the King with twelue other Knights put vpon them mourning garments,
declaring sorow: and comming vnto the Knight disgraded, put him downe
the Stage, not by the stayers hee mounted vp when he was made Knight,
but threwe him downe tyed vnto a rope. Then with great ignominy hee
was brought vnto the Altar, and there layd groueling on the ground, and
ouer him was read a Psalme full of curses.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the yeere of Christ 490. there raigned in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(then called <hi>Britaine</hi>) a King named <hi>Arthur,</hi>
whose valour was so great, and admirable, as many
men now liuing, doe hold the same rather fabulous
then credible. Yet whoso shall consider enterprises
of later time atchieued by priuate persons, may be
easily induced to thinke that a great part of praise
written of that mighty Monarche, may reasonably
receiue beleefe. But omitting to speake of his prowesse (percase already
by others ouerlargely discoursed) I say that this most famous King hauing
expulsed out of <hi>England</hi> the <hi>Saxons,</hi> conquered <hi>Norway, Scotland,</hi> and the
most part of <hi>France,</hi> was crowned in the Citie of <hi>Paris.</hi> From whence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned,
he erected a certaine Association or brotherhood of Knights: who
vowed to obserue these Articles following.</p>
                  <p>First, that euery Knight should be well armed, and furnished to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
any enterprise wherein he was employed, by Sea or land, on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
or foot.</p>
                  <p>That he should be euer prest to assaile all Tyrants, and oppressours of
people.</p>
                  <p>That he should protect widowes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>and maidens; restore children to their
right: repossesse such persons as were without iust cause exiled, and withall
his force maintaine the Christian faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:17413:31"/>
That he should be a Champion for the weale publique, and as a Lion
repulse the enemies of his countrey.</p>
                  <p>That he should aduance the reputation of honour, and suppresse al vice,
releeue people afflicted by aduerse fortune, giue aide to holy Church, and
protect pilgrimes.</p>
                  <p>That he should bury Souldiers that wanted sepulture, deliuer prisoners,
ransome captiues, and cure men hurt in seruice of their countrey.</p>
                  <p>That he should in all honourable actions, aduenture his person, yet with
respect to iustice and trueth, and in all enterprises proceed sincerely, neuer
failing to vse his vttermost force of body, and valour of minde.</p>
                  <p>That after the atteyning of any enterprise, he should cause it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,
to th'end the fame of that fact might euer liue, to his eternall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and renowne of the Noble order.</p>
                  <p>That if any complaint were made at the Court of this mighty King of
iniury, or oppression, then some knight of the Order, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the king should
appoint, ought reuenge the same.</p>
                  <p>That if any knight of forraine nation did come vnto the Court with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to challenge, or make shew of his prowesse, that then (were he single,
or accompanied) these knights ought be ready in Armes to make answere.</p>
                  <p>That if any Lady, Gentlewoman, Widow, Maiden or other oppressed
person did present a petition declaring they were, or had bene in this or
other nation iniured, or offered dishonour, they should bee gratiousty
heard, and without delay, one or more Knights should bee sent to make
reuenge.</p>
                  <p>That euery Knight should bee willing to enforme yong Princes, Lords
and Gentlemen in the orders, and exercises of Arms, therby not only to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
idlenes, but also to increase the honor of Knighthood and Chiualrie.</p>
                  <p>Diuers other Articles inciting to magnanimious Action of honour in
Armes these Knights were sworne to obserue: which for breuitie I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.
Neuerthelesse (being vsed to lose my labour) I aduenture to say this
little: and the rather, because this order of knighthood is ancient and
English.</p>
                  <p>I doe not read of any robe or habit prescribed vnto these Knights, nor
with what ceremonie they were made.</p>
                  <p>Their place of meeting and conuocation was the city of Winchester,
where king <hi>Arthur</hi> caused a great round Table to be made, and at the same
the Knights at the feast of Pentecost, did sit and eat. The proportion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was such, as no roome could be thought of more dignity then the rest.
Yet (as some writers say) one seat thereof was called, the Sea perilous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
for that Knight that did excell the rest in vertue. That place by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of all the Knights was allotted vnto King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who for his valour
surpassed other professors of Armes.</p>
                  <p>Of officers and ministers belonging vnto this Order, I doe not read, but
of a Register, whose duty was to enter and keepe records of all and euery
action, enterprised, attempted, or performed by any or all these Knights;
which records were read and sung publikely to the eternizing of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and fame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:17413:31"/>
Whether the number of these Knights were many or fewe, I doe not
find, but it seemeth imparted to a great many, all persons of high dignitie
or much prowesse. For at a city called <hi>Carlion,</hi> resorted vnto king <hi>Arthur</hi> at
one time, ten kings and thirteene Earles, besides many Barons and other
Knights of meaner title.</p>
                  <p>As the conquests of this King were many, so was his bounty notable:
for it is written, that vnto his chiefe Seneschal or Steward called <hi>Kay,</hi> hee
gaue the prouince of Anjou, on his Butler <hi>Bedwere</hi> he bestowed Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and to his cousin <hi>Berell</hi> he granted the Dutchie of Burgundie, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
many other Lords and valiant Knights, he allotted other magnificent
gifts, according to their vertue and merit.</p>
                  <p>Some men haue surmised, that the successe of king <hi>Arthurs</hi> prosperous
proceeding in his enterprises, was occasioned by counsell of one <hi>Merlin,</hi>
a man in that time reputed a Prophet.</p>
                  <p>King <hi>Arthur</hi> hauing all his youth found fortune his friend, was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
at length deceiued by the treason of one <hi>Mordred</hi> his owne cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
to whome (during his absence out of England) he had committed the
gouernment.</p>
                  <p>He was also at a city called <hi>Augusta</hi> encountred of the Romans and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens,
conducted by a Consul called <hi>Lucius:</hi> neuerthelesse <hi>Arthur</hi> by his
great valour slew <hi>Lucius,</hi> and forced his Romanes to flee. In that battell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
were slaine fiue Saracen kings.</p>
                  <p>After this victorie, <hi>Arthur</hi> returned into England, and fought with
<hi>Mordred.</hi> In which conflict died <hi>Gawen</hi> a Noble Knight and cousen to
king <hi>Arthur.</hi> Also in landing, <hi>Aquisel</hi> king of Scots was slaine; But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the losse of these valiant Knights, king <hi>Arthur</hi> landed, and
<hi>Mordred</hi> fledde to London: where the Citizens would not suffer him to
enter the City. Then he went into Cornewall, where <hi>Arthur</hi> did slea him,
and he himselfe was mortally wounded. So great a slaughter had neuer ben
before that day seene.</p>
                  <p>After this conflict, king <hi>Arthur</hi> was neuer found aliue, or dead: but (as
some Poets haue supposed) was taken vp into the firmament, and remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
there a Starre among the nine Worthies; which fancie is founded
vpon the prophecie of old <hi>Merlyn,</hi> who many yeeres before affirmed, that
<hi>Arthur</hi> after a certaine time should resuscitate, and come vnto <hi>Carlion</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the round Table. There he wrote this Epitaph:

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Rue it is, as hath bene formerly said, that many enterprises
in times past attempted and atchieued aboue the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, are now thought rather fabulous then faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reported: either because we that now liue did not know,
or see them, or that ignorant men cannot conceiue howe
they might be done, or that want of courage doth disable them to take the
like actions in hand. Yet most certaine it is, that diuers histories common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reputed vaine fables, were at the first begun vpon occasion of matter in
effect true, although some writers afterwards, to shew the excellencie of
their inuention, or make their workes more vendible, haue added many
fancies and fictions which are not indeede worthy to bee beleeued. And
who so shall well consider how difficult a thing it is to write an history of
so great trueth and perfection, as cannot be controlled, will easily excuse
these writers that haue taken in hand matter so farre from our knowledge
and vnderstanding. For like vnto all other men, mooued with loue, hate,
profit, or other priuate passion, they are either willing or ignorantly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to encrease or extenuate the actions and merits of those men, of whom
their histories haue discoursed. How soeuer that bee, I verely thinke the
Acts and enterprises of <hi>Vlysses, Aeneas, Hector,</hi> and other famous captaines
(of whome Poets and profane Writers haue written so many woonders)
were indeed of notable men, and some part of their doings such, as writers
haue made mention. Much lesse doe I doubt, that some egregious acts at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued
and written in the bookes of <hi>Amadis de Gaule, Ariosto, Tasso,</hi> King
<hi>Arthur</hi> of England, and such others doe containe many things, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
not to be discredited. But omitting to meddle with time so long since
past, and with countreys so farre from our Climate, wee will remember
some few Actions which worthy men of our owne Nation or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
(as that of <hi>Hernando Cortez, Pisarro,</hi> and others) haue (within our
knowledge) to the eternizing of their fame and honour, perfourmed. The
greater part of which enterprises haue bene atchieued in this present age,
and shall no doubt hereafter (when men are lesse industrious) be thought
rather fabulous, then matters credible.</p>
                  <p>Let vs therefore say no more of matter so long before our dayes, and
begin with actions notable performed by men of our owne Countrey, and
they (for the most part) persons of such qualitie, as were not forced with
distresse, but with desire to aduance the honour of their Countrey. Wee
reade in Authors worthy credit, that at one time twentie thousand Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17413:32"/>
of this most noble Iland (then called great <hi>Britaine</hi>) traueiled from
hence vnto <hi>Iudea,</hi> and vnder the Emperours <hi>Vespasian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> serued at
the siege and sacke of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The like enterprize was long after taken in
hand by King <hi>Richard</hi> the first, who in his owne person traueiled to recouer
the same Citie from the <hi>Saracens.</hi> The voyages and marueiles which Sir
<hi>Iohn Mandeuile</hi> reporteth, are accompted of many men rather fables then
reports of trueth, yet of late yeeres, some Sailers euen of our owne nation,
haue found by experience they ought not to be discredited. Who would
haue thought it possible to passe securely into <hi>Syria, Persia, Media,</hi> and other
farre countreys in the East and Southeast, vntill M. <hi>Anthony Ienkinson,</hi> (a
gentleman yet liuing, and worthy beleefe) performed those, and other
right notable Voyages? It is also certaine that <hi>Thomas Windhame</hi> a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
well borne and worshipfully descended, sailed from thence to <hi>Guinea,</hi>
and the kingdome of <hi>Benin,</hi> and since that time Captaine <hi>Fenner</hi> perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the same iourney, so farre as the Ilands of <hi>Capo verde.</hi> All which Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
with many other were made by Princes, or persons of reputation, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the South and Southeast.</p>
                  <p>The like may be said of Voyages of latter time towards the North, and
Northeast Regions performed by sir <hi>Hugh Willowby,</hi> M. <hi>Ienkinson</hi> aforesaid,
M. <hi>Christopher Burrow</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Of voyages towards the West and Southwest countreys, who hath not
heard the Nauigation of sir <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> to <hi>Brasill,</hi> and the West <hi>Indias,</hi> of
<hi>Roger Bodname</hi> gentleman to <hi>S. Iohn Vllua</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> of sir <hi>Francis
Drake</hi> to <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi> sir <hi>Martin Furbisher</hi> to <hi>Meta incognita,</hi> sir <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey
Gilbert</hi> to the coast of <hi>America,</hi> sir <hi>Richard Greeneuile</hi> to <hi>Virginia,</hi> M. <hi>Iohn
Dauis</hi> gentleman his discouery 200. leagues beyond sir <hi>Martin Furbisher</hi> to
the Northwest? I omit to make mention of many Merchants, Nauiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and simple Sailers of our land, that haue not onely attempted, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
performed marueilous actions, to vulgar people and vnskilfull thought
impossible. Yet is it now publiquely knowen that sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him <hi>Thomas Candish</hi> esquier, (a yong gentleman scarcely knowne to
Sailers) within the space of two yeeres and three moneths, effected a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
about the Globe of the whole earth: an action no doubt, worthy all
admiration, and such as before that time had neuer bene performed.</p>
                  <p>Here might we also insert how the mightie and formidable <hi>Armada</hi> of
<hi>Spaine,</hi> was by her Maiesties Nauie (conducted by the Earle of <hi>Nottingham</hi>)
vanquished <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. being in forraine Nations thought vnresistable.

proper vertue, and at the particular charge of him and his friends, assaulted
and possessed the Isle of S. <hi>Iohn de Porto Ricco,</hi> a place both by nature and

were aboue the common opinion of men, attempted, and atchieued
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17413:33"/>
by worthie and excellent Captaines of our countrey: and the chiefe of
them within the raigne of our sacred Soueraigne, by whose counsell and

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N ancient Histories it appeareth that the old Romanes did
giue rings of gold vnto men of qualitie, seruing in the war,
whom afterwards they called <hi>Equites.</hi> Such rings the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
vsed also to weare, whereof may be inferred that knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
and ensignes of honour were giuen as well for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
as Militarie merit. <hi>Cicero</hi> seemeth to say that Captaines generall had
in vse (after euery victory) to make an Oration vnto souldiers, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their vertue: and to those men that serued with much valour were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
rings of gold.</p>
                  <p>We read likewise in holy Scripture that king <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in signe of honor
did take a ring from his owne finger, and gaue the same to <hi>Ioseph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Princes also intending to honour their seruants and souldiers did
bestow vpon them spurres of golde or guilded: in signe they were men of
vertue, and professors of Armes on horsebacke: for spurres are onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to souldiers of that sort, and so it appeareth by the signification of the
latine word <hi>Eques,</hi> and likewise by the terme <hi>Caualiero,</hi> ordinarily vsed of
the Spaniards and Italian.</p>
                  <p>In old time (as a token of honour and aduancement) Princes did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
girdles and swordes. And the lawe Ciuill seemeth to note that the
girdle signified administration or dignitie, and whosoeuer did loose that
girdle, should also forfeite all priuiledges which the lawe alloweth vnto
souldiers. A sword was alwayes hanging at the girdle, and the hilts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

Knight, doe either gird him with a sword, or with a sword touch him on
the head or shoulder, thereby to signifie that as with the sword he is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a Knight, so with the sword he ought to defend the Prince and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
that did create him, without feare of death or other daunger. <hi>Hiera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias</hi>
with his right hand deliuered a sword vnto <hi>Iuda,</hi> and in the name of
God made him a Knight, saying, Receiue this sacred sword sent from God,
wherewith thou shalt vanquish the enemies of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath bene also a custome ancient, that Princes did giue collars as a
singular demontration of fauour and honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth that the Romanes did giue vnto their confederates a
collar of gold, and to their owne citizens a collar of siluer.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Manlius</hi> in single combat had slaine a French man, hee tooke
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17413:34"/>
from him a collar of golde, all bloodie, and put the same about his owne
necke in token of victorie. After which time, he was surnamed <hi>Torquatus,</hi>
because <hi>Torques</hi> in the Latine signifieth a collar or chaine.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours in like maner bestowed collars vpon Captaines and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that serued in the warre, and deserued commendation.</p>
                  <p>In some Histories may be found, that collars were of two sorts: the first
called <hi>Duplares,</hi> th'other <hi>Simplices.</hi> And with those collars the Emperours
(for the most part) did giue prouision of money or vittaile: to some more,
to some lesse.</p>
                  <p>For these reasons and by these examples it appeareth, that among the
ensignes and ornaments of Honor and Armes, the great Collar is of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
reputation.</p>
                  <p>It is also seene that Princes soueraigne, doe at this day bestow chaines or
small collars vpon men of vertue or fauour, and in token thereof (for the
most part) a picture or modele of the giuer is thereat pendant; which Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat
the Knight or Gentleman that receiueth it, ought carefully to keepe
during his life.</p>
                  <p>The ancient custome was, that Knights of meane degree, and such as
were not of the great Orders (whereunto particular habits are assigned)
should in signe of honour weare a garment of scarlet, because red repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth
fire, the most noble element, and (next vnto the Sunne) of most
brightnesse. It was therefore among the olde Romanes decreed, That no
man should weare any habit of that colour, but only Magistrates and men
of dignity. Red doeth also betoken boldnesse, magnanimitie, and ardent
loue with charitie. The element of fire is also assigned to <hi>Mars,</hi> in respect
whereof that colour is most proper to Knights, Captaines, and all other
professours of Armes.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Dward</hi> the third King of <hi>England,</hi> after hee
had obtained many great victories of <hi>Iohn</hi>
the <hi>French</hi> King, and <hi>Iames</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
both prisoners in the Realme at one time,
<hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Castile</hi> the Bastard expulsed,
and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> restored by the Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> did first erect this order in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<hi>Anno</hi> 1350. vpon no waightie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as is reported. Notwithstanding the
same is, and long hath bene in so great
reputation, as Emperors, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
haue and doe desire to bee companions
thereof for their greater honour.</p>
                  <p>The patron of this Order is <hi>S. George,</hi> vnto whom it was first dedicated.</p>
                  <p>The Soueraigne of this Order is the King of <hi>England,</hi> his heires and
successors for euer.</p>
                  <p>The number of this Colledge of fellowship is 26. Knights with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,
and when any of them die, another is chosen by consent of those
Knights that liue.</p>
                  <p>The habit of these Knights is an vnder garment, or gowne of Crimsin
veluet, of some called ak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtle, ouer which he weareth a mantle of Purple
veluet lined with white sarsnet, on the left shoulder thereof is embroidred
in a Garter an Eschuchion of <hi>S George,</hi> and ouer his right shoulder hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his hood of Crimson veluet lined with white, the <hi>Cordons</hi> to the mantle
are purple silke and gold.</p>
                  <p>Aboue all which, about his necke he weareth the collar of the order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of pure gold, made of garters and knots, and enamiled with roses white
and red, weying 30. ounces of Troy weight, with the image of <hi>S. George,</hi>
richly garnished with precious stones, pendant thereat.</p>
                  <p>About his left legge he weareth buckled a garter enriched with gold,
pearle and stones, whereupon these French words are embrodered, HONY
SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE. Which may be thus Englished, <hi>Shame
be to him that euill thinketh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The custome was long that these Knights did yeerely hold a feast at the
Castle <hi>Windesor,</hi> where the same King <hi>Edward</hi> founded a Church, and
gaue vnto certaine Priests and Prebends large stipends to serue there. And
he ordained also that thirteene poore aged and decayed Gentlemen by the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17413:37"/>
name of poore Knights were there for euer to be maintained and kept, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uested
in gownes and mantles of cloth onely, sutable with those of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to pray for the prosperity of the Soueraigne and his successors, and all
other Knights of the said noble Order.</p>
                  <p>It is not publiquely knowen what mooued the King to make this order:
but thus it is vulgarly reported, that King <hi>Edward</hi> dauncing with the
Queene and other Ladies of his Court, hapned to take vp a blewe garter
which fell from one of them, and of some said from the Countesse of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie</hi>
(of whom the King was then enamored) which garter the King af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
wore about his left legge for a fauour. The Queene taking some
offence thereat, it was signified vnto the King by some of the Lords the
cause of her displeasure, at which he smiling sayd, HONY SOIT QVI
MAL Y PENSE. I will make of it yet it be long the most honourable
Garter that euer was worne, and thereupon instituted the order of the
Garter.</p>
                  <p>Some rather thinke it was made to remunerate those Noble men and
Knights, that had best endeuoured and deserued in his most Royall and
Martiall affaires of <hi>France, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> with all which Nations he
then had warre and triumphed.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A Knight that is to receiue this honour, shalbe led betweene two other
Knights before the King or Generall, bearing his <hi>Pennon</hi> of Armes in his

                  <p>May it please your grace to vnderstand, that this gentleman hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himselfe valiant in the field: and for so doing, deserueth to be aduanced
vnto the degree of a Knight <hi>Banneret,</hi> as worthy from hencefoorth to beare

                  <p>Then the King or Generall shal cause the points of his <hi>Pennon</hi> or <hi>Guydon</hi>

two other Knights, the trumpets sounding all the way before him,
there to receiue sees: viz. to the Heraulds three pound sixe shillings and
viij pence. And if he were before a Knight Bachelour, then is he to pay also
vnto the Trumpets twenty shillings. I suppose the Scots doe call a Knight
of this creation a <hi>Bannerent,</hi> for hauing his Bannerrent.</p>
                  <p>Here is to be noted, that no Knight Banneret can be made, but in the

officers of the Court, as the Steward of Chamberlane, if
they be present, or otherwise by the Marshals and Vshers,
and there shall be ordayned two Esquiers of honour, wise, and well learned
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:17413:39"/>
in courtesie and nurture, as also in feates of Chiualry: and they shall be
Esquiers and Gouernours of all which pertaineth to him, who receiueth
the order abouesaid: and if the Esquier doe come before dinner, hee shall
serue the King of water, or with a dish at the first course onely, and then
the Esquiers gouernours shall leade the Esquier that is to be Knighted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his chamber without any more adoe, at that time, and towards euening
the Esquiers gouernours shall send for a Barber, and hee shall prepare a
Bath, decked with linnen, aswell within the Tubbe, as without, and that
the tubbe be well couered with carpets and mantels for the colde of the
night, and then the beard of the Esquier shalbe shauen, and his haire roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
This done, the Esquiers gouernours shall goe to the King and say, Sir
it is euening, and the Esquier is readie at the Bathe, when it shall please ye.
Whereupon the King shal command his Chamberlaine to conuey to the
chamber of the Esquier the most gentle and wisest Knights that are then
present, to enforme, counsell, and instruct him in the order and feates of
Chiualrie, and likewise that the other Esquiers of that house with minstrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
doe goe before the Knights, singing, playing, and dancing to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
doore of the said Esquier.</p>
                  <p>And when the Esquiers gouernours doe heare the noyse of Musicke,
they shall vncloth the Esquier, and put him naked into the Bath. But at the
entring of the chamber the Esquiers gouernours shall cause the musicke to
cease, and the Esquiers also for a time. This done the Knights shall enter
into the chamber still without making any noyse, and then the Knights
shall doe reuerence one to the other, who shall be the first to counsell the
Esquier in Order of the Bath, and when they are agreed, then the first shal
go to the Bath, and kneeling downe before the tubbe shal say secretly, Sir,
great honour may this Bath be vnto you, and then he sheweth him the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the Order that best he can, and then putteth some of the water of the
Bath vpon the shoulder of the Esquier, and taketh leaue, and the Esquiers
gouernours shall attend on each side of the Bath themselues, and after that
same maner shall all the other Knights do, one after another, till they haue
all done, and then the Knights depart out of the chamber for a season. This
done, the Esquiers gouernours doe take the Esquier out of the Bath, &amp; lay
him in his bed, till he be dry, which bed ought to be simple without curtens,
and being dry, he shal rise out of his bed and apparelled somewhat warme
because of the coldnes of the night, and ouer all his apparell he shal weare
a coat of Russet cloth with long sleeues, after the manner of an Hermit,
with an hood. The Esquier being out of the Bath and made readie, the
Barber shall take away the Bath, and all that is about the same, aswell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
as without, and take them for his fees, and likewise the Coller if hee
be an Earle, Baron, Banneret or Bachelor Knight, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the Court. This done, the Esquiers gouernours shall open the
chamber doore, and let the Knights enter in, to leade the Esquier to the
Chappell. And when they are entred, the Esquiers singing and dauncing
shall be brought before the Esquier with their melodie to the Chappell.
And when they are entred into Chappell, then spices and wine shall
be giuen to the sayd Knights and Esquiers. And the Esquiers gouernours
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17413:39"/>
shall lead the Knights before the Esquier to take their leaues. And he shall
thanke them altogether for their trauell, honor and courtesies. And so they
depart: after whom the Esquiers gournours shall shut the doore, and let
no man tarie in the Chappell, except the Esquiers his gouernours, the
Priests, Chandler, and Watch. And so he shall remaine in the Chappell
till it be almost day, alwayes in prayer, desiring God to blesse and increase
his grace in him, to giue him power and comfort to take this high tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

                     </gap>gnitie, to the honour and prayse of him, the holy Church, and order
of Knighthood. And when day appeareth they shal cause the Priest to say
prayers, and communicate if he will. And from the entring of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
doore hee shall haue a candle of waxe borne before him. Prayers
being begunne, one of the Gouernours shall holde the candle before the
Esquier till the reading of the Gospell, and then the Esquier shall hold it
himselfe till the Gospel be ended, and then it shall be set before him till all
the Seruice be ended. Then one of the gouernours shall take away the
hood from the Esquier. And when the Gospel is read, the Esquier shall
kneele downe and offer money in the honour of God, and him that shall
make him Knight. Then the Esquiers gouernours shall leade him into his
chamber, and lay him in his bed till it be farre day. And whilest hee resteth
in his bed he shalbe couered; that is to say, with a couerlet of gold, called
Sigleton, and the same shall be lined with Kersie. And when it seemeth
good to the Gouernours, they shall goe to the King and say vnto him: Sir,
when it pleaseth your Grace our Master shall rise. And then the King shall
commaund the Knights, Esquiers, and Minstrels, to goe to the chamber to
cause him rise, and to make him ready, and to bring him before him in his
Hall. But before their entring and noise of musicke heard, the Esquiers shall
make all things ready for the apparelling of him. One Knight shall giue
him his shirt, another his hose, the third his dublet, another shall apparell
him in a kertle of red Tartar. Two other shall lift him out of his bed: two
others shall put on his blacke netherstockes soled with leather: two other
to lace his Manches: another to girde him with a girdle of white leather
without any studs: another shall combe his head: another shall put on his
coife: another shall giue him a Mantle of silke, and Kertle of red Tartar,
laced with a white silke lace. But the Chandler shall haue for his fees all the
garments and others wherewith he was clothed at the first entrie, and also
the bed and Sigleton; for which fees, the Chandler of his owne expences
shall finde the coife, gloues, girdle, &amp; lace. Then the Knights shall mount
on horsebacke, and conduct him to the Hall, the musicke playing before
him, his horse sadled with blacke leather, the Arson white, stirrop leathers
blacke, and stirrops gilt, the pectorel of blacke leather with a crosse paty of
gold, hanging before the horse feete, and without a crouper: the bridle of
blacke leather with a crosse paty on the forehead: and then a yong Esquier
to ride before him without a hood, who shall beare his sword by the point
with the spurres hanging at the hilts, which are white, studded with blacke,
and a white leather girdle without any studdes. When they come to the
Kings Hall, the Gouernours and Marshals shalbe ready to meete him, and
at his alighting the Marshall shall haue his horse, or else 100. sh. for his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17413:40"/>
see, he shall be brought to the vppermost table in the Hall, and there tarie
till the Kings comming, the Knights on each side of him: and the young
man holding his sword betweene the two Esquiers. And when the King
commeth into the Hall, and looketh on the Esquier, ready to take the high
Order of temporall dignitie, he shall demand the sword, and the spurres,
and the Chamberlaine shall take the sword and the spurres from the yong
man, and shall shew them to the King, &amp; then the King shall take the right
spurre and shall deliuer it to the most noble Lord, saying, Put this vpon the
Esquiers heele: and he kneeling on that one knee, shall take the Esquier by
the right legge, and put his foote vpon his knee, and make fast the spurre
to his right heele: and the Lord shall make a crosse on the knee of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier,
and kisse him. This done, another Lorde shall come and fasten the
spurre to the left foot in the same manner. And then the King of his great
curtesie shall take the sword, and gird it about the Esquier: and then the
Esquier shall lift vp his Armes on high, holding the Gantlets in his hands
betweene his fingers and the thumbes. And the King shall put his arme
about the Esquiers necke, and lift his right hand vp, and smite the Esquier
on the shoulder, saying, Be a good Knight, and then kisseth him. And then
the Knights doe leade the new Knight to the Chappell with great melody
to the high Altar, where he kneeleth downe and putteth his right hand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Altar, promising to defend the right of holy Church during his
life. And then he shall vngird the sword, and with great deuotion pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Almightie God that he may keepe the Order which he hath taken vpon
him, and accomplish the same to the end, and taketh a drop of wine. And at
his going out of the Chappell, the Kings master Cooke is ready to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the spurres, and to haue them for his see, saying, I am come from the
King being his master Cooke, to take the spurres from you, and to shewe
you, that if you doe any thing against the order of Chiualrie (which God
forbid) I will cut away the spurres from your heeles. And then the Knights
shall lead him backe into the Hall, and he beginneth the table of Knights,
and the Knights shall sit about him, and he shalbe serued as the other are,
but he shall neither eate nor drinke nor mooue, or looke here or there, no
more then one that is new married. This done, one of the gouernors shall
haue a handkerchife in his hand, which he shall hold before his face, when
he wil spit or such like: and when the King is risen from the table, and gone
into his chamber, then the new Knight shall be led with a great number of
Knights and Minstrels before him to his chamber, and at their entring
the Knights and Minstrels shall take leaue, and hee shall goe to dinner.
The Knights beeing departed, the chamber shall be shut, and that newe
Knight shalbe dispoiled of all his abillaments which shall be giuen to the
Knights &amp; Heralds, if they be present, or els to the Minstrels, with a marke
in siluer if he be a Bacheler Knight, and if hee be a Baron, then double so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
if hee be an Earle or higher estate alwayes doubled, and the Russet
night-cap shall be giuen to the watch, or els a noble in money. And then
he shalbe apparelled in a blew gowne, with the Manches open in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a Priest, and hee shall haue at his left shoulder a lace of white silke
hanging, which he shall weare vppermost on his garment, so long till hee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17413:40"/>
haue gained honour in Armes: and be recorded by some noble Knights,
Esquiers, and Heralds of Armes for some memorable deeds done by him,
as hath bene said before, or by some noble Prince, or noble Lady, which
may cut away the lace from the Knights shoulder, saying, Sir, wee haue
heard much of your renowne, and what you haue done in diuers places to
the great honor of Chiualrie, for your selfe and him that made you Knight:
therefore reason would that this lace should be taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. But after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Knights and gentlemen doe come after the Knight, and doe bring
him to the Kings presence, and the Esquiers gouernours before him. And
when the newe Knight commeth into the Kings presence, he shall kneele
downe before him, saying, Most noble and renowned Sir, I do thanke you
for al the honors, courtesies and goodnesse which you haue done vnto me.
And so he taketh leaue of the King. And then the Esquiers gouernours do
take leaue of their Master, saying, Sir, we haue accomplished the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kings as he charged vs, to the vttermost of our power, wherein
if we haue displeased you, through negligence, or deed, during the time, we
desire pardon. On the other side, Sir, according to the custome of the
Court and ancient Kings: we demaund Robes and fees for terme of life,
as Esquiers of the King, and companions vnto Bachelors Knights, and
other Lords.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst it is to be remembred, that no man is brone a
Knight of any title, but made, either before a battell,
to encourage them to aduenture their liues, or after
the fight, as an aduancement for their valour then
shewed: or out of warre for some notable seruice
done, or some good hope of vertues that do appeare
in them.</p>
                  <p>These Knights are made either by the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
or by his commission and royal authority giuen for that purpose,
or by his Lieutenant in the warres, who hath his royal and absolute power
for that time. And this order may bee resembled to that which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
called <hi>Equites Romanos,</hi> differing in a sort, but in some other sort
doeth agree with it: for seldome in all points one Common wealth doeth
agree with another, nor long any State accordeth with it selfe. <hi>Equites Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani</hi>
were chosen <hi>ex Censu,</hi> which is according to their substance and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
Euen so be Knights in <hi>England</hi> for the most part, according to the
yeerely reuenue of their lands, being able to maintaine that estate: Yet all
they that had <hi>Equestrem Censum</hi> were not in <hi>Rome Equites:</hi> no more are all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:17413:41"/>
Knights in <hi>England</hi> that may dispend a Knights land, or fee, but they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to whom it pleaseth the King to giue that honour. In <hi>Rome</hi> the number
of <hi>Equites</hi> was vncertaine, and so it is of Knights in <hi>England,</hi> at the pleasure
of the Prince. <hi>Equites Romani</hi> had <hi>Equum Publicum,</hi> but the Knights of
<hi>England</hi> finde horses themselues, both in peace and warre: <hi>Census Equester</hi>
among the <hi>Romanes</hi> was at diuers times of diuers value, but in <hi>England,</hi>
whosoeuer may dispend of his free lands fourty pounds starling of yeerely
reuenue, by an old Law, either at the Coronation of the King, or mariage
of his daughter, or at the dubbing of the Prince, Knight, or some such great
occasion, may be by the King compelled to take that order and honour, or
to pay a fine: which many rich men, not so desirous of honor, as of riches,
had rather disburse. Some also, who for good respect are not thought
worthy that title, and yet haue abilitie, neither be made Knights though
they would, and yet pay the fine of fourtie pounds sterling, which (as siluer
is now prised) is 120. pound currant money. Where of this word Knight
is deriued, or whether it signifieth no more then <hi>Miles</hi> doeth in Latine,
which is Souldier, I know not. Some hold opinion that the word Souldier
doeth betoken a waged or hired man to fight. <hi>Caesar</hi> in his Commentaries
called Souldiers, men deuoted and sworne by band or oath to serue the
Captaine, which order if the <hi>Almanes</hi> did follow, it may be, that they
who were not hired, but being of the Nation vpon their owne charges,
and for their aduancement, and by such common oath and band that did
follow the warre, were (perhaps) called Knights, or <hi>Milites:</hi> and now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Almanes</hi> some are called <hi>Launce-Knights,</hi> as Souldiers not hired,
although they be wel-neere all hired. Or it may be that they who were
next about the Prince, as his Guard and seruants, picked, and chose men
out of the rest, being called in the <hi>Almane</hi> tongue <hi>Knighten,</hi> which is as
much to say as dayly seruants, being found of good seruice, the word after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
was taken as an honour, for one that professeth Armes. Now our
language is so altered, that hard it were to giue iudgement thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
sure it is, we in our English doe call him Knight, whom the French do call
<hi>Cheualier,</hi> and the Latine <hi>Equitem,</hi> for <hi>Equestris ordinis.</hi> Touching the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of these English Knights, the maner is this. Hee that is to be made
Knight, is stricken by the Prince with a sword drawen vpon his backe, or
shoulder: the Prince saying <hi>Soys Cheualier,</hi> and in times past, was added, <hi>S.
George.</hi> And when the Knight riseth, the Prince saith, <hi>Auance.</hi> This is
the maner of dubbing Knights at this present: and that terme dubbing was
the old terme in this point, and not creating. These sorts of Knights are by
the Heralds called Knights Bachelers.</p>

                  <p>First, after the publication of his offence, his gilt
spurres were beaten from his heeles, then his sword taken from him and
broken: That being done, euery peece of his armour was bruised, beaten
and cast aside. After all which disgraces, he was beheaded.</p>
                  <p>In like maner: <hi>Andrew</hi> of <hi>Herklay</hi> a Knight and Erle of <hi>Carlile,</hi> was in this
sort disgraded. He being apprehended, was by the Kings commandement
brought before sir <hi>Anthony Lucie, anno</hi> 1322. apparelled in all the robes of
his estate, as an Earle and a Knight, and so led vnto the place of iudgement.
Being thither come, Sir <hi>Anthony Lucie</hi> saide vnto him these words: First
thou shalt loose the order of Knighthood, by which thou hadst all thine
honour: and further all worship vpon thy bodie be brought to nought.
Those words pronounced, Sir <hi>Anthony Lucie</hi> commanded a knaue to hew
the Knights spurs from his heeles, &amp; after caused his sword to be broken o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
his head. That done, he was dispoiled of his furred Tabord, of his hood,
of his furred coats, and of his gird<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

words, <hi>Andrew,</hi> now art thou no Knight, but a knaue, and for thy treason
the King doth will thou shalt be hanged.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Knighthood of the <hi>Toizon</hi> was institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Philip</hi> (surnamed the good) Duke of
<hi>Burgundy,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Flanders</hi> in the yeere
of our Lord, 1429. being mooued thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
with deuoute zeale that he had to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the conquest of the holy land, albeit his
valerous determination tooke none effect, by
reason of many alterations and losses which
hapned vnto the Christians in the East at
that time. Hee elected for Patron of this
Order, the Apostle <hi>S. Andrew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Soueraigne of this Order is he vnto whom the Dukedome of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundie</hi>
doth lawfully descend.</p>
                  <p>The number of these Knights first elected were foure and twenty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Soueraigne, all men of Noble blood without reproch, and of
vertuous merit.</p>
                  <p>The habit is an vnder garment of Crimson veluet, with a mantle of the
same, lined with white, it openeth on the right side, and in the wearing is
turned vp on the left shoulder, it is richly embrodered round about with a
border of flames, fusils and fleeces. The hood of crimson veluet the Knights
we are on their heads as by the figure appeareth.</p>
                  <p>The Collar of this Order, is of gold wrought of flames and fusils with
the <hi>Toizon</hi> hanging thereat. The Soueraigne hath authoritie in himselfe
absolutely to giue, and bestow the same at this pleasure. This Collar, or the
<hi>Toizon,</hi> euery Knight is bound to weare dayly, or failing, shall incurre a
penaltie. But in time of warre, or vrgent affaires, to weare the <hi>Toizon</hi> only
shall suffise. Or if by mishap the Collar doe breake, it is permitted for
mending thereof, it may be carried vnto a goldsmith. Or if any Knight
trauelling by the way shall feare to be robbed, he may lay the Collar aside.
Yet it is not lawfull to increase the quantitie of the Collar, nor adde there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
any stones, or workemanship, and most vnlawfull it is to sell it, or
change it.</p>
                  <p>Whosoeuer entreth into this Order, mustrenounce all other Orders of
Knighthood, of euery Prince, Company or Religion; yet out of that law
are excepted all Emperours, Kings and Dukes, vnto whom it is dispensed
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17413:45"/>
that they may weare the Ensignes of this Order, if they be chiefe and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes
of their owne Order. Yet to the end the trueth may appeare, a
Councell of Knights shall be called to consent vnto that dispensation.</p>
                  <p>These with other Statutes and Ordinances the Knights of this great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
are sworne to obserue and keepe. And many of them haue bene, since
the first institution, enlarged, altered, ortaken away by the Soueraignes.</p>
                  <p>The day of assembly for these Knights, was at the beginning appointed
on the feast day of S. <hi>Andrew,</hi> but since altered vnto the second of May,
and that but once in three yeres; vnlesse it pleaseth the Soueraigne other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to command.</p>
                  <p>To this Order doe belong foure principall officers, <hi>Viz.</hi> A Chancellor,
a Treasurer, a Register, and a king of Armes named <hi>Toizon D'or.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Order also appertaineth an <hi>Impreze:</hi> the inuenter thereof was
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of Burgundie: whose high valour brought <hi>Lewys</hi> the xj. king
of Fraunce vnto great trouble, as <hi>Monsieur d' Argenton</hi> writeth.</p>
                  <p>The said <hi>Impreze</hi> or deuice was an Instrument made to strike fire, called
an Ansill, with these words, <hi>Antè ferit, quam flamma micet:</hi> meaning, he had
power to kindle great trouble before it were perceiued, yet was the euent
vnhappy: for in the warre against <hi>Lorayne</hi> and the <hi>Suysses,</hi> after the defeare
of <hi>Morat</hi> and <hi>Granson,</hi> his forces were vtterly ouerthrowen, and his person
slaine before <hi>Nancy,</hi> the Euen of the <hi>Epiphany.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Renato</hi> Duke
of <hi>Lorayne</hi> being victorious, and seeing the standerd of Duke <hi>Charles</hi> with
the <hi>Impreze</hi> of the Instrument of fire, sayd, That vnfortunate Prince when
he had most neede to warme him, lacked leisure to strike fire: which speech
was pithie; and the more, because the earth was then couered with snow,
and by reason of the conflict, full of blood. At that time was the greatest
frost and cold that any man liuing could remember.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Toizon</hi> which these Knights doe weare hanging at their Collar of
Order, is the forme of a golden fleece, which <hi>Iason</hi> woon at <hi>Colchos:</hi> others
do suppose it to be the fleece of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> whereof the holy Scripture maketh
mention; which signifieth <hi>Fidel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The number of these Knights was much encreased by the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth; who hauing the dukedome of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> elected into that
Order persons of greater Title then were at the beginning, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the election should be by consent. After him, King <hi>Philip</hi> of Spaine
did the like.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeere 1469. <hi>Lewis</hi> the xj. French King
erected an order of Knighthood whereinto
himselfe with others the most principall
Peeres of <hi>France</hi> did enter. It is said, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
which moued the King to intitle this
Order with the name of <hi>S. Michael,</hi> was the
memory of an apparition of that Saint vpon
the bridge of <hi>Orleance,</hi> when that Citie was
besieged by the English, at which time liued
a certaine mayden called <hi>Iohan,</hi> a woman of
so rare wit and valour in Armes, as was repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
more then a mortall creature, or rather some enchantresse of singular
knowledge.</p>
                  <p>This Order is ornified with a great Collar, whereat the Image of <hi>S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi>
hangeth. The words thereon set, are these: <hi>Immensitremor Oceani.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Soueraigne of this Order is the French King and his successors.</p>
                  <p>The number of Knights to be elected into this Order is 36. But of late
yeeres that number hath bene much encreased, and thereby the order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of small reputation: yet it is said, that the great Collar and Robe is
bestowed onely to that number, although the <hi>Michael</hi> be giuen vnto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Howsoeuer that be, sure it is, that th'entent of that King was to make
choise onely of the most noble personages of his owne blood, and others,
who for vertue and honour were accompted worthy: as by the first electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
appeareth: who were these.</p>

                  <p>It was called the Order of the S. <hi>Esprit,</hi> for that on

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeere 1117. nine Gentlemen who happened
to meete in the Holy land, (of which number was
<hi>Godfredus Aldemaro Alexandrino,</hi> and <hi>Hugo de Planco
de Paganus)</hi> among themselues determined to erect
an Association or brotherhood. And being come
vnto <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they consulted vpon the estate of
that countrey, beeing enformed, that in <hi>Zaffo</hi> (a
towne anciently appertaining to the family of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tareni</hi>
in <hi>Venice</hi>) there remained many theeues that vsed daily to rob such
Pilgrims as resorted vnto the holy Sepulchre. They therefore resolued (as
a seruice acceptable to God) to hazard their liues in the suppression of
those robbers, whereby the way vnto <hi>Ierusalem</hi> might become secure. And
because the Christian armie was then employed in recouery of the Holy
land, no order was taken for safe passage. To encourage these Gentlemen
in so praiseable an enterprise, a lodging in the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> neere
vnto the Sepulchre, was appointed; of which place they tooke the name of
Knights Templars. Also the King and Patriarch much liking an action so
honourable, furnished them with many necessarie prouisions. To them
also resorted many other Christians, so as in short time the number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
much encreased: yet no habit, signe, or rule was agreed vpon. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
the Gentlemen persisted in their vow nine yeeres, and grew
to so great reputation, that Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> at the suite of <hi>Steuen</hi> Patriarch
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> prescribed vnto them an order of life, whereby they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
to weare a white garment; and Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> added thereunto a
red Crosse.</p>
                  <p>After which time, they elected an head or great master, like vnto him
that commandeth in <hi>Malta.</hi> The number of these Knights daily encreased,
and their enterprises became famous: not onely for guarding the way and
passages, but also they vndertooke warre against the Infidels, both by Sea
and land. And the Christian Princes mooued with loue of their vertue, in
sundry prouinces assigned vnto them houses and great reuenues to be spent
in Gods seruice. In processe of time they became so potent, as in euery
Christian kingdome they were owners of Townes, Fortresses, and Castles,
and wheresoeuer the great Master did goe, a mightie army did follow him.</p>
                  <p>It pleased God afterwards to permit, that Ierusalem and other places of
the Holyland, through discord among the Christians, and negligence of
Princes not sending thither any aid, was conquered, about ninety yeeres</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is written (I know not with what warrant)
that at the Citie of <hi>Amiens</hi> in <hi>Picardie,</hi> a
Prouince of <hi>France,</hi> there was borne a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Gentleman, who in his childhood had
bene brought vp in learning: and being
growen to mans estate, disposed himselfe to
the exercise of Armes, and there in long time
continued. Afterwards hauing attained ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
yeres, he despised the world, and framed
himselfe to a solitarie life, as one fully resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to liue in contemplation, vnseene of any
but God alone. Hauing sometime remained in that solitarie sort, a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
desire he had to visite the Sepulchre where Christ was buried, which
shortly after he did. And to the end he might with securitie passe the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, he apparelled himselfe like vnto a Phisition; by which
meane without impediment he performed his iorney. Thus hauing passed
the difficulties of trauell in diuers strange Countries, he arriued at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and being there, fell into acquaintance with <hi>Simon,</hi> Patriarch of that
Citie, and in lamenting wise enformed him of the oppression and crueltie
offered and dayly vsed by the Infidels towardes the poore Christians in
those Countreys. Whereunto <hi>Simon</hi> answered, that albeit the Christians
in those countreys indured great outrages, yet they of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> suffered
much greater, and should be forced to more, if God did not defend them.</p>
                  <p>By this conference, the Patriarch conceiued <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermit (for so he
was called) to be a man of good vnderstanding, and apt to execute any
action of importance, that should be committed vnto him. Whereupon
the Patriarch determined to make him a messenger vnto the Pope, vnto
whom by letters he imparted the great calamitie and afflicted estate of the
poore Christians, inhabiting the Holy land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> hauing receiued his instructions, and letter of credence, returned
into the West: first vnto the Pope, and after sollicited other Princes: in
such sort, and with so good successe, as by his perswasions, many great
Kings and Potentates, consented to take in hand the recouery of the Holy
land from the oppression of the Infidels, and some of them furnished that
enterprise with men, some with money, and some did go in person. Among
which number (as the chiefe) was <hi>Robert Duke of Normandie,</hi> sonne to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17413:56"/>
King <hi>William</hi> of <hi>England, Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> with two of his brethren
called <hi>Eustace,</hi> and <hi>Baldwin, Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Flanders, Hugh</hi> surnamed the
Great, brother to the French King: with diuers other Princes, Dukes,
Earles and Barons. Also thither went <hi>Beaumond</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who for
zeale to that seruice (or desire of honour) resigned his Dukedome vnto
<hi>Ruggiero</hi> his brother, taking with him so many of his subiects as would vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
follow him, of whom (with such other Captaines and souldiers
of <hi>Italy</hi> as came vnto him) hee assembled more then twenty thousand, all
choyse men and young, fit for warre.</p>
                  <p>All things in this sort prepared for the iourney, <hi>Vrban</hi> the second (then
Pope) sent vnto the Captaines a white Crosse, with commandement that
all the souldiers should weare the like, calling that enterprise <hi>La cruciata.</hi> It
is sayd that the Christians, as such time as this warre was proclaimed in
<hi>Cleirmont</hi> (a citie of <hi>Auergna</hi>) indeuoured themselues vniuersally to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
the souldiers, and ioyned in generall prayer for their good successe,
giuing them meat, apparel and furniture, vnasked or required. Moreouer,
those that were indebted, were forgiuen, and such as had beene banished,
were pardoned. The women also (contrary to their custome) willingly
and with much ioy consented their husbands and sonnes should passe in
this enterprise, and for their furniture gaue them their Iewels, Chaines,
and money. The French King likewise sent them great treasure, and gaue
priuiledges to the souldiers lands and wiues, in their husbands absence.
And many great Princes, and other Lords sold and impawned their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
to further this action. So as the Armie assembled for this holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise,
amounted vnto three hundred thousand footmen, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand horse, who presently marched towards <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
where they passed the Strait called <hi>Bosphoro Thracio,</hi> &amp; landed at <hi>Calcedonia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the first enterprise they besieged <hi>Nicea</hi> in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> which within
fiftie dayes was yeelded: and the fouth of Iuly at the foote of certaine
mountaines neere vnto that citie, the Christians fought a battell with a
Turkish Armie, which in number exceeded ours, and thereat was present
<hi>Solyman</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Turkie,</hi> but the Christians had victory, with the
losse of two thousand men: of the Enemies were slaine fourtie thousand.</p>
                  <p>This victorie gained, the Christians following their enterprise, within
short time wonne an hundred cities and townes of accompt: and among
them the great <hi>Antiochia,</hi> before which they begun the siege the twentieth
of October, and tooke it the last of May following, where they found <hi>Corbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and <hi>Cassiano,</hi> Lord of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Neere vnto that place in
one other conflict were slaine more then one hundred thousand Turkes,
with the losse of foure thousand of ours.</p>
                  <p>The cause of this victory was (in that time of superstition) imputed to
the vertue of a bloody Lance found in <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which they supposed to
bee a speare wherewith Christ was wounded on the Crosse. It was also
sayd, that the Turkes did see (or imagine) another great Armie comming
against them from the mountaines, conducted by three Captaines moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon three white horses, the beholding wherof occasioned their flight.</p>
                  <p>This victory being had, a Nauie arriued from <hi>Genoa</hi> and from <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:17413:56"/>
Also with them came certaine ships conducted by one <hi>Vymer</hi> of <hi>Bullein</hi> in
<hi>Picardie,</hi> a notable Pirate, who repenting his former like, determined to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that honourable Action.</p>
                  <p>The Christian forces thus increased, they marched towards <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>
and besieged it, &amp; notwithstanding the city was of great force, yet by Gods
helpe, and the valorous aduenture of the Christians, it was assaulted, and in
the end yeelded, <hi>Anno</hi> 1099.</p>
                  <p>This Citie thus conquered, the sayd <hi>Peter</hi> (as the chiefe procurer of the
enterprise) was highly honoured, and <hi>Godfrey</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorayn</hi> elected King
of the Holy land.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to the Original of these Knights, I say, that somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Christians conquered the Citie of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they had obteined of
the Saracens leaue to dwell neere vnto the Sepulchre of Christ, and there
builded an house, calling it the Hospital of Christians, whither all other
Christians dayly resorted. After that, the number of Christians increasing,
they builded another houses for women, calling it <hi>S. Mary Magadelens.</hi> And
at length they made a third house, calling it <hi>S. Iohn Baptists,</hi> where for the
keeping of good order they appointed an officer whom they called <hi>Rector.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some time after was elected to that fellowship, a gouernour called <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardus,</hi>
who commanded that he, with al others of that house, should weare
a white Crosse vpon a blacke garment, which was the originall of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and euer since hath bene vsed.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards one other <hi>Rector</hi> or great Master was elected, whose name
was <hi>Raimondus,</hi> to whom authority was giuen, that he should gouerne and
command all Knights of this Order, where soeuer they were dispersed.</p>
                  <p>Many yeeres after these Knights conquered the Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> holden by
the Turkes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1308. which was the cause they were commonly called
Knights: and diuers princes seeing them martially inclined, gaue vnto
them great lands and possessions: and they became greatly esteemed for
their seruice, chiefly against the sayd Turkes, and the Soldan, king of <hi>Egypt</hi>
and <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sayd Isle of <hi>Rhodes</hi> (during those Knights inhabited there) was foure
times assaulted, yet by Gods helpe, and the valiancie of the Knights, it was
defended Then <hi>Mahomet Otoman</hi> Emperour of <hi>Turkie, Anno</hi> 1480. with an
excessiue force of men, and an hundred Saile of Galleys (conducted by a
Bassa borne in <hi>Greece,</hi> descended of the rase of <hi>Paleologi</hi> sometime Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of <hi>Constantinople</hi>) did besiege it, but after 89 dayes of continuall bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
they were forced to abandon the enterprise, and for their farewell, in
the last assault, the Knights slew more then fourtie thousand Turkes.</p>
                  <p>But in the yeare 1523. in the moneth of Ianuarie, the Turkes againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaded
the Island, and after three moneths Siege preuailed: for the rest of
Christendome neuer vouchsafed them either aide or reliefe.</p>
                  <p>Since the losse of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> these Knights haue remained in the Island of
<hi>Malta,</hi> and often defended it against the enemies of Christendome, but
chiefly in the yeere 1565.</p>
                  <p>The first erector of Statures and Rules for the gouernment of these
Knights, was the sayd <hi>Raymondus,</hi> calling himselfe, <hi>Raimondo di Poggio,

                  </p>
                  <p>No man might be receiued into this Knighthood, vntill he had proued
his gentilitie, in presence of the great Master, and other Knights.</p>
                  <p>Nor no man descended of a Moore, a Iew, or Mahometan, might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

                  <p>And euery Knight of this order was sworne to fight for the Christian

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His order was first erected by <hi>Alphonso</hi> King
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> sonne to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and Queene
<hi>Constanza</hi> in the yeere 1268. And to giue the
said Knighthood reputation and honour, the
King himselfe with his sonnes and brethren
vouchsafed to enter thereinto: with them
were also admitted diuers other gentlemen
of best quality and greatest estimation.</p>
                  <p>The cause that mooued the King to name
them, Knights of the <hi>Band,</hi> was, for that hee
commanded euery man elected into the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
should weare a certaine red Scarfe, or Lace of silke the bred<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th of three
inches, which hung on their left shoulder, &amp; was tied vnder the right arme.</p>
                  <p>No man might enter into this Knighthood, but such as the king did spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
admit: neither was any person capable of that dignitie, vnlesse hee
were the sonne of a Knight or some Gentleman of great account, or at the
least such a one as had serued the King by space of ten yeeres in his Court,
or in the warre against the Moores.</p>
                  <p>Into this Order no Gentleman could be receiued being an elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or an heire in possession or apparance, but only such as were yonger,
without land and liueload: because the Kings intention was to aduance
the Gentlemen of his Court that had not of their owne.</p>
                  <p>At such time as any Gentleman was admitted a Knight, he promised to
obserue these Articles following, which I haue thought good particularly
to expresse, and the rather because they tend only to entertaine the minds
of men in the offices of Courage and Curtesie, without any mixture of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
whereof almost all other Orders in those dayes tasted.</p>
                  <p>First, that hee should speake vnto the King for commodity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
and the defence thereof, so often as he were thereunto requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and refusing so to doe, shall for feit all his patrimony, and be banished
his countrey.</p>
                  <p>That he should aboue all things speake the trueth vnto the King, and at
euery occasion be faithfull to his Maiesty.</p>
                  <p>That hee should not be silent whensoeuer any person should speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kings honor: vpon paine of being banished the Court, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of his Band for euer.</p>
                  <p>That he should be no great speaker, and in speaking to vtter the trueth:
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:17413:59"/>
but if he should say or affirme an vntrueth, then for a punishment, to
in the streets without his sword, for one whole moneth.</p>
                  <p>That he should endeauour himselfe to keepe company with wise m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

merchants, artificers, or base people, he should be therefore greatly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the great Master, and for one moneth be commanded to keepe his
house.</p>
                  <p>That he should maintaine his owne word, and faithfully keepe promise
with his friends: and being found to do otherwise, to be enioyned to walke
and goe alone, vnaccompanied of any other of the Kings Court, &amp; should
not presume to speake or come neere vnto any other Knight.</p>
                  <p>That he should alwayes haue good armour in his chamber, good hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in his stable, good launces in his hall, and a good sword by his side: or
otherwise to be called Page, and no Knight, for one whole moneth.</p>
                  <p>That he should not be seene mounted vpon any Mule, or other vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hackney: neither walke abroad without his Band, nor enter into the
Kings pallace without his sword, nor eate alone at home, vpon paine to
forfeit for euery such offence, one Marke toward the maintaining of
the Tilt.</p>
                  <p>That he should be no flatterer of the King, or any other person, neither
take delight in skoffing, vpon paine to walke on foote for one moneth, and
be confined to his house another moneth.</p>
                  <p>That he should not complaine of any hurt, nor boast of his owne actes,
nor in curing his wounds crie Oh: for if in vaunting wise hee vttered any
oftentatious speeches, he should be reproued by the great master, and let
alone vnuisited of all his companions.</p>
                  <p>That he should be no common gamester, chiefly at the dice, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
that others should play in his house, vpon paine to forfeite for euery
such offence, one moneths pay, and for one moneth and a halfe not to be
seene in the Court.</p>
                  <p>That he should not in any sort lay to pawne his Armour or weapons,
nor play away his garments, vpon paine to be imprisoned in his owne
house a whole moneth, and for two moneths following, to goe without
the Band.</p>
                  <p>That he should be dayly apparelled in fine cloth, and on Holy dayes in
silke, and on high feastes weare gold in his garments if he pleased, without
being compelled so to do. But if he did weare buskins vpon nether stockes
of cloth, the great Master should take them from him, and giue them in
almes to the poore.</p>
                  <p>That in walking either in Court or Citie, his pace should not be swift
or hastie, vpon paine to be reproued of his fellow Knights, and punished
at the great Masters discretion.</p>
                  <p>That he should not speake any thing vnfit, or offensiue to his fellowe in
Armes, vpon paine to aske him forgiuenesse, and to be banished the Court
for three moneths.</p>
                  <p>That he should not commence or enter suite of Law against the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of any Knight, vpon paine neuer to haue Ladie or Gentlewoman of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17413:59"/>
Court to his mistresse or wife.</p>
                  <p>That if he happened to meete with any Ladie or Gentlewoman of the
Court, he should foorthwith alight from his horse, and offer her his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
vpon paine to loose one moneths wages, and the fauour of all La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>That if any Lady of honour required seruice at his hand, he refusing to
doe it (hauing power) should be called for euer, the discourteous Knight.</p>
                  <p>That hee should not eate alone, nor at any time feede vpon grosse
meates.</p>
                  <p>That he should not enter quarell with any of his fellow Knights: or if
any such disagreement did happen, that he nor any other Knight should
make partie, but by all good meanes seeke to reconcile them, vpon paine
to pay a marke towards the charge of the next Iusts.</p>
                  <p>That if any man not being of this Order, should presume to weare the
band, that then he should be forced to fight with two Knights: but van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing
them, should be also a Knight himselfe: and being vanquished,
should be banished the Court, and neuer to weare the Band.</p>
                  <p>That if at any Iusts or Turnaments in the Court, a Gentleman being not
of the Order, should winne the prize, then the King was bound forthwith
to make him a Knight of the Band.</p>
                  <p>That if any Knight of the Band did offer to drawe his sword against any
of his fellowes: for so doing he should absent himselfe two moneths, &amp; two
other moneths weare but halfe his band. And if a Knight did hurt his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in Armes, he should be imprisoned one halfe yeere, and the next halfe
yeere, be banished the Court.</p>
                  <p>That no Knight for any offence should be punished or iudged before he
were brought to the King, and his pleasure signified.</p>
                  <p>That he should be euer furnished to attend on the King, whensoeuer he
went to the warre: and if any battel were striken, then ought these Knights
ioyntly to giue the charge: and if in any such seruice a Knight performed
not his part, he should loose one yeres pay, and one other yeere weare but
halfe the Band.</p>
                  <p>That no Knight should be inforced to serue in any warre, saue onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Infidels: Or attending on the King to any other warre, to weare
no Band: and if he serued any other Prince in his warre, he should loose
the Band.</p>
                  <p>That all the Knights should assemble three times a yeere to consult vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
matters pertaining to the Order. The assembly was at such place as the
King pleased to appoint, and there they awaited with their horse and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;
the first meeting was in April, the second in September, the last at
Christmas.</p>
                  <p>That all the Knights of this Order, should fight at the Turney at the lest
twise euery yeere, Iust foure times a yeere, play at the Canes sixe times a
yeere, and mannage horses euery weeke. And who so failed to performe
all, or any one of these Knightly exercises, should attend on the King one
moneth without a sword, and one other moneth without a Band.</p>
                  <p>That if the King did come to any citie or towne, that then the Knights
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17413:60"/>
within eight dayes after, should prepare a place for the Iusts and Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
they should also exercise all other warlike weapons: and if any
Knight were negligent in these things, he should be confined to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and weare but halfe the Band.</p>
                  <p>That no Knight might remaine in Court without a mistresse, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to marry her, and not dishonour her, and whensoeuer she pleased to
walke, he was to attend on her on foote or horsebacke, to do her all honour
and seruice.</p>
                  <p>That if any Iusts were holden within tenne miles of the Court, euery
Knight to be there, vnder paine to goe without his sword one moneth, and
without his Band another.</p>
                  <p>That if any of these Knights were married within twentie miles of the
Court, all the rest should accompany him to the King to receiue a gift, and
from thence to the place of wedding to exercise feats of Armes there, and
euery Knight to present the bride with some gift.</p>
                  <p>That the first Sunday of euery moneth, all the Knights should shew
themselues armed before the King, ready to performe any action in Armes
at the Kings pleasure: for the King would not haue them be only Knights
in name, but in deed also.</p>
                  <p>That in no Turnament there should be more Knights then thirtie on
one partie, and so many on the other partie, and that no sword should be
brought into the place, but such as were rebated both of edge and point.
And that vpon the sound of trumpet, the fight should begin, and at the
sound of the Clarions, euery man to cease from fight, and retire, vpon paine
that who so failed, should neuer more enter into that combat, and be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
the Court for one moneth.</p>
                  <p>That at euery day of Iusts, ech Knight should passe foure <hi>Carieres,</hi> before
foure Knights appointed for Iudges, and they who brake no staues in those
courses, should pay the charges of the Iusts.</p>
                  <p>That if any Knight were sicke and in perill of death, all other his fellow
Knights should visit him, and exhort him to godlinesse. And if he died, to
accompany his course to the graue. Also to mourne in blacke one whole
moneth, and absent themselues from the Exercise of Armes, for the space
of three moneths, vnlesse the King should otherwise command.</p>
                  <p>That within two dayes after such funerall, all the Knights should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
and present the Band of the dead Knight vnto the King, making
humble sute for some of his sonnes to succeed, if any of them were meete,
praying it would please his Maiestie to be good to the mother, that she
might liue according to her honourable calling.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese Knights doe not much varie from the Knights of the
<hi>Rhodes,</hi> for their custome is to entertaine Pilgrims, and at
occasions to serue in warre.</p>
                  <p>The beginner of this Knighthood' was a certaine <hi>Almane,</hi>
who after the taking of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the Christians together
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17413:61"/>
with diuers other of that Nation remained there. This Almaine being
exceeding rich and maried, kept a franke and liberall house, relieuing all
passengers and Pilgrims that trauelled to <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> insomuch that his
house became as an Hospitall or place of ordinary accesse. At length he
builded nere vnto it a faire Church, which (according to the vse of that
time) he did dedicate to our Lady.</p>
                  <p>Not long after many Christians resorting thither, as well for loue of
the Christian Religion, as to visit the sicke, they resolued to erect a frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
and hauing chosen a great Master to be gouernour, ordained that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man of that association, should bee apparelled in white, and vpon
their vppermost garment weare a blacke Crosse, voided with a Crosse
potence.</p>
                  <p>It was also agreed, that no man should be admitted into that order, saue
onely Gentlemen of the Duch nation: and they to protest at all occasions
to aduenture their liues in defence of Christs Gospel.</p>
                  <p>About 88 yeers after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had remained in the Christians hands, it
was taken againe from them by the <hi>Saracens</hi> in the yeere 1184 since which
time it neuer was recouered. For which cause these Knights retired to <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaida,</hi>
where they remained.</p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Ptolemaida,</hi> being also taken by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> they returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Germanie</hi> their naturall countrey; where, after some short abode (as loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
rest and idlenesse) they went vnto <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second then Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the yeere 1220, to let his Maiestie vnderstand, that the people of
<hi>Prusia</hi> vsed incursions vpon the confines of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> adding that those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were barbarous idolaters without the knowledge of God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
besought his Maiesty to grant them leaue to make warre vpon them at
their owne charges, yet with condition that whatsoeuer they gained, his
Maiesty would giue the same to the maintenance of that Order.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour allowing of that suite, presently granted them the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
and vnder his seale confirmed the gift.</p>
                  <p>These Knights by this donation much encouraged, forthwith tooke
Armes, and within short space subdued all that prouince, and then passed
the riuer of <hi>Vistola,</hi> and conquered other people, who became their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
and were made Christians.</p>
                  <p>Within short space after, these Knights builded diuers Churches, and
among the same Cathedrall Temples, making them places of residence for
Bishops, who were also enioyned to weare the habit of that Order.</p>
                  <p>Neere vnto the riuer <hi>Vistola</hi> was a great Oke, where these Knights buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the first Castle and Towne, which with time was encreased and called
<hi>Borgo di Santa Maria,</hi> or <hi>Mareenburg,</hi> where is now the chiefe Church
appertaining to this Order: there unto belongeth so great riches and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
as these Knights may both for men and money compare with diuers
Princes.</p>
                  <p>This countrey of <hi>Prussia</hi> is great, and much thereof bounded by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

warre among the Princes of <hi>Italy)</hi> certaine rich Gentlemen
of <hi>Bolognia</hi> and <hi>Modona,</hi> desiring to eschew the present trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and be exempt from publique charges, desired of that
Pope to permit them to liue in contemplation, &amp; erect a new
Order of religious Knighthood, which for money they obtained, calling

The habit of this Order was very pompous, and thereupon a red Crosse
wrought with gold round about.</p>
                  <p>They were specially inhibited to weare gold in their spurres and horse
harnesse.</p>
                  <p>They made profession to fight against the Infidels, and all others that
offended iustice: notwithstanding they liued euer at home in rest, with
their wiues and children.</p>
                  <p>They were commonly called <hi>Caualieri di Madona:</hi> but because they
liued continually in ease and pleasure, men termed them <hi>Fratri gaudenti:</hi>

                  <head>The Prooeme.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit, in ages more ancient, Princes
were sometimes pleased to admit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Combate and triall by armes: yet
euen then the lawes determined, that
no man of base calling could be allowed
to fight with any Gentleman, or other
person by long seruice or vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
Noble.</p>
                  <p>It behoueth therefore to know what
Nobilitie and Gentilitie is. Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
enformed that Nobilitie is (as some haue defined it) ancient riches
accompanied with vertuous qualities. Others affirme that riches (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their owne nature vile) cannot make men Noble; concluding that
vertue alone sufficeth <hi>Bartholus</hi> sayth, that vertue onely maketh a
man Noble, and riches is an ornament thereof.</p>
                  <p>Others doe thinke, that Nobilitie proceedeth from the ancient honor,
fame and title of Predecessors: because (other wise) a bondman (being
vertuous) might challenge that honour. Some also haue thought, that as
before God he is most Noble and worthy, vnto whom he hath giuen most
grace, euen so is he most Honourable among men, whom Princes or lawes
haue aduanced vnto dignitie. Howsoeuer it be, most sure it is, that no
man giueth vnto himselfe any title, but it behooueth him to receiue it
from others. Therefore <hi>Bartholus</hi> concludeth that to be made Noble,
it is requisite the Prince should bestow some sort of dignitie, office, or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
vpon the person that is ennobled, to the end he may be knowne from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. But our opinion is, that men may be reputed Noble by three
meanes. First by nature or descent of Ancestors, which is the vulgar
opinion. Secondly for vertue onely, which the Philosophers affirme.
Thirdly by mixture of Auncient Noble blood with vertue, which is indeed
the true and most commendable kind of Nobilitie. For seeing man is a
creature reasonable, hee ought be Noble in respect of his owne vertue,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17413:66"/>
and not the vertue of others, which moued <hi>Vlysses</hi> to say vnto <hi>Aiax,</hi>
boasting of Ancestors,
<q>Et genus, &amp; Proauos, &amp; quae non fecimus ipsi,
Vix ea nostra voco. &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for manifestation that naturall Nobilitie mixed with vertue, is
most true and perfect, thus may it be prooued. The Almighty hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
all things, both in generalitie and specialitie, with a certaine excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and bountie, one more perfect then the other, one noble, another igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For among stones some are precious, others of no vertue, &amp; of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sort of them, some more or lesse precious: Euen so among liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
both in generality &amp; specialitie, we find some courteous and gentle,
others rude and vnciuill. Much more is the difference of nature in men,
among whom the eternall God hath dispensed his grace, to some more,
and to some lesse, according to his diuine will and pleasure. VVherefore
they seeme to erre much, that thinke Gentility in nature hath no force,
when experience proueth that of one race we see wise, iust, valiant, and
temperate persons. Yet because in ordinarie obseruation we finde, that
neither the horse of excellent courage doth alwayes beget another of like
qualitie, nor that the vertuous man hath euer children resembling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
we doe not (hauing proofe of their degeneration) esteeme the one or
the other: as <hi>Iuuenal</hi> sayth,
<q>
                        <l>Malo Pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tu sis</l>
                        <l>Aeacidae similis, Vulcaniaque arma capessas,</l>
                        <l>Quà m te Thersitae similem producat Achilles.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seeing then that either by nature, nurture, or endeuour, some men
are more vertuous then others, therefore ought they bee reputed more
Gentle, Noble and worthy honour, then are those which are void of noble
Ancestors, good education and industrie. No rule is so generall or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
but sometime receiueth exception. Yet appeareth it, that Nature in
her owne operation doth seldome digresse from the order thereof. The
Faulcon neuer (or very rarely) bringeth forth other bird then a Faulcon.
The Greyhound engendereth a whelpe like vnto himselfe. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
if either that bird in shape resembling her Dame, hath not in her
like vertue: or that whelpe doth prooue in delight, diuers from his Sire,
they thereby become either contemned, or little esteemed: Euen so is it
among men descending from Ancestors of honour and vertue: for if
neither by celestiall grace, nurture nor endeuour they aspire vnto the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
of vertue, then become they thereby vnfit for all publike action, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
to themselues, and consequently disdained, or at the least,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17413:66"/>
lightly regarded, what Pedigree, Armes, or Badges soeuer are to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant

For whensoeur matters of great importance had
beene duely examined, and the trueth could not appeare
otherwise then by Gods iudgement; in such cases the combat was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
yet with this caution, that the combatants were first sworne, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fraud, and for triall of trueth, the same should be performed.</p>
                  <p>The matters of those combats were chiefly these.</p>

These and some other doubts, mooued the Lombards to graunt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or answer to this question, I will vse the opinion of <hi>Ioannes
Iacobus Triuultius,</hi> who beeing Colonell generall of the
French Kings forces, hearing a man at Armes to refuse the
challenge of a foot souldier, said that he ought not, because
euery souldier being enrolled, and in the Kings pay, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
a gentleman: <hi>quontam ex militia oritur nobilitas.</hi> Euery small disequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
ought not make difference chiefly where God is Iudge: before whom
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17413:68"/>
is no difference of persons. Moreouer if that exception were generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
no challenge should be at all, because none, or very few are equall;
for some are honourable, as they that haue receiued dignitie from the
Prince: other are gentlemen, whose title the Armes of their Ancestors do
warrant. Others for vertuc haue deserued same, and are reputed noble.
<hi>Plancus</hi> and other ancient writers do say, that <hi>Nobilis est, quasi notus.</hi> Hardly
therefore are gentlemen found, that by all these meanes can warrant their
Nobilitie. Better it is therefore to iustifie honour by Armes, then incurre
suspition of viletie, or stand vpon curious points of pedegrees. What good
could <hi>Plancus</hi> haue, when puffed with pride, he boasted himselfe to descend
of the high house of <hi>Drusis.</hi> And <hi>Iuuenal</hi> saith:
<q>Nobilitas veraest at<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> vnica virtus.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Much doubt hath also bene made, whether a man of meaner title may
challenge a greater: as when an Earle challengeth a Duke, whether lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he may so do. Of this matter diuers men haue thought diuersly. <hi>Paris</hi> the
doctor saith, That a gentleman borne, and of three descents, may fight or
challenge a Duke vpon any iniurie to him done. The reason thereof is,
That a Duke offering iniurie, maketh him to whom it is offered his equall,
and able to encounter him in Armes, which otherwise he ought not be.</p>
                  <p>But this opinion the Lawiers of later time do not allow. For as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie
criminall, persons illustrious, and of great title, may answere by
Proctor, so may they in combat appeare by Champion.</p>
                  <p>Otherwise it ought be, where both the Challenger and Defender be
<hi>Illustri</hi> and <hi>tituler</hi> personages; for in that case, although they are not euen
of one degree, yet being both Noble, the greater Lord cannot refuse to
fight with the inferiour. For which reason an Earle may not be repulsed
by a Marquize, or a Duke, because they are both Right honorable, though
of diuers title. Yet is it not fit, that priuate Gentlemen or Barons should
challenge a great Marquize. A Gentleman of three descents, and such a
one as hath employed his life in Armes, ought not be refused to fight with
men of worship, because the inequalitie of their dignities is not great: and
such is the opinion of <hi>Paris.</hi>

                  <p>It hath bene therefore ordeined and determined, that no man hauing

                  <p>Finally, whosoeuer is defamed of any notable crime, or is by the law of

that lawfully are repulsed: these men I say, challenging any Gentleman or

because in fighting with men of such condition, a man of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
doth equll himselfe vnto persons vtterly vnworthy. Yet true it
is, that whosoeuer repulseth a person for cause of infamie, must assuredly
know, that he hath bene for such crimes condemned, or at the least the
same is a thing so notorious, as the partie repulsed cannot denie it. But
if any such infamous man be challenged by a Gentleman or souldier, he
may not after be refused, vnlesse that after challenge, he committeth some

                  <p>Whosoeuer was vanquished within the Lists, was the prisoner of him

                  <p>The vanquished might be forced to pay ransome, no lesse then if he had
bene a prisoner of the warre. But if the prisoner did serue the vanquisher,
the space of fiue yeeres, in seruices meete for a Gentleman, then was he
set at libertie without paiment. And if in the meane time he were emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in any base action or seruice vnworthie his degree, then was it lawfull
for him to escape and breake prison: Or if it happened that during the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
any land or other wealth did come vnto him, yet was it not
lawfull for the victour to increase the ransome.</p>

                  <p>If being in this sort at liberty, he hapned to become a Prince, or a Lord,

the obligation of honour was preferred before all other respects.</p>
                  <p>Whosoeuer was borne Noble (vnder which word is comprised all

And because the profession of armes is honourable, an old souldier

any other Potentate, may refuse to fight with any person being a subiect
notwithstanding he hath the title of Prince, Duke or Marquesse. Here is
to be noted, that these titles of honour were at the first giuen in office, as
the title of Duke was proper vnto him that was a Generall of the Armie.
A Marquesse was he vnto whome the confine or marches of a countrey
or kingdome was committed. An Earle or Count was a Iudge or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
in peace, and of them in the ancient Emperours seruice were diuers, as
the Countes <hi>Palatine</hi> were as stewards of the Emperors house, of his court,
or stable, and euery of them might challenge any Prince, Duke, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
being a subiect, because they are in respect of subiection, reputed
none other then Barons.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman well borne, and descended from Parentage of foure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
may fight with any Earle or Baton, in case of treason to his Prince
or Countrey, and also murther and infidelitie: because they are (besides
their dignity) none other then Gentlemen, and Gentilitie or Nobilitie is
hereditary and cannot be taken away, but dignitie may. But in other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
of lesse importance, the Earle in respect of his dignitie, may fight by
Champion, but in the cases aforesaid he shall fight in person, vnlesse he be
aged, lame, or otherwise disabled.</p>

A Captaine Generall of an Armie Emperiall or Royall, may not be
challenged by any Gentleman or Lord, neither ought the gouernour of

abandoned for priuate respect. The like is to be vnderstood of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,

Combat (vnlesse vpon quarell of infidelitie) should bee
tried with shields and staues, and with no other weapon. But
the matter of their Combats was onely for triall of trueth,
without respect of honour. Howsoeuer it were, besides
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17413:71"/>
that custome must be receiued for lawe, it seemeth to me that either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
or priuate fight, such weapons ought bee vsed as are commonly
worne of Gentlemen and others professing Armes. And touching Armes
defensiue, it hath beene also the vse, that as they are thought allowable in
warre and all generall fights, so in particular trial of Armes, they ought not
be reiected, because fortitude accompanied with prudence is much the
more commendable, seeing he that vnwisely or inconsiderately aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himselfe, is not to bee reputed valiant, but furious: neither is hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
valiant, that without counsell or cause, delighteth in dangers,
but he that neuer doth shun any generous action, tending to publique be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
or his owne priuate reputation. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, that a valiant
man doth neither feare all things, nor dare doe all things. For these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
it hath euer bene thought fit, that in particular Combats, the Figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
should be allowed Armes defensiue, and not performe the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and vtterly disarmed, with swords and daggers onely, as is in this part
of the world now vsed. And sith the perill of life is no lesse in particular
then in publique fight, it seemeth very reasonable that defensiue Armes
should be allowed, yet so as both the challenger and defender be equally
armed and weaponed, which in trueth ought be at the election of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
as heretofore hath bene discoursed. But because the custome of
the land is, and happily also lawe forbideth that any man should be armed
saue onely in the warre, I thinke no Gentleman ought to refuse to fight
disarmed. And here will I not omit to remember an abuse which hardly is
discontinued, I meane that some English gentleman are so obstinately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to custome, as notwithstanding they doe themselues enter quarrell
and be challengers, yet wil they vse that sort of weapon only which please
themselues. An opinion contrary vnto reason, and the vse of all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as though ancient vse made that weapon onely allowable, which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will also prooue vice as good as vertue, because it is no lesse ancient.</p>

vnto him that is chalenged, because hee being accused and
constrained to fight, iust and true reason willeth that hee
should enioy all honest fauour. It hath bene therefore well
determined, that whosoeuer is defender, doeth sufficiently
acquite himselfe, and ought be reputed victorious, if hee be not victored.
But on the other side, he that challengeth, must not onely escape to be van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished,
but also vanquish his enemie: for otherwise he shall be reputed as
victored, and lose the quarell. Which seemeth very reasonable, because his
office is to proue: But the defender is not bound to more then defend.</p>
                  <p>Another fauour also appertaineth to the desender, which is, the election
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17413:71"/>
of the weapon, because, if another man will voluntarily call me to triall of
the sword, the choice of the weapon ought of right to be mine. Yet true it
is, that no defender ought to make election of other Armes either defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue
or offensiue, then such as are lawfull, and worne ordinarily by gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Souldiers. Therewith also is to be obserued, that if the question
whereupon the Combat or fight groweth may be decided by ciuill triall,
that then no trial of Armes ought be enterprised. Much more also may be
added touching the equalitie or disequalitie of the persons that enter into
fight, and likewise of the Armes aswell defensiue as offensiue: but because
publique Combats are now almost generally forbidden, and in this land
most rarely vsed, I speake onely of those things which are to bee knowen

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F two men at Armes do couenant to fight on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
and runne ten courses with sharpe Launces,
and that hee who worst performeth those courses,
should be iudged victored and prisoner to the other:
It happeneth that at the second course, the one of
them falleth from his horse, and suddenly recouering
to horsebacke offereth to performe the rest of the
courses. The question is, whether it be lawfull for him
so to do, or by the fall be reputed a prisoner? Whereunto is answered, that
in a challenge for life and death, no man ought be accompted vanquished
vnlesse he be slaine, or forced with his owne mouth to yeeld, or deny those
words whereupon the quarell groweth: yet otherwise it is, when the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
or Combat is for honour onely, loue of Ladies, or exercise of Armes,
because in that case notwithstanding the Runners be determined vpon a
certaine number of courses, yet if at the first, or after (before those courses
be all performed) any of them do fall, hee that receiueth the fall shall loose
the honour, and the other depart with victory.</p>
                  <p>Two gentlemen being come into the field to fight for life, the one in
fighting happeneth to fall, the other presently sitteth vpon him, and saith,
Yeeld thy selfe; He that lieth vnder, saith like words, and therewith woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his enemie lying vpon him, who feeling his griefe mortal, striketh the
other in the throat. He that was first fallen, ariseth and walketh, shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they both die. The question is, which of them ought to be iudged vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious.
Albeit no dead man can require iudgement of victory, yet to the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17413:72"/>
of them ought receiue most honour.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto may be sayd, that the hand being a member most necessary
for fight, and placed much higher then the legge: therefore the losse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is of more importance, and consequently dishonourable. On the other
side is alledged, that seeing the legge is of as great necessitie, so as without
it he is disabled to serue either on horse or foote: therfore he who becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
hurt and lame in that part, receiueth most dishonour; and the more,
for that no Arte can supply that want, as in the hand it may. But I referre
the true deciding of this doubt vnto the wise and learned reader.</p>
                  <p>Two Gentlemen come to fight for life: the challenger being left handed
is maymed on that hand, the other being right handed looseth it. Which
of them ought receiue most dishonour?</p>
                  <p>It seemeth that in this case the losses and harmes are equall: for he who
was left handed, being maimed on that side, is depriued of that hand which
hee vsed chiefly, and was no lesse apt for him, then the right hand is vnto
the enemie. And sith it is the office of the Challenger not only to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
but also offend and proue in not doing more to preiudice the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
then that harme himselfe receiueth: therfore the chalenger (although
hee looseth but a left hand) is in this case most dishonoured. Yet because
the exercise of these mens hands were of like necessitie, I thinke (vnder
correction) the iudgement ought to rest as indifferent.</p>
                  <p>Two Gentlemen in performing a combat on foot, are hurt in places
equall: the question is, whether of them is victorious.</p>
                  <p>We haue in the former question said, that where two fighters be equally
hurt, the challenger should depart with dishonour, because hee hath not
prooued that which he tooke in hand, which is to vanquish the defender:
therefore the drawing the enemies blood, and the manner thereof is to be
considered. If then the one be hurt on the right arme, and the other on the
left, it may seeme there is none aduantage: for as the right hand is apt to
offend in fight, so the left hand is no lesse fit to defend. Notwithstanding,
for that the vse of the right hand is both more necessary and ordinary, hee
who is hurt thereof, ought to be adiudged vnto most dishonour, chiefly
in combat for life. For in the exercise of Armes for honor only, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ought lye dead, or else he shall be thought victorious that most man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performed his part, or that regardeth least the wound, or that most
cunningly doth handle his weapon. The qualitie of the hurts is also to be
considered, which of them is more or lesse mortall; likewise which mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is more or lesse to be regarded.</p>
                  <p>Foure Gentlemen determined to fight on horsebacke for triall of trueth
and life, did enter into the Lists: the one partie doe both charge one of the
aduersaries reputed a man of small force, yet valiantly defending himselfe,
did hurt one of the assailers: and his companion seeing the matter so han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,
suddenly dismounteth, and with his Launce woundeth the other of
his enemies in the backe, and forceth the one of them to denie his words:
he that denied, fleeth out of the Lists, perswading his fellow being first hurt
to abide there, saying it was more honourable to die within, then without
the Lists. Hee who forced the enemy to flee, pursued him, but not able to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:17413:72"/>
take him, a question was mooued, which party ought be accounted victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
because on either party one was hurt, and the other two went out of
the Lists without licence of the Iudge. Whereto may be said:</p>
                  <p>That he who denied, ought with his companion to loose the honour:
for albeit one of the enemies did also leaue the Lists, yet his intent therein
was to pursue his foe being fled thence: and forsomuch as the combat was
for matter of treason, it sufficeth not onely for the victorious to vanquish
the enemy, but also to bring him into the power of the Iudge to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.
And it is plaine, that seeing of the one party one was hurt, and the
other fled, they ought to be iudged to loose all honour, and be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as guilty of that whereupon the quarell was mooued.</p>
                  <p>Seuen Gentlemen doe compound with seuen other, to run certaine
courses at the Tilt for honor and loue of Ladies: in which match, it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that fiue of the one partie did commendably acquite themselues, but
the other two of that side were ouerthrowen. On the other side, two only
perfourmed their courses well, and the rest of that company exceeding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,
losing many Lances, and running very foule: whereof a question grew,
whether vnto fiue well doers, and two euill, or vnto two well doers with
fiue euil, the honour ought to be allotted.</p>
                  <p>Albeit in this case much may be spoken: yet for that the question is not
of any particular mans merit, but which partie in generall performed best
the enterprize, it may be alleaged, that the partie wherein were most wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers
ought to haue the honour, notwithstanding the fall of two of their
companions: yet for so much as the fall from horsebacke by the enemies
force or vertue is most reprochefull, it seemeth that the misaduenture of
two men onely, may reasonably be the losse of honour to all the rest. And
therefore we leaue the iudgement of this doubt vnto wise men, better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
in Armes.</p>
                  <p>Two gentlemen being in combat for life, the Challenger taketh the
sword of the Defender from him, notwithstanding the Defender most va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly
defendeth himselfe with his arme and hands all the whole day, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time he could not be forced either to denie, yeeld, or be slaine.
A question thereupon arose, whether of them was victorious.</p>
                  <p>Forasmuch as this Combat was for life, and that in euery fight of such
nature, no victory is fully gained vntill the Defender is slaine, or els forced
to yeeld or denie; it seemeth that he is not to be iudged guiltie, not hauing
done any of these, although his sword were lost, which indeed in all mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
exercises, and feates of Armes is a thing much to be discommended.
But most certaine it is, that in all Combats and actions, for honor, loue,
and praise onely, whosoeuer loseth his sword, must presently also lose the
honor and victory.</p>
                  <p>Two Gentlemen fighting for life within the Listes, the one yeeldeth
himselfe a prisoner. Whether may the Prince of the place (who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
is elected a Iudge) saue the life of him that is vanquished. Hereunto
may be answered:</p>
                  <p>That albeit euery prisoner appertaineth vnto his taker, yet hath it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
bene vsed, that the victorious haue presented their prisoners vnto
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17413:73"/>
the Prince, to be disposed at his good pleasure, who in recompense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
doe vse according to the magnanimous mindes of such persons, not
onely to pay the charges of the victorious, but also in signe of clemencie
and mercie, set the infortunate prisoner freely at libertie. As did the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England,</hi> vnto <hi>Iohn Visconti,</hi> who in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence

of battell, which was to be performed within forty dayes next following,
whereunto both the Challenger and Defender condscended. Then were
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17413:74"/>
the Combattants commaunded to bring in sufficient pledges for suertie,
that they and euery of them should appeare, and performe the combat,
betwixt the sunne rising, and going done of the day appointed for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirall
of their pledges, and that they nor any of them, should doe or cause
to be done any molestation, damage, assault or subtiltie against the person

                     <p>THe Kings pleasure being signified vnto the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stable &amp; Marshal, they
caused Lists or Rayles to be made, and set vp in length threescore pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

was euer vpon plaine and drie ground, without ridges, hilles, or other
impediments. At either end of the Lists was made a gate or place of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,
with a strong barre to keepe out the people. For the guarding of either
gate one Sergeant at Armes was appointed, and commanded not to suffer
any man to approch within foure foote. The one gate opened towards the
East, the other towards the West, being strongly barred with a raile of

                     <p>THe Challenger did commonly come to the East gate of the Lists, and
brought with him such armors as were appointed by the Court, and
wherewith he determined to fight. Being at the gate, there he stayed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
such time as the Constable and Marshall arose from their seate, and
went thither. They being come to the said gate of the Lists, &amp; beholding
the Challenger there, the Constable said, For what cause art thou come
hither thus armed? and what is thy name? vnto whom the Challenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
thus: My name is A. B. and am hither come armed and mounted,
to performe my challenge against G. D. and acquit my pledges. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I humbly desire this gate may be opened, and I suffered to performe
my intent and purpose. Then the Constable did open the visor of his
headpeece to see his face, and thereby to knowe that man to be he who
makes the challenge.</p>
                     <p>These Ceremonies ended, the Constable commanded the gate of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17413:74"/>
Lists to be opened, whereat the armed man with his necessaries and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
entered. From thence he was brought before the King, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
vntill such time as the Defender was come thither.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the Defender appearing did make request vnto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
and Marshal, desiring they would be pleased to deliuer and discharge
his pledges. Whereupon the said Constable and Marshall did humbly
desire the King to release them, because the Defender is alreadie come, and
presented before his Maiestie, there to performe his duetie.</p>
                     <p>But in case the Defender did not come at time conuenient in the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
then did the King deliuer his pleasure vnto the Constable, and
he reported the same vnto the Marshall, who forthwith did giue order vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lieutenant, that the Defender should presently bee called to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by the Herald Marshall of the King of the South, called <hi>Clarencieux:</hi>
and in case the Herauld Marshall of the King of the South was not present,
then was the proclamation made by some other Herauld. But if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
were performed in the North, on the other side of the Riuer of Trent,
in the circuit of the King of the North called <hi>Norrey,</hi> then was his Marshall
to make proclamation. The words whereof were to this effect.</p>
                     <p>Oiez, G. D. Defendant in this Combat, appeare now, for in this day
thou hast taken vpon thee to acquit thy pledges in presence of the Lords,
Constable and Marshall, and also defend thy person against A. B. who
challenged thee to maintaine the cause of this Combat.</p>
                     <p>This Proclamation was made thrice at euery corner of the Lists: but if
at the second time the partie appeared not, then the Herauld did adde
these words: The day passeth, and therefore come without delay. And if
in case the said Defendant appeared not before noone, but stayed vntil the
third houre after, then did the Herauld by commandement of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
and Marshall, in the beginning of the proclamation say, A. B. ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
in haste, and saue thine honour, for the day is well neere spent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
thou didst promise to performe thine enterprise.</p>
                     <p>It was also vsed that the Constables Clerke, should in a booke record
the houre of the Combattants appearing within the Lists, either on foot
or on horsebacke, in what sort they were armed, of what colour the horses
were, and how they were in all points furnished.</p>
                     <p>It was also anciently vsed, that the Constable moued the King in fauour
of the Combattants, to knowe whether his Maiestie were pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
any of his Nobility or other seruants of reputation, to assist them for
counsell in combat.</p>
                     <p>The Constable and Marshall did suruey the Launces and other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
wherewith the combat should be performed, making them equall,
and of euen measure.</p>
                     <p>The Constable also appointed two Knights or Esquires vnto the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger,
to keepe the place free from impediments: the like was also done for
the Defender.</p>
                     <p>The Constable did also moue the King, to know whether his Maiestie
in person would take the Oathes of the fighters, or giue him and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
authority to doe it out of his presence.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:17413:75"/>
The Constable also did send the Marshall vnto the Challenger, and his
counsell to make ready his Oath, declaring that after that ceremonie all
protestations should be voide.</p>
                     <p>After these preparations, the Constable caused his Clerke to bring
foorth the booke, whereupon the Combattants were solemnely sworne.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The first Oath.</head>
                     <p>THe Constable hauing caused his Clerke to reade the Challengers bill,
and calling him by his name, sayd, Doest thou conceiue the effect of
this Bill? Here is also thine owne Gauntlet of defiance. Thou shalt sweare

thou maintaine it so to be, vpon the person of thine aduersary, as God shall

                     <p>The Oath thus taken, hee was led backe vnto his former place, and the
Constable did cause the Marshall to produce the Defender, who tooke
the like Oath. This Oath was euer taken the parties kneeling, vnlesse it
pleased the Constable and Marshall to pardon that duetie.</p>

and that neither of them <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should put affiance or trust in any
thing other then God, and their owne valors, as God and the holy Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
should helpe them. That done they were both sent to their places
of entrie.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The third Oath was thus.</head>
                     <p>THe combattants being againe called, were commanded by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
to take one the other by the hand, and lay their left hands vpon

prooue thine affirmation, either by death or deniall of thine aduersary,
before hee departeth these Lists, and before the Sunne goeth downe this
day, as God and the holy Euangelists shall helpe thee.</p>
                     <p>The very same Oath in like manner vsed, was offered vnto the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
&amp; that done, the combatants returned vnto their places, their friends,
and counsellors.</p>
                     <p>These ceremonies ended, the Herauld by commandement of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
and Marshall, did make proclamation at foure corners of the Listes,
thus: <hi>Oiez, Oiez:</hi> We charge and commaund in the name of the King, the
Constable and Marshall, that no man of what estate, title, or degree soeuer,
shall approach the Lists neerer then foure foote in distance, nor shall vtter
any speech, word, voice, or countenance, wherby either the Challenger or
Defender may take aduantage vpon paine of losse of life, liuing, and goods,
to be taken at the Kings good pleasure.</p>
                     <p>Then the Constable and Marshall assigned a place conuenient within
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:17413:75"/>
the Lists, where the Kings of Armes, Heraulds, and other Officers should
stand and be ready if they were called: for afterwards, all things were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
vnto their charge as well on the behalfe of the defender as the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenger,
as if any thing were forgotten in their confessions, either touching
their lands or consciences; or that any of them desired to eate or drinke:
all those wants were supplyed by the Heraulds and none other.</p>
                     <p>But here is to be noted, that no meate or drinke might be giuen to the
Challenger, without leaue first asked of the Defender, who commonly did
not deny the request. And after the Herauld went vnto the Constable and
Marshall, and made them priuy thereunto, desiring their fauours, that the
combattants might eate, drinke, or ease their bodies, if need were.</p>
                     <p>After these orders taken, the Constable and Marshall did auoid the Lists
of all sorts of persons, saue onely one Knight and two Esquiers armed, to
attend the Constable: and the like number to await on the Marshall, either
of them hauing in his hand a Launce without head, ready to depart the
Combattants, if the King did command.</p>
                     <p>Of more ancient time the Constable and Marshal vsed to haue certaine
Lieutenants and seruants within the Lists. Also the one part to keepe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on one side, and the others to looke vnto the other side. And if the
Queene happened to behold the combat, then the Constable and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
awaited on the Kings side, and their Lieutenants attended on the
Queene.</p>
                     <p>Then did the Constable alone, sitting downe before the King, send his
Lieutenant to the Challenger to come vnto him, and the Marshall with
his Lieutenant did accompany the Defender.</p>
                     <p>The Constable thus set, did pronounce his speech with a loud voice:
<hi>Let them goe, let them goe, let them goe,</hi> and doe their best.</p>
                     <p>Vpon which words pronounced, in the Kings presence, the Challenger
did march towards the Defender to assaile him furiously, and the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
himselfe for defence, as best he might.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time, the Constable and Marshall with their Lieutenants,
stood circumspectly to heare and see if any worde, signe, or voice of yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
were vttered by either of the fighters, and also to be ready if the King
should command the Lances to be let fall, to depart the fight.</p>
                     <p>The Constable and Marshall did also take regard, that the Challenger
and Defender should appeare at the day and houre appointed, whether
they had about them any engine, or other vnlawfull things, as charmes or
enchantment: yet was it lawfull both for the Challenger and Defender, to
be as well and surely armed as they could. And if any of them would haue
his sword shorter then the Standard, yet was not the other bound to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aue
his cut to that measure, if he required that fauour of the Court. But if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one or the others sword passed the Standerd, then was that ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality
to be reformed, or if they were both ouer long, both ought be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                     <p>It had beene also in more ancient time vsed, that the Constable &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
should foresee, that if the Kings pleasure was to depart the fight, and
suffer the combatants to rest before the combat ended, that they should be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17413:76"/>
parted in due time, when no aduantage were. Likewise that they should
take heed that none of them should priuatly speake vnto the other of yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or otherwise. For vnto the Constable and Marshall appertained the
witnessing and record of all things.</p>
                     <p>And in case the combat were for question of treason, he that was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
should be forthwith disarmed within the Lists, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement
of the Constable and the Marshall. Also the armour and weapons of the
vanquished was in one end of the Lists defaced, to his disgrace; and after,
the same drawen out together with his horse. From thence also the man
vanquished was drawne vnto the place of execution, to be there headed
or hanged, according to the custome of the countrey.</p>
                     <p>The performance of all which punishment appertained onely to the
Marshall, who ought see all things done in his owne presence. And in case
the Chalenger did not vanquish the Enemy, then ought he suffer the same
paines that are due to the Defender, if he were vanquished. But if the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
were vpon a crime of lesse importance, the party vanquished should
not be drawen vnto the place of execution, but onely led thither to receiue
death or other punishment, according to the quality of the crime.</p>
                     <p>If the combat were onely for triall of vertue or honour, he that was van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished
therein, should be disarmed, and put out of the Lists without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
punishment.</p>
                     <p>If it happened that the King would take the quarell into his hand, and
make peace betweene the parties without longer fight; then did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
lead the one, and the Marshall the other out of the Listes at seuerall
gates, armed and mounted as they were, hauing speciall regard, that neither
of them should goe the one before the other. For the quarell resting in the
Kings hand, night not be renued, or any violence offered without preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
vnto the Kings honour. And because it is a point very speciall in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Armes, that he who leaueth the Lists first incurreth a note of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
therfore to depart the Lists in due time was euer precisely obserued,
were the combat for treason, or other cause whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>It is also to be remembred, that without the principall Lists were euer
certaine counterlists, betwixt which two, the seruants of the Constable
and Marshall did stand. There stood also the Kings Sergeants at Armes, to
see and consider if any default or offence were committed contrary to the
proclamation of the Court, against the Kings royall Maiesty, or the Lawe
of Armes. Those men were euer armed at all peeces.</p>
                     <p>The seruants of the Constable and Marshall had charge of the place,
and good order thereof. The Kings Sergeants tooke care to keep the gates
of the Lists, and be there ready to make arrest of any person, when they
should be commaunded by the Constable or Marshall. The fees of the
Marshall were all horses, peeces of Armour, or other furniture that fell to
the ground, after the Combattants did enter into the Lists, aswell from the
Challenger as the Defender. But all the rest appertained to the partie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious,
whether he were Challenger or Defender.</p>
                     <p>The Barres, Posts, Railes, and euery other part of the Lists were also the
fees of the Marshall.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Arro</hi> saith, That Princes and great Captaines being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to <hi>Rome</hi> with victory, were allowed to passe with their
armie through the citie vnto the Capitall, singing <hi>Io. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe:
Io. Triumphe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first inuentour of Triumphes was <hi>Liber Pater,</hi> as
<hi>Pliny</hi> saith. Yet certaine it is, (and so by lawe prouided)
that no man should be admitted to Triumph, vnlesse he had vanquished
full fiue thousand enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Martius</hi> (Tribunes of the people) by law also decreed, that
who so vntruely reported the enterprize he had done, should incurre pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement.
Therefore entring into the citie, euery Triumpher did first come
before the <hi>Questors,</hi> and deliuer his actions in writing, and sweare they
were true.</p>
                  <p>It was likewise by law prouided, and by custome also obserued, that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for recouery of dominion, no man should bee permitted to triumph.
Which was the cause that neither <hi>Publius Scipio</hi> for the recouery of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
not <hi>Marcus Marcellus</hi> for taking of <hi>Syracusa,</hi> were suffered to triumph.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:17413:77"/>
The first that imitated <hi>Liber Pater</hi> in triumphing was <hi>Titus Tatius,</hi> when
he triumphed for victory of the <hi>Sabini,</hi> yet was that no full triumph, but
(as they called it) <hi>Ouante,</hi> because his victorie was not great, and without
blood. For the same reason the crowne he ware, was made of Myrtel,
which euer after was the crowne of all Captains that triumphed for victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of meane reputation.</p>
                  <p>In that age also it was vnlawfull for any man to triumph, vnlesse he were
a Dictator, a Consull, or a Praetor. Therefore <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> being Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
although he had performed great seruices in <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet was he not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to enter <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Ouante.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Afterwards <hi>Scipio</hi> most instantly required to triumph, hauing deserued
great glory, but till that time no man (without office) had triumphed.</p>
                  <p>Likewise <hi>C. Manlius,</hi> by the base people elected the first Dictator, by
their commandement also without allowance of the <hi>Patritij,</hi> did triumph.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Gneus Pompeius</hi> a Gentleman Romaine, before he was of age to be
Consull, triumphed twise.</p>
                  <p>Another law or custome there was, that no Captaine might triumph,
vntill he had brough backe the armie: and therewith also deliuered the
country of his charge, quiet, into the hand of his successour. For <hi>Lucius
Manlius</hi> the Consull, hauing effected great victories in <hi>Spaine,</hi> was (in the
Hall of <hi>Bellona</hi>) denied to triumph, because the countrey where he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
was not in peace, as <hi>Liuie</hi> reporteth.</p>

and <hi>Vespatian,</hi> and likewise by that of <hi>L. Verus Antoninus</hi>
made of marble, yet extant in <hi>Rome.</hi> This Arke was drawen
by foure white horses. Others vsed in their chariots white
Buls or Elephants. As <hi>Pompei</hi> triumphing of <hi>Affrica</hi> had in his chariot
Elephants onely. But <hi>Caesar</hi> surpassing all others in pompe was drawen by
forty Elephants, and in the day time conducted to the Capitoll, with tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
when he triumphed ouer the <hi>Galli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some writers haue said that the Emperour <hi>Aurelianus</hi> was drawen with
foure Harts or Stags, and being come to the Capitoll, he caused them all
to be slaine, and sacrificed to <hi>Iupiter Optimus Maximus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Other Historians haue noted, that some triumphs haue continued more
then one day: As <hi>Titus Quintius Flaminius</hi> held his triumph of the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi>
&amp; <hi>Grecians,</hi> three dayes. Likewise <hi>Suetonius</hi> triumphed foure daies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:17413:78"/>
in one moneth: and <hi>Augustus</hi> triumphing of the <hi>Dalmatians, Acciaci,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
had three chariots for three dayes.</p>
                  <p>The Triumpher also vsed to carry in his chariot his owne children,
which custome <hi>Cicero</hi> seemeth to confirme in his Oration for <hi>Murena,</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> caried in triumph his sonne, who within three daies
after died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adrianus</hi> hauing obtained of the Senate to triumph, he modestly refused
it, saying, that honour was due to <hi>Traianus.</hi> And so (as a good Emperour)
he caused <hi>Traianus</hi> picture to be caried in the chariot, fearing that after his
death, he should loose the honour of the triumph.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marcus</hi> and <hi>Lucius Antonius</hi> being brethren, and triumphing together,
they caried in their chariot the daughter of <hi>Marcus</hi> a yong virgin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperour, a man of immodest maners, and vnworthy of
all Emperiall honour, being returned to <hi>Rome</hi> caried in the chariot with
him his vicious <hi>Anterus,</hi> who being placed neere his person, as he passed the
citie, he ofttimes kissed him publiquely.</p>
                  <p>Farre otherwise did <hi>Seuerus Afer,</hi> who being victorious of the <hi>Parthians</hi>
was offered the honour of triumph: which he refused, alleaging he was
vnhealthie: and therefore desired his sonnes might be set in the chariot to
triumph in his place.</p>
                  <p>Thus appeareth it that the Romanes accompted no honor too much or
too great for those that had in their seruice vertuously employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
After the triumphall chariot followed the chiefe prisoners bound.</p>
                  <p>Then came many captaines and souldiers wearing boughs of Lawrel, in
signe of victorie. Being also perswaded that by vertue of that tree they
were purged of mans slaughter. Lawrell is also a cause of good fortune,
and a signe of prosperitie, because it is euer greene and flourishing. As <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi>
writeth, saying, <hi>Laurus triumphis dicatur: Caesarum Pontificum<expan>
                           <am>

                        </expan> sola do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos
exornat, &amp; ante limina excubat.</hi> Yet the same <hi>Plinie</hi> saith that in times
more ancient, he that triumphed, did vse a crowne <hi>Etrusca</hi> of gold, which
by a seruant was caried, and on his finger a ring of yron, to signifie that the
fortune of him that triumphed, and his seruant, was alike. In this manner
<hi>Caius Marius</hi> triumphed of <hi>Iugurtha<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> yet in his third triumph he ware a ring
of gold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> at his triumph ware a coate of gold, as <hi>Plinie</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affirme.</p>
                  <p>One other custome the Romanes had, and was no ordinance or law, yet
precisely obserued; which is, that whosoeuer in any ciuil warre had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
victorie (how notable soeuer) he should not be admitted to triumph:
because men therein slaine, were Citizens, and no strangers, which was
the reason that <hi>Nasica</hi> hauing vanquished <hi>Tiberius Gracchus</hi> and his folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
nor <hi>Metellus</hi> suppressing <hi>Caius Opimius,</hi> nor <hi>Antonius</hi> defeating <hi>Cati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi>
were admitted to triumph.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse when <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> had surprised the cities of <hi>Graecia,</hi> and
taken the <hi>Marian</hi> citizens, he was allowed in triumphant wise to carie with
him the spoiles gained in those places.</p>

and state, they were called <hi>Ouanti.</hi> But why they were so
called, writers doe not agree.</p>
                  <p>Triumphs absolute haue bene formerly discoursed. Now
are we to speake of meane or halfe triumphs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plutarch</hi> seemeth to thinke, that who so in this kind triumphed, did sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in the Capitol a sheepe: but he that was allowed a full triumph, did
offer a Bull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dionysius</hi> sayth, that <hi>Ouatio,</hi> differeth from <hi>Triumphus</hi> by this meane.
He that entered the city <hi>Ouans,</hi> had no chariot, nor vsed any regal garment
but marched with the Armie on foot. <hi>Plutarch</hi> likewise writeth they ware
in their Crowne no Laurel, but Mirtle.</p>
                  <p>This kinde of Triumph was instituted in <hi>Rome</hi> in the yeere 253. <hi>ab vrbe
condita.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dionysius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> are not of one opinion, why this sort of Triumph
was called <hi>Ouante.</hi> Yet this seemeth the cause.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Posthumius</hi> being <hi>Consul,</hi> in his seruice of the warre proceeded coldly and
sparing of blood.</p>
                  <p>Also in one other expedition before, he fought most infortunately, with
losse of many men, and by fleeing saued his owne person.</p>
                  <p>Other causes do seeme of this Triumph <hi>Ouante:</hi> as if the warre was not
iustly pronounced, or the enemie of base reputation, as a Pirate, a bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
or a coward.</p>
                  <p>So as the victory obtained, doth appeare vnworthy much honour. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>Whether the Triumpher <hi>Ouante</hi> did enter the citie on horsebacke or
foot, is a question.</p>
                  <p>Another vse also the Souldiers had, which haply will seeme strange;
that following the triumphall chariot, oft times they vttered scoffes and
iests against the Triumpher? Such was the behauiour of <hi>Caesars</hi> folowers at
his Triumph. For among other speeches they vsed these words: <hi>Gallias
Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem: &amp; Ventidium Bassum Parthici triumphi die
secuti milites decantarunt; Qui mulos fricabat, factus est Consul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Rome</hi> it was by law prouided that no Captaine should come into the
citie before his triumph: So saith <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Paulus Aemilius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We reade likewise, all Triumphs were celebrated in <hi>Rome</hi> onely, two
excepted, which seemeth strange. For in those dayes <hi>Milan, Aquileia,</hi> and

                  <p>Next to him <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> the King triumphed. But
in what sort these Kings did triumph, we cannot finde.</p>
                  <p>After the expulsion of the <hi>Tarquinij,</hi> and the death of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,
Publius Valerius</hi> the Consul triumphed.</p>
                  <p>Then, with greater pomp and admiration the Dictator <hi>Camillus</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed,
who sitting in a chariot drawen by two white horses, entred the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Which maner of triumph was neuer before seene, therefore mooued

                  <p>Many yeeres after was the triumph of <hi>Papirius Cursor</hi> Dictator, who tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed

                  <p>
                     <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> also triumphed of the <hi>Galli, Etrusci</hi> and <hi>Samniti.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then followed againe the triumph of <hi>Papirius Cursor</hi> the Consul, when
he brought home the Armie from <hi>Samnio.</hi> He furnished his triumph with
many prisoners both horsmen and footmen, with crownes <hi>Ciuicae, Vallarae,</hi>
and <hi>Murales,</hi> cariyng with him spoiles of the <hi>Samniti,</hi> and leading many
honourable captiues: hee brought with him also two hundred thousand
and thirtie three thousand pound weight of treasure. All which money
was deliuered into the treasurie, and no part thereof giuen to the souldier.</p>
                  <p>With greater ioy the two Consuls, <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> and <hi>Liuius Salinator,</hi>
triumphed for their victory, hauing defeated <hi>Hasarubal</hi> and slaine him, yet
was this triumph in magnificence farre inferiour: but the treasure they
brought to the city was an hundred thousand pound weight, whereof 23.
thousand was diuided among the Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>But farre more magnificent was the triumph of <hi>Scipio,</hi> who being retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from <hi>Libya</hi> triumphed at <hi>Rome,</hi> in this sort. First hee caused certaine
Trumpets to sound: after them followed chariots laden with spoyle: then
were caried towers of wood, made for models of those cities which were
taken. Next were the cariages of golde and siluer, part whereof was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought,
and part coyne: next were certaine crownes caried in signe of
honor at the winning of cities, which were followed with white Buls and
Elephants: after them came the captiue Princes of <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Numidia.</hi>
Before <hi>Scipio</hi> his person, marched his <hi>Lictori</hi> or Mace-bearers apparelled in
purple, and accompanied with diuers sorts of musicke and singers. These
men had on their heads crownes, wearing also garments of silke cut. In
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17413:79"/>
marching euery of them one after another, sung some verse in praise of the
victory; making also gesture to mooue mirth. The chariot of <hi>Scipio</hi> was
richly wrought with gold, and neere to his person also many sweete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes
were burned. The horses of his chariot were white, and on their
heads they ware crowns: their foretops and maynes were curled, and dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with gold, and precious stones.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> himselfe was apparelled in purple, embroidered with starres of
gold, according to the Romane fashion. In the one hand he bare a scepter
of Iuory, in the other a braunch of Laurell, which among the Romanes
were signes of victory. About him were caried certaine young boyes and
virgins, and at his stirrup marched some young men of his blood. Lastly
followed his guard, and their Ensignes, with the army diuided into squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons.
The Souldiers of best seruice caried in their hand abranch of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell;
and certaine Musicians did sing their praise. Others of no merit bare
no Laurell, as persons noted of infamy. By which manner of Triumph, the
honour or disgrace of euery one did appeare.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> being thus ariued in the Capitoll, laide aside his pompe, and (as
the custome then was) feasted his company in the Temple.</p>
                  <p>Some time after, <hi>Marcus Porcius Cato</hi> triumphed of Spaine, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
comparable. He brought with him twenty fiue pound weight of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought
siluer, and of gold one thousand fiue hundred. To euery footman
he gaue two hundred and seuenty pieces: and to euery horseman thrice so
much.</p>
                  <p>About that time, <hi>Lucius Quintius</hi> triumphed three dayes.</p>
                  <p>The first day he shewed the Armour, weapons, and ensignes taken from
<hi>Philip</hi> and his cities.</p>
                  <p>The second day hee shewed the siluer and gold, both wrought and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought.
The siluer vnwrought was eighteene thousand pound weight,
and the gold two hundreth seuenty thousand pound weight. Besides trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
were many vessels of all sorts; with them also were many head-pieces,
excellently and artificially wrought: ten targuets of siluer, and one of gold:
besides great pieces of coyne of incredible poize; among which, was of

                  <p>The third day hee shewed the crownes of gold, and the gifts of cities,
wherewith he had beene presented. Before h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Armenes</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nabides</hi> the <hi>Lacedaemonian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Quintius</hi> in person entred the City, his chariot beeing followed
with great numbers of Souldiers. Then much treasure was diuided, one
part to a footeman, two parts to a Centurion, and three parts to a Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
Those prisoners that were exempt from bondage, ware their heads
polled in signe of liberty.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Quintius, Pub. Cornelius Nasica</hi> triumphed for victory of the <hi>Boij.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pompe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> was numbred among the triumphs of meane
magnificence. Hee brought with him the Armes, Ensignes, and Pillage
taken from the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Also certaine noble prisoners and troupes of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17413:80"/>
horses taken from other enemies. Besides these spoyles, he shewed chaines
of gold: and one thousand foure hundred seuenty pound weight of siluer,
of golde 246. pound weight: in vessels of the French fashion 360. pound
weight.</p>
                  <p>Hee had likewise peeces of coyne whereon was imprinted a chariot
drawen by two horses. Of them were a hundred thirty and eight thousand,

                  <p>Now may we not omit the triumph of <hi>Marcus Flauius,</hi> who determined
to triumph: but hearing <hi>Aemilius</hi> was comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> hee fell sicke, and
deferred his triumph to auoid contention. The next Ianuary he triumphed
of the <hi>Etoli</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia.</hi> Before his chariot were caried crownes of gold
weighing an hundred and twelue pounds, of siluer 83. pound weight, with
other spoiles incredible.</p>
                  <p>Ouer long it were to tell of all the Romane triumphs, and their magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
being greater then can be expressed.</p>
                  <p>Let vs only remember the triumph of <hi>Gaius Manlius,</hi> who brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Rome</hi> 200. kings crownes of gold, 220. thousand pound weight of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
with other coynes of diuers Nations. Hee caried also great spoiles, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from King <hi>Alexander,</hi> and from the <hi>Gaules.</hi> In this triumph he set before
his chariot two and fifty captaines prisoners, and rewarded his owne soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
abundantly.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Persian vse was, that so soone as the Sunne shined
in the morning, a trumpet was sounded in the Kings Pauilion, which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
euery man to come forth.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the roofe of the Kings Pauilion, an image of the Sunne closed in
Christall was set, which shined exceedingly, and might bee seene many
miles.</p>
                  <p>The order of the Kings company, when he marched, was this:</p>
                  <p>First the fire (which they called holy and euerlasting) was caried vpon
Altars of siluer.</p>
                  <p>Next to those Altars went the <hi>Magi</hi> or sorcerers, singing certaine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
verses.</p>
                  <p>The number of the <hi>Magi</hi> was three hundred three score and fiue.</p>
                  <p>After them followed 365 yong men, in Carthagenian attire, for the
Persian yeere containeth euen so many dayes.</p>
                  <p>Then a chariot consecrated to <hi>Iupiter</hi> did follow, euer drawen by foure
white horses of exceeding greatnes: they called those, Horses of the Sun.
Their raines were of gold, and their furniture white.</p>
                  <p>Not farre from this chariot, were twelue other chariots ornified with
gold and siluer.</p>
                  <p>Then marched more horsemen of twelue diuers nations, diuersly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and of diuers qualitie.</p>
                  <p>Next to them were ten thousand men, whom the Persians called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall.
Some ware chaines of gold, others had coates with sleeues em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered
with gold, and set with rich stones.</p>
                  <p>Not farre off were fifteen thousand men, whom they called the Kings
cosins: which number was furnished rather richly (like women) then well
armed: they were called <hi>Doryphori.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to this troupe were other men apparelled like Kings. They went
before the Kings chariot he being caried vp higher then any other. These
chariots were loden with Images of the gods, made of siluer and gold.</p>
                  <p>Betweene the Images a partition was set with rich shining iewels: the
one side represented a warre; and likewise the other.</p>
                  <p>Among these things they sacrificed an Eagle of golde spreading her
wings: but of all things, the Kings attire was most admired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:17413:81"/>
His apparell was of purple parted in the middes with white: and ouer
it he had a short cloke like a womans garment, embrodered with Sparow-haukes
of gold, very strangely.</p>
                  <p>His girdle was womanlike small and girt: whereat hanged a Scimiter,
or crooked sword: the sheath thereof was set with precious stones.</p>
                  <p>On his head he ware a royall cappe, called <hi>Cidaris,</hi> which all Kings of
<hi>Persia</hi> doe vse. It was tied on his head with a lace, part of skie colour and
part white.</p>
                  <p>After the chariot, followed ten thousand Lances, adorned with siluer:
and next to the chariot certaine choice men caried Darts gilded. Also on
either side, his neerest of blood did accompany him.</p>
                  <p>This troupe contained thirtie thousand footmen, whom fiue hundred
of the Kings horsemen followed.</p>
                  <p>About one acre distance from them the chariot of <hi>Sisygamba</hi> King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
mother, did come, and in one other his wife.</p>
                  <p>All the Ladies and other women belonging to both the Queenes, were
on horsebacke.</p>
                  <p>After them other women did come (whom they called <hi>Armamax:</hi>)
they exceeded not the number of fifteene.</p>
                  <p>In that company were the kings children, with their gouernours. Also
a number of Eunuches, being persons of some reputation among the
Persians.</p>
                  <p>Then the Kings Minions being 360 were caried in chariots: their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
was princely and rich.</p>
                  <p>After them the kings coine was caried by sixe hundred Mules and three
hundred Camels garded with Archers.</p>
                  <p>The Kings Concubines and his kinsmen were next to them. And they
being past, the Cookes, Sculions, and other base people did follow.</p>
                  <p>Last of all came certaine Captains and souldiers lightly armed, to force
the troupes to march in order.</p>

                  <p>The whole armie was sixtie nine thousand strong.</p>
                  <p>These Christian forces (assisted by the Almightie) defeated the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,
and slew the greater number.</p>
                  <p>The victorie obtayned, and the Emperour with his Princes returning
homewards, were in all places feasted. And they desirous in some sort to
honour the Ladies of those countries, where they passed, were willing in
triumphal wise, to make Iusts, Turneaments, and other Militarie pastimes.
Which being pleasing to the Emperour, and acceptable to all others; His
Maiestie with consent of the Princes, commanded that publike triumphs
should be proclaimed; whereunto all Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen
might resort, to shew their valour. And this was the originall of Germaine
triumphes.</p>
                  <p>Then was there a Counsell and commission graunted to certaine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

would take delight in such royall sight: they greatly commended that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention
vnto the Emperour, who presently agreed that Lawes might be
made and obserued in those Actions.</p>
                  <p>His Emperial Maiestie commanded that at euery Triumph 4. chiefe
persons should be chosen to giue direction, and by their authoritie all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances

                  <p>Among these shewes of triumph and iolitie, two sights
there were most admirable, and neuer before that time seene: the maner of
the one was a representation of Iusting on horsebacke.</p>
                  <p>For certaine portratures or images of men and horses were so made, of
skinnes clothed in silke, with Lances and Shields, as the wind by a straight
line forced them to runne one encountering the other, like to a course of
the field.</p>
                  <p>The other was like vnto a combat: where armed men did seeme to fight,
both which shewes were in the streete.</p>
                  <p>In the first the Actors were only 24 yong Gentlemen Venetians, for
personage, apparell, and yeeres very commendable. The inuentor and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector
of these pastimes was <hi>Thomasso Bambasio,</hi> who for such deuises and
action was in <hi>Venice</hi> esteemed, as in old time <hi>Roscius</hi> had bene in <hi>Rome.</hi>
Surely it seemeth strange, that so many men richly attired, and so many
horses brauely furnished, could be managed with so great dexteritie: and
one hauing ended his courses, another was presently ready to supply that
place. In the meane while the Lances did seeme broken, and the splinters
flie about.</p>
                  <p>The duke with al the Nobilitie of the city, beheld this miraculous sight,
and so did a multitude of people.</p>

with great difficultie he obtained leaue.</p>
                  <p>The like desire to honour the King, mooued the Earle of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who
had married the Kings sister. And he brought with him a great troope of
gallant Knights.</p>
                  <p>These two Princes came first vnto <hi>Calis,</hi> where they found English
ships readie to transport them. But the Earle of <hi>Oye</hi> passed ouer first: and
being come to <hi>London</hi> had accesse to the King: of whom he was with
great ioy embraced. The like courtesie he found in <hi>Iohn Holland</hi> the Kings
brother, and all other Lords of the Court.</p>

and sorted with their degrees.</p>
                  <p>Then were the men of Armes marshalled, and set in such order, as they
should runne.</p>
                  <p>The first courses were allotted to the Earle of <hi>S. Paul</hi> and his Band: who
were with great courage encountred by the English. Betweene them the
first dayes Iusting was spent: and that night his Maiestie, the Queene and
all the company supped and lodged in the Bishops house, neere to Saint
Pauls Church.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe honour and commendation of that first fight, was (among

Earle of <hi>Huntington</hi> had the praise.</p>
                  <p>This magnificent supper ended, euery one resorted to his lodging (the

Knights.</p>

                  <p>The first (of the strangers) that offered to runne, was the Earle of <hi>Oye:</hi>
who presented himselfe, and his companie most pompously furnished.
And after him followed the Earle of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> with his troope of Frenchmen.</p>
                  <p>The Knights strangers, being entred and readie, were foorthwith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred

                  <p>The Iusts of that day ended, the King returned to his lodging, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

                  <p>The chiefe commendation of that day (on the strangers part) was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

highly praysed.</p>
                  <p>On Tuesday also, the men at Armes resorted to the Tilt, and continued

<hi>Bayon,</hi> where the <hi>Dolphin,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Auuernia</hi> with
great pompe receiued him. Being in the towne, he beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himselfe as King, pardoning offenders, and deluering
them from prison. From thence with like Maiestie he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to other cities, accompanied with the sayd <hi>Dolphin</hi> and Duke, where
he vsed the same authority.</p>
                  <p>In Ianuary hee came to <hi>Castelloaldum,</hi> where the King in person with
much magnificence intertained him. From thence he passed to <hi>Amboyse,</hi>
where King <hi>Charles</hi> the 8. had built two great towers, the walles whereof
are so large, as Mules and Carts may passe vpon them.</p>
                  <p>The King then to the end that <hi>Caesars</hi> entrie in the night should bee the
more magnificent, furnished those towers with an exceeding great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of lights, so as they might behold all the Countrey, as if it had bene
faire day. But when <hi>Caesar</hi> was going vp, by great mishap, the tower fell on
fire; the flame and smoke whereof became so great, as euery one feared
lest the Emperour should haue bene smothered. Whereupon all men
there present laboured by fleeing to saue themselues. Some that were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
to haue done this fact were apprehended, and the King did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
they should be hanged, though indeed no proofe appeared: but
<hi>Caesar</hi> would in no wise they should die, so were they pardoned.</p>
                  <p>After this disaster, the King conducted the Emperar to <hi>Bleas,</hi> and from
thence to <hi>Fountainableu,</hi> where they hunted, hauked, and beheld certaine
Iusts and Tournaments; in conclusion, no sport or solace was omitted.</p>
                  <p>From thence the Emperour attended by the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and Duke, went
to <hi>Paris.</hi> Before he entred the citie, the Burgesses and Citizens of all sorts,
came foorth, and receiued him with no lesse ceremony then if the King
had bene present: there he also set at libertie all prisoners. From thence
he passed vnto the Constables house, and was there most honourably lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
At last he went into <hi>Picardy,</hi> and so to <hi>Valentia,</hi> which is the first town
of his iurisdiction in <hi>Belgica:</hi> vnto which place the <hi>Dolphin</hi> and Duke did
follow him.</p>

did attend him in <hi>Burgo della Trinitá,</hi> as they call it.</p>
                  <p>Being passed that place, hee was saluted by <hi>Caesar Gonzaga,</hi> the Count

richly apparelled.</p>

with a great troupe of Gentlemen of the Countrey, clad in white silke, and
bearing in their hands Pollaxes: the heads of them were gilt, and the staues
couered with white silke.</p>
                  <p>Then followed the Doctors, &amp; schollers, accompanied with 300 horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
apparelled in yellow coats. And immediatly appeared two other
troupes of men lightly armed, which company garded the ancient Lords
and Noblemen of the countrey: among whom were some Princes, Earles
and Barons. That troupe was so great, as two houres sufficed not to see
them passe.</p>
                  <p>They that rode next vnto the Princes person, were the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Sossa,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Pescara,</hi> the Admiral of <hi>Castilia,</hi> the

Count Francisco Somaia, Count Philippo Tornello,</hi> &amp; two other noblemen.</p>

                  <p>These Complements ended, the Prince came vnto the chiefe Church:

                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:17413:87"/>
Thus the match was concluded: yet the <hi>French</hi> fearing some subtiltie
(because the countrey fauoured the enemy) procured <hi>Monsieur de Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi>
with fiue hundred horse and 200. footemen to lye neere the place, to
the end he might defend his friends, if need should require.</p>
                  <p>The first courses were performed betweene the Duke <hi>de Nemours</hi> and
the Marquesse of <hi>Pescara,</hi> who hauing ended their courses with honor, they
embraced one the other, and so gaue place.</p>
                  <p>The next that presented himselfe, was <hi>Monsieur de Classis</hi> sonne and heire
of <hi>Monsieur de Vasey,</hi> a Knight of the Order and Captaine of fifty men at

                  <p>The third courses were betweene <hi>Monsieur de Mauns</hi> a Leader in the
<hi>French</hi> Army, and a Spanish captaine called <hi>Alba.</hi> In which reencounter
the Frenchman was wounded in the necke, and the fourth day after died.</p>

whose encounter was so violent, as with his Lance he pearced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

haue bene no lesse desirous to honour their Nation in
forraine countreys, then willing to aduance the renowne of
their Prince at home: it shall not be (as I thinke) offensiue
to remember some triumphal actions by them performed
in forraine countreys, as writers haue well obserued: wishing our English
Armorists and Historians, were of like care to conserue al memorable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
tending to the honour of their owne Prince and countrey. Of which
acts it seemeth there are many worthy to be remembred. For when the
Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> or (as mine Author calleth him) the Erle of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
remained gouernour of the Kings Armie in <hi>Bullonoys,</hi> a certaine
Frenchman approching the Campe, with a lowd voice asked if any Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
there had a mistresse, or other beloued Lady, for whose sake and
honour, he would breake three Launces, and aduenture three encounters
of his sword. This proud Challenge being heard by the English men, one
<hi>Ioachimus Cathorius</hi> (as the Author calleth him) a braue English Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
stepped forth: which the Lord <hi>Fitzwater</hi> (then Marshall,) seeing hee
foorthwith sent word vnto the Frenchman (whose name was <hi>Gauuenus Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleus</hi>)
that he should be presently answered. Whereof the French Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
very glad, returned to his friends, &amp; furnished with three Launces,
three Maces of yron, three Swords, and three seruants to beare them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17413:88"/>
himselfe before the English Armie. The English seeing him in
this sort prepared to maintaine the challenge, much marueiled thereat,
supposing that no Frenchman had dared to encounter the force of an
English Souldier.</p>
                  <p>The brute of this <hi>brauado</hi> foorthwith was dispersed through the Armie,
and at last the Generall became thereof enformed, who desirous to behold
the combat, mounted on horsebacke, accompanied with the Earle of <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi>
and the Earle or L of Deuonshire.</p>
                  <p>The Duke and other beholders thus assembled, the Challenger and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
begun their courses: but by default of the horses, their Launces
missed at the first, and at the next incounter very lightly th' one touched
the others Armor.</p>
                  <p>The Duke beholding in what estate the matter stood, and perceiuing
night at hand, commanded the conflict should cease til an other day: and
in the meane space required the Frenchman might be well entreated.</p>
                  <p>The next day of triall being come, th' one and th' other appeared, and
with much commendation brake their Launces. That done, they came to
the sword, th' one assaulting th' other furiously, till they were both hurt;
which the Duke perceiuing, caused them to be parted, and the Frenchman
by an Herault was safely sent home to his friends.</p>

<hi>Nicholas Clifford</hi> touching matter of Honour and Armes, asked him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he could, before he departed, consent to make triall of his vertue, by
breaking of three Launces. With all my heart (quoth <hi>Clifford</hi>) for so haue
I long desired to do: and no time more fit then now, when the Constable
and his company may be iudge; Yet such is my hap, as I haue no Armor
at hand. For supply of that want (quoth <hi>Boucmelius</hi>) I will take order that
two Armors shalbe brought vnto vs, and of them the choise shalbe yours,
with euery other thing fit for our purpose.</p>
                  <p>This agreement made, they imparted the same vnto the Constable, and
obtained his license: yet with condition, that they should attend vpon him
the next day, at which time hee would, with other noble men, see what
should be the euent of that Action.</p>
                  <p>About the houre appointed these Champions did appeare, and at the

young of yeeres, and in Armes of great reputation:
men called him <hi>Tristram de Roy.</hi> He seeing the warres ended
betweene the Kings of <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> determined to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17413:89"/>
returne home. Yet desirous by some means to gaine honor, before his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall
in France, procured an Herauld to goe vnto the English Army, and
proclaime, That if any Gentleman there would breake three Launces, he
would challenge him.</p>
                  <p>This challenge being heard in the English campe, a braue young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
named <hi>Miles Windesor</hi> accepted thereof: hoping by that occasion
to merit the honour of Knighthood.</p>
                  <p>The next day according to appointment, he appeared in the field, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with <hi>Mathew Gorney, William Beuchamp, Tho Simons,</hi> the <hi>L. Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos,</hi>
the <hi>L. Newcastle,</hi> the <hi>L. Bardolf,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>The French Challenger appeared likewise honourably graced with
friends: and thus both parties in readinesse to runne, the Lord <hi>Souldichius</hi>
bestowed the dignitie of Knighthood vpon the said <hi>Windsor.</hi> Which done,
the one charged the other: and the two first courses were perfourmed with
great courage, yet without any hurt. But in the third course the armour
both of the one and the other was pearced through; yet by breach of the
launces, both of them escaped more harme.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the reigne of King <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, three noble young
men of great hope and much affecting the warre liued in
that Court. viz. <hi>Mounsier de Bouciquant</hi> the younger, <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
Reynaut de Roye,</hi> and <hi>Mounsier de S. Pye,</hi> all Gentlemen of
that Kings chamber.</p>
                  <p>In the same time also there was in <hi>England</hi> a Knight for valour and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
vertue of great fame: men called him Sir <hi>Peter Courtney:</hi> He hauing
obtained license, passed the sea, and trauelled to <hi>Paris.</hi> After a few daies
rest in that citie, he challenged <hi>Mounsieur Trimoulie,</hi> a noble Gentleman
in great reputation: who accepting the defie, obtained license to answere,
appointing a day and place. The time being come, the King accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
with the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> and many other great Estates went to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that conflict.</p>
                  <p>The first course was performed exceeding well, and ether partie brake
his launce with commendation. But the second launce being deliuered
into their hands, the King inhibited more should be done: seeming some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
offended with the English Knight who had made sute, that he might
be suffered to doe his vttermost.</p>
                  <p>This Action by the Kings commaundement was stayed, and Sir <hi>Peter
Courtney</hi> therewith grieued, thought good to abandon that Countrey, and
so desired he might doe.</p>

                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:17413:89"/>
The King well pleased he should depart, sent vnto him an honourable
gift, and the Duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> did the like. The King also commaunded
<hi>Mounsiuer de Clary</hi> (a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Lord) to accompany him to <hi>Callis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the way, they visited the Earle of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who married King <hi>Richards</hi>
sister of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle in most courteous manner welcommed Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> and the
rather, for that his Ladie had formerly bene married to the Lord <hi>Courtney</hi>
his kinsman, who died young.</p>
                  <p>This Sir <hi>Peter Courtney</hi> being well entertained, the Earle and hee with
their company supped together: in which time (as the custome is) they
communed of many matters. Among which the Earle asked of Sir <hi>Peter,</hi>
how he liked the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> and what conceit he had of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto Sir <hi>Peter</hi> with a sowre countenance answered, That hee
found in <hi>France</hi> nothing to be compared with the magnificence of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi>
though for friendly entertainment hee had no cause to complaine:
yet saide Sir <hi>Peter,</hi> I am not well satisfied in that matter, which was the
chiefe cause of my comming into <hi>France.</hi> For I protest in the presence of
all this Honourable company, that if <hi>Monsieur de Clary,</hi> beeing a Noble
Gentleman of <hi>France,</hi> had come into <hi>England,</hi> and challenged any of our
Nation, he should haue beene fully answered: but other measure hath ben
offered to me in France: for when <hi>Monsieur de Tremoulie</hi> and I had enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
our honour, after one Lance broken, the king commanded me to stay.
I haue therefore sayde, and wheresoeuer I shall become, will say, that in
<hi>France</hi> I was denyed reason and leaue to doe my vttermost.</p>
                  <p>These words much moued <hi>Mounsieur de Clary,</hi> yet (for the present) hee
suppressed his anger, hauing charge to conduct Sir <hi>Peter</hi> safely vnto <hi>Calis.</hi>
Notwithstanding this heate (quoth the Earle) let mee tell you Sir <hi>Peter,</hi>
that in mine opinion you depart from <hi>France</hi> with much honour, because
the King vouchsafed to entreate you, that the fight might stay: whom to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,
is a certaine signe of wisedome and praise worthy. I pray you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sir Knight, haue patience, and let vs proceede in our iourney.</p>
                  <p>Thus Sir <hi>Peter</hi> hauing taken leaue of the Earle, passed forth towards
<hi>Calice,</hi> accompanied with <hi>Mounsieur de Clary;</hi> who so soone as they were
entred into the confines of the English Dominion, Sir <hi>Peter</hi> most hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thanked him for his company and courtesie. But <hi>Clary</hi> hauing made an
impression of such sowre speeches, as Sir <hi>Peter</hi> had vttered in the Earles
house, said thus: Hauing now fully performed the Kings commandement
conducting you safe to your friendes, I must, before wee part, put you in
minde of your inconsiderate words in contempt of the Nobility of <hi>France.</hi>
And to the end you being arriued in <hi>England,</hi> shall haue no cause or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
to boast that you were not answered in <hi>France:</hi> Loe here I my selfe
(though inferiour to many others) am this day, or to morow ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ou; not for malice to your person, or gloriously to boast of my
valour, but for conseruation of the fame and honor due to our French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
where neuer wanted Gentlemen to answere in Armes, when any
English man should challenge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:17413:90"/>
Well (quoth Sir <hi>Peter</hi>) you say well; and with good will I accept your
challenge: and to morow I will not faile to attend you armed, with three
Launces, according to the custome of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This agreement being made, Sir <hi>Peter</hi> went foorthwith to <hi>Calice,</hi> there
to furnish himselfe of Armes fit for the Combat. And making the Lord
<hi>Iohn Warren</hi> (then Gouernour) priuie to what was intended, the next day
hee returned to meete <hi>Mounsieur de Clary</hi> betweene <hi>Bullaine</hi> and <hi>Calice:</hi>
thither also went the Gouernor, and other English Gentlemen to behold.</p>
                  <p>The courses betweene these Champions being begun: at the first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
either partie brake well: but in the second encounter by default
of the English Knights Armour, he was hurt in the shoulder, as other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Gentlemen did well see: which moued the Gouernour of <hi>Calice</hi> to say
vnto <hi>Mounsieur de Clary,</hi> You haue dealt discourteously, to hurt <hi>Courtney</hi>
when his Armour was broken.</p>
                  <p>I am sory (quoth <hi>Clary</hi>) but in my power it is not to gouerne Fortune:
what is happened to him, might likewise haue come to me.</p>
                  <p>The matter standing in these termes, <hi>Mounsieur de Clary</hi> returned into
<hi>France,</hi> supposing he had deserued great commendation. But being come
to the Court, the King, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Trymoulie</hi> himselfe bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him: and the Counsel of <hi>France</hi> gaue sentence that his goods should
be confiscate, because the King hauing commanded that Sir <hi>Peter</hi> should
be without offence peaceably conducted to <hi>Calice,</hi> the matter was other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
handled. To be short, <hi>Clary</hi> was brought to the Kings presence, and
by the Counsel asked what reason he had to take Armes against amy man
whom the king expresly had commanded to defend.</p>
                  <p>These words much perplexed <hi>Clary,</hi> and the kings offence did greatly
amaze him. Notwithstanding with a good courage he sayd, that what was
enioyned him to doe, he had most faithfully performed: But <hi>Courtney</hi> with
insolent speech taxed him and all the French nation; which without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor
might not be endured: He therfore thought not only to haue bene
free from blame, but also merit commendation. yet (quoth he) seeing my
expectation faileth me, I submit my selfe to the censure of the Constable
and Marshals of <hi>France.</hi> I also will endure the iudgement of <hi>Courtney</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
and all other men of Armes in the kingdomes of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>
All which excuses &amp; submissions notwithstanding, he was committed to
prison and his goods confiscate, til at the humble and earnest suit of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Coucy,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> the Earle of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Englishman
(to whom he had done wrong) hee was restored to liberty. Then said the
Constable, Doest thou thinke (<hi>Mounsieur de Clary</hi>) to haue done well or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
the French nation by taking Armes against <hi>Courtney,</hi> who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
vnto thee? If ought hath bene by <hi>Courtney</hi> spoken in preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the French Nobility, thou ought haue complained thereof to the
king, and then haue proceeded by his Maiesties direction. But the matter
was not so handled by thee, which is cause of thy punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
therfore be more aduised, &amp; for thy liberty giue thanks vnto the duke
of <hi>Burbon, Mounsieur de Coucy,</hi> &amp; the Earle <hi>S. Paul,</hi> who haue exceedingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to compasse this fauor. Such was the end of this military Action.</p>

to remaine 30. dayes. We also determine to be accompanyed with other noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
louers of Armes and Honour, there to encounter all commers with Lances
either sharpe, blunt, or both: and euery man shalbe permitted to run fiue courses.</p>
                        <p>We likewise hereby giue you to vnderstand, that such order is taken, as euery
one of vs shall haue his shield, and Empreaze hanging on the outside of the Pauilion:

such a Launce as you intend to run with, touch the shield. And who so meanetb

                  <p>THese Letters shewed to the King, were imparted to his Counsell: who
considering their tenor, deemed them to be presumptuous (chiefly in
respect the place appointed was neere vnto <hi>Calis:</hi> which haply might call
into question the truce taken for three yeeres.) Whereupon some of the
most ancient Counsellors, thought it vnmeete to permit the Challenge.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17413:91"/>
But others perceiuing the Kings inclination, did allow thereof, because the
words of challenge, were modest and reasonable.</p>
                  <p>The matter thus debated in Counsel, the King called into his chamber
all the three Challengers, to whom he said thus, <hi>Bouciquaut, Roy,</hi> and you
<hi>S. Pye,</hi> behaue your selues well, and with respect both to priuate and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique

not, for of our bountie we wil bestow vpon you ten thousand <hi>Florins,</hi> to be

giuen vnto his Maiestie, they determined to send the proclamation of their
Challenge into diuers countries, but chiefly into England.</p>
                  <p>The proclamation being in al places published, euery courageous Lord

in the beginning of May, and were lodged in the Abbey where they were
enformed of the excellent furniture which the English had brought;

                     <p>The second course was performed better, and the launce both of the

                     <p>At the third course, both their Headpieces were striken off, and all the
lookers on might see their faces. Neuerthelesse the Lord <hi>Holland</hi> desired
that for his mistresse sake he might breake one Launce more. Which cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious

                     <p>Next to these, <hi>Roy</hi> and the English man called <hi>Earle Marshall</hi> charged

                     <p>The next was betweene <hi>Bouciquaut</hi> and <hi>Peter Scrope,</hi> a young Gentleman
of great courage, but of no long practise in Armes: yet was his encounter
so violent, as forced <hi>Bouciquaut</hi> to bleede at the eares, and retire to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion
all that day.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Scrope</hi> not contented with the honour of his successe against <hi>Bouci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaut</hi>
touched the shield of <hi>S. Pye</hi> and presently the one encountred the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But at the second course (by misfortune) the English Knight fell
downe, and though (with some helpe) he recouered his horse, yet ranne
he no more that day. Such was the successe of the first dayes Iusting.</p>

The first courses were performed betweene <hi>Iohn Sauage</hi> and <hi>Roy:</hi> who at

called <hi>Hercourt,</hi> belonging to the Queene of England, but not borne in

brake crosse, which is an errour in Armes: and thereupon much disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

that <hi>Hercourt</hi> by law of Armes, had forfeited his Horse and Armes: but at
request of the company, that fault was remitted, and he permitted to runne
one course more against <hi>Roy,</hi> who had not runne that day, and therefore
willingly consented. The courses betweene these Knights were exceeding
violent, but the Englishman being wearied was vtterly throwen from his
horse, and as a dead man lay flat on the ground: but afterwards he reuiued
lamenting that disgrace.</p>

were disarmed on the head.</p>
                     <p>The eight encounter was betweene <hi>Iaqueminus Stropius</hi> and S. <hi>Pye.</hi> At
the first course both their horses went out. At the second they brake both

the Englishman pearced through the Aduersaries shield, but was himselfe
dismounted.</p>
                     <p>The ninth encounter was betweene <hi>Guilielmus Masqueleus</hi> and <hi>Bouci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaut.</hi>

                  <p>The place for performance of that Action was appointed in the streete
of <hi>S. Anthony</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and there a Tilt with euery furniture fit for such a

                  <p>To that place (as at like occasions it happeneth) resorted an infinite

receiue them; and those places not capable of so excessiue a number, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the people bestowed themselues on the sides and roofes of the
houses.</p>
                  <p>The first courses were performed by the French King, to his great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
the rest of the Challengers also very honourably did the like. Then
the Lords and Counsellors besought the King that in respect the weather
was exceeding hote, his Maiesty would be pleased to moderate his motion,
and for that day cease from running: adding this perswasion, that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
a King should in such disports hazard his person; which perswasion for
the present preuailed. But his Maiesty (as it were drawen on by fatal force)
would in any wise the 3. day returne to the Tilt, either to make further tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

                  <p>That day his Maiestie in all princely pompe appeared: his person and
horse also being more richly furnished then any pen can expresse.</p>
                  <p>The first courses his Maiestie performed fortunately, with marueilous
applause of the beholders.</p>
                  <p>At the fourth course, by marueilous misaduenture, he became hurt with
a splinter of the aduersaries Lance, which pearced his eye so deep, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
his braine was much bruised. Thus was the Nuptiall feast disturbed,
and ioy conuerted to sorow. Such is the state of worldly things, gladnes is

                  <p>Some preassed to carie his person home, and others (as touched to the
heart) shut vp their eyes from seeing a spectacle so lamentable.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies likewise and Gentlewomen of the Court, turned their faces
from beholding, and closed vp their eyes with teares. To conclude, the
whole number of Courtiers were striken with sorow not explicable.</p>
                  <p>The Citizens likewise, and generally all the subiects of that kingdome,
were perplexed, to see the tragical euent of that disastrous triumph: which
was intended to congratulate a new peace and an honourable alliance.</p>
                  <p>The forme and face of the citie thus conuerted from exceeding ioy, to
vnspeakeable sorow; some helde vp their hands to heauen, others made
haste to the Churches, and euery one with abundance of sighs and sobs,
cried out, beseeching God to grant the King recouery: as if euery mans
well doing had thereon depended.</p>
                  <p>How vnpleasing these newes were to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> euery one can

                  <p>Then the Physicians and Chirurgions, not onely of <hi>France,</hi> but of the
Low countreys also came thither to shew their skil, vsing all Art and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
that might be: but the splinters of the Lance had pearced the Kings
eye so deepe, as the tendernes of the place could not suffer it to bee taken
out, nor seene, (the braine also being pearced) no meane there was to cure
the wound. The King therefore tormented with extreame paine, fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a burning Feuer, whereof in the end of eleuen daies he died In all which
time he did neuer weepe, or speake any word that might be imputed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimity;

sayd, that seeing he was destined to die in Armes, he would haue bene

                  <p>Betweene the water and the gate was a large Court: and there hanged
a large white Shield, and therein was painted a blacke Eagle.</p>
                  <p>Neere to that place was a Turret, whereinto no man could come, vntill
he had passed many doores: it was called <hi>Transitus periculosus,</hi> which is, the
perilous passage.</p>
                  <p>Not farre from thence was a Pillar of no great height, yet broad and
square, and thereon was painted a red Griffin, vnder which signe were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Lawes of that yland in three tongues.</p>
                  <p>The first passage to the Castell was kept by the Knight of the red Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin:
who was indeed the Earle <hi>Aringberg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second passage was kept by the Knight of the blacke Egle: that was
the Erle <hi>Hoochstrat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third passage next the yland, was kept by the Knight of the golden
Lion: which was the Earle of <hi>Egmond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Within this Castell, called <hi>Arxtenebrosa;</hi> remained the L. <hi>Corbaron</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour

                  </p>
                  <p>Before euery of the foresaid gates, a magnificent Pauilion was erected,
and therein the Earles with their troupes attended their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Then was there a petition presented to the Emperour, against <hi>Norabroc</hi>
the Magician, for that hee by his diuelish art and force of the inchanted
sword, had surprised many noble personages and worthy Knights, now
prisoners in the Castell of darknesse.</p>

Prince liuing vnder the sunne (who can be no other then the excellent
Prince of <hi>Spaine)</hi> sonne to the most inuincible Emperour <hi>Charles)</hi> they
humbly desired, that he with his Knights might attempt the enterprise.</p>
                  <p>The Emperours license obtayned, the three Knights within the darke
Castle, came foorth to encounter all those that durst assayle them.</p>
                  <p>The first that appeared, called himselfe the Darke Knight, followed
with one onely seruant to carry his launce. His armour was blacke, and
his apparell course: Of the same colour was the attire of his seruant, and
the furniture of his horse. But the assault no sooner was made, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into the Castle. <hi>Norabroc</hi> had euer sixe Gentlemen apparelled in red
and yellow, readie to receiue such Knights as went out or in.</p>
                  <p>Those sixe were attired after the Hungarian fashion, wearing on their
heads Turbants.</p>
                  <p>These men had charge of the bridge, to let in euery Knight that would
fight. This Darke Knight was the Lord <hi>Chaumont:</hi> and he that encountred
him was the Knight of the red Griffin, otherwise called the Earle of <hi>Aren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg.</hi>
His armour was all gilded, and ouer it hee ware an arming coate of
siluer cloth, very rich. In his crest he also ware feathers white and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion.</p>
                  <p>The Darke Knight thus retired to the Castle, three other Knights ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in coates of blacke cloth of gold, and in their crests they ware fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of many colours. Before them rode a young man apparelled like to
a woman, after the most anticke fashion.</p>
                  <p>That woman was mounted vpon a fish, and by her a footman did runne.
She complained and bitterly cursed one, by whom she had bene iniured.</p>
                  <p>Then the Knights who accompanied her, promised to be reuenged, and
presently determined to assault the Iland.</p>
                  <p>The first of these three Knights bearing many colours, was <hi>Yuan Cunia</hi>
the Spaniard: who at the second course, hurt the Earle <hi>Arenberg</hi> very sore;
and hauing lost the vse of one finger on his right hand, he ran no more. In
his place therefore succeeded, a Knight vnknowen, wearing the signe of
an horne. Then came the Earle <hi>Hochstrate</hi> in white siluer: wearing on his
breast a rose. And although he perfourmed his part well, yet was he forced
to dismount.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Arenberg</hi> beeing wounded, in his place one other of three
knights errant, did come: who was the Lord <hi>Hubermunt</hi> of the Emperors
Chamber.</p>
                  <p>The third Knight was <hi>Peter Ernest</hi> Earle <hi>Mansfield,</hi> calling himselfe
Knight of the white Moyle. Against him came the Knight of the golden
Lyon: vpon whom the Earle <hi>Mansfield</hi> brake three swords: but the fourth
sword by misaduenture fell out of his hand, and thereby he forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
prisoner. And this was the end of that dayes conflict.</p>
                  <p>The next day soone after dinner, out came the Lord <hi>Pelous</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi>
called the Knight of the greene Shield: hee and his horse were furnished
with gold and greene. The first three encounters he made against the Lord
<hi>Thourlo,</hi> were to good purpose: but beeing come to the Sword, it was by
force wrested from him, and he caried to prison.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:17413:95"/>
Then followed <hi>Rodorigo Bassano</hi> a Spaniard, called <hi>Pedro Vermandesio,</hi>
who within three encounters was taken.</p>
                  <p>The Lo. <hi>Courlan</hi> a Burgundian, called Knight of the three Starres, all in
greene, desiring to be reuenged, was also made prisoner.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>Peter Ernestus</hi> Earle <hi>Mansfield</hi> desired againe to try his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
calling himselfe the feathered Knight. But at the second encounter
his aduersaries Launce brake the sight of his headpeece, and cut his nose,
wherewith he fell downe dead: yet because the armour was good and the
violence of the blow broken, he recouered.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Mansfield,</hi> followed the L. <hi>Noyel</hi> a Fleming: who after a little fight
before the tower of Terror, where he fought with great courage, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to yeeld.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Iacomo di Leyua</hi> a Spaniard (called the <hi>Indian</hi> Knight) attired in
blacke, after the second course yeelded himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Spaniard entred two Knights in red cloth of Tissue, richly
embrodered with gold: they called themselues Knights of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The
one was the Prince of <hi>Ascoli,</hi> who at the first encounter yeelded himselfe:
neither had <hi>Giacobo a Cunia</hi> (called also <hi>Gonartus a Stella tenebrosa)</hi> better
fortune: for at the first course he was taken.</p>
                  <p>The first that entred the Iland by force, was <hi>Iohn Guixada</hi> sirnamed <hi>Guli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elmus
Superbus:</hi> Hee, apparelled in blacke tissue embrodered about with
gold, by force of Armes brake into all the passages; and then by aid of the
Lord <hi>Bossuuio</hi> master of the Emperours stable, was receiued into a Barke,
hauing sayles of white and red silke. So being landed in the Ile, he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to winne the precious sword. And though his attempt prooued vaine,
yet in approbation of his valour, the Queene did giue him a crowne.</p>
                  <p>Next to him his brother, with equall fortune, entred the Iland: men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him <hi>Iohn Lodouic Guixada,</hi> who for his hardy enterprise receiued also a
garland.</p>
                  <p>The like successe had the Duke of <hi>Arscot</hi> his brother, who with the
Marquesse of <hi>Cieura</hi> (called Knight of the red Shield, wheron were painted
three Mores heads) entred the Ile. Likewise <hi>Ferdinando della Zerda</hi> a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard
(called fortunes Knight) hauing slaine the guard, was also crowned.</p>
                  <p>The next day also <hi>Monsieur de Chaumont,</hi> called the sodaine Knight,
and one other Knight named <hi>Florestan</hi> which was the Lord <hi>Valous,</hi> both
Flemings, yeelded their charges.</p>
                  <p>The fift man that entred the Ile, was <hi>Lodouico Zapatta</hi> a Spaniard: his
garments were of yellow cloth of gold. But <hi>Iohn Zeuendio</hi> a Spaniard also,
called the sorowfull Knight, was forced in the first straight to alight, &amp; was
presently ledde into the darke fortresse. The like fortune had <hi>Monsieur de
Moncean</hi> named Knight of the Mistie mountaine.</p>
                  <p>The sixt that entred the Ile was the Earle of <hi>Megen,</hi> otherwise the Knight
of the Sunne. His apparell was blacke cloth of gold. The like good hap
was like to befall vnto <hi>Monsieur Champagni,</hi> but his horse encountring an
enemy at the chocke, amazed him so much as he fell downe and was taken
prisoner.</p>
                  <p>The seuenth garland <hi>Gaspero Roblesio</hi> a Spaniard gained. He being called
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17413:96"/>
Knight of the Moone, recouered the second passage, complaining vnto the
Earle of <hi>Egmont,</hi> that the Iudges without desert had giuen honor to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur

                  <p>But <hi>Monsieur Querenaut</hi> a Knight errant, encountring <hi>Monsieur Preux</hi>

Myngoual,</hi> who in a fight on foot gained great honour: but at his first
encounter on horsebacke he became prisoner.</p>
                  <p>The eight garland <hi>Monsieur de Mally</hi> a Flemish Gentleman, and a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower
of the Duke of <hi>Arscot,</hi> obtained. That Knight was brauely furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in white siluer, and called himselfe the furious Knight.</p>
                  <p>Last of all, the prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> with his Band of Knights appeared: their
attire was vermilion cloth of gold, wrought with flowers of siluer, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
about with lace of gold. The Caparisons of their horses were of the
same. Also the Saddles, the Petrels, Croopers, and Girthes were of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion
silke, mixed with gold; so was euery mans scaberd, and all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours
in their Creasts were made of white and vermilion red. The chiefe
Knight of the princes company was the Marques of <hi>Pescara,</hi> sonne to the
Marquesse of <hi>Guasta</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who called himselfe Knight <hi>Anonius;</hi> a beard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
yong man, yet so valorous, as in that fight he receiued a crowne.</p>
                  <p>Next to him was the Baron, <hi>Noirquerk,</hi> a Fleming, called Knight of the
the Rose: a gallant Gentleman, yet at the first encounter taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p>The third was the Marquesse of <hi>Monte,</hi> Knight of the Skie, because his
Armour was of that colour: Hee passed the Strait, but further hee could
not goe.</p>
                  <p>The fourth was the Prince of <hi>Piemount</hi> and Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> whose vertue
merited a garland, but his sword could not gaine more ground, but onely
to enter the Iland.</p>
                  <p>The fift was the Prince of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who brake his two first Launces with
great courage: and the third was torne with so great violence, as thereof
ten pieces were seen to lie on the ground.</p>
                  <p>These courses furiously perfourmed, he drew forth his sword, and with
marueilous speede pearced further into the Iland: till in the end of three
assaults, he gained the place where the fatall sword was: whereof hauing
layd hold, he flourished ouer his head, and forthwith the misty cloudes
of darkenes vanished: so, as euery man might see all places of the Castel.</p>
                  <p>The darkenes of the fortresse thus driuen away, the Prince with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted
sword touched the wals: and immediatly they fell downe.</p>
                  <p>The castel thus demolished, the Inchanter <hi>Norabroc,</hi> with a Turkish cap
on his head, came forth: and kneeling on his knees, desired the Princes
pardon. Therewith also he set at libertie all the knights whom he held in
prison, and they being free, in triumphant wise fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Before the King, went the Prince his sonne, sixe Dukes, sixe Earles, and
eighteene Barons, besides other Lordes, Knights, Esquiers, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to the number of 900. or thereabout.</p>
                  <p>By the way awaited the Lord Mayor with his brethren, and officers of
the City. Also the companies of euery Hall in their Liueries, which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
amounted to sixe hundred.</p>
                  <p>All the streets where the King passed, were hanged with cloth of golde,
siluer, or rich Arras.</p>
                  <p>That day and the next, all the conduits were full of wine, some Claret,
and some White.</p>
                  <p>The night before the Coronation, the King washed his body: and the
next morning prayed, in the presence of three Prelats.</p>
                  <p>The next morning, the Clergie in great numbers attended the King to
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17413:98"/>
the Temple of Westminster: and from thence all the Lords and Knights
of the Order in their robes awaited vpon his Maiestie to the Pallace, who
all that way marched vnder the Canopy of State.</p>
                  <p>On either hand of the King a sword was caried: the one represented the
Ecclesiasticall, the other Politicall iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>The Ecclesiasticall sword was borne by the Prince of Wales the Kings
sonne: the sword of Iustice, <hi>Henry Percie</hi> Earle of Northumberland and
Constable of England, did beare: which office was lately taken from the
Earle of Rutland and giuen to him. The scepter was caried by the Earle of
Westmerland Marshall of England.</p>
                  <p>In this order, and thus accompanied, the King came into the Church,
where he found a place of State prepared in the mids: there he set himselfe
downe, being furnished with all his rich and royall ornaments, the crowne
excepted.</p>
                  <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury preached, and shewed the Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
vnto the people, saying, Behold him here that is to raigne ouer you, for
so God hath ordained: Will you (quoth hee) consent he shall be crowned
your King? whereunto they answered, Yea: and holding vp their hands,
offered to be sworne.</p>
                  <p>Then the King went downe from his seate, and kneeled before the high
Altar, where two Archbishops and ten Bishops did take off his royall gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and annoynt him in the presence of all the multitude: <hi>viz.</hi> on the
crowne of his head, on the breast, on the shoulders, on the palmes of his
hands: which done, they set his cap vpon his head.</p>
                  <p>Then the King put vpon him a garment like vnto a Deacon, and girt
the same, as Prelates vse to doe. Then they buckled vpon one of his feete a
Spurre, and drew forth the sword of Iustice, which they deliuered into the
Kings hand, and he put it vp into the sheath: when it was put vp, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of Canterbury girt it vnto his side.</p>
                  <p>Then was the Crowne of S. <hi>Edward</hi> brought thither, and by that Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
set vpon the Kings head.</p>
                  <p>All these ceremonies, and Diuine Seruice finished, the King with the
same pompe he came to the Church, returned to the Pallace: in the mids
whereof was a fountaine which flowed with wine, white and red.</p>
                  <p>At dinner, the King did sit at the first table: at the second sate the fiue
chiefe Peeres of the kingdome: at the third, the Mayor and Aldermen:
at the fourth, the nine new made Knights: at the fifh, the Knights &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Kings house.</p>
                  <p>So long as the King did sit, the Prince of Wales stood on his right hand,
holding the Ecclesiasticall sword: and on the left hand stood the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of England, shaking the sword of Iustice: vnder them stood the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
holding the Scepter.</p>
                  <p>At the Kings table, besides the King, two Archbishops and three other
Bishops did sit.</p>
                  <p>In the dinner time a Knight well mounted &amp; armed at all peeces, came
into the Hall: and before him rode an other horseman, that caried his
Launce; his name was <hi>Dymmock.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:17413:98"/>
This Champion hauing his sword drawen, and a Mace also ready, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
vnto the king a scroule of paper: wherein was contained; that if any
Gentleman would denie that <hi>Henry</hi> there present, were not the lawfull
King of <hi>England,</hi> he was ready by Armes to maintaine it, where and when
the King should command.</p>
                  <p>This Cartell was deliuered to a King of Armes, and by the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
proclaimed in the palace, and in sixe places of the Citie: but
no man found to say the contrary: and so the ceremonie of this Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ended.</p>

and Lords of the blood, whom the next day he dubbed Knights.</p>
                  <p>On Sonday after, the King went vnto the Church, which was most

with all pomp possible, the King was crowned.</p>
                  <p>Then to the end that all men might haue cause to reioice, the King was
pleased to remit and forgiue all taxations, subsidies and impositions by
what name soeuer, lately inuented.</p>
                  <p>The Coronation finished, his Maiestie returned to the palace, where his

Ambassadors of all Kings and Princes: sauing of the Pope, and the King
of England, which was supposed to be of purpose; lest the deputies of the
Germane Princes should preceed them.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor being come to <hi>Aquisgran,</hi> alighted at our Lady Church:
and there (after prayers) he talked particularly with the Electors, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him to his lodging.</p>
                  <p>One other day they met againe in the Temple, where the throng was so
great, as hardly the Guard could make roome.</p>
                  <p>In the mids of the Temple, a great Crowne was hanged, and vnder it
carpets were spred, whereupon <hi>Caesar</hi> did prostrate himselfe, till the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop
of <hi>Collen</hi> had ended certaine prayers.</p>
                  <p>Then the Archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Treuer</hi> did take him vp and led him
before our Ladies altar: where againe he fell downe vpon his face, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
prayers, they led him to his throne of State.</p>
                  <p>When these ceremonies were ended, the Bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> begunne the
Masse, and hauing said a part thereof, he asked the Emperor (in the Latine
tongue) <hi>If he would conserue the Christian faith? defend the Church? do Iustice?
protect the Empire? defend widowes, fatherlesse children, and people distressed?</hi>
Whereunto, when he had consented, hee was led to the Altar: and there
with a solemne othe, confirmed the words he had spoken, and returned to
his throne.</p>
                  <p>After the oath taken, the Bishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> said other prayers, and then
put oyle vpon his head, his brest, the bending places of his armes, and the
palmes of his hands.</p>

                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:17413:100"/>
Being thus anointed, the Archbishops of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Treuer</hi> led him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Vestry, where they apparelled him as a deacon, and in that habit
brought him forth, and placed him in his throne, where after more prayers,
the Archbishop of <hi>Cullen</hi> (in presence of the whole Clergie,) deliuered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his hand a naked sword, and recommended to him the Common weale.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> hauing the sword in his hand, put it into the sheath: which done,
they put vpon his finger a Ring, and on his shoulders they cast a Regal
cloake.</p>
                  <p>They also deliuered to him a Scepter and a Ball, to represent the forme
of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Then all the three Bishops layed hand on the Crowne, and set it vpon
the Emperours head.</p>
                  <p>When all these things were done, hee was againe brought vnto the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and there sworne to performe the duetie of a good Prince.</p>
                  <p>That oath taken, the Emperour accompanied with those Bishops, went
vp higher, and there sate in a seat of stone. Then the Bishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> (in
the Germane tongue) spake alowd, and wished that his Maiestie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to him subiect, might long liue in health and happinesse. After which
words, in signe of publicke ioy, the Quoristers and instruments of Musicke
made melody.</p>
                  <p>At all these solemne prayers the Lady <hi>Margarita</hi> aunt to the Emperor,
and gouernesse of the Low countreys was present.</p>
                  <p>In the end of these complements he receiued the Sacrament: and made
many Knights, which honour (as mine Auctor saith) was anciently the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of vertue and approued valor: but now the custome is, that if a King
do lightly lay his sword vpon any mans shoulder, that fauour alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ceremony or other merit, shall make him a Knight: which is the
cause, that title is giuen not only to Gentlemen well borne, but also to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
and others, that ambitiously do seeke it.</p>
                  <p>All these things being done in the Church, the Emperour returned to
his Pallace, which was most magnificently prepared. There he dined:
and so did the Electors: euery one sitting at a table by himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The dinner being ended, and the tables taken away: the Bishop of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer</hi>
tooke place right against the Emperour, for so the law of <hi>Charlemaine</hi>
determined.</p>
                  <p>In ages more ancient, an oxes body filled full of small beasts and fowles,
was rosted, on the day of <hi>Caesars</hi> Inauguration, whereof one part was serued
at his table, the rest giuen to the multitude. Two Conduits were likewise
made to runne wine all that day.</p>
                  <p>Dinner being done, the Emperour retired into his chamber, and there
he deliuered the seales of the Empire vnto the Archbishop of <hi>Mentz:</hi> and
the next day all the Electors supped with his Maiestie.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is written, how at a triumph in the noble citie of <hi>Naples,</hi>
a Gentleman called the L. <hi>Peter</hi> Counte of <hi>Derise,</hi> receiued
so furious an encounter by the Launce of another that ran
against him, that therewith he became at one instant disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of his shield, his Curats and Headpeece, so as he being
vtterly disarmed, was left on horsebacke in his doublet onely, without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
harme. In requital whereof, the said <hi>Peter</hi> gaue vnto the other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
so violent a blow, as therewith the girthes of the horse were broken,
and the man cast headlong on the ground.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon a question was moued, which of them had merited most
honour, or rather which of them deserued least reproch? Whereunto was
answered absolutely, that he who fell from the horse, was most dishonored,
for (next vnto death) to fall from the horse is most reprochfull.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is lesse disgrace to fall with the horse, then to fal alone: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
albeit a man doth runne neuer so well, if in the end he doth fall from
the horse, he can by no meanes receiue honour for that day, but shal rather
depart with disgrace.</p>
                  <p>Who so fighteth on foot at Barrier, or in any other exercise of Armes,
is by the force of his aduersary constrained with his hand to touch the
ground, shall thereby lose all commendation.</p>
                  <p>He that on horsebacke directeth his Launce at the head, is more to be
praised, then he that toucheth lower. For the higher the Launce hitteth,
the greater is the Runners commendation.</p>
                  <p>Whoso runneth low is not onely vnworthy praise, but also meriteth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.
And he who so carieth his Launce comely and firme, is more to be
praised, although he breake not, then he who misgouerneth his horse, or
vnskilfully handleth his Launce, although he doeth breake.</p>
                  <p>He that vseth to runne high, sitteth steadily and mooueth least in his
course, accompanying his horse euenly and iustly, is in running worthy all
commendation.</p>
                  <p>He that falleth with the encounter of the aduersary, although (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said) the same be a great disgrace: yet is it more excuseable, then if he
remaineth on horsebacke amazed, suffering his horse to wander he wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
not whither.</p>
                  <p>He that with his Launce taketh away the rest of the aduersaries Armor,
meriteth more honour, then he that taketh away any other ornament.</p>
                  <p>He that breaketh his Launce on the pomel or bolster of his aduersaries
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17413:102"/>
faddle, deserueth worse then he who beareth his Launce well without
breaking.</p>
                  <p>He that breaketh on the face or other part of the horse, meriteth worse
then he that breaketh not at all.</p>
                  <p>He that hurteth an horse, shall not receiue honour, although before he
hath run well: for he that hurteth an horse is in like predicament with him
that falleth, who cannot on that day receiue any honour.</p>
                  <p>He is worthy small estimation that cannot gouerne his owne horse, or
that sitteth loose in his saddle: but much is he to be praised, that with his
force disordereth his aduersary in the saddle.</p>
                  <p>He that letteth his Launce fall, can claime no commendation. And
lesse worthy praise is he that knoweth not how it should be charged.</p>
                  <p>He that breaketh the Launce furiously in many pieces, is more reputed,
then he that breaketh it faintly in one onely place.</p>
                  <p>He that conueyeth his Lance into the Rest in due time, is worthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
but he that carieth it shaking in his hand, or vnstayedly in the
Rest, meriteth blame.</p>
                  <p>He that dexteriously carieth the Launce long on the arme, and skilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conueyeth it into the Rest nere the time of encounter, is more allowed,
them he that suddenly and at the first setting out doth charge it.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, he is worthy all commendation, that beareth himselfe wel
on horsebacke, that sitteth comely, that fitteth his body well with Armor,
that hath his person so disposed, as if it were without Armor, that can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to weare it long, &amp; that till the end of the day disarmeth not his head.</p>
                  <p>He that performeth not all his determined courses, ought not receiue
any prize or honor.</p>
                  <p>He that hurteth or toucheth an horse with his Launce, shal neither haue
prize nor praise, for he is in case as though he had fallen.</p>
                  <p>He that doth fall, may not run any more in that day, vnlesse he falleth
on his feet standing right vp, and be also a Challenger: for in that case he
may returne to horse &amp; answere all commers, because on that day hee is so
bound to doe.</p>

                     <p>HAuing here spoken of forreine triumphs, I thinke it not impertinent
(and haply my duety also) to remember what honour hath bene by
like Actions done vnto the Kings of <hi>England</hi> our own natural Souereigns.
For albeit the Romans, the Persians, &amp; Syrians being heretofore the most
mighty Monarches of the world, and consequently of greatest pompe, yet
in later time (and chiefly within these 500. yeeres) no Prince Christian
hath liued more honourably then the Kings of England. And as their
prowesse in Armes hath bene great, so their Courts for magnificence and
greatnesse needed not giue place to any, which may appeare by the often
and excellent triumphes celebrated before Kings and Queenes of this
land. Yea certaine it is, that neither <hi>France, Spaine, Germany</hi> or other Nation
Christian was euer honoured with so many Militarie triumphes, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
hath bene, chiefly in the raigne of her Maiestie who now liueth: as
hereafter shal appeare. For besides other excellent triumphal Actions, and
Militarie pastimes since her Maiesties raigne, a yeerely (and as it were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary)
triumph hath bene celebrated to her Highnesse honour, by the
noble and vertuous Gentlemen of her Court; a custome neuer before vsed
not knowen in any Court or Countrey. And albeit (as hath bene former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
remembred) the Triumphes of <hi>Germany</hi> were of great pompe and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
yet because they were furnished with the whole number of Princes
and Nobilitie of that Nation, (and the celebration rare) they seeme to me
lesse admirable then our owne, which haue continued more then 30.
yeeres yeerely, without intermission; and performed chiefly (and in effect
onely) by the Princes, Lords and Gentlemen dayly attendant vpon her
Maiesties Royal person. Whereby the honour of those Actions is indeed
due to her Highnesse Court onely.</p>

                     <p>To these actions of Armes, we may adde a notable Tourneament on
horsebacke, solemnized within her Maiesties pallace at Westminster:
which became the more rare and memorable, because it was performed in
the night. The manner whereof in briefe was thus.</p>
                     <p>It pleased her Maiestie, (according to her Princely custome in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
of noble strangers) to conuite vnto supper the Duke <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie,</hi>
chiefe Marshall of <hi>France,</hi> at that time come thither to receiue the
honourable order of the Garder. This magnificent supper ended, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
her Highnesse (the weather being warme) to walke out of her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
into the open Tarrace, whither also (awayting on her) went the sayd
Duke, and all others of the French Nobilitie, with the Ambassadours,
Lords and Ladies of the Court. At her Maiesties comming to the North
side of the Tarrace, there were prepared and set rich chaires, cushions and
carpets. In which place it pleased her to stay, entertayning most gratiously
the said Duke, and other Noble strangers. Next vnto them were placed
the Ladies, Lords, Counsellers, and other persons of reputation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their degrees and conuenience of the roome. So as the said Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race
was on all sides beset with Lord, Ladies, and persons of qualitie,
sumptuously apparelled, and richly furnished, and among them (both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
and vnder) stood many of the Guard in their rich coates, holding an
infinite number of Torches: and so in the preaching place: by which
meane, those that beheld the Tarrace in this sort furnished, deemed it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Theater celestiall, then a pallace of earthly building.</p>
                     <p>The place with this Royall presence replenished, suddainly entred <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> and with him twelue Gentlemen armed at all peeces, and
well mounted. The Earle and his horse was furnished with white cloth of
siluer, and the rest in white sattin, who after reuerence done to her Maiesty,
marched to the East side of the Court, and there in troope, stood firme.
Forthwith entred <hi>Edward</hi> Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> with a like number, in like sort
armed and apparelled all in blew: and hauing presented his reuerence,
stayed on the West end. Before either of these bands, one Chariot was
drawen, and therein a faire Damsell, conducted by an armed Knight, who
pronounced certaine speeches in the French tongue, vnto her Maiestie.
These Ceremonies passed, The Queene commanded the armed men to
fall vnto fight: which was performed with great courage, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
chiefly in the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> a noble personage, valorous in armes,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17413:106"/>
and all other wayes of great vertue. Truely this Action was marueilously
magnificent, and appeared a sight exceeding glorious to those that were
below looking vpward to the Tarrace, where her Maiestie, the Lords and
Ladies stood, so pompously apparelled, iewelled and furnished, as hardly
can be seene the like in any Christian Court, as my selfe saw, and other the
Actors (at occasions staying from fight) with great admiration did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
and thinke.</p>
                     <p>Of the Actors names in this Triumph (it seemeth) no note is kept: yet

The ceremonies of which assignation were publiquely performed
in presence of her Maiestie, her Ladies and Nobilitie, also an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

                  <p>On the 17. day of Nouember, <hi>Anno</hi> 1590. this honourable Gentleman
together with the Earle of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> hauing first performed their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice

Also, on the one side there stood an Altar couered with cloth of gold, and
thereupon two waxe candles burning in rich candlesticks, vpon the Altar
also were layd certaine Princely presents, which after by three Virgins
were presented vnto her Maiestie. Before the doore of this Temple stood
a crowned Pillar, embraced by an Eglantine tree, whereon there hanged a

                  </lg>
                  <p>The gifts which the Vestall maydens presented vnto her Maiesty, were
these: A vaile of white exceeding rich and curiously wrought: a cloke and
safegard set with buttons of gold, and on them were grauen Emprezes of
excellent deuise: in the loope of euery button was a noble mans badge,
fixed to a pillar richly embrodered.</p>
                  <p>And here (by way of digression) let vs remember a speech which this
noble Gentleman vsed at such time as these buttons were set vpon the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
aforesaid: I would (quoth he) that all my friends might haue bene
remembred in these buttons, but there is not roome enough to containe
them all; and if I haue them not all, then (said hee) those that are left out,
may take exception. Whereunto another standing by, answered: Sir, let
as many be placed as can be, and cause the last button to be made like the
Caracter of <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now Godamercie with all my heart (quoth the Knight)
for I would not haue giuen the <hi>Caetera</hi> of my friends for a milion of gold.</p>
                  <p>But to returne to the purpose, These presents and prayer being with
great reuerence deliuered into her Maiesties owne hands, and he himselfe
disarmed, offered vp his armour at the foot of her Maiesties crowned pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
and kneeling vpon his knees, presented the Earle of Cumberland, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beseeching she would be pleased to accept him for her Knight, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the yeerely exercises aforesaid. Her Maiesty gratiously accepting of
that offer, this aged Knight armed the Earle, and mounted him vpon his
horse. That being done, he put vpon his owne person a side coat of blacke
Veluet pointed vnder the arme, and couered his head (in liew of an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met)
with a buttoned cap of the countrey fashion.</p>
                  <p>After all these ceremonies, for diuers dayes hee ware vpon his cloake a
crowne embrodered, with a certaine motto or deuice, but what his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therein was, himselfe best knoweth.</p>
                  <p>Now to conclude the matter of assignation, you shall vnderstand, that
this noble Gentleman by her Maiesties expresse commandement, is yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17413:108"/>
(without respect vnto his age) personally present at these military exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises,
there to see, suruey, and as one most carefull &amp; skilfull to direct them;
for indeed his vertue and valour in Arms is such as deserueth to command.
And touching that point, I will let you know the opinion of <hi>Monsieur de
Champany,</hi> a Gentleman of great experience and notable obseruation,
who at his beeing Embassadour in England for causes of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
and writing to his friends there, in one of his intercepted Letters, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other occurrents these words were found: I was (quoth he) one day
by Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> Captaine of her Maiesties guard inuited to El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,
an house of the Queenes, whereof he was the guradian: At which
time I heard and saw three things that in all my trauel of France, Italy, and
Spaine, I neuer heard or saw the like. The first was a consort of musicke, so
excellent and sweet as cannot be expressed. The second a course at a Bucke
with the best and most beautifull Greyhounds that euer I did behold. And
the third a man of Armes excellently mounted, richly armed, and indeed
the most accomplished <hi>Caualiero</hi> I had euer seene. This Knight was called
Sir <hi>Henry Lea,</hi> who that day (accompanied with other Gentlemen of the
Court) onely to doe me honour, vouchsafed at my returne to Greenwich
to breake certaine Lances: which action was performed with great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and commendation. Thus much was the substance (and well neere
the whole circumstance) of Sir <hi>Henry Lea</hi> his last taking of Armes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he seemed to imitate the auncient Romanes, who hauing serued a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
time, and claiming the priuiledges due to old Souldiers (whome
they called <hi>Emeriti</hi>) did come into <hi>Campo Martio,</hi> euery man leading his
owne horse; and there offered his Armes vnto <hi>Mars</hi> in presence of the
chiefe Magistrates: which ceremony, <hi>Scipio, Cassius,</hi> the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> with
many other noble Captaines, disdained not to doe.</p>
                  <p>Summarily, these annuall Actions haue bene most nobly perfourmed
(according to their times) by one Duke, 19 Earles, 27 Barons, 4 Knights
of the Garter, and aboue 150 other Knights and Esquiers.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow fora much as all that which hath bene hitherto said,
doeth tend to extoll the excellencie of Armes and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
with the dignities to them appertaining: Yet for
not being mistaken in my meaning, I haue thought good
to say, that the commendation due vnto learning, is of no
lesse desart then that which belongeth to Marshall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
And indeed very rarely doeth any man excell in Armes, that is vtterly
ignorant of good letters: For what man vnlearned can conceiue the orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and disposing of men, in marching, incamping, and fighting, without
<hi>Arithmetique?</hi> Or who can comprehend the ingenious fortifications or
instruments apt for Offence or Defence of Townes, or passing of waters, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17413:108"/>
he hath knowledge of <hi>Geometrie?</hi> or how may Sea seruice be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
without skill to know the <hi>Latitude</hi> of the place, by the <hi>Pole,</hi> and the
<hi>Longitude</hi> by other Starres? which must be learned of <hi>Astronomers.</hi> Yea,
learning is of such necessitie, that no common weale without it can be well
gouerned, neither was any State euer well ordered, vnlesse the Gouernors
thereof had studied Philosophie: chiefly that part, that intreateth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
for that onely informeth, first, how euery man should gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
Secondly, how hee should guide his owne family, and thirdly
teacheth, how a Citie or Common weale may be well ordered and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
both in warre and peace. Which moued <hi>Plato</hi> to say, <hi>That happy is the
common weale where either the Prince is a Philosopher, or where a Philosopher is
the Prince.</hi> And although it cannot be denied that Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
are both wonne and kept, aswell by force and manhood, as by wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and pollicie: yet is the chiefe of that pollicie attained vnto by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
For in all gouernments, the wiser haue authoritie aboue the rude and
vnlearned: as in euery priuate house or towne, the most discreet and best
experienced are preferred; so in all Nations they that be most ciuill, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and politique, doe finde meanes to command the rest: although in
force, they be inferiour. The experience hereof was apparantly seene in
the Grecians and Romanes; among whom, like as wisedome and learning
was most esteemed, so their Empires were spread furthest, and continued
longest. And to prooue that excellencie of learning in those Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
against others equall to them in manhood and courage, we also will
vse this onely example: That albeit this Realme before any conquest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
was (no doubt) inhabited with people of great courage; yet for that
they were vnciuil, or at the least, without policie and learning, they were
brought vnder the subiection of other Nations: as the Saxons were last by
the Normans, and the Romanes by the Saxons before that, and the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
by the Romanes first of all.</p>
                     <p>And albeit diuers men haue bene and yet are, both wise and politique
without learning, and some also that be learned (in respect of wordly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie)
be very simple: yet I say, that such wise men should haue bene more
excellent, if they had bene learned, and the other more simple and foolish,
they had bene vtterly without learning.</p>
                     <p>Exercise in warre maketh not euery man fit to be a Captaine, though he
follow Armes neuer so long: and yet is there none so vnapt for warre, but
with vse is more perfect, and the rather if he be learned. For if experience
doeth helpe, then I am sure that learning helpeth much more to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of wisedome. We will then determine, that experience, because it
doeth further Wisedome, may be called the father thereof, and Memorie
the mother; because she doth nourish and preserue it: for in vaine should
experience bee sought for, if the same were not held in remembrance.
Then if both experience and memory be holpen and encreased by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
it must needs be confessed, that experience helpeth it.</p>
                     <p>Euery man seeth that the experience of an old man, maketh him wiser
then the yonger, because he hath seene more. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:17413:109"/>
age and experience, but whatsoeuer hath bene in long time past; yea since
the first writer tooke pen in hand, &amp; therefore must needs know more then
the vnlearned man, be he neuer so old: for no memory can compare with
writing. Besides that, if the vnlearned doe forget any thing seene, hardly
shall hee reduce it to memory againe: whereas the learned man by tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his booke, hath meane to call to remembrance, what hee happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to forget. Therefore as he that liueth fourescore yeeres, must needes
haue more experience then he that liueth fortie: so he that seeth in bookes,
the actions of men a thousand yeres, knoweth more then he, that by liuing
one hundreth yeeres could attaine vnto. In like manner, if he that trauai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
many Nations, be of more experience then others of like age, that
neuer went from their natiue Countrey: so he that is learned, by Cosmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie,
histories, and other learning, seeth the maner and vsage of euery
countrey in the world, yea of many more than is possible for one man (in
all his life) to trauell through: and of those he trauaileth, much better doth
he learne, by small abode there, then an other by longer experience that is
altogether vnlearned. By this learning also we may conceiue the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Temperature, and qualitie of euery Countrey throughout the world.
Also through the Science of Astronomy we know the course of Planets
aboue, and their aspects and coniunctions, which the learned men in times
past attained vnto by long conference and obseruation: but we by perusing
their bookes onely, may learne it: yet without that helpe we could neuer.
To conclude, there is nothing either of profit or necessitie for mans life,
but by learning is taught more perfectly, than it can be compassed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
or other meane whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>But leauing the commodities of learning to be discoursed by those that
are learned in deede, this onely I say, that the endeuour of Gentlemen,
ought be either in Armes or learning, or in them both. And in my poore
conceit, hardly deserueth he any title of honour, that doth not take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in the one or the other.</p>
                     <p>For as no liuing creature is borne to idlenesse, so is there no doubt, but
God and nature hath destined ech one, for some commendable businesse.</p>
                     <p>And like as base occupations are fit for folke of base fortune, so valiant
and venturous minds, in actions of honour and vertue should be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And if in this earthly life any there be that meriteth fame or fauor, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the same is a vertuous life and valorous endeuor. Wherof <hi>Iuuenal</hi> saith:

                     <p>And continuing the consideration of this matter, I am occasioned to
be sory, that our English youth doe not onely earnestly affect vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and improfitable pastimes, as recreation: but also vse them with dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
labour, as their chiefe businesse, and speciall profession. And to speake
plaine, I am more then halfe perswaded, that great sort of our Gentlemen
(chiefly those that haue had their nurture at home with their owne igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
parents) doe take more comfort to be called good Faulkoners, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
woodmen, then either skilfull Souldiers, or learned Schollers. Yet
who so obserueth, shall find, that the same men by secret instinct of gentle
nature, doe not a litle glory in the ancient badges, titles, and seruices of
their Auncestors, supposing those passed merrits (supported with riches)
ought, without further sufficiencie, make them more worthy then others,
whose owne proper labour and vertue haue indeede deserued much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
But as no fowle flyeth with the wings of another, nor no horse doth
runne on legges not his owne, so should no man be praysed or admired for
the vertue or good merit of another. And albeit the fame of Auncestors
honour, may (for some short space) maintaine a certaine hope of vertue,
(chiefly where no vice appeareth) yet time, which doth distinguish things
indeede, from those that onely appeare, will also (like vnto counterfeit
mettal) bewray the want or worth of euery man, and for such a one he shall
be knowen and esteemed, of what name, house, parentage or predecessor
soeuer he is descended. It therfore behoueth euery Gentleman well borne,
to embrace the loue of vertue, and in the actions thereof to employ the
course of his whole life For what can be more pleasing to a generous mind,
then the studie of wisedome? whereby to know good from euill, and truth
from falshood, the one to be followed, the other eschewed.</p>
                     <p>What may be more blessed then Iustice? whereby we refraine from all
iniuries, and giue vnto euery one that which to him appertaineth: what is
more noble then fortitude? which conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth all wordly accidents, &amp; with
inuincible courage fighteth for equity and right. And what is more besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a noble personage then temperance? which teacheth comelines and
moderation, gouerning the passions &amp; perturbations of mind, to the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse
of mans life, and contentation of others. These, with other vertues
on them depending, haue from base birth and poore parentage, aduanced
many to great titles and dignity: and as those vertuous endeauors haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
them, so discontinuance did vtterly deface that honor in their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.
Vertue (I say) is that, which from meane estate hath raised the louers
<pb facs="tcp:17413:110"/>
therof to great reputation and glory. Among infinite examples (omitting
men of meaner fortune, yet worthy much honour) we haue <hi>Agathocles, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,
Pertinax, Dioclesian, Valentinian,</hi> with other Emperors, Kings, &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
Of like fortune in birth was <hi>M. Tullius, Cato, Horace,</hi> and diuers most
notable learned men: yea <hi>Socrates</hi> himselfe (who by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> was
iudged the wisest man aliue) had no great parentage. And <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> that
both in armes and learning excelled, was the first Emperor, and from low
degree aspired to excessiue glory. Notwithstanding, through protraction
of time, and the degeneration of posterity, not only their owne houses and
names are vanished, but also the honour &amp; renowme of the nations where
they liued, is vtterly decayed and extinguished: which the Christian Poet
<hi>Palingenius</hi> did well expresse in these verses.</p>

                     <p>Thus haue we heard the meanes of aspiring vnto honour, and by what
occasion the same is lost &amp; decayed. But well I wot, that vnto these reasons
and examples produced to incite our English youth, they answere, That
were they sure to attaine vnto the least part of that fortune these great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages,
and many others their inferiours haue come vnto, then would
they not feare to aduenture their labor and liues to the vttermost: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the paines and perils are certein, &amp; the successe doubtful, they thinke
it more wisdome to Hunt and Hawke at home, then hazard their bodies
abroad, or beate their braines about that, which haply shall neuer turne
them to profit. This silly allegation compounded of sloth and pusillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
may easily bee refelled, but rarely reformed: notwithstanding (for
that I am vsed to loose my labour) I will reply thereunto thus: That seeing
no reward is due before desert, and that honour is the recompence of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
it may not be looked for, vntill some vertuous testimony be first shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
What Souldier is so simple, as entring into pay, wil at the first day looke
to be made a Captaine, or haue promise within fewe yeeres to become a
Generall? what Scholler will at his first comming to study, demand the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
due vnto Art, or shortly after (with little learning) will challenge to
be a Doctor? Yet true it is, that sometimes the simplest Archer doeth hit
the marke, which many an excellent shooter misseth; yet hardly will any
wise man bee brought to lay money on his side, or hope of such successe.
Euen so, in the attaining of Honor, although fauour and fortune oft times
preferreth the vnworthy: yet the true way and most likely meane thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
is true vertue and industrious life. Wherefore concluding, I say, that
euery noble and magnanimous mind, doth not so much couet the reward
of vertue, as it taketh delight therein. As the Poet sayth:

euer to bee at the Princes disposition

Scripture <hi>Hester cap.</hi> 6.) Yet the
Maiesty of our present Soueraigne hath
euer consented, that all noble persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,

should precede according to order anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
vsed in the reignes of her most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

diuers considerations, some alteration hath bene: As sometimes the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
haue taken place before Princes, and all other Lords: and some other
times the Temporall Lords and Officers did march next vnto the King.
In some other time the chiefe precedence was giuen to Dukes, Marquesses
and Earles, without respect vnto the Kings blood, his Alliance or fauour.
So as no absolute order, or precise rule hath bene on that behalfe obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and is the cause that questions and confusion do oft times arise at the
assembly and meeting of great personages, and others of dignitie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.
For auoiding of which inconueniences, it may please her royall
Maiestie, by princely power and sacred wisedome, to signifie her pleasure
on that behalfe; to the end that persons of dignitie, Magistrates, Officers,
and other subiects of qualitie, may be martialled and ranged accordingly.
For as good order is an ornament of great excellencie: so confusion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
discord, and is the roote of many most dangerous questions: which
moued the Philosophers to say, that the losse of worldly wealth is lesse
grieuous to men of generous minde, then the priuation of place and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

due places, without preiudice to their superiours or equals. For so great
is the force of ambition, as oftentimes priuate ostentation seeketh to put
backe true dignitie, and impudent presumption presumeth to step before
vertue, honour, and honourable merit.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onor, saith <hi>Cicero,</hi> is the reward of vertue, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
the recompense of vice: whoso then desireth
to aspire vnto Honor, it behooueth him to come
thereunto by the way of vertue, which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
couertly expressed in building the Temple
of Honour, so as no man could passe thereunto,
but first he was forced to goe through the Church
dedicated to Vertue. But because the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, are not well informed what Vertue meaneth, it shall bee expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to say, that Vertue is a good habite, and true perfection of reason;
whereunto whoso will attaine, it behooueth him to consider, what and
how many the morall Vertues are, chiefly those fewe, of the which the rest
haue dependance. Therefore to begin with that which of all others is most
necessary for preseruation of humane societie, I say that Iustice is a vertue
which enformeth euery man to rest contented with so much as to him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth,
and giue to all others that which to them belongeth. This is it
which conserueth peace, and whereof men be deseruingly called Good.
Next therunto we thinke Temperance or modestie, ought to accompanie
euery wise man, and chiefly him that hath authoritie ouer others: For no
man there is that can rightly iudge, howe to direct the maners of other
men, that knoweth not first how to gouerne him selfe. The rule whereof
is this vertue of Temperance: which teacheth a moderation of hope, and
feare; and of ioy, and sorow; with euery other affection or perturbation of
minde. Next vnto these (in euery man truely honourable) Fortitude de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruingly
requireth her place, as that which protecteth and defendeth the
actions both of moderation and Iustice. This is that vertue which enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
valiant men to fight for Iustice, and not to offend others, vnlesse iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
shall thereunto enforce. These I say are the chiefe and most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of all morall vertues. Yet for that euery of them requireth the ayde
and excellencie of Prudence (being a vertue intellectiue) we wish that all
honourable personages should be therewith indued, considering that the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17413:112"/>
force thereof is a certaine naturall skill to distinguish the good from euill,
to desire the one, and detest the other, to say that is fit to be spoken, and
conceale that which is vnfit to be vttered: to prosecute that which is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and forsake that which is vicious and vile. Yea, the excellencie of
Prudence is such, as without it no other vertue can proceed: Which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
some Philosophers to affirme, that Prudence alone included the force
and power of all vertues. But omitting to discourse more largely, I say,
that whosoeuer is possessed with so excellent graces, doth iustly deserue to
be accompted good and honourable: For albeit riches and authority be
vulgarly reputed great honors, yet whoso hath most high Titles, or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
vnlesse his proceedings be such as are consonant to Iustice, he may be
accompted a man of more authoritie then vertue.</p>
                  <p>Likewise, he that immoderately and vntemperately pampereth his own
body, not confining his sensuall pleasures, vnto the bounds of reason, doth
seeme rather subiect to bestial voluptuousnesse, then vertuous moderation:
and consequently both vnable to gouerne himselfe, and vnapt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
others.</p>
                  <p>Many other vertues there are fit to be found in euery honorrable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage,
but among them, pietie, liberalitie, mercie, and affabilitie are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ornaments in euery noble and generous minde. It is not therefore
as ignorant persons and vnskilfull folke doe surmise, that great riches, or
titles of dignitie, do make men honourable, vnlesse they be accompanied
with the vertues and perfections aforesayd: for riches (albeit they are a
great ornament to illustrate vertue) yet are they not any efficient cause to
make men honourable.</p>
                  <p>Neither are dignities in descents of noble blood, enough to aduance
men vnto Honor: for whatsoeuer is not within vs, cannot be iustly called
ours, but rather the graces and goods of fortune.</p>
                  <p>And who so pleaseth to haue thereof more perfect proofe, let him lay
before his consideration some mechanicall man, that by prouidence or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimony
hath aspired vnto excessiue riches, or by vndeserued fauour is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
to high titles: yet in the opinion of those that doe indeed knowe
how to distinguish of euery mans merit, he shall be deemed rather notable
for his imperfections, then worthy of true Honor.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He scope and marke of each mans endeauour, is either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
or honour. The one proper to men in bare or meane for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
the other to persons of vertue and generous minde.
But now we will in this worke entreat only of the last: For
as one man is more worthy then another, so ought hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17413:113"/>
others to be preferred and honoured. It therefore behoueth to know
that Honour is a certaine testimony of ech mans excellency in vertue, and
who so desireth to be honored, must endeauour to win some apparant note
of worthinesse, either before God or men. In the first case no humane skill
or coniecture can iudge. Neither is it lawfull for any man to call him Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,
that hath not by vertuous merit acquired some exterior title, or
made proofe of honourable merit either in words or deeds. The signes or
notes of Nobility are these, <hi>Notitia, Laus, Ciuilis excellentia, Generositas.</hi>
Some learned writers therefore haue said, that Honor consisteth signes
exterior. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth it, <hi>Maximum bonorum exteriorum.</hi> Others
affirme, it is a certaine reuerence in testimony of vertue. <hi>Lucas de Penna</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth
Honor in these words, <hi>Honor est administratio reipub. cum dignitatis
gradu siue cum sumptu, siue sine sumptu.</hi> And S. <hi>Austen</hi> speaking of Honour in

                        </expan> incendimur ad studia gloria.</hi> Diuers other definitions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
there are, which for breuitie we omit.</p>
                  <p>Touching the worth or prise of Honour, it ought be valued aboue all
earthly wealth, and is more precious then siluer or gold: and I suppose that
hope of honor and feare of punishment, be the breeders thereof; the one
inciteth mans minde to honest endeuour, the other suppresseth leaud incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and maketh bad motions obedient to reason. <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to restraine the force of audacious youth, ordained by law eight diuers
punishments, calling them <hi>damnum, vincula, verbera, talio, ignominia, exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium,
mors, seruitus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here is to be noted, that Honour and Reuerence are in nature diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:
because reuerence is only the first motiue to honour, which after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
honour absolute. The like difference is betweene honour and
praise, for honour is of it selfe, and in it selfe: but praise ten deth to a further
end. Moreouer, honor is a testimony of excellencie, chiefly in vertue: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according to each mans vertue and merit, honours are bestowed, and
ought not be giuen to the vnworthy: so concluding with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> I say,
<hi>Prauus honore non est dignus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much of Honour and the nature thereof. Now we thinke fitte to
say, that the power and authority to bestow honour resteth onely in the
Prince. For the Law sayth: <hi>Honorandus est, quem Princeps honorat:</hi> adding,
<hi>quem Princeps iudicat dignum, &amp; nos iudicabimus: nam nullus debet esse tantae
superbiae fastigio tumidus, vt regalem sensum contemnat. Cap. de priuilegijs eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
qui in sacro palatio militant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seemeth also expedient to know how men become honoured, and by
what meanes they aspire thereunto: for <hi>Aristotle</hi> sayth, <hi>Honor est praemium
virtutis.</hi> Some are also honored for their dignity, as Princes, Prelates, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
and other men of great place or title.</p>
                  <p>Others are honoured for their age or anciencie: and so is it commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in holy Scripture, <hi>Coram cano capite consurge, Leu.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Others are honoured for their function, as Preachers and Ministers of
the word. And some be honoured for magistracie or authority in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweale:
As <hi>Casaneus</hi> remembreth, That when the sonne of Q. <hi>Fabius
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17413:113"/>
Max.</hi> was Consul, and sitting in the seat of magistracie, he commanded his
father from his horse being mounted in his presence, according as it was
instituted by the ancient Romans, That no man on horsebacke should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch
the Consul, but for honours sake he should first alight, as <hi>Val. Max. in
tit. de Instit. antiquis,</hi> reporteth. <hi>Fabius</hi> therefore beeing so commaunded
from his horse by his sonne, pronounced this most excellent sentence: <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lui
ante iussum tuum descendere, non vt imperium tuum contemnerem, sed vt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perirer
an scires consulem agere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others are honoured as Parents, to whom their children &amp; nephewes
doe owe all duety and obedience: as is commanded in the booke of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs,
<hi>Honora patrem &amp; matrem, vt sis long aeuus super terram,</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>To these, many other causes of Honour may be added, as subiects to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
their Prince, seruants their masters, inferiours their superiours. And
diuers demonstrations of honour are also due by externall countenance,
words, and gesture; as by attentiue hearing of him that speaketh, by rising
to him that passeth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He that sitteth doth receiue honour from him that standeth: yet a man
of dignity in presence of Iudges ought to sit &amp; not to stand as other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
persons doe, vnlesse his owne cause be pleaded. So sayth <hi>Baldus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man that sitteth at the table is more honoured then hee that serueth,
and he that sitteth on the right hand is more honoured then he that sitteth
on the left hand.</p>
                  <p>He is also honored that sitteth next to the Prince, or neerest to him that
is of greatest dignity. We also account him honored that standeth or wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in the mids of two, or a greater number, <hi>quia mediocritas in electione loci

                  </p>
                  <p>He is likewise reputed most honoured, that sitteth at the chiefe ende, or

                  <p>He is most honoured that walketh next the wall (vnlesse they be three
in number) for then he that is in the mids, is in the worthiest place, as hath
bene formerly said. And he that sitteth next the wall, hath the higher place.
But if three of equall qualitie do walke together, then (for not offering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie
one th'other) sometimes one, and sometimes the other, ought
to take the middle place, which Order the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Venetians</hi> doe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
obserue: affirming the right side to be most Honourable.</p>
                  <p>Among brethren the eldest is alwaies to precede. And so are their wiues
to take place: <hi>In pari dignitate.</hi> Except by some peculiar dignitie the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be graced.</p>
                  <p>In like maner where many are of one company or fellowship, as in the
Innes of Court, or the Vniuersities, the more ancient is euer most honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and shall precede others, <hi>In pari dignitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men are also honoured in their diet, for the more honorable the ghest is,
the more delicate ought his fare be. Likewise the apparell of men ought be
differing, according to their degrees, to the end the profession and qualitie
of euery one may be knowen: as an arming Coat best becommeth a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
a Tippet is seemely for a Priest, a Gowne is meetest for a Scholler, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:17413:114"/>
eche mans attire ought be like vnto the State, profession, and office
he beareth: as appeareth by that caution which <hi>Seneca</hi> did giue vnto the
Empresse, mother of <hi>Nero.</hi> His wordes are these, <hi>Indue te, charissima vxor,
delicatè, non propter te, sed propter honorem Imperij.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man is also honoured, when his Prince or other superior is pleased to
salute him by word or writing, or to grace him with gift of any Office or
dignitie.</p>
                  <p>Men are honoured when for any egregious acte, they are permitted to
erect Images of themselues: as <hi>Porcius Cato, Horatius Cocles, Mutius Scaeuola</hi>
and other notable men were suffered to doe.</p>
                  <p>Men are honoured by drinking in gold, and wearing of purple, also by
being stiled the cousins of Princes.</p>
                  <p>Men are honoured by bearing Armes: For who so hath Armes from
ancesters, is more honourable then he who is the first Gentleman of his
race, and consequently ought be placed in a more worthy seate. Note here
that to euery title of great dignitie, a particular ensigne or ornament is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.

wanting. These Kings had also 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

kinds. And <hi>Polydor</hi> in his booke aforesaid speaketh of many, affirming

at which time they were made of boughes and trees, afterwards they

                     </gap>eall, and in
the Pastoral Comedies also, and by imitation of them, others were framed
of slender barres of tinne, or some other mettall guilded: so as in processe
of time many kinds of Crownes were inuented and much esteemed, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among the Romanes, and in the time of Consuls.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe Crownes were Militarie, and with them Consuls and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Commanders, in their triumphes were crowned. At the beginning
those crownes were made of bayes: which tree sheweth mirth and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
and after of gold.</p>
                  <p>The next they called <hi>Corona Muralis,</hi> giuen to him that first was seene
vpon the wall of the Enemies towne. This Crowne was also of golde
wrought with certaine battlements like vnto a wall.</p>
                  <p>The third they named <hi>Corona Castrensis</hi> likewise of gold: being giuen to
him that could breake the wall of the enemie, &amp; enter the towne or castle.
The points of this Crowne was made like Towers.</p>
                  <p>The fourth was <hi>Corona Naualis</hi> also of gold garnished with forecastles,
giuen to him that by force and vertue first boarded the enemies ship.</p>
                  <p>The fift was <hi>Corona Oleaginea</hi> bestowed vpon them that were victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

                  <p>
                     <hi>Corona Oualis</hi> was made of Mirtle, and giuen to them that entred a
Towne, taken with litle resistance, or yeelded vpon composition, or when
the warre was proclaimed, or made against slaues or pirats onely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corona obsidialis</hi> was giuen to a Generall leader that had saued his armie
distressed. That Crowne was made of grasse growing where the Armie
was besieged. Such a one the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> bestowed vpon
<hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> in the second warre against the Carthagenians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corona Ciuica</hi> was also of high estimation, being giuen to him that saued
a Citizen from the enemie. This Crowne was made of Oaken boughes,
and reputed an ensigne of exceeding honor. Of which opinion <hi>Antoninus
Pius</hi> seemed to be, saying: <hi>Malo vnum ciuem seruare, quàm mille hostes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidere.</hi>

<hi>Corona Populea</hi> was giuen to yong men industrious and disposed to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
endeuour.</p>
                  <p>Other ensignes Militarie the Romanes vsed, and were bestowed in token
of dignitie: as chaines of gold, gilt spurres, launces, and white rods, the
one a token of warre, the other of peace. We will also speake of Crownes
of later deuice giuen to great Estates.</p>

of Emperour was first in vse among the Romanes, and by
them inuented, not for Princes, but chiefe Leaders and
Captaines of the warre. At the beginning they were yerely created in
Ianuary, and ended their authority in September: which custome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

with the surname of <hi>Augustus,</hi> for his happy gouernment: which
name hath bene euer since vsed by all Emperours to this day. So appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it that the title of Emperor began in <hi>Rome, Anno mundi</hi> 3914. or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
say 3963 <hi>ab vrbe condita</hi> 706. And before the birth of Christ 47.</p>
                  <p>This Emperor and his successors continued their seate at <hi>Rome</hi> vntill
the reigne of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, <hi>Anno Christi</hi> 310. by whom the Emperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Court was transferred to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> So the Empire became diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into two Empires, one Emperour gouerned at <hi>Constantinople</hi> in the
East, the other at <hi>Rome</hi> in the West. Which order continued from the
reigne of <hi>Carolus magnus</hi> vntill <hi>Constantinus Paleologus.</hi> In whose time <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi>
was besieged, and taken by the Turkes.</p>
                  <p>The West Empire after the death of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> hath in diuers ages
bene gouerned by Princes of diuers nations, as Frenchmen, Saxons, Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uians,
and Austrians, who presently hold that dignitie.</p>
                  <p>In the reigne of <hi>Otho</hi> 3. (with the consent of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> 5.) the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Emperour was taken from the Italians, and granted vnto seuen
Princes of <hi>Germany, viz.</hi> the Archbishops of <hi>Mentz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Treuer,</hi> and <hi>Colein,</hi> the
<hi>Count Palatin</hi> of <hi>Rheine,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxon,</hi> the Marquesse of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> then called Duke of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> This order was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confirmed in the reigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, about the yeere 1378.</p>
                  <p>Among Princes secular, an Emperor hath anciently bene reputed wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a chiefe place, and to precede all other Princes, which is the cause
that <hi>Baldus</hi> called an Emperour the Vicar or Vicegerent of God vpon
earth: and therefore when other Princes are crowned with one onely
Crowne, an Emperor hath euer had three.</p>
                  <p>The first Crowne is of iron, which he receiueth at <hi>Aquisgran,</hi> by the
hand of the Archbishop of <hi>Colein,</hi> within whose Diocesse that Citie is

                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:17413:115"/>
The second Crowne is of siluer, which hee taketh at the hand of the
Archbishop of <hi>Milan,</hi> in the Citie of <hi>Modena,</hi> after he is arriued in <hi>Italy.</hi> Yet
true it is, that the Emperour <hi>Henrie</hi> receiued it at <hi>Milan</hi> in S. <hi>Ambrose</hi>
Church: and haply so haue some other Emperors. Siluer signifieth clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and brightnesse. Yet some writers haue sayd, the first Crowne is of
siluer, and the second of iron, which <hi>Cass.</hi> denieth.</p>
                  <p>The third Crowne is of pure golde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he is crowned at <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope, in the
Church of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> before the Altar of <hi>S. Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riee.</hi>
Gold is accompted the most excellent of
all mettals, and of such perfection in Iustice
Emperors and Princes ought be. In these three
mettals all Tributes and other dueties were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently

At the Inauguration and Coronation of an

words are pronounced, <hi>viz. Thou oughtest to

liue, endeuour to preserue peace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Scepter and sword are deliuered into his hand, it is likewise
said vnto him: viz. <hi>By these signes thou art admonished to correct subiects with
a fatherly chastisement, extending thy hand of mercie, first vnto the ministers of

For the better conceiuing of that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth,
it shall not be impertinent to know, that Kings,
Princes, and other soueraigne Commanders, did in the
beginning) aspire vnto greatnes by puissance and force:
of which number <hi>Cain</hi> was the first, as <hi>Austen lib. 15. de ciuitate Dei cap.</hi> 20.
writeth. This <hi>Cain</hi> to the end he might with more commoditie command
his people, builded a citie, calling it by his sonnes name <hi>Enoch:</hi> and was
the first citie in the world, as appeareth in <hi>Genes. cap.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>After the flood, the first King that raigned, was <hi>Nimrod</hi> descended of
the line of <hi>Cham,</hi> as we find in <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. whose sonne builded the Tower of
<hi>Babel,</hi> intending to make the same of height equall to the heauen. But the
Lord offended with his ambition inspired the people to speake in diuers
languages, for before that time, all men had onely one tongue, <hi>Gen. cap.</hi> 9.</p>

                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:17413:116"/>
These and other Princes were oppressors of people, and displeasing to
God, for which cause they receiued vnfortunate ende. The first King
of <hi>Barbary,</hi> exercising the arte Magike was slaine by the deuill. In like
manner other ancient Monarkes raigning tyrannically, ended their liues
by violence. As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (whose heart being hardned against the Lord) was
drowned in the red sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. Also <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
vp by the earth, <hi>Numb. 16. Antiochus</hi> eaten of lice, 2. <hi>Mac. 9. Saul</hi> the first
King of Israel, disobedient to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and other ministers of the Lord, was
wounded of the Philistims, and in the end desperately stabbed himselfe to
death with his owne sword, 1. <hi>Kings.</hi> 31. And <hi>Absalon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
rebelling against his father, was slaine by <hi>Ioab, 1. King.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>Too long it were to tell by how many meanes the Almighty Lord hath
punished the vngodly and impious oppressors of people, and with what
power and grace he hath protected those Kings &amp; Princes that gouerned
with Iustice, &amp; maintained people in peace: for indeede there is no power
but from God, as Christ speaking to <hi>Pilat</hi> said: <hi>Non haberes potestatem ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersum
me vllam, nisi datum tibi esset desuper. Ioh.</hi> 19. It appeareth also that
good Princes doe deserue diuine honour, as <hi>S. Austen</hi> seemeth to affirme.
And the Apostle in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> saith. <hi>Qui bene praesunt, duplici
honore dignisunt.</hi> Good and godly Kings therfore haue receiued from God
diuine vertue aboue all other creatures. As was scene in <hi>Saul:</hi> who being
made King by <hi>Samuel</hi> foorthwith became inspired with the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
and the Spirit of God did enter into him, whereby he prophecied

                  <p>If seemeth also that Kings, are diuinely inspired with diuers other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttcular

The dignitie of Earles is of diuers kindes: for an Earle acknowledging no
superiour, is equall to a Prince; but if he acknowledge a superior, he is but
in degree with a Generall. And as Earles for their vertues and heroicall
qualities, are reputed Princes, or companions vnto Princes: so ought they

                  <p>One other degree of great estate and titular dignity there is, called Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:

authority ouer their owne vassals as if they conspire against them, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence

                  <p>Note that a Baron hauing <hi>Iura Imperialia</hi> or <hi>Iura Regalia,</hi> is reputed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual

                  <p>Note also, that Barons doe participate of diuers priuiledges and Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities

                  <p>Barons by creation, are either solemnely created by another name, then

                  <p>In which diuersities although Barons be diuersly made, yet are they all

So is euery Esquier a Gentleman, but euery Gentleman not an Esquier,

by the Prince, as a testimonie of fauour, or a signe of his vertue that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

sorts of Esquiers according to the custome of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first of them, and the most ancient, are the eldest sonnes of Knights,
and eldest sonnes of them successiuely.</p>
                  <p>The second sort, are the eldest sonnes of the younger sonnes of Barons,
and Noble men of higher degree, which take end, &amp; are determined when
the chiefe Masles of such elder sonnes doe faile, and that the inheritance
goeth away with the heires females<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third sort are those, that by the King are created Esquiets by the
gift of a Collar of SS. and such bearing Armes are the principall of that
coat Armour, and of their whole race, out of whose families although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other houses doe spring and issue, yet the eldest of that coat Armour
onely is an Esquier, and the residue are but Gentlemen.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last sort of Esquiers are such, as bearing office in the
common weale, or in the Kings house, are therefore called and reputed to
be Esquiers, as the Serieants at the Lawe, the Escheators in euery shire,
and in the Kings house, the Serieant of euery Office: but hauing no Armes,
that degree dieth with them, and their issue is not ennobled thereby.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mounsieur P. Pithou,</hi> in his memories of the Earles of <hi>Champagne,</hi> and
<hi>Brie</hi> saith further, that among the Fiefes of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Fiefe called
<hi>Fiefe de Haubert,</hi> was that which in Latine is <hi>Feuda Loricae,</hi> or <hi>Feuda Scutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum</hi>
the very originall of the name of our Esquiers, comming of the
Armes, and seruice which they ought to Knights, for they helde their
land of a Knight by Scutage, as a Knight helde his land of the King,
by Knights seruice. And such Fiefes were called <hi>Vray Vassaulx,</hi> being
bound alwayes to serue their Lorde (by reason of their Fiefe) without
pay.</p>
                  <p>There are also in <hi>England</hi> other sorts of Esquiers, which courtesie and
custome haue made, among which they are reputed Esquiers that are able
at the Musters to present a Launce, or light horse, for the Princes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
not vnlike the manner of the Spaniardes, where all freehoulders are
called <hi>Caualieros,</hi> that doe keepe horse for the Kings impolyments.</p>

in Latine <hi>Nobiles</hi> or <hi>Ingenui,</hi> in the French <hi>Nobles,</hi> in the
English <hi>Gentlemen. Gens</hi> in Latine betokeneth a race, a sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
or family: as the Romans had <hi>Traquinij, Valerij, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tij,
Claudij, Cincinnati, Fabij, Cossi,</hi> and such like: so haue we
in England certaine names, which for their continuance in reputation,
vertue, and riches, may be in Latine called <hi>Agnati</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that is, men
knowen, or Gentlemen of this or that name and family. But let vs consider
how this Nobility is defined, and by how many meanes men doe thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
aspire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iudocus Clicthouius</hi> defineth Nobilitie thus: <hi>Nobilitas est generis velalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
rei excellentia ac dignitas, Tract. Nobil. Cap.</hi> 1. Nobility is the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of gentle race, or of some other good quality. And <hi>Bartholus</hi> discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
long, whether Nobilitie and Dignity be but one, concludeth they are
not: yet (said he) the one resembleth the other, <hi>Lib. 1. Cap. de Dig.</hi> adding,
That as he to whome God hath vouchsafed his grace, is before his diuine
Maiesty, noble; so before men, who so is fauoured by his Prince or the
Lawes, ought be receiued for noble. This Nobilitie therefore is thus defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
<hi>Nobilitas est qualitas illata per Principatum tenentem, qua quis vltra accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos
plebeios honestus ostenditur:</hi> Nobility is a title bestowed by him that hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
place of the Prince, and maketh him that receiueth it to be of better
reputation then other men.</p>
                  <p>Of Nobilitie (or as we call it Gentilitie) diuers diuisions by diuers men
haue bene. <hi>Bartholus</hi> sayth, That of Nobility there are three kinds, <hi>viz. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas
theologica seu supernaturalis, Nobilitas naturalis, Nobilitas politica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first is a certaine Nobilitie knowen to God only: and they that be
so ennobled, be noble for integrity and vertue.</p>
                  <p>The second Nobility may be considered in two respects, as <hi>Bartholus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth:
For, both creatures vnreasonable and they that are senslesse may
(in some sort) be called Noble, as we see Birds euen of one <hi>Espece</hi> or kind,
some prooue noble and some ignoble; as of Falcons, some are Gentle and
some Haggard. Likewise of fourefooted beasts, some are Noble, as the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
some ignoble, as the Wolfe: which <hi>Ouid</hi> in his booke <hi>de Tristibus</hi> well
expresseth:

                        <l>Et faciles motus mens generosa capit.</l>

                     <hi>Politica nobilitas,</hi> is that honour which the Prince giueth: as hath bene
formerly said.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his 4. booke of <hi>Politikes</hi> maketh foure kindes of Nobility,
<hi>viz. Diuitiarum, Generis, Virtutis, &amp; Disciplinae:</hi> that is, noble by riches, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by ancestors, noble for vertue, and noble for learning. But leauing to
say more concerning the qualitie of Nobility, let vs returne to those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
that we formerly called priuate or simple Gentlemen. We say there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they ought be preferred before all other men without dignity,
whensoeuer any comparison is made. For this word Gentleman or <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,
id est, nos cibilis,</hi> is a name of preheminence to distinguish men of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
from base people. We read in holy Scripture, how Moses constituted
certaine Iudges, and called them <hi>Sapientes</hi> and <hi>Nobiles, Deut. 1. Samuel</hi> was
also called <hi>Nobilis</hi> for his excellencie in prophecying. It is likewise in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
Beata terra cuius Rex nobilis est.</hi> And <hi>Aristot.</hi> in his <hi>Polit.</hi> sayth, <hi>Nobilitas
apud omnes in honore habetur.</hi> And <hi>Seneca</hi> sayth, <hi>Habet hoc proprium generosus
animus, quod concitatur ad honesta.</hi> Now for so much as Nobility or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rositie
is the first degree or steppe whereby men ascend to greater dignity,
it seemeth fit to be enformed how that title is acquired. We say therefore,
that some are Gentlemen by blood of Ancestours, as appeareth in the
booke of <hi>Wisd 3. Gloria hominis ex honore patris sui, &amp; contumelia filij pater
sine honore.</hi> Also, <hi>Gloria filiorum parentes eorum, Prou.</hi> 18. Yet is this to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood,
that the worde <hi>Parentes</hi> signifieth the Nobilitie of fathers, not of
mothers, as <hi>Bal.</hi> affirmeth <hi>Cap. de Seruis fugiti.</hi> Of which opinion <hi>Cicero</hi> in
his Offices seemeth to be, saying, <hi>Optima haereditas à patribus traditur liberis,
omnis<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

                        </expan> gestarum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly men are made Noble for wisdome: for in true wisdome No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
consisteth, <hi>Sap.</hi> 7. And Prudence ought bee preferred before all ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
yea nothing desirable can be thereunto compared, <hi>Prou</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly men are aduanced for learning in the Lawes Ciuil: hereof it
commeth, that Doctors of Law are to be honoured so highly, as no other
man (how honourable soeuer) shall presume to call them <hi>Fratres,</hi> but <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,
Le. 1. Cod.</hi> Yet <hi>Bonus de Curtili</hi> in his treatise of Nobility sayth, That in
the opinion of <hi>Bartolus,</hi> knowledge or learning doth not make a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
vnlesse hee be dignified with the title of Doctor, or graced by some
office of reputation, and if that be taken away, he shalbe reputed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
person.</p>
                  <p>Item, men placed in Offices Iudicial, are thereby made noble: for euery
Iudge ought be reputed a Gentleman in regard of his Office. Also euery
officer vnder the Prince, I meane, hauing any Office of honor or worship, is
therby made a Gentleman. <hi>Dignitas &amp; nobilitas idem sunt Bart de Dig li.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Item, men become noble for vertue, and chiefly Iustice: which moued
<hi>Lucas de Penna</hi> to define Nobilitie thus, <hi>Nobilitas nihil aliud est, quàm habitus
operatioque virtutis, in homine.</hi> And another old writer summarily saith,
<q>
                        <l>Nobilitas hominis, est mens Deitatis Imago.</l>
                        <l>Nobilitas hominis, virtutum clara propago.</l>
                        <l>Nobilitas hominis, humilem releuare iacentem.</l>
                        <l>Nobilitas hominis, mentem refrenare furentem.</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>Item, if any common person by his vertue or fortune doe chance to be
made a Duke, and Earle, a Baron, or do aspire to any other dignitie of honor
or worship, he thereby becommeth a Gentleman. Or if he be made a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of a Countrey or castle, hauing pension or fee appertaining thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
he ought be a Gentleman: For which reason, euery man of dignitie is a
Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Item, they are Nobilitated to whom the Prince granteth any honorable
Fee farme, Pension, or intertainement for life: chiefly if the same be ancient.
<hi>Quoniam feodum nobile nobilitat suum possessorem.</hi> And that Fee is indeed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and Honourable, which by custome is vsed to be giuen by the Prince
to Gentlemen onely, and if the same be granted to any ignoble person, that
donation doeth not presently make the receiuer noble: <hi>Quoniam nobilitas
ictu oculi non nascitur. Bal. Praeludij Feodoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lucas de Penna</hi> saith, that if a Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
do buy an honorable Fee, he shal not thereby become a Gentleman.
The reason therof is, <hi>Res à persona sumit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditionem, &amp; honore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; non e contra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, by common opinion some ignoble persons are called Gentlemen.
Of these the number is infinite, yet are they not indeed Noble, but vulgarly
so esteemed: as <hi>Lucas de Penna</hi> saith.</p>
                  <p>Item, men are ennobled by the Princes grant, as <hi>Baldus</hi> affirmeth, Yet if
a simple subiect, being made a Gentleman, doe not exercise the qualities
beseeming that dignitie, he ought be depriued of that title: Or if hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
with base men, or apparell himselfe and his wife in garments vnfit for
their degree, they shall not be accompted Noble. <hi>Quia habitus demonstrat
qualitatem &amp; dignitatem personae deferentis.</hi> And as these persons made Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
in not exercising the professions of that degree, doe loose the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
thereof: So Captaines and Souldiers discontinuing the warre, doe by
Law loose their reputation. <hi>Milites not exercentes militiam, non gaudent
priuilegijs militum. Bal. in lib. 1. Cod.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item men may sometimes become Noble in respect of the place where
they were borne: For the Citizens of famous Townes may reasonably be
thought more worthy then villaines. Yet if a Gentleman doe inhabite his
village, he shall neuerthelesse continue Noble. <hi>Quia nobilis à rustico, non lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,
sed genere distinguitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item, all men in the princes ordinary seruice and houshold are thereby
ennobled, and ought be Gentlemen. The words <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Law be these. <hi>Omnes

idem sunt. Bart. lib. 1. Ca. de Dignit.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Item, some Gentlemen doe hold that dignitie by prescription, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
other proofe, then that they and their ancestors were called Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
time out of minde. And for this reason it seemeth that Nobilitie the
more ancient it is, the more commendable, chiefly if the first of such fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
were aduanced for vertue. Which Nobilitie is that whereof <hi>Aristotle</hi>
meaneth, saying, <hi>Nobilitas est maiorum quaedam claritas honorabilis progenito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
Likewise <hi>Boetius de Con.</hi> saith, <hi>Nobilitas est quaedam laus proueniens de

                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:17413:122"/>
Item, Nobilitie is oft times gotten by mariage; for if a Gentleman doe
marrie a woman of base parentage, she is thereby ennobled. <hi>Text est in leg.

                  </p>
                  <p>Item, of riches (chiefly if they be ancient) men be called noble; for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
no man is accompted worthy much honour, or of great trust and

                  </p>
                  <p>Item, men be made noble for their seruice in warre, if therein they haue
acquired any charge honorable. For no ordinarie Souldier without place
of commandement is reputed a Gentleman, vnlesse he were so borne, as
<hi>Lucas de Penna</hi> sayth, <hi>Simplex militia dignitatem non habet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Item Doctors and Graduates in Schooles, do merit to be ennobled and

                  <p>Item, in <hi>England</hi> whoso studieth liberal Sciences in the Vniuersities, or
is accounted learned in the common Lawes, and for the most part, who so
can liue idlely, and without manual labour, or will beare the port, charge,
and countenance of a Gentleman, shalbe called Master (for that is the title
which men giue to Esquires and other Gentlemen) and shall be taken for
a Gentleman. For true it is with vs, <hi>Tanti eris alijs, quanti tibi fueris.</hi> So
doth it appeare, that (in <hi>England</hi>) the King needeth not to make Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
because euery man may assume that title, or buy it better cheape,
then by suite to the Prince, or by expence in his seruice. And who so can
make proofe, that his Ancestors or himselfe, haue had Armes, or can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them by purchase, may be called <hi>Armiger</hi> or Esquier. Such men are
called sometime in scorne Gentlemen of the first head, as Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>
pleasantly writeth.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irst it is to be remembred, that Gentlemen (which title
comprehendeth all degrees of dignitie) are either attendant
vpon Princes, or Officers in the State, or els doe liue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately
vpon their owne possessions.</p>
                  <p>These men, as they are diuers, so are they diuersly affected.</p>
                  <p>The Romanes antiently delighted in Armes, but in times of peace oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
themselues in Agriculture, as an exercise honest and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Which <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> seemeth to affirme, by these words: <hi>Bonus Ciues,
&amp; bonus Agricola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Neapolitan</hi> standeth so high vpon his <hi>puntos d'honor,</hi> as for the most
part he scorneth Marchandise, Phisicke, and all other professions profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Yea his disdaine of base parentage is such, as a Gentleman <hi>Neapolitan</hi>
accounteth it more honourable to liue by robbery, then industrie: and will
rather hazard his daughter to incurre infamy, then marry her to a most
rich Marchant, or other ignoble person.</p>
                  <p>The Venetian, albeit he reputeth himselfe the most noble Gentleman
of the world, being capable of all offices in that Common weale, yet he
holdeth it no dishonour to traffique in marchandise.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Genoues</hi> do hold the selfe same opinion: though true it is, that some
of them haue Castles, and houses vpon the mountaines, and there at occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
doe inhabite.</p>
                  <p>The Germaine Gentlemen, doth (as it were euer) abide in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
house or castle, and is not much ashamed to better his reuenew by
robbery and pillage. Yet some of them doe serue or follow Princes, and
thereby become the better nurtured.</p>
                  <p>The French Gentlemen, almost generally doe inhabit their houses in
the Village, and manure their owne lands, which course was anciently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
most commendable. For <hi>Lycurgus</hi> King of the Lacedemonians
made a Law, enioyning all Gentlemen to dwell in the Countrey, the more
commodiously to endeuour the exercises and vertues Militarie.</p>
                  <p>Much after that maner the English Gentlemen that liueth priuately,
doth dispose his life: as one that accounteth it no honour to exercise Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize:
neither did they (in times past) repute the practise of Lawe or
Phisicke, so commendable as now they doe. For their ancient endeuour
was agriculture, and feeding of cattell, to maintaine honorable hospitality,
being perswaded, the more rich they were, the more they were esteemed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:17413:123"/>
Among the Grecians there was not anciently any meane to be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
but only by the Emperours seruice: wherein whosoeuer did continue
any time (were he neuer so basely borne) should notwithstanding be made
a Gentleman.</p>
                  <p>The Egyptians and Affyrians would not admit any man to haue the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of a Gentleman, vnlesse he were a souldier, and skilfull in Militarie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires.
The rest of the people liued as slaues without reputation.</p>
                  <p>The Tartarians and Muscouites doe holde no man worthy the name of
a Gentleman, vnlesse he be a man of Armes, a Captaine, or at the least, a
souldier of extraordinary account. For learning is there of no price.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E reade that anciently the greatest, and most noble Kings
of the world were these: <hi>viz.</hi> The King of <hi>Sycionia,</hi> the King
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and the King of <hi>Assyria;</hi> but of them, that of <hi>Assyria</hi>
of greatest power. For <hi>Ninus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Belus,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
and brought to his obedience all the people of <hi>Asia,
(India</hi> excepted.) Others affirme hee commaunded the one halfe of the
world, and some say he was King of a third part. So writeth S. <hi>Augustine
li. 17. cap. 17. de ci. Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is likewise by other writers said, that in ancient time were foure migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Kingdomes (by <hi>Daniel</hi>) compared to foure mettals: <hi>viz,</hi> That of <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
in the East was likened vnto gold: that of the Persians and Medians to
siluer: that of the North Regions to brasse: that of the Romans in the West
to yron. But the kingdomes of the East were most honourable, though (at
length) it pleased God that the Empire of <hi>Rome</hi> (resembled to yron) both
in longitude and latitude exceeded all others: For as yron doth cut and
decrease all other mettals, so the dominion and power of Romanes abased
and eclipsed all other Regall puissance. Howsoeuer that were, the glory
and greatnesse of the Romane force (in tract of time) did also become of
small force, weake and feeble: according to the prophesie of <hi>Daniel, ca.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>But leauing to speake more of times so ancient, we say that in <hi>Asia</hi> the
chiefe Kingdomes are <hi>Catai, Tharses, Turnester, Corasina, India, Persia, Media,
Georgia, Syria, Cappadocia, Ethinia, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Affrica,</hi> is <hi>Ethiopia, Libya, Arabia, Iudea, Cilicia, Mauritania, Numidia</hi> and
others.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Europe</hi> are likewise many kingdomes, but of them, these are most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent:
<hi>viz. England, France, Scotland, Spaine, Portugal, Denmark, Moscouia,
Sweden, Poland. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now touching the Precedence of these Princes in <hi>Europe</hi> by diuers wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:17413:124"/>
it is affirmed, that the King of <hi>France</hi> may iustly claime the chiefe
place.</p>
                  <p>First, for that it pleased God to send from heauen vnto <hi>Clodoueus</hi> the first
Christian King of that Nation, three Lilies (as a Diuine fauour) to be from
thenceforth borne in the Armes of that kingdome, before which time the
Kings Armes was three Toades.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they alleage that <hi>France</hi> is the most ancient kingdome of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and that <hi>Suardus</hi> was King of that Nation in the raigne of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because the King of <hi>France</hi> is anointed: which indeed seemeth
a marke of much preeminence.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, for that the French King beareth the title of Most Christian.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, because it hath been in sundry papall Consistories decreed, that
the Ambassadours of <hi>France</hi> should precede the Ambassadors of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others hold that Precedencie appertaineth to the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, for that he is entituled, The most Catholique King.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because he is King of many kingdomes, and consequently
of most honour, according to the prouerbe of <hi>Sal. In mulitudine populi digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
regis:</hi> which reason <hi>Salust</hi> seemeth also to confirme, saying, <hi>Maxima
gloria in maximo Imperio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we say the chiefe place of honour, and Precedencie in <hi>Europe,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth
to the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, in respect of ancienty. For albeit <hi>Alexander</hi> first King of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
and of <hi>Persia,</hi> called himselfe King of the world: euen at that time
<hi>Brutus</hi> was King of <hi>England,</hi> and (as some haue sayd) <hi>Suardus</hi> was then King
of <hi>France.</hi> But <hi>Gaquinus</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>France,</hi> maketh no mention
thereof, not recordeth his name among the number of French Kings.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the king of <hi>England</hi> is anointed, and so is no other king, but
the French King, the King of <hi>Sicil,</hi> and the King of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the King of <hi>England</hi> is crowned, which honour the King of
<hi>Spaine, Portugal, Aragon, Nauarra,</hi> and many other Princes haue not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the King of <hi>England</hi> is a Prince most absolute, as from whom
is no appellation, either in iurisdiction Ecclesiastical or Ciuil.</p>
                  <p>And albeit <hi>Enqueranus Monstellet</hi> writeth that in the yeere 1420. at the
Interuiew of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> making their entrie into
the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> the French King did ride on the right hand, and kissed
the Relikes of Saints first: Yet is that no proofe of his right in precedence:
for <hi>Quilibet rex seu Princeps, in suo regno in culmine sedere debet:</hi> so saith <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setus
de potestate Regia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And admit that in time more ancient, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
before <hi>England,</hi> yet since the Conquest, &amp; famous victories of <hi>Henry</hi>
the fift, and Coronation of <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt in <hi>Paris,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
may iustly take place: neither is the title of most Christian any proofe of
ancienty, being only an honour giuen for certein seruices done by King
<hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemaine</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the allegation of <hi>Spaine</hi> affirming that the King Catholike is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of many kingdomes, and therefore of most honor: that reason is of no
consequence. For so is also the King of <hi>England,</hi> whose only kingdome of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17413:124"/>
                     <hi>England</hi> is by nature inexpugnable, and so plentifully peopled as sufficeth
not onely to defend it selfe against all other Nations, but also to inuade,
and conquer, as both <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France</hi> hath made experience.</p>
                  <p>But the last and most effectuall reason in fauour of <hi>England,</hi> is, that the
King and people thereof receiued the Gospell and faith Christian before
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spaine.</hi> Also the Bishops with the Ambassadours English had
precedence in the greatest general Councels of Christendome, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
appeared at the Councell of <hi>Constance,</hi> where the Bishops of <hi>England</hi>
were present and honoured accordingly. At which time it was doubted
whether <hi>Spaine</hi> should be admitted a nation, but in the end the Spaniards
were allowed for the fift and last nation. And al the people there assembled
were diuided into fiue classes or rankes, <hi>viz.</hi> Germanes, French, English,
Italians, and Spaniards.</p>
                  <p>The Germane ranke contained themselues, <hi>Bohemia, Hungaria, Polonia,
Dalmatia, Graecia,</hi> and <hi>Croatia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The French had place alone, as a nation absolute.</p>
                  <p>To the English Nation, <hi>Scotland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi>
were adioyned.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> had all the Kingdomes subiect to <hi>Rome, Sicily, Naples</hi> and
<hi>Argier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were the Ambassadors and Bishops of <hi>Castilia, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon,
Maiorca, Nauarra, Portugall</hi> and <hi>Granado.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This assembly contained the Legates and Ambassadors of 83. Kings.
Besides the person of the Emperor, and King of Romanes, two Popes (for
one died there,) fiue Patriarches, three and thirty Cardinals, fourtie and
seuen Archbishops, a hundreth forty and fiue Bishops, and 83. Suffragans.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ext vnder Emperors, Kings and Princes Souereigne, are
foure degrees of Magistrates.</p>
                  <p>Some are called <hi>Magni</hi> and <hi>Illustres.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are <hi>Medij</hi> and <hi>Spectabiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some are <hi>Minimi</hi> and <hi>Clarissimi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And some are <hi>Infimi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first may be named Magistrates souereigne, as they who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
no superior, but the Maiestie of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>The second are they that yeeld obedience to them, and command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Magistrates their inferiors.</p>
                  <p>The latter two are such as cannot command any Magistrate, but haue
power only ouer particular subiects within the limits of their iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first that haue authority to commaund all other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and acknowledge no superior but the Prince, they are fewer at this
day then heretofore. Yet certaine it seemeth, that some Romane Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
authorized one Magistrate or Lieutenant (without any companion)
to command all other Magistrates of the Empire, and to him all Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and Magistrates did appeale: Which Magistrate they called <hi>Praefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus
Praetorio.</hi> True it is, that at the beginning he was of no greater quality
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17413:125"/>
then Captaine of the Legions <hi>Praetorian,</hi> as <hi>Seius Strabo,</hi> vnder <hi>Augustus,</hi> and
<hi>Seianus</hi> vnder <hi>Tibertus;</hi> vntill other Emperors succeeding by litle and litle
encreased their authority, as in the end the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> became Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
generall, and iudge of all questions and causes whatsoeuer, by
which occasion, that office was giuen vnto men learned in the Lawe: as
<hi>Martian</hi> vnder <hi>Otho, Papinian</hi> vnder <hi>Seuerus,</hi> and <hi>Vlpian</hi> vnder <hi>Alexander.</hi>
All which came to passe, before Armes were diuided from lawes, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticers
from Captaines. Afterwards, this great office became imparted
vnto two, and sometimes three persons, purposely to abridge the excessiue
authority of one.</p>
                  <p>But touching the Precedencie of Magistrates, albeit they cannot aptly
be ranged with those of the Empire, yet may they (in some sort) be placed
according to the dignitie and degrees of those titles which the Romanes
anciently vsed. And touching their authority, it shal not be amisse to know
that a Magistrate is an Officer hauing power to command in the common
weale: among whom in the Romane Empire, the <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> was
the chiefe, hauing authority aboue all other Officers, to whom also euery
one did appeale.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Praetor</hi> or <hi>Praefect</hi> we may compare the <hi>Grand Mayor du Pallais</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> who in times past did in that kingdome beare chiefe office. To him
also in some sort we may resemble the high <hi>Seneschal</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> vnder
King <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, and other Kings his successors. These Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
might therefore bee reasonably called <hi>Illustrissimi</hi> chiefly in the
Kings absence. For sure it is, that in presence of the King all power of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and Commissioners also doth cease: For during that time, they
haue no authority of commandement either ouer other subiects, or other
Officers their inferiors. But this mighty Magistrate is no more either in
<hi>England</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> yet during their authoritie they were called <hi>Illustrissmi:</hi>
which title signified a certein preeminencie aboue all Magistrates that
were <hi>Illustres,</hi> either <hi>Honorarij</hi> or <hi>Administrantes. Nam accidentia denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Subiectum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next to these <hi>Illustrissimi</hi> or <hi>Maximi,</hi> the chiefe place of Precedencie
is due vnto those whome we called <hi>Illustres,</hi> and among them the L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour
is chiefe: <hi>etiam in dignitate impari:</hi> as one whose excellent vertue
ought be preferred before all other officers.</p>
                  <p>Likewise the Lord high Constable or Lord Marshall is a Magistrate
<hi>Illust.</hi> the Lord Treasurer, Admirall of England, the Lord Chamberlaine,
and all others of the Kings priuie Councell may assume the title of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<hi>Illust.</hi> or (as we commonly call them) right Honorable. So saith <hi>Cass.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It seemeth also that Doctours who haue read in schoole the space of
twenty yeeres, may be called <hi>Illustrissimi</hi> as <hi>Purpuratus</hi> noteth.</p>
                  <p>To these <hi>Illust.</hi> or right Honourable personages, the lawes Emperiall
haue graunted many great priuiledges, as the same <hi>Barthol.</hi> discourseth.</p>
                  <p>After these, the Magistrates (whome we formerly called <hi>Spectabiles</hi> and
may in our tongue be tearmed Honourable) ought to follow: as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
in Armes, Iudges, Gouernours, or Lieutenants Generall of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
and Cities, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="tcp:17413:126"/>
The fourth place appertaineth to them that anciently were named <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissimi</hi>
or Right worshipfull, who are inferiour Iusticers and Ministers, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels,
Captaines, and meane Officers, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Lastly are they whome the Romanes intituled <hi>Infimi,</hi> and in English
Worshipfull, as Captaines of particular Castles, Iudges in Townes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate,
where no action is triable aboue 3000 shillings.</p>
                  <p>Note here that euery Magistrate is an Officer, but euery Officer is not a
Magistrate: and of all Magistrates the Lord Chancellor hath euer had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence,
not onely in England and Fraunce, but of all anciencie in euery
other place: for read we may, that <hi>Eginardus</hi> who wrote the life of <hi>Carolus
Magnus,</hi> was his Chancellor. Likewise <hi>Tribonianus</hi> was Chancellor vnto
the Emperor <hi>Iustinian; Iosaphat</hi> was Chancellor to King <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. of <hi>Kings;
Vlpianus</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Alexander; Seneca</hi> to <hi>Nero:</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> the
Chancellor hath so great preheminence, as he precedeth the Constable,
vnlesse he be the Kings brother or his sonne. For the better memory of the
degrees aforesaid, <hi>Lucas de Penna</hi> speaking of titular dignity, hath left these
verses vnderwritten.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Fficers seruing Princes are of diuers sorts: among which,
some doe attend the Princes person, others haue charge of
his Treasure; some are ministers of Iustice, and some are
commanders in warre.</p>
                  <p>For the better conceiuing of our intention therfore, and
the order of that which followeth, it behooueth to know, That the first
places of dignity doe appertaine to those that are attendant and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
in office illustrious. The second is due to them that haue heretofore
borne office of dignity, and are now vacant. The third belongeth to those
that haue obtained an office of dignity in reuersion.</p>
                  <p>These diuers degrees were in the Emperiall Court called <hi>Administran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
Vacantes,</hi> and <hi>Honorarij.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The officers Administrant are to precede; next to them the Vacants,
and then the <hi>Honorarij</hi> or officers extraordinarie: in which order they are
euer to take place, <hi>In simili dignitate, non in dignitate dispari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to begin with Administrants and their order among themselues,
thus it is: He that was first placed or sworne, ought euer to precede, and so
in order from the first to the last, <hi>In paridignitate.</hi> As for example: a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of the Kings Chamber in ordinary attendance, shall take place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all other Gentlemen, <hi>in part dignitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="237" facs="tcp:17413:126"/>
The like order ought be obserued by the Vacants: for he that hath bene
longest vacant, may take place before him that is lesse ancient in vacancie.
As for example: He that was a Viceroy or an Embassador ten yeeres past,
shall sit before him that serued since, <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same course is to be kept among the number of <hi>Honorantes</hi> or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
extraordinary. As for example: Hee to whome any office or other
place of dignity is granted in reuersion, being first therin placed or sworne,
shall goe before all others of his ranke, <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi> As for example: A
Master of Requests extraordinary must precede all others that haue since
obtained that dignity; yet true it is, that an officer extraordinary may be
by birth or otherwise so priuiledged, as he shall take place of a Vacant, and
sometimes also of an Administrant.</p>
                  <p>Note also that euery office or dignity granted by the Prince in his own
presence, shall be of greater reputation then if the same were giuen in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or sent vnto him that receiueth it, <hi>data paritate in reliquis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same law also commandeth that a Vacant shalbe preferred before
an officer extraordinary: and men of Armes seruing in any Emperiall or
Royall Court, shalbe priuiledged before others <hi>in pari dignitate. Iohan. de
Platea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note likewise that these officers (whome we call Vacants) are of two
sorts: The one are they that haue absolutely quitted their offices, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
their places may be supplied by others: the other are they, who had
office in some City, Court, or Countrey, where now no such office is: as
the Counsellors of <hi>Milain,</hi> when that State was subiect to the French king,
are now no more officers in that City, being subiect to the King of Spaine:
yet doe they hold place of other Vacants, <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise an Officer Administrant may sometime precede an Officer
Extraordinary, <hi>etiam in dignitate dispari.</hi> But otherwise it is with a Vacant
or extraordinary officer, for he is neuer preferred <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi> We call
him <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> that hath onely the name of an Officer, without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
or fee: yet shall he goe before all others of that place, being his
punies or men of no place. As for example: A Gentleman waiter Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
shall not onely precede all other Gentlemen of lesse ancientie,
but also sit before all other Gentlemen not the Kings seruants, <hi>in pari dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate.</hi>
And consequently euery man Extraordinary in the Princes seruice,
shall take place before all other men without office, and <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is also to be remembred, that in euery office neere the person of the
King, or in his Royall house, there is euer one supreme and superlatiue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
aboue the rest: and after him other Honorable officers of diuers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
The rest are equall, yet with respect that he who was first preferred,
shall take place first. As for example: The chiefe Officer of the Emperors
house was called <hi>Praefectus sacri Palatij,</hi> and vnder him were certaine <hi>Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes;</hi>
as in the Court of England her Maiesties supreme Officer of houshold
is the Lord Steward, and next to him the Treasurer, Comptroller, &amp; Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer:
in France, <hi>Le Grand Maistre:</hi> in Spaine, <hi>El Maggior domo, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Likewise those Emperors had one <hi>Praefectus sacri Cubiculi:</hi> another <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buli,</hi>
with their <hi>Comites:</hi> as our Souereigne hath a Lord Chamberlaine, a
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17413:127"/>
Master of the horse, and diuers officers inferiour to them. The rest of her
seruants in euery particular office, are to proceede as equals, hauing respect
to ancienty: For he that was first aduanced ought alwayes to take place
first, <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi> Which rule may direct euery man to goe, as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
his qualitie, and consequently eschewe all occasions of offence, or
presumption. Whereunto we will adde one thing (perhaps by euery one
not obserued, or to all men not knowen) which is, that all men seruing
neere vnto the Princes person (in what office or place soeuer) are thereby
priuiledged and honoured. The words of the Law are these. <hi>Adhaerentes
lateri Principis, &amp; eidem in officio seruientes, nobilitantur, &amp; nobiles efficiuntur.
Omnes famulantes principi sunt in dignitate, &amp; ideo nobiles: cum dignitas &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitas

                     <p>He is to haue in his owne house a cloth of Estate, and in euery other

                     <p>A Dukes eldest sonne is borne in the degree of a Marquesse, and shall go

                     <p>Note that a Baron, is an Estate of great dignitie in blood, honor and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
a Peere of the Realme, and companion of Princes, and therefore no

the West doore before her Maiesties entrance in, there was
prouided a rich Chaire of Estate, and the ground being spred likewise with
tapits, her Maiestie kneeled downe against a deske couered with very
Princely furniture, and said the Lords prayer: and then the Bishop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
in his Cope, deliuered her a booke containing all the Orders, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and Priuiledges belonging to the said Church: which her Maiesty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:17413:130"/>
did confirme and redeliuer vnto the Bishop in the presence of all
the Prebends and Churchmen, who attended her Highnesse in very rich
Copes: and so with the whole Quire singing before her, she proceeded vp
into the Chancell, where within a Trauers she rested vntill the Procession
and other diuine Anthems were sung. After which, her Maiesty entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the place ordained for the Duchie of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> which at that time was
newly reedified with faire and large glasse windowes, in which she stayed
during the Sermon preached at the Crosse by Doctor <hi>Perce</hi> then Bish. of
<hi>Salisbury;</hi> where, with the whole assembly of the people she gaue God pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
thankes for that triumphant and euer memorable victory ouer the
Spanish Fleet, proudly by them called Inuincible. The Sermon beeing
done, her Maiestie went to the Bishops Palace, and there dined: and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
euening returned vnto <hi>Somerset</hi> place by torchlight.</p>
                  <p>Against her Highnes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in the morning, the streets were railed and
hung with Blew broad clothes for the seueral Companies in their Liueries
to stand, &amp; euery Company distinguished by Banners, Standards, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of their Armes richly painted, and illumined. The Gentlemen of the
Innes of Court likewise (being placed nere <hi>Temple Bar</hi>) stood orderly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their railes. All the fronts of houses were couered with rich Arras and
Tapistry, and the windowes and streets replenished with all sorts of people
innumerable, who with great applause, and ioyful acclamations, both gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and honoured her Maiesties most Royall proceeding.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Mayor (which was Alderman <hi>Calthrope</hi>) deliuered his Sword
to her Maiestie at Temple Barre, who receiuing it, gaue him a Mace or
Scepter to beare, and deliuered the Sword to the L. Marquesse of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi>
who bare it before her Highnesse all that day.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Artholus, in his discourse <hi>de re Militari &amp; Duello,</hi> diuideth
men into three degrees: viz. great personages aduanced to
dignitie, men of reputation without dignitie, and common
or ignoble persons. Of whom <hi>Iac. Faber</hi> in his discourse vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Aristotles politickes, maketh nine sorts.</p>
                  <p>The first are husbandmen, whose endeuor is employed, about the fruits
of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, artificers occupied Arts either necessarie, honest or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, victualers, retailers of wares, and chapmen.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Marriners and sea souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Fishermen.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Watermen and Ferrymen.</p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, Masons, and labourers in stone.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, workemen of little substance, and Labourers.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Bondmen and slaues.</p>
                  <p>Among common persons in euery Prouince or Towne, the Gouernor
or Captaine is of most reputation, notwithstanding hee be of a common
birth, yet in some Cities, the Maior or chiefe Iudge hath that chiefe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and is superior to the military Officer, but generally men in Office,
are of more reputation then others without office, and Officers for life are
preferred before Officers annuall or time certaine: <hi>Data paritate in alijs.
Raynutius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note also that euery man during the time he beareth office is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
and honoured, as <hi>Purpuratus</hi> writeth: And to say summarily, all
wisemen hauing place of rule in any Prouince, Citie, or Towne, must be
preferred before others, albeit they are aduanced aboue the measure of
their vertue. For no man is so euill, but sometimes he doth well, <hi>Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia

                  </p>
                  <p>Men married are euer to precede men vnmaried, <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi> And
he who hath most children, or lost the greater number in the warre of his
Countrey, is to be most honored, <hi>Lex Iuli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> The like order ought be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
among women maried, <hi>in pari dignitate:</hi> and in <hi>Rome</hi> maydens
did anciently go before widdowes, and wiues also: and sonnes before their
Fathers.</p>
                  <p>Men hauing land of inheritance are to precede other hauing none: and
Citizens that are housholders, must be preferred before others hauing no
habitation, chiefly in such Cities and Townes where their Ancestors and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:17413:132"/>
families haue bene of continuance in reputation of marchandise, or other
possessions. For next after Gentlemen and Magistrates they are to take
place, <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi> Yet here is to be noted, that if any Burgesse, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
or other man of wealth doe happen to purchase a Barony, yet ought
he not be a Baron, nor haue place among Barons, <hi>Iac. Rabuff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A father whose sonne beareth any Office, shall giue place to his sonne
in all publike meetings and seruices: but in priuate affaires, the order of
nature ought be obserued: and in domesticall conuersation, the father shal
goe and sit before the sonne. Likewise a Bishop must doe reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his father at home, but being in the Church the father shal follow him.
So for diuers respects the one and the other is honoured.</p>
                  <p>Betwene two equals, he that is in his owne iurisdiction shal precede: as if
an Archbishop or Cardinall doe come into the Diocesse of a Bishop, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
they be persons of more dignity, yet ought they giue honour
vnto the Bishop, because their presence doth not cancell his authority.</p>
                  <p>A Citizen or dweller of any chiefe City, shall take place of other Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of meaner townes or cities, when soeuer they meet in any place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
yet he who findeth himselfe within his owne Libertie or Iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
shalbe preferred: which mooued <hi>Caesar</hi> to wish himselfe to be rather
the chiefe man of a little village among the Alpes, then the second person
in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among common persons also (chiefly where no dignity is) fathers are
to precede their sonnes: <hi>Honora patrem tuum, &amp; gemitum matris tuae ne obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiscaris,
Eccles</hi> 3. Likewise among equals, age is to be preferred in respect
of wisdome and experience. Many priuiledges and immunities are also
due to old age, and they in counsell ought to speake first: <hi>Loquere maior na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu,
decet enim te, Ecclesiast.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>In the number of men meane borne, they that be learned deserue most
reputation, chiefly when both for Armes and Ciuil gouernment they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
praise, because such men be meete, as well for peace as warre. Also
among learned men the first place is due to Diuines, the next to Ciuilians,
and the third to Physicians. But <hi>Arnoldus de Villa Noua,</hi> sayth, <hi>Primus locus
in mensasolet seruari Sacerdoti, &amp; Medico, in domo infirmi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After men learned, Iudges of inferiour Courts, Notaries, and Clerkes
doe seeme worthy of respect and preferrement: for more credit is to be
giuen vnto a Notary or Scribe then to other men: <hi>Super faciem Scribae im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponet
honorem, Eccles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Also among popular persons, they that be vertuous ought bee most
esteemed: because it were iniury to take reward from men of good desert.
<hi>Honor est praemium virtutis, Arist. 8. Ethic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men of good and charitable mind, are also worthy honour: for actions
of Iustice and pietie, are vniuersally praised: and the more, because men
indued with vertues intellectiue, are not many, <hi>Perdifficile est bonum esse,
Pittacus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this number of Plebeians, to be naturally borne of the countrey or
towne where a man dwelleth, is also reason he should be esteemed: for <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>

                     <pb n="250" facs="tcp:17413:133"/>
They are likewise worthy of respect, that are persons of good fame and
name: <hi>Bona fama impinguat ossa, Eccle.</hi>

                  <p>Among strangers, they ought be preferred that are borne in ciuil and

yet the temperature of the parents complexion giueth a certaine aptnesse

                  <p>After rich men, persons honest and industrious ought be esteemed: for

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S man (aboue other creatures) is honoured in life, so ought
his buriall be decent and honourable: Wherein we are to
follow the example of our Sauiour Christ being both God
and man. For albeit he subiected himselfe to worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies,
and death ignominious, yet was his Funerall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and glorious, according to the prophesie of <hi>Esay,</hi> saying, <hi>Eterit sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chrum
eius gloriosum pro vt sepulchra Adae; Abrahae, Isaac &amp; Iacob, &amp; eorum
vxorum, &amp; aliorum plurium patriarcharum fuerit gloriosa Cap.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>It seemeth also (of all ancientie) that burying of the dead hath bene
much commended: For we finde in <hi>Eccles. Mortuo non negabis gratiam, id
est, sepulturam.</hi> We reade likewise that <hi>Tob.</hi> did bestow sepulture vpon men
dead and slaine.</p>
                  <p>The Romanes likewise vsed many ceremonies in burying of the dead,
anointing their bodies, and in burning them caused many sweet spices to
be cast into the fire. For so was the corps of <hi>Sylla</hi> buried. This custome was
also obserued among the Egyptians, as appeareth in the last of <hi>Gene.</hi> where
<hi>Ioseph</hi> commanded his Phisitions, that they should embalme the bodie of
his father <hi>Iacob.</hi> In performing of which Ceremony they spent forty daies,
and thirty in mourning. In like manner, the people of Israel mourned for
<hi>Moses</hi> thirty daies. <hi>Deut.</hi> 34. And <hi>Valerius tit de Seruata relig.</hi> Maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     </gap>ery Matrone of <hi>Rome</hi> should mourne thirtie dayes, and not
longer. Other customes among other Nations haue bene vsed: for some
were enioyned to end their mourning within fourty dayes: some others
within three, and some in seuen. But in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> the vse of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
hath euer bene thirtie dayes, chiefly among persons of honour, as may
be conceiued of a sentence giuen in <hi>Burgundy</hi> by an Officiall there, who
hauing cited before him a Ladie called <hi>Iaquelina de la Trimoille</hi> daughter to
the Kings Lieutenant generall in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> vpon certaine promises matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,
she answered by Proctor, her apparance ought be excused, in
respect the thirty dayes of her fathers death were not expired: During
which time she might not goe out of her house, which Plea was allowed.</p>
                  <p>By that which hath bene formerly sayd of the last of Gen. we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
three particular honours appertaining vnto a funerall, <hi>viz.</hi> the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balming
of the bodie: the solemne mourning, and the concourse of friends
when the corps is carried to interrement. For <hi>Ioseph</hi> assembled all his chiese
kinsfolke and friends of the house of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to accompany his father vnto
the graue: which custome is still continued specially among persons of
State and reputation. And indeede no Nation is so vnciuill or sauage, as
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17413:134"/>
vtterly to contemne the honest buriall of mens bodies. Yet doe we reade
that the <hi>Lotophagi</hi> doe cast their dead bodies into the Sea, affirming it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no matter whether they consume by earth or water. Which custome
the excellent Doctor <hi>Modestinus</hi> reproueth in these words: <hi>Laudandus est
magis quàm accusandus haeres, qui reliquias testatoris non in mare secundum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
voluntatem abiecerit, sed in memoriam humanae conditionis sepulturae tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.</hi>
Neither doe I like the conceite of <hi>Solon,</hi> who dying in <hi>Cyprus</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
his heires, that the bones of his bodie should be burned, and the ashes
dispersed throughout the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>In old time, the <hi>Albanoys</hi> thought it no point of pietie to take care of the
dead: which Christians may not allow, as hath bene formerly said: <hi>Noli
mortuo denegare gratiam, Eccl.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Scythians</hi> were wont to eate the flesh of dead bodies at their feastes,
as a dish of great delicacie and honour: and the <hi>Hircani</hi> kept dogges pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
to deuoure dead mens carcases. Likewise the <hi>Parthians</hi> seeing any
dead bodie, of man, beast, or bird, did foorthwith teare off the flesh and
then buried the bones.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Massagetae</hi> vsed to beate old mens bodies to death with a cudgell,
and then gaue them to be eaten by Shepheards dogges, and such as died of
sickenesse were deuoured by wilde beasts. All which customes do deserue
to be abhorred.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Athenians</hi> were so carefull of Funerall dutie, as if any man did
neglect to burie a Captaine slaine, he was capitally punished. And the
Egyptians in building of their houses, did neuer forget to make their
Tombes with pyramides and other ornaments of excessiue cost: and they
dying, their bodies were embalmed and kept therein: as <hi>Cicero</hi> in his first
booke of <hi>Tusculane questions</hi> seemeth to affirme.</p>
                  <p>The first great Prince that begun to bury bodies of men slaine in the
warre, was <hi>Hercules:</hi> and such men are much commended by the Prophet.
<hi>Vos benedicti a Domino, qui fecistis misericordiam hanc cum Domino vestro Saul,
&amp; sepelistis eum.</hi> Also <hi>Maccabaus,</hi> commanded his enemies slaine, to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
as appeareth, 2. <hi>Maccob. cap.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius</hi> being slaine, and his bodie brought to <hi>Alexander,</hi> was sent vnto
his mother <hi>Tumbrudina:</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> caused the carkasse of <hi>Paulus Emilius</hi>
to be buried. In like maner <hi>Gracchus</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi> were buried by their
owne enemies. <hi>Valerius lib. 5. de humanitate.</hi> And <hi>Baldus</hi> saieth: <hi>Expedit
reipub, non minus mortuos humari quàm viuentes conseruari.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is also extant, how <hi>Cyrus,</hi> by his testament, commanded his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
should be buried in the earth: and so did the Emperors <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander;</hi>
as <hi>Leonardus Aretinus</hi> hath written <hi>Epist.</hi> 94.</p>
                  <p>But omitting these Rites and Customes of time ancient, and people to
vs vnknowen: we see that at the buriall of our Princes and persons of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
all their friends and domesticall seruants doe assemble, and carrie in
their hands the Armes, Pennons and other Hatchments appertaining vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

40. day after the decease of the defunct according to the example of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
vsed at the burial of <hi>Iacob,</hi> as in the 50. of <hi>Genesis</hi> at large appeareth.</p>

                  <p>It appeareth also in holy Scripture, that the body of Christ was buried

                  </p>
                  <p>We reade likewise in <hi>Tob. 12. Sepelire mortuos est opus pium.</hi> By which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
it seemeth that pompous and honourable Funerals are not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to God, but allowed in all ciuill nations; with this caution, that no
man should be so superstitious as to beleeue these externall complements
to be propitiatorie vnto the soule. For S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>de ciuitat
Dei</hi> saith, <hi>Sepulchroru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> memoria sumptum funeris magis viuorum est consolatio,

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much touching honourable burials: whereunto wee will adde,
That forso much as diuers degrees of men doe vsually and casually meete
at our funerals in <hi>England,</hi> it seemeth necessary that in accompanying of
euery corps, heed should be taken that no indignity be offe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed vnto any
Mourner, but ech man to march in such place, as is meete for his estate.</p>
                  <p>The Heralds therefore by their skill and care, are to take a List or Rolle
of all Mourners, then to marshall them into seuerall classes, by their diuers
titles, as Gentlemen, Esquires, Knights, Barons, Vicounts, Earles, &amp;c. euer
preferring her Maiesties Officers and seruants before all others, <hi>in pari dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate.</hi>
And if none of her Maiesties seruants be there present, then euery
one to proceede according to his antienty <hi>in pari dignitate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this point also it behooueth the Herauld to be heedfull and prouide
that no man exceede in expences or charges superfluous, but euery one to
confine his cost within the bounds of his abilitie: for otherwise doing, the
executors or heires of the defunct, shall hereby receiue preiudice. For
some times we haue seene the buriall of an Esquire more costly then was
fit for a Knight, and a Knights funeral such as might become a Lord. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid
which excesse I could wish, that excepting the number of poore who
are commonly so many as the defunct was yeeres olde, her Maiestie or
Lord Marshall would be pleased to prescribe a certaine number of Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to euery degree, and that no man of greater title then the defunct
should be permitted to mourne, so as the chiefe mourner may euer be <hi>in
pari dignitate</hi> with the defunct, and all the rest of meaner qualitie. As at
the buriall of an Esquire, onely Esquires, Gentlemen, and other inferiour
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:17413:135"/>
persons to mourne. At the funerall of a Knight, onely Knights, Esquires,
Gentlemen and their inferiors. The like order to be taken at all burials of
higher estates. Prouided neuerthelesse, that if the defunct be a Knight of
the Garter, a Knight of the Priuie counsel, or a Lord by office, then it may
be permitted Noblemen to mourne, because they are reputed persons ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable

to saue their Tombes, and places of buriall from ruine and
violation A matter of more consequence, then euery one marketh, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to be looked vnto, both for publique, and priuate respects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> in his Oration against <hi>Varro</hi> telleth how <hi>Scipio</hi> did thinke

Cities, and Princes pallaces. In an other place also he saith, they
were made to retaine in memory, the excellent Actions of such men, as
had liued honourably, and died vertuously.</p>
                  <p>Another respect publique, to continue Monuments in reputation, is
that thereby diuers Arts of good qualitie (as Grauing, Caruing, Masonry,
Painting, Imbossing, and other commendable knowledges, be exercised.
For by such industry, many princely buildings be beautified, and many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
doe aspire to great fame and riches: as <hi>Teledius</hi> and <hi>Theodorus</hi> his
brother: <hi>Lysias</hi> and <hi>Mentor,</hi> who framed the portraitures of <hi>Iupiter Capito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi>

                  <p>Seeing then that these Arts of pourtraying, painting, and sculpture, are

                  <p>And sith we are here occasioned to speake of these matters, it shall not
be amisse to say somewhat of Epitaphs, being indeed Monuments of no
lesse glory and perpetuity, then the greatest Obeliskes and Pyramides of
the world.</p>
                  <p>Of Epitaphs be diuers kindes: some are praiseworthy, some partiall,
some inuectiue, some conceited, some Poeticall, and some Morall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the sundry humors and passions of seuerall writers.</p>
                  <p>The ancient Romanes did make their Epitaphs briefe, plaine, and true,
vsing onely a few letters for wordes: but in these our dayes no wordes are
thought praises enough, nor no praises can suffice vnlesse they do exceed.</p>
                  <p>My selfe haue seene Epitaphs, wherein an ordinarie Orator hath beene
compared to <hi>Cicero,</hi> a meane Poet to <hi>Virgil,</hi> and an audacious captaine to
<hi>Caesar, Pompey, Scipio, Cyrus,</hi> and all the Worthies.</p>
                  <p>
