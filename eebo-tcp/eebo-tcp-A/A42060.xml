            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:103673:6"/>
Now, their peremptory refuſal to flatter the Roman Emperors, in matters of this kind was looked upon as an Argument of their diſaffection and diſloyalty, which, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the malice of their <hi>accuſers,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by their <hi>Judges,</hi> did expoſe them to the ſevereſt cenſures of the Imperial Laws, as if they had been really guilty of Rebellion and Treaſons indeed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Servants of Chriſt were accuſed and thought guilty of ſuch vile <hi>Immoralities</hi> and foul <hi>debaucheries,</hi> as, being committed, would indeed render any man unfit to live. <note place="margin">Aug. de Civ. dei l. <hi>19.</hi> cap. <hi>23.</hi>

               </gap>, &amp;c. We Chriſtians are charged with <hi>Inceſtuous copulations,</hi> with our own Siſters and Mothers too.</p>
            <p>That, which gave occaſion to this foul, but undeſerved reproach, was this; in thoſe days the Servants of Chriſt, being ſorely perſecuted in all places, could not meet to ſerve their God in <hi>publick,</hi> and by <hi>day,</hi> without manifeſt hazard of their lives, and ſo were conſtrained, as <hi>Pliny</hi> informed the Emperor, to hold <hi>Caetus Antelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canos,</hi> their holy Aſſemblies exceeding early, and in the dark. Theſe obſcure and private meetings, though held not of their own choice, but of mere neceſſity; and though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for no other end, but the ſafety of their perſons, whileſt they worſhipped God, did expoſe them to the cenſure of their Enemies; who, willing enough to believe all evil of them, did eaſily ſuſpect them to be guilty of thoſe horrid Crimes, which other wicked men, and perhaps they themſelves, did often act in private and in the dark,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103673:7"/>
And ſince the men of the Pagan World did, though very unjuſtly, believe the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians to be guilty of Adultery, Inceſt and Murder, even that of their own little ones; we cannot much wonder, that they ſhould think their utmoſt <hi>Severity</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them to be an Act of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> yea, and <hi>Religion</hi> too; becauſe even amongſt them, ſuch enormous Crimes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly puniſhed with Death, and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſerve it by the known Laws both of God and Men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Servants of Chriſt were thought to be the Cauſes of all thoſe Publick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which befell the World, and ſo might well be judged unfit to live any longer in it.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſs had thoſe former Charges been well proved againſt them, this laſt had been but a very rational Inference from them. For, whoſoever is an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> in point of <hi>Religion,</hi> a <hi>Rebel</hi> in point of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and a <hi>Debauchee</hi> in point of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> doth contribute a great deal towards the Ruine of that place where he reſides.</p>

So that the main Quarrel, which both <hi>Jew &amp; Pagan</hi> had againſt Chriſt and his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, did ariſe from the different Intereſts of their Religions; the <hi>Jew</hi> adhering to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> ſtanding up for his <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>Gods,</hi> and the <hi>Christian</hi> oppoſing them both.</p>

There are ſome amongſt us, who, upon frivolous Pretences, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of our Church, have departed from it; and as they have
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103673:11"/>
withdrawn <hi>themſelves,</hi> ſo have they thought it their Obligation to ſeduce and take off <hi>others,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all they could: 'tis the unhappineſs of ſuch Men, that a <hi>blind zeal,</hi> which is their <hi>own Sin,</hi> ſhould likewiſe prove their <hi>Neighbours Ruine;</hi> that they, who <hi>intend</hi> a <hi>kindneſs</hi> to other perſons, ſhould even by their miſtaken <hi>Charity deſtroy</hi> them.</p>
            <p>For 'tis very like, that many Promoters of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Faction</hi> may <hi>intend</hi> well; but we muſt not truſt to the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of our <hi>Meanings,</hi> but look to the <hi>Soundneſs</hi> of our <hi>Underſtandings.</hi> Tis not hard to believe, that when the Jew and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Crucified</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and <hi>Murdered</hi> his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> they <hi>meant well</hi> in both; nor can we doubt with any Charity, but when Zealous <hi>Papiſts</hi> and Religious <hi>Pagans</hi> burnt the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they <hi>intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Good; the Text ſaith, that it ſhould be ſo. <hi>Every one that kills you, will think that he doth God Service.</hi> If ſo, then take we heed of all groſs <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes</hi> in the matters of our Religion; let us beware, leſt we be <hi>corrupted</hi> in our <hi>Judgments,</hi> either by the <hi>Papiſt</hi> on the one hand, or the <hi>Sectary</hi> on the other; let us not ſatisfy our ſelves, that our <hi>Intentions</hi> are <hi>right;</hi> but look we that our <hi>Informations</hi> be not <hi>wrong;</hi> for, if they be, what we do, as <hi>Duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> may prove our <hi>Crime;</hi> and, upon that Suppoſition, the more of <hi>Zeal,</hi> the more of <hi>Sin.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Conſider we what it is, that we muſt expect from thoſe Men, were we in their Power, who purſue us upon the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> or at leaſt pretend to do ſo.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain that they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have as <hi>great</hi> Reaſon, upon <hi>Religious</hi> accounts, and probably far <hi>greater,</hi> upon <hi>Wordly</hi> Conſiderations, to be as Zealous for their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip,</hi> as ever the <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> were for theirs. Nor is it to be diſputed,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103673:11"/>
but we of the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> do differ from them of the <hi>Roman</hi> in ſome of the <hi>ſame</hi> Points, wherein the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> did both differ from the <hi>Pagan</hi> and the <hi>Jew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis not hard to demonſtrate, that we of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> now are, in all the <hi>Fundamental</hi> Points of our Religion, what the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their Followers ever were. Nor is it difficult to prove, that they of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion now are, in ſeveral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, what the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> were.

               </gap>, their Law in the <hi>Mouth</hi> to that in the <hi>Book:</hi> Even this, together with the vaſt <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and ſuch Ceremonies as do render the ſervice of God rather <hi>vain</hi> than <hi>venerable,</hi> doth prove them ſomewhat like the <hi>Jews:</hi> onely whereas the <hi>Jewiſh Rites,</hi> being appointed by God, did <hi>adorn</hi> his Worſhip, and were <hi>Parts</hi> of it; theſe mens follies, invented by themſelves, do <hi>corrupt</hi> and ſpoil it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:103673:12"/>
Again, their publick <hi>allowance</hi> of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> and taking Money for it, as if it were no ſin; their <hi>adoration</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> their <hi>invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> their doctrine of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> which was the Invention of <hi>Plato:</hi> All this doth teſtifie, that both in their <hi>Religion,</hi> and in their <hi>Manners,</hi> they are too like the <hi>Pagans.</hi> The truth is, the preſent Religion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a mere <hi>Miſcellany,</hi> too like that of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Alcharon, as having in it ſomething of the <hi>Pagan,</hi> ſomething of the <hi>Jew,</hi> and ſomething of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> too.</p>
            <p>And as our Adverſaries do thus <hi>reſemble</hi> both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> in ſome matters of their <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo do they <hi>match</hi> them both, in their <hi>zealous perſecution</hi> of all ſuch as do oppoſe them.

            <p>And thus have the <hi>Roman Jews</hi> dealt with <hi>us</hi> and our <hi>Progenitours;</hi> they have <hi>morally</hi> driven us from them, by impoſing upon us ſuch <hi>Conditions</hi> of <hi>

            <p>'Tis well known, what <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Interdicts</hi> they have ſent us, what <hi>Anathema's</hi> and <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> they have written againſt us in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, what ſolemn <hi>Excommunications</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103673:13"/>
againſt us yeer by yeer, they proclaim us <hi>Schiſmaticks, Hereticks,</hi> and vile <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the Faith of Chriſt, and as ſuch do they treat us; and, by ſo doing, they fully teach the <hi>Example</hi> in the Text—<hi>They will put you out of the Synagogues.</hi>—This they have done over and over; and 'tis well for us of this Age and Nation, that they can yet do no more; 'tis well, that all this <hi>Thunder</hi> of ſo many Excommunications, which hath made ſuch a mighty <hi>noiſe,</hi> doth yet want a <hi>killing Bolt.</hi> We are obliged to the good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that they have not yet found, in our days, and in our Church, what they ſtrangely long for, a fair opportunity to <hi>melt</hi> down their <hi>leaden Seals,</hi> and turn them into <hi>Bullets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Text ſaith of the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> both—<gap reason="foreign">

            <p>And have not the <hi>Roman Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> dealt thus with <hi>thouſands</hi> of our Religion, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103673:13"/>

Have they not ſeconded their <hi>Excommunications</hi> with the <hi>Sword,</hi> and their <hi>Anathema's</hi> with devouring <hi>Flames?</hi> Is it not the conſtant Doctrine of their Church, that Hereticks muſt be burnt, and who thoſe Hereticks are, they <hi>themſelves</hi> muſt be the <hi>onely Judges?</hi> If we ſhall but read over the Hiſtories of <hi>England, Ireland, France, Germany,</hi> and other places, we ſhall finde that they have made ſuch miſerable <hi>ſlaughters</hi> in the <hi>reformed</hi> Churches, that it may be juſtly doubted, whether <hi>Rome-Pagan</hi> or <hi>Rome-Papal</hi> have ſhed the <hi>greater quantity</hi> of Chriſtian - bloud. But why would they do it?</p>
            <p>3ly. The Text gives us this reaſon: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that kills you,</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Pagans</hi> had not right apprehenſions of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> was deceived in his opinion of <hi>Christ;</hi> ſo <hi>blinde</hi> was the <hi>Pagan,</hi> that he thought his <hi>falſe Gods</hi> to be <hi>true ones;</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:103673:14"/>
ſo <hi>prejudiced</hi> was the <hi>Jew,</hi> that he judged the <hi>true Meſſias</hi> to be a <hi>falſe</hi> one: which groſs Miſtake of theirs, did expoſe them to the commiſſion of that horrid Crime, wherewith the Text doth charge them—<hi>Every one that kills you</hi>—To kill a man, that <hi>affronted</hi> his ſuppoſed <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> did not think it ſin; to kill a man, that <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> the legal <hi>Worſhip</hi> of their Church, the <hi>Jews</hi> did not think it Murther; no, they judg'd it, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And ſuch Apprehenſions concerning <hi>us</hi> have they of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> in which men bred up in the ignorance of <hi>our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> yea, and much of their <hi>own</hi> too, are taught to believe, that we of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Religion are mere <hi>Apoſtates</hi> from the <hi>Faith</hi> of Chriſt, that we are ſuch <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as deny the great Doctrines of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And yet ſure we are, that they can never <hi>overthrow our</hi> Faith, nor <hi>defend</hi> their <hi>own,</hi> by more Arguments than one; I mean, that one

which <hi>hangeth</hi> by their <hi>ſides;</hi> that one which they fetch, not from the <hi>Library,</hi> but the <hi>Cutlers</hi> Shop: they can never <hi>confute</hi> us any other way, than that in the Text—<hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that kills you.</hi>—We have ſo much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Reaſon on our ſides, that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be too hard for us, till either we <hi>our ſelves</hi> ſhall <hi>loſe</hi> our <hi>brains,</hi> or <hi>they daſh</hi> them out.</p>
            <p>And that they may ſo do, O what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours do they uſe! what Plots do they lay? what Expences are they at? They can fetch <hi>Armadoes</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> falſe Witneſſes from St. <hi>Omers,</hi> and a <hi>Powder</hi>-Treaſon even from <hi>Hell</hi> it ſelf. What pains do they take to corrupt ſuch <hi>great</hi> perſons, as are either <hi>vitious</hi> or <hi>ignorant?</hi> Nay, what <hi>hazards</hi> do they run? for, as things yet ſtand, they cannot attempt <hi>our Lives,</hi> without ſome danger of their <hi>own,</hi> and yet they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but why all this? The Text gives us the beſt account: <hi>They will think that they do God ſervice,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Certainly, they who, through the juſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103673:15"/>
Judgment of God, are given up to ſuch ſtrong deluſions, as to think that <hi>Murther</hi> is rather their <hi>Merit</hi> than their <hi>Crime,</hi> muſt needs be dangerous men. Of all Villains in the world, the <hi>Religious Villain</hi> is far the worſt: for, whilſt every <hi>common</hi> Villain's Conſcience, who knows what he doth to be ſin, may juſtly <hi>check</hi> him; the <hi>Religious</hi> Villain's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, who commits a <hi>ſin,</hi> but thinks it <hi>duty,</hi> doth not onely <hi>invite</hi> him to it, but <hi>applauds</hi> and chears him in it.</p>
            <p>'Tis the great unhappineſs of the Chriſtian Church, that there ſhould be any ſuch <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken Zelots</hi> in it, who think the <hi>killing</hi> of <hi>men</hi> to be a <hi>ſerving</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But ſince the Divine Providence, for the <hi>correction</hi> of our <hi>Vices,</hi> or the <hi>tryal</hi> of our <hi>Graces,</hi> doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it ſo to be; ſince we have ſuch devout and <hi>pious Bloud-hounds</hi> amongſt us, as count it a <hi>religious</hi> act to <hi>deſtroy</hi> our <hi>Perſons,</hi> and <hi>ruine</hi> our <hi>Nation,</hi> which they know to be both the <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> of the Reformed Churches, We may do well to conſider theſe three things.</p>

No, the Religion of Chriſt hath in it ſuch Properties as forbids all this: St. <note place="margin">James 3. 17.</note>
               <hi>James</hi> tells us, What it is, 'tis <hi>firſt Pure, and then Peaceable.</hi> The Deſigns of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is to make Men as more <hi>Holy</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their <hi>God,</hi> ſo more <hi>Gentle,</hi> Kind, and Tender-hearted towards their <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> then all Man-kind beſides: 'Tis one great work of the Goſpel ſo to <hi>Mollifie</hi> and Soften the Hearts of Men, that the <hi>Vulture</hi> may become a <hi>Dove,</hi> and the <hi>VVoolf</hi> a <hi>Lamb.</hi>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we have abundant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to <hi>prepare</hi> our ſelves for the very worſt of Sufferings.</p>

As there is a vaſt Diſproportion betwixt him, that doth baſely <hi>Commit</hi> a Murder; and him that doth Gloriouſly <hi>ſuffer Martyrdom,</hi> ſo is there an equal Diſtinction betwixt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion,</hi> which bids them <hi>Kill;</hi> and <hi>Ours,</hi> which bids us <hi>dye.</hi> And this is that which we muſt ſatisfie our ſelves about in order to our Couragious and Cheerful enduring thoſe Sufferings, which Men,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103673:18"/>
               <hi>Conſcientiouſly</hi> Cruel, are preparing for us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> 'Tis our Great Concern to Live with that <hi>Innocence, Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> which well becomes the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and that <hi>Religion,</hi> which is both <hi>Ours</hi> and <hi>His.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will be a Difficult task for any of us to Dye for our <hi>Religion,</hi> except in the mean time we ſhall <hi>Live</hi> according to it; for although the <hi>Excellency</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> may <hi>Invite</hi> us to ſuffer for it, yet the <hi>Guilt</hi> of a <hi>VVicked</hi> Life will <hi>Deterr</hi> us from it. Indeed, <hi>Aquinas</hi> tells us, that <hi>Martyrdom</hi> is a thing ſo <hi>Meritorious,</hi> that it procures a Pardon for all Crimes whatſoever; and yet methinks it ſhould be hard for any Man, even upon a <hi>Religious</hi> ſcore, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to leave <hi>this</hi> world, ſo long as he knows himſelf <hi>Unfit</hi> for a <hi>Better.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Conſideration, let us <hi>Live</hi> like the <hi>Beſt</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> that we may Dye like the beſt of <hi>Saints;</hi> let us ſo order our whole Converſation, that the world may ſee,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103673:19"/>
that our Enemies Malice is Levelled not againſt our <hi>Faults,</hi> but our <hi>Duties:</hi> not againſt our <hi>Evil Manners,</hi> but our <hi>Good Religion;</hi> let our <hi>Virtuous Actions</hi> as much Condemn their <hi>Allowed Debaucheries,</hi> as the <hi>Purity</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> doth Condemn the Groſs <hi>Superſtitions</hi> of theirs.</p>
            <p>This is the way to make our Sufferings eaſie; For, would <hi>We</hi> but Frame our <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> as our <hi>Church</hi> already hath done her <hi>VVorſhip,</hi> according to thoſe <hi>Rules,</hi> which our Saviour hath left for <hi>Both;</hi> if whilſt our <hi>Adverſaries</hi> do whatever they can to <hi>Deſtroy</hi> our Lives, <hi>we</hi> would make it <hi>Our work</hi> to reform and <hi>mend</hi> them; as we do not fear the <hi>Strongeſt Arguments</hi> invented by their moſt <hi>Subtle</hi> Heads, ſo neither need we Dread the <hi>Keeneſt VVeapons</hi> managed by their <hi>Stouteſt Hands;</hi> For, ſhould it be the pleaſure of Divine Providence to give us up to the will of theſe <hi>Religious Butchers,</hi> they would do us no great Injury by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from this <hi>Bad</hi> world to a <hi>Better</hi> ſo much the ſooner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:103673:19"/>
Wherefore ſince we are deſigned for the ſlaughter, let us ſo prepare our ſelves, by an <hi>holy life,</hi> that we may die, not like <hi>Swine</hi> in the <hi>Shambles,</hi> but as <hi>Lambs</hi> before the <hi>Altar,</hi> that the pouring out of our <hi>blood,</hi> which will be <hi>murder</hi> on <hi>their</hi> ſides, who <hi>ſhed</hi> it, may prove a <hi>Martyrdom</hi> on <hi>our</hi> part, who <hi>loſe</hi> it; let us ſo frame both our <hi>hearts,</hi> and our <hi>lives,</hi> that our <hi>perſons</hi> may be <hi>offered</hi> up to God, as indeed the <hi>Choiceſt Sacrifices</hi> ſhould and muſt be, <hi>unſpotted without,</hi> and <hi>ſound within.</hi> And when once we have ſecured our ſelves of this, we may ſay of <hi>our</hi> Enemies, what <hi>Socrates</hi> did of <hi>his</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> they may <hi>turn</hi> us out of their <hi>Synagogues;</hi> they may <hi>throw</hi> us into our <hi>graves,</hi> but they cannot <hi>hurt</hi> us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let us endeavour, as to <hi>prepare</hi> for thoſe ſufferings, which our Enemies would fain bring upon us, ſo to <hi>prevent</hi> them too.</p>
            <p>The way to do ſo, is to reconcile our ſelves, firſt to <hi>our God,</hi> by <hi>quitting</hi> our <hi>vices,</hi> and then to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> by quitting our <hi>Diviſions.</hi> May we not ſay, <hi>For the Diviſions of</hi> England <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are great thoughts of heart?</hi> For, next to thoſe <hi>debaucheries,</hi> whereby we <hi>provoke</hi> that holy God, who would otherwiſe <hi>protect</hi> us; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103673:20"/>
that can do us ſo much injury as thoſe <hi>Differences</hi> in Matters of Religion, whereby we <hi>gratifie</hi> thoſe wicked men, who would, but could not otherwiſe <hi>deſtroy</hi> us. Our mutual Animoſities have a <hi>double</hi> tendency towards our Ruine, as being both our <hi>Crimes,</hi> which make us the more <hi>ſinful;</hi> and our <hi>Calamities,</hi> which make us the more <hi>impotent</hi> and weak. For,</p>
            <p>Were we one <hi>entire</hi> Body, we ſhould be a burden too <hi>big</hi> for our Enemies to throw us into the <hi>flames;</hi> and upon that ſcore, their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is to <hi>untie</hi> us firſt, that they may <hi>undo</hi> us next. To accompliſh this, they teach poor ſilly ſouls to quarrel with the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> the uſe of our excellent <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and thoſe other <hi>Rites,</hi> which, in their <hi>number,</hi> are but <hi>few,</hi> and in their <hi>nature innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſince, in order to our <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> we do <hi>agree</hi> in the <hi>ſubſtantials</hi> of our Faith: Why ſhould we, in order to our <hi>Temporal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction diſagree</hi> about its <hi>Circumſtances?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tell me, ſhall we at ſuch a time as this, ſtand and quarrel whether the Governour of our Church ſhall be called a <hi>Presbyter</hi> or a <hi>Biſhop?</hi> Whether the Communion-board ſhall be called a <hi>Table,</hi> or an <hi>Altar?</hi> Shall we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103673:20"/>
about <hi>bare Names,</hi> when, by ſo doing, we may loſe the moſt <hi>ſacred things?</hi> Shall we ſtand debating, even at the Daggers point, whether a <hi>Black Gown,</hi> or a <hi>White Surplice</hi> doth better become the Worſhip of God, when our Adverſaries are endeavouring to change the colour of both into a <hi>Scarlet Red,</hi> and that with the <hi>blood</hi> of thoſe that wear them?</p>
            <p>Methinks we ſhould never <hi>divide</hi> upon ſuch <hi>ſlender grounds,</hi> when our Enemies, for <hi>diſmal ends,</hi> do ſo cloſely <hi>unite</hi> againſt us. Do we not yet underſtand, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are the men, who, under the notion of <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> have broken our <hi>Publick Congregations</hi> into <hi>Private Conventicles?</hi> They are the men who would fain <hi>crumble</hi> us yet into <hi>ſmaller fractions,</hi> that ſo we might become the <hi>fitter morſels</hi> for their <hi>Teeth,</hi> and be devoured with the greater caſe.</p>
            <p>True it is, in all they do they <hi>pretend</hi> the ſervices of God, by reſtoring that which they falſly call the <hi>Old Religion.</hi> This is in their <hi>Tongue,</hi> but ſomething elſe is in their <hi>Eye:</hi> They well remember what <hi>rich Revenues</hi> they formerly had amongſt us, and would fain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover yet once again. To make us once more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103673:21"/>
their <hi>Prey,</hi> they ſeparate us from one another: They act like the <hi>Huntſman,</hi> who <hi>ſevers</hi> from the Flock that <hi>fat Deer</hi> which he fain would <hi>kill:</hi> And ſince we are ſo purſued, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult <hi>our ſafety,</hi> as the wounded Deer doth <hi>his;</hi> and that is by <hi>uniting</hi> our ſelves <hi>unto,</hi> and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe <hi>within</hi> the <hi>common herd;</hi> I mean, our <hi>Publick Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the great honour of this Royal City, that you have built ſo <hi>many,</hi> and ſo <hi>ſtately</hi> Temples.

            <p>But withall, to what end are theſe glorious Temples <hi>built</hi> and <hi>beautified,</hi> if our God may be worſhipped with as much <hi>ſolemnity</hi> in a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Barn,</hi> or a <hi>Cuy Coffee-houſe,</hi> as in this and other <hi>Churches;</hi> which are ſet apart from <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſes,</hi> and for the ſervice of that <hi>great</hi> God,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103673:21"/>
for whom nothing can be too ſplendid and venerable.</p>
            <p>But ſince theſe ſacred ſtructures are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>reſtored,</hi> but <hi>bettered</hi> too, let us unanimouſly meet to ſerve our God within them: Let not the <hi>ſame</hi> men, who are juſtly ſuſpected to have <hi>fired</hi> us out of our <hi>Old</hi> Churches, be ever able to <hi>tempt</hi> and <hi>flatter</hi> us from our <hi>New Ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to matters of meer <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which are a ground of our Diviſions, it will become our <hi>Modeſty</hi> to think our <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> wiſer than our <hi>ſelves:</hi> 'Tis eaſie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that they who ſtand on the <hi>higheſt ground,</hi> ſhould <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>fartheſt:</hi> 'Tis eaſie to think, that the <hi>diſcerning Eye,</hi> and the <hi>judicious Brain,</hi> ſhould rather be found in them, who are the <hi>Heads</hi> of our Church, than in other men, who are as the <hi>Hand,</hi> the <hi>Foot,</hi> or ſome of thoſe inferiour members, which God and Nature have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for other uſes.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, 'tis our great Concern to put an end to our Diviſions, remembring that we are but as <hi>Glaſs</hi> in the Caſement, expoſed to ſtorms, and brittle at beſt; but if once <hi>unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We uſe to count it a great ſecurity to this Iſland, that the kind Seas do interpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a Bulwark between us and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who might otherwiſe more eaſily annoy us.

            </p>
            <p>But, were there once a bleſſed <hi>Cloſure;</hi> were all names of <hi>Diſtinction</hi> forgot amongſt us; were the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> as ready to own the <hi>Biſhop</hi> for his <hi>Father,</hi> as we are to own the <hi>Presbyter</hi> for our <hi>Brother:</hi> Would but our <hi>Conventiclers</hi> once <hi>empty</hi> themſelves into our <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>honestly reſtore</hi> what they have <hi>unadviſedly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn;</hi> would <hi>we</hi> as firmly unite in order to our <hi>preſervation,</hi> as our <hi>Enemies</hi> do in order to our <hi>deſtruction;</hi> then might we yet hope to ſee our <hi>Crown flouriſh,</hi> our <hi>Church ſetled,</hi> our <hi>Religion eſtabliſhed,</hi> this great <hi>City proſper,</hi> our <hi>Perſons,</hi> and our <hi>Concerns,</hi> ſecured from all the Attempts of thoſe inhumane Villanies, who their Powder failing, they are ſtill contriving <hi>New</hi> Engines to lay <hi>us</hi> in our <hi>Graves,</hi> our

            </p>
            <p>Nor may we hope that they, whoſe very <hi>Religion</hi> doth make them <hi>wicked,</hi> will ever ceaſe from theſe curſed Deſigns, ſo long as they are acted by the Commands and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of that <hi>Roman Jugler,</hi> who, how vicious ſoever, being once ſeated in an honeſt man's Chair; I mean, St. <hi>Peters,</hi> doth immediately pretend to an <hi>Infallibility,</hi> as if that <hi>Triple Crown,</hi> when it firſt <hi>adorns</hi> his Head, muſt needs <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire</hi> it too.</p>
            <p>Upon which Conſiderations, give me leave to renew my requeſt, which is only this—That we would joyn our <hi>Hearts</hi> &amp; our <hi>Hands;</hi> and let thoſe Hearts be <hi>upright</hi> with God, and thoſe Hands <hi>clean</hi> in the ſight of men.
