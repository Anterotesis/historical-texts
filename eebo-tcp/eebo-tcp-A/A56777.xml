         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
ART OF LIVING
IN <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is a greater peece of skill to live in a populous place, where
multitudes of people reside then in a so<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itary and private place
among a few; yet some natures are so caried and led away
with variety of acquaintance and company, that it is a death
unto them to live by and to themselves, which indeed is the
happiest life of all and hath ever bin most contenting, and pleasing
to the best and wisest men.</p>
            <p>Now our most populous places are Cities, and among us <hi>London,</hi>
or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Citie, whether all sorts reside. Noble and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
rich and poore yong and old, from all places and Countries either
for pleasure (and let me adde beside, to save the charge of House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping
in the Countrey) or for profit, as Lawyers to the Tearmes,
Country-men and women to <hi>Smithsield</hi> and the Markets or for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,
as poore yong men and maids to seeke services and places,
serving-men Masters, and some others all manner of imploiment.</p>
            <p>Now the Citie being like a vast Sea (full of gusts) fearfull dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
shelves and rocks, ready at every storme to sinke and cast away,
the weake and unexperienced Barke (with her fresh-water souldiers)
as wanting her compasse and her skilfull Pilot; my selfe, like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Columbus</hi> or <hi>Drake,</hi> acquainted with her rough entertainment
and stormes, have drawn you this chart or map for your guide, as well
out of mine owne, as my many friends experience.</p>
            <p>Who therefore soever shall have occasion to come to the City for
the occasions before mentioned; the first thing he is to doe, is to
arme himselfe with patience, and to thinke that he is entred into a
wood, where there is as many bryers as people, every one as ready to
catch hold of your sleece, as your selfe; for we see that sheepe when
they passe through a thorny or a bushie place they leave locks or
<pb facs="tcp:64533:2"/>
wooll behinde them; so imagine a populous Citie could not live nor
subsist (like the stomacke) except it have helpe and nourishment
from the other parts and members. Therefore the first rule I give
you, next to the due service of God on the Saboth, and at other
times is the choice of your company and acquaintance, for according
to that every man findes his owne valuation high or loe; that is, we
are esteemed to be such as we keepe company withall, as well in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
as condition; if you cannot finde such fitting for you, apply
your selfe to your friends, if you have any, or the friends of your
friend; if you have not them neither, (I speake to the meaner and
more inferiour) be sure that you take your lodging at lest in some
honest house of credit; whether it be Inne, Alehouse, or other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
house, which I could rather wish because in the other, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity
of resort and company of all sorts will draw you to much
need esse and vaine expence; as in pots of Beere or Ale, Tobacco,
perhaps cards, dice, the Shovelboord-Table &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But first of all have an eye to, and a care of your maine businesse,
or the end of your coming to towne, as it were at what marke you
wou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> your arrow; which being throughly considered, for
your purse sake, pursue it with all expedition: for the Citie is like a
quick-sand the longer you stand upon it the deeper you sinke; if
here mony or meanes to get it be wanting.</p>
            <p>But imagine you have money of your owne and come hither one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for your pleasure, as being tired and weary of your Countrey, if
you husband it not thriftily, you may quickly take a nap upon peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
bench: so many are the occasions here offered that are ready
every houre to picke your purse; as perpetuall visits of vaine and
vselesse acquaintance; necssitous persons ever upon borrowing hand
with you; cloathes in the fashion, this or that new Play, play at Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries,
Taverne feasts and meetings, Horse and Coach hire; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
those britle comodities they carry; Boat-hire to <hi>Kingston, Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor,</hi>
and other places, with the like. For an Antidote to these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
poysons, let me prescribe to my Citie Country Gentleman these
receits or remedies.</p>
            <p>First, being come to the Citie, avoid idlenesse, which commonly
drawes after a traine of many vices: I call idlenesse keeping your
chamber, consuming the day lying in bed, or risen in walking up and
downe from street to street, to this or that Gentlemans chamber,
<pb facs="tcp:64533:3"/>
having no businesse at all, and cannot meet with usefull company,
let the Bible, and other bookes of piety, such as treat of Philosophy,
Naturall or Morall History, the Mathematickes, as Arithmeticke,
Geometry, Musicke; sometime Heraldry, and the like, be your
chiefe company: for you shall finde books no flatterers, nor expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
in your converse with them. Beside, you shall meet with those
who can instruct you in all those Arts which <hi>Tully</hi> calles <hi>Venales,</hi>
which are taught for money as the Mathematickes themselves, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
Fencing, Riding, Painting, and the like.</p>
            <p>Next, have a care of saving and improving your money to the
best: As who would bespeake a supper or a dinner at all adventure
at a Taverne, and not know the price of every dish, as the Italians
and other Nations doe, while they laugh at our English for their
vaine profusenesse and simplicity, who when the dinner is ended,
must stand to the curtesie of a nimble-tonged Drawer; or a many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringed
whistling Mistresse whether they or you should bee Masters
of your money. Beside one dish well drest gives a good stomacke
more and better content then a variety of twenty.</p>
            <p>And above all things beware of beastly drunkennesse, which (as
<hi>Horace</hi> truly saith, doth <hi>Affigere humo divinae particulam aurae.</hi> And
well he may <hi>Affigere humo,</hi> or naile to the ground: for some are
found sometimes so drunke, who being fallen upon the ground; or
(which is worse) in the kennell, are not able to stirre or move a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Drinking begets chalenges and quarrels and occasioneth the
death of many, as is knowne by almost daily experience. Hence are
Newgate, the Counters, and other prisons fild with our young heires
and swaggering gallants, to the sorrow of their friends, and joy of
their Iaylors.</p>
            <p>Again, men when they are in drinke, are apt to say or doe any
thing as become sureties for decayed companions, or lending them
ready money out of their purses which when they have slept upon it,
they curse and are ready to hang themselves beside the terror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and extreame melancholy which sticks by them a long time
after. Drunken men againe are apt to lose their Hats, Clokes or Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
not to know what they have spent, how much money they have;
and full oft they have their pockets pickt by Whores and Knaves.
There is lesse danger in out-doores recreations then, as shooting,
Boules, riding, Tennis, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:64533:3"/>
Next, let every man beware of play and gaming, as Cards, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Dice, at Ordinaries and other places: for in the Citie there are
many, who when they live onely by cheating, are so cunning, that
they will so strip a young Heire, or Novice, but lately come to
towne, and Wood-cocke like so pull his wings, that hee shall in a
short time never be able to flye over ten Acres of his owne Land.</p>
            <p>These and the like errours are the cause why so many faire estates
being neere or not very farre from the Citie, have beene so often
bought and sold, and the truth is, very few have held out in a name
to the third generation.</p>
            <p>Let a monyed man or Gentleman especially beware in the City,
<hi>ab istis calidis &amp; calidis solis filiabus,</hi> as <hi>Lipsius:</hi> these over-hot and
crafty daughters of the Sunne, your silken and gold-laced harlots e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where (especially in the Suburbs) to bee found: these have
been and are daily the ruine of thousands; and if they happen to alure
and entice him, which is onely to cheat him, and picke his pocket
to boot, with the bargaine she makes; but let him resolutely say as
<hi>Diogenes</hi> did to <hi>Lais</hi> of Corinth, <hi>Non tanti emam poenitentiam,</hi> I
will not buy repentance at such a rate.</p>
            <p>Let him also in the City have a speciall care whom he entertaines
into his service, let him or they have friends of his acquaintance,
who may undertake for them but not at all adventure every stragler.
What sayes old <hi>Tusser</hi> in his booke of good Husbandry?</p>
            <q>
               <l>Take Runagate <hi>Robin</hi> to pitie his need,</l>
               <l>And looke to be filcht as sure as thy Creed.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And if you bring one with you out of the Countrey (except you
have a great eye over him) he will quickly be corrupted in the Citie
with much acquaintance: then shall you helpe your selfe to bed, see
your horse starved in the stable, and never rubd; your linnen lost at
the Landresses; in a word your selfe every where neglected. Thinke
it therefore no disgrace in a Citie Inne, to see your horse every day
your selfe and to see him well meated rubd and watered he shal make
you amends in your journey. <hi>Occhio di patrono ingrassa lo Cavallo,</hi> the
Masters eye makes the horse fat: besides, remember what <hi>Salomon</hi>
saith, <hi>The righteous man regardeth the life of his beast, but the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have cruell hearts.</hi> I saw, I remember, a Carrier flea his horse alive,
<pb facs="tcp:64533:4"/>
being able on the way to goe no farther, his too heavy burthen hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
broke his back, insomuch as he tumbled raw in his own skin.</p>
            <p>Next; let a Gentleman living in the Citie have a care to keepe
himselfe out of debt, let him owe as little as he can to his Taylor for
following the fashion, then which there can be no greater misery;
for then if he walkes abroad he is ready to be snapt up at every lanes
end, by Serjeants Marshals men, or Baylies; or keeping his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
let him stirre never so little be betraid by some false knave or
other; in the meane time his creditors, if they be of the inferior sort
(nay their scolding and clamorous wives, and every sawcie prentice)
will be ready to disgrace him; and if arested, he shall be hald to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
many times like a dogge, if he returnes but the lest ill word; if
he be a landed man, let him take heed of Vsurers and their factors,
of whom he shall finde as much mercy in cities, as an Oxe cheeke
from a Butchers Curre: but I will turn my discourse now to such as
but accidentally make their abode here, either through businesse to
see friends, or sent for by Authority.</p>
            <p>Next after the setting up of their horses, and seeing them well
used (which should be your chiefest care at your first alighting in the
citie, with all diligence follow your businesse, let not vaine and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occasions
take you off from it, as going to Tavernes, seeing Playes,
and now and then to worse places, so lose your time, spend your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and sometime leave your businesse uneffected. To avoid these
take a private chamber, wherein you may passe your spare time in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
something or other and what you call for, pay for, without going
upon the score; especially in Citie-Alehouses, where in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
you shall be torne out of your skin (if it were possible) even for
a debt of two pence: and though you have spent twenty or fourty
pounds in one of their houses, your Host, especially your Hostesse,
will hardly bid you drink in a twelve-moneth; but if they bee at
dinner or supper, never to eate a bit with them: for that were an
undoing to them in their opinion.</p>
            <p>Againe, walking abroad, take heed with what company you sort
your selfe withall: if you are a Countrey man, and but newly come
to towne you will be smelt out by some cheaters or other, who will
salute, call you by your name (which perhaps one of their company
meeting you in another street, hath learned by way of mistaking you
for another man, which is an old tricke) carry you to the Taverne,
<pb facs="tcp:64533:4"/>
saying they are a kin to some one dwelling neere you, &amp;c. But all
trickes of late yeares have been so plainly discovered, and are so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
knowne almost to every childe, that their practice is out of
date and now no great feare of them; yet an <hi>Item</hi> can doe you no
hurt.</p>
            <p>You shall not doe amisse if you send for your diet to your owne
chamber an hot joynt of meat of Mutton, Veale or the like, what
you leave covered with a faire napkin, will serve you to break-fast
the next morning, or when you please. Keepe out of throngs and
publicke places, where multitudes of people are, for saving your purse;
the fingers of a number goe beyond your sense of feeling. A Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
wife of the Exchange, one day when her husband was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some businesse in the Citie, desired him he would give her leave
to goe see a Play, which shee had not done in seaven yeares. Hee
bade her take his Prentise along with her, and goe; but especially
to have a care of her purse: which shee warranted him shee would.
Sitting in a Box among some Gallants and gallant Wenches, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
when the Play was done, returned to her husband, and told
him she had lost her purse. Wife, quoth he, did I not give you war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of it? How much money was there in it? quoth shee, truly
foure peeces six shillings, and a silver Tooth-picker: quoth her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
where did you put it? Vnder my Peticote between that and
my smocke. What quoth he, did you feele no bodies hand there?
Yes, quoth shee, I felt ones hand there; but I did not thinke hee
had come for that. So much for the guard of your purse.</p>
            <p>Now for such as are of the poorest condition, and come to the
Citie, compelled by necessitie to try their fortunes, to seeke services,
or other meanes to live, let them presently provide themselves if
they can (for here is imployment for all hands that will worke) or
returne home againe before they finde or feele the extremity of
want; otherwise they shall finde it farre worse then the Countrey;
because if they want, here are more occasions to draw them into ill
courses then there, as being constrained to steale, and to shorten their
dayes, to seeke death in the errour of their lives, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith.
Young maids, who never knew ill in their lives, to bee enticed by
impudent Bawds, to turne common Whores, and the like; but if
they can provide themselves, and take honest courses, by the blessing
<pb facs="tcp:64533:5"/>
of God, they may come to as great preferment as Aldermen and
Aldermens wives: For poverty of it selfe is no vice but by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
Whom hath the Citie more advanced then poore mens
children? The Citie it selfe being the most charitablest place of the
whole, and having done more good deeds then halfe the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side.
In a word, for a conclusion, let mee give all commers, not
onely to <hi>London,</hi> but all other like populous places this one and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rule never to be forgotten, which is, To serve God, avoid Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
to keepe your money, and to beware of ill company.</p>
