            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But the main Scope of this Fable is to shew us that the cunning Imposturs of men put a Necessity upon the injured, to appeal to the Justice of an omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient GOD who sees the Thoughts of the Heart afar off, even long before they are thought; no doubt <hi>Atheists</hi> (both in Judgement &amp; Practice) are apt to deride that Appellation, as to a very long Day; and questionless that general Judgement must needs be very far off in the Eys of these faithless souls, who do not believe that ever such a Day will come; neither do they consider how nigh they are by such Provocations to a particular Judgement, of which I shall subjoine one or two Instances in Lieu of many.</p>
               <p>When the grand Master of the <hi>Knights Templars</hi> was tyed to the Stake in <hi>France</hi> to be burnt alive, with diverse of his Order, He first crav'd Pardon of God &amp; of the Brethren of his Order for the wrong He had done them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing those Crimes to be true which were charged upon the Order in general, and that thro' the Vehemency of Torment: for being shortly to appear before the righteous Judge of the World, He not only appealed to Him for their Innocency, but also cited Pope <hi>Clement</hi> V. and <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Fair,</hi> then K. of <hi>France</hi> (for it was mainly by the Authority of those two great men with their Influence on other Princes, that this horrid Massacre was carryed on, thro all <hi>Europe:</hi>) He summoned them I say to appear within a Year, before the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial <hi>Tribunal</hi> of GOD, there to answer for the great Injustice done to his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31534:8"/>
Order. And it's most certain that both these summoned <hi>Pannels</hi> dyed within the prefixed Time, which induced many to believe that the <hi>Templars</hi> were not guiltie of these execrable Crimes which were laid to their Charge. The <hi>Iews</hi> have a Proverb <hi>Cum</hi> Elias <hi>venerit solvet nodos;</hi> and Me fears this is one of the Mysterys which the Day of Judgement shall fully unriddle. There was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed some little discovery made of that Intrigue, even in the Age wherein it was acted; For some Historians report, that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> would have all the Templars destroyed, <hi>per fas aut nefas,</hi> that his German Brother might enjoy the Forfeitry of the whole Order, and no doubt he had become one of the greatest Princes of the Western World (as to Revenue) if that Design had taken effect. For the <hi>Templars</hi> had great possessions almost in every King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Europe.</hi> But tho' King <hi>Philip</hi> thought he had the Pope upon his Finger ends (for he was indeed his Creature) yet his Ghostly Father with his Council at <hi>Vienna</hi> disappointed him, by making a Gift of all the Temple Lands to the Knights Hospitallers, called otherwise, The Order of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I hope the Reader will pardon this small Digression, (if any so account it) to give my Sentiments concerning that cruel Method practised in some parts of the World, in order to the finding out of an obscure Truth, as is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the same being usually termed Torture: And that either by the formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rack, Boots, Thumbikins, Water, Oyl, or any other manner of way whereby human Nature is tormented. I joyn issue with the great St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> That it is the greatest Injustice to inflict the greatest bodily Torment i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable upon an innocent Person, for such are all in the Construction of Law, till they be proven guilty; It being an approved Maxime both of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Canon Law, and of Divinity also, <hi>praesumitur esse bonus qui non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur esse malus.</hi> And I must needs say it, they who iudge such an Extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Confession a sufficient probation, have never sufficiently considered the Frailty of human Nature. So that I think Torture should never be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in any Case, except the Confession can instantly verifie it self <hi>.e. g.</hi> Suppose there were great Presumptions against a Man, that He were guilty of <hi>Crimen Peculatus,</hi> by robbing the publick Treasury of a vast sum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, I would lay no stress on his tortured Confession, till he had brought the Judge to the place where he had laid that stollen Treasure: then the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inspection justifies the Confession. This had been the case of that bold <hi>Caudiot,</hi> who alone pilfer'd one of the richest Treasures in the World, I mean that of <hi>Venice,</hi> laid up in the Church of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> if his new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident had not made the Indication for him: Therefore such a Case should be reduced to that Maxime of Law, concerning the Examination of Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, who are <hi>suble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>There remains yet a more admirable instance of these Appeals to Heaven from unjust Sentences on Earth, which may be found in the <hi>Spanish</hi> History penn'd by <hi>Mariana.</hi> There was a Nobleman of <hi>Spain</hi> found privatly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, neither was it known who had done that villanous Act, the King was the more diligent in making Inquisition for that Blood, because the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Person had been his principal Minion. At last it was suggested that there were two <hi>Castilian</hi> Bretheren, who were picked at this Nobleman, so that it was very probable they were the Malefactors, and meerly upon this presumption, they were sentenced to be thrown down from the top of an high Rock, that by their Death they might expiate their Crime. The Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren indeed confessed, that they were sensible of a great wrong done them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31534:8"/>
by that Nobleman, but withal appealed to the Omniscient GOD, that they had no hand in his death, neither directly nor indirectly. They further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as Christians they would never have been so wicked, and as Persons of Honour (for they were Gentlemen well descended) they could not have been so base, to murther any Man of what Quality soever. But when all their Prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

No doubt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Spectators deem'd him no less than mad, to prefix so short a time to the King, who was but a Young Man, and in good Health at the time nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there at that time any fear of Intestine Commotion, or Forraign Invasions. Yet it is a most certain Truth that the King dyed of a Fever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the 30 dayes; which Providential Dispensation was judged by many, a more weighty presumption of the young Mens Innocencie, than that whereon the King had founded their Guilt.</p>

               <p>There is also another notable Story to this Purpose (which abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciphers the Vanity of such Impostures) After the shamefull Defeat of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Army under <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> and the most ignominious Death of their General for all his Wealth. <hi>Cassius</hi> (even the same who afterwards with <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> assasinated the great <hi>Caesar</hi>) aving brought off a considerable part of the Cavalry, now tho' their safty consisted in their flight; yet a foolish Astrologue had the confidence to say to him that it was mighy dangerous for them all to proceed one-foot further, till the Moon had gone out of the Sign <hi>Capricorn,</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I shall shut up this point with a wittie Reflection of <hi>Cato</hi> the elder upon all such Impostures at <hi>Rome,</hi> for he many times admired that when the <hi>Aru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spices,</hi> the <hi>Augurs</hi> and <hi>Star-Gazers</hi> (all which passed under the general name of <hi>Sooth-Sayers</hi>) did meet one another, that they did not laugh heartily for their deluding and cheating the World so long with their manifold Fopperies, Lyes and Deceits.</p>

But he should have considered that they Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Nature who spurn at the Means, when they are in a Capacity to use them, it being a true <hi>Maxime</hi> of the <hi>Casuists, That the means are ours, but the event is Gods;</hi> for I have known some good Christians that were so weary of the Fable of this World (as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> usually said) and had so little Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for this natural Life, yea were so desirous <hi>To be dissolved, and to be with Christ,</hi> that if their Consciences had not commanded them to use the Means, they would have rather chosen to have dyed more than once (if it had been possible) than to have endured the Fatigue of medicinal Applications; which minds Me of the famous Consul <hi>Marius,</hi> who being both pained and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his legs with that Distemper that <hi>Physicians</hi> term <hi>Varices,</hi> He having (to all outward Appearance) suffered most patiently the <hi>Lanceing</hi> and <hi>Cutting</hi> of one of them, when the <hi>Surgeon</hi> addressed to the other, He told Him that these Incisions and Amputations were not worth the while, and since Death was the worst of it, He would choose rather to die, than undergo so much Trouble again.</p>
               <p>Yea more than so, if all true <hi>Christians</hi> were not convinced that the Lord of Life, hath fixed Us here away as a Sentinel, at a post, who must not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move without his Captains Order, I am fully persuaded that some of them (for any Dread they have of Death, would not be shy to imitate that <hi>Roman Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator</hi> who being informed that the monster of Nature named <hi>Nero,</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to put Him to a tormenting death; He resolved to anticipat the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant's Malice, by starving Himself to death, and having intirely abstained from all Kind of Food, the space of five or six Days, one of his Friends came and told Him that he was misinformed, For the Emperour had no bad Design upon Him, therefore, subjoined he, all your Friends are resolved to come and

                  <hi>Titus Livius</hi> would allmost cause an <hi>Heraclitus</hi> to laugh at the event of Fae minine Futility, when there was no ground in Nature for it: <hi>Papyrius Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi> (famous enough in the <hi>Roman</hi> historie) when he was but a young stripling, was importuned by his too curious mother to tell her what had kept the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours sitting so long beyond their ordinary time; at last under great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie He told Her that there had been great contest among them concerning <hi>Polygamie,</hi> and that the finall Determination was referred to the morrows diet, but in his weak Judgement they who were for Plurality of wives, would carrie it by plurality of voices; she was so far from keeping this supposed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to herself, that the very next morning she assembled a great Brigade of all the <hi>Roman</hi> matrons at the senat house door, who told the admiring senatours, that they were come to protest against that unjust act, till they were heard for their interest: <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae oriuntur Leges;</hi> for whereas the senatours sons (tho' very young) were formerly permitted to be present at all their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious debates; this was inhibited for the future till they should ascend to a competent Age; having reason to judge that all Women were of the same mold with the mother of <hi>Papyrius,</hi> yet in regard he had manifested extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary discretion by his fiction he alone was priviledged to sitt tho' far with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the competent age, and therefore surnam'd <hi>Praetextatus.</hi> But <hi>A.

               <p>The a. instance is <hi>Roman</hi> too, and no less comical than the former, by the pleasant Jest put upon a futile wife, by the husband, who was a <hi>Roman</hi> Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and having stayed one day long from dinner, the wife was very curious to know what weigty matter they had been about; The Husband appeared verie shy, because (said he) it's a matter that may cost me my Life if it be known that I have revealed the mysteries of the state, and on the other hand, I know that it's as easy to grasp the Air in our fist, or to take hold of a vanishing shadow, as to fix a woman to secrecie, yet upon so many protestations he was at last persuaded to trust her for once, Then out comes the mysterie, that there had been a strange prodigy seen of late, which by the <hi>Angures</hi> was judged to be a portentous <hi>Omen</hi> to the City, and that was a <hi>Lark</hi> flying above it with an Head-Piece and a Javeline at it's side, so that the Senatours have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising long what expiation to make for the City to divert the wrath of the Gods which is apparently threatned by that wonderfull prodigy: The wife was the more apt to beleeve him, not only because she knew her husband to be a serious man and that he had told his tale with a great deal of seeming Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but also in regard that <hi>Rome,</hi> whither <hi>Pagan</hi> or <hi>Christian,</hi> hath been alwayes too superstitious; but for all her protestations for Secrecie, all her Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips heard it long before <hi>Sun</hi>-sett; for the Husband walking towards the <hi>Forum</hi> in the Cool of the day, was accoasted with many of his acquaintance, all say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we pray you Sir, what think you of that prodigious Lark, with a Cask and Javeline? He returning to his house appeared to His Wife to be in a mighty Passion, to whom He said, If I had not been a Fool, I would never have put it in your Power to undo me by your Madness in divulging that great secret committed to You, for now the Town is full of it; It's well known

that women have very ready Wits, so that Her Apology was not ridiculous, fit had not had its Rise from a Fable; Husband (said she) are there not 300 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of You, and the generality of them have Wives no less curious than I, &amp; as bad Secretars, why then should I be challenged more than the rest?

               <p>We may easily imagine how surprising this paper was to an innocent <hi>Soul</hi> who had never harboured such unnatural thoughts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yea abhorred them as he did the Devil and Hell it self; so that in a true filial rage he was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to throw that treasonable paper into the fire as most worthy of Hell fire; till he began to reflect on two things, 1. that it might be a politick Fetch of his Father to try how he would behave, for he knew Him to be of as Jealous a temper as any man living; Or supposeing it to be a reall effect of the conspiracie of the nobles against his father, yet he judged it probable that some pick thank among them, or a timerous <hi>Soul</hi> might reveale the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination to the King, with the circumstance of that dropped paper, so that the <hi>Maxime</hi> of Law might be applyed to himself, <hi>Qui tacet, consentire videtur,</hi> Therefore he finaly determined to acquaint the King with that unhappy emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie, and withall to make infinite protestatons of his own ignorance of the matter, and His fitter Abhorrence of so vile a Designe: The father was well pleased with the prudent Conduct of his Son, and throughly convinced of his innocencie, Yet that fatal paper had raised such suspicions of the Nobles in his head, and such sinistrous suppositions concerning His own Son, that it was possible he might yet be prevailed upon to comply with that treasonable designe (since a great Crown is a great temptation) or that it would satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the conspiratours that his Son were only passive in the matter, and in fine this unhappy Father, no less jealous than the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour <hi>Tiberius</hi> (and too like him in his dissimulation) began to entertain that same suspicion of his Son, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had done of <hi>Germani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
