            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE THE

            <head type="sub">The humble PETITION of the Maſter, Wardens, and Commonalty of the
Miſtery or Trade of the Silk Throſters of LONDON.</head>
            <opener>Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT great quantities of Cloath and other manufactures made of the woolls of this Kingdome,
and other Merchandizes have bin hence exported to <hi>Perſia, Turky, Italy, Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicilia:</hi> From
which for returnes, hath bin yearely Imported about 2000 Bales of Raw Silke, the Throing, Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Weaving, and working whereof, hath given Imployment hitherto, to about two hundred
thouſand poore people, workers of Silke manufactures, in and about this Citie: which Raw Silk,
cometh to the hands of the Petitioners (being about 70 Perſons) to be Throen; in which imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
dependeth the livelyhood of about thirty thouſand doublers, turners, thred makers, win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
ſpinners and others, all which are very poore people, and not able to live one week without working.</p>
            <p>But ſo it is, that by reaſon of the great diſtractions in this Kingdome, firſt fomented by the Prelats, Popiſh Lords,
evill Councellors, and others diſaffected to the true Religion, in ſtirring up difference between this and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by thoſe other deſperate and wicked plots attempted ſince the begining of this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
againſt the peace and welfare of the Parliament, City and Kingdome, and all Reformation in Church and
Common-wealth, and by that unheard of, and unparralleld high breach of the Priviledges of Parliament, and by
the horrible, cruell, and bloody Rebellion ſo much advanced in <hi>Ireland,</hi> againſt our Nation and Religion: all
which occaſions of our diſtractions have bin (as the Petitioners humbly conceive) principally intended for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of Popery, ſupport of the Prelacy, and other humane inventions in the Church, and (as a furtherance
thereunto) for the inlet of Arbitrary and tyrannical government in the Common-wealth: And by all which your
good reſolutions and determinations for Reformation of this Church and Common-wealth, for defence of this
Kingdome, for ſending of ſufficient aydes to <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the reliefe and reformation of that gaſping people, and
for the contrailment of thoſe bloody Rebells, are obſtructed; and thereby Trade is ſo exceedingly decayed, that
not only the Petitioners are diſinabled to buy raw ſilke, or to have it any longer delivered to them to be Throen,
as formerly, but alſo for want of ſuch ſupply, the aforeſayd numerous multitudes are already, and in a very few
daies in a greater meaſure like to be, the ſubjects of great penury, and extreame want, whoſe lamentable complaints
and deſperate reſolutions, the Petitioners heare with much griefe, and whoſe dangerous thoughts and opinions of
thoſe who ſhall be found cauſers of theſe their extremities, will, the Petitioners feare, ere long be, too aparently
expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore your Petitioners; as beſt known unto, ſo likely firſt to ſuffer by, this numerous neceſſitated people,

thus truly ſet forth as a fit ſubject for the wiſe conſideration of this honourable Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>And doe humbly pray, that the Prelacy may be totally Aboliſhed, and as theirs, ſo the Voteing of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh

any longer to abſtruct your moſt worthy and pious endeavours in reforming the Church, and compoſing
ſo great and waighty affaires of theſe Kingdomes: which the Petitioners humbly conceive, will be the only
meanes to give life and ſubſiſtence to Trade, and to prevent <hi>Englands</hi> ruine to ariſe from its own Inhabitants.</p>
