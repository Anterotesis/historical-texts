            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>The Inuectiue of Doctor</hi> Andreas de Laguna, <hi>a Spaniard and Phyſition to Pope</hi> Iulios <hi>the third, againſt the painting of women, in his Annotations vpon</hi> Dioſcorides, li. 5. cap. 62.</head>
               <p>THe Ceruſe or white Lead, wherewith women vſe to paint themſelues was, without doubt, brought in vſe by the diuell, the capitall enemie of nature, therwith to tranſforme humane creatures, of faire, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them vgly, enormious and abominable. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is not to be beleeued, that any ſimple women
<pb facs="tcp:19158:8"/>
without a great inducement and inſtigation of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, would euer leaue their natural and gracefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances, to ſeeke others that are ſuppoſitions and counterfeits, and ſhould goe vp and downe whited and ſiſed ouer with paintings laied one vpon another, in ſuch ſort: that a man might eaſily cut off a curd or cheeſe-cake from either of their cheekes. Amongſt which vnhappie creatures, there are many, who haue ſo betard their faces with theſe mixtures and ſlubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauces, that they haue made their faces of a thouſand colours: that is to ſay: ſome as yellow as the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gold, others a darke greene, others blunket colour, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as of a deepe red died in the wooll. O deſperate madneſſe; O helliſh inuention, O diueliſh cuſtome: can there be any greater dotage or ſottiſhneſſe in the world, then for a woman in contempt of nature, (who like a kinde mother giueth to euery creature whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer is neceſſarie to it in its kind) to couer her naturall face, and that pure complexion which ſhee hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, with ſtench of plaiſters &amp; cataplaſmes. What ſhal God ſay to ſuch in the laſt Iudgement, when they ſhal appeare thus masked before him with theſe antifaces: Friends, I know you not, neither do I hold you for my creatures: for theſe are not the faces that I formed. Thus the vſe of this ceruſe, beſides the rotting of the teeth, and the vnſauourie breath which it cauſeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miniſtred in paintings, doth turne faire creatures into infernall Furies. Wherefore let all gentlewomen &amp; honorable matrons, that make price of their honeſty and beauty, leaue theſe baſe arts to the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets, of whom thy are fitteſt to be vſed, that by that fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines they may be known and noted. Yet do I not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together miſlike, that honeſt women ſhould waſh themſelues, and ſeeke to make their faces ſmooth, but that they ſhould vſe the barly water, or the water of Lupines, or the iuyce of Lymons, and infinite other things, which <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> preſcribes as cleanely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
<pb facs="tcp:19158:8"/>
to cleare the face, and not goe continually with ranke ſmelles of ointments and plaiſters about them. Howbeit that you may not thinke that this vnhappie trade and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of painting is altogether new and of late brought into the world, I will recount vnto you a ſtory, which <hi>Gallen</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth in that little booke of his, which he intituleth, <hi>An exhortation to good arts. Phryne</hi> a famous harlot of <hi>Athens</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent at a great feaſt or banquet, where euery one of the gueſts might by turnes command what he pleaſed to the reſt there inuited, ſhe ſeeing many women there that were painted with ceruſe, inioyned that they ſhould execute her command very ſeuerely, which was, that they ſhould bring a boule full of warme water, and that they ſhould all waſh their faces therein, which was done without gaine-ſaying, for that was the Law of the feaſt. Whereupon the faces of all the women there preſent appeared foulely deformed and ſtained ouer, the painting running downe their cheekes to their vtter ſhame and confuſion, and the horror of all that ſtood by, to whom they ſeemed and appeared as horrible monſters, onely <hi>Phryne</hi> appeared much more beautifull and faire then before: for albeit her life were not free from blame, yet was her beautie and comely grace, pure, naturall and without artifice, but God be thanked, ſaith he, our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Spaine are ſo faire of themſelues, that they haue no neede of any thing to cleere their complexions, but onely a little Orpin, and Soliman, or Mercury ſublimate.</p>
               <p>Now that you may know that hee flouteth his country-women, heare what he ſaith of this Soliman in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the 69. chapter. The excellencie of this Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſublimate (ſaith he) is ſuch, that the women, who often paint themſelues with it, though they be very young, they preſently turne old with withered and wrinkeled faces like an Ape, and before age come vpon them, they tremble (poore wretches) as if they were ſicke of the ſtaggers, ree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and ſull of quick-ſiluer, for ſo are they: for the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and quicke-ſiluer differ onely in this, that the Soliman is the more coroſiue and byting; inſomuch that being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the face, it is true, that it eateth out the ſpots and
<pb facs="tcp:19158:9"/>
ſtaines of the face, but ſo, that with all, it drieth vp, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth the fleſh that is vnderneath, ſo that of force the poore skin ſhrinketh, as they ſpeake of the famous pantofle of an ancient ſquire called <hi>Petro Capata,</hi> which being often beſmeared ouer to make it blacke, and to giue it luſter, it ſhrunke and wrinkled, and became too ſhort for his foote. This harme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and inconuenience (although it be great, yet it might well be diſſembled, if others greater then this did not accompany it; ſuch as are, a ſtinking breath, the blackneſſe &amp; corruption of the teeth which this Soliman ingendreth. For if quick ſiluer alone, applied onely to the ſoles of the feete, once or twiſe, and that in a ſmal quantitie, doth marre and deſtroy the teeth; what can be expected from the Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which is without compariſon more powerfull and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuatiue, and is applied more often, and in greater quantity to the very lips and cheekes? So that the infamous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencies which reſult from this Mercurie Sublimate, might be ſomewhat the more tollerable, if they did ſticke and ſtay onely in them who vſe it, and did not deſcend to their of spring. For this infamy is like to originall ſinne, and goes from generation to generation, when as the child borne of them, before it be able to goe, doth ſhed his teeth one after another, as being corrupted and rotten, not through his fault, but by reaſon of the vitiouſneſſe and taint of the mother that painted her ſelfe, who, if ſhee loath and abhorre to heare this, let her forbeare to do the other.</p>

And ſo exploded, whatſoeuer he ſaid, reprehending his diſpoſition by the deceit, he vſed with his haire.

Doubtleſſe falſhood is in his or her heart, whoſe face or haire is falſified to deceit. Falſhood vttered in the face, or haire, is firſt conceiued and coined in the heart.

            <p>ALL painting or colouring of the face is not of one kind, nor by one meane. The more artificiall and ſumptuous is by tincture, the skinne being died and ſtained with artificiall colours. This the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier ſort performe by the helpe of pearle. Were it not much better to beſtow this coſt on the poore, which are creatures and images of God, then on ſuch idle images and workes of their owne creation? O what thankfulneſſe doe they ſhew vnto him, that miſpend his gifts on things, he skornes to looke on! <hi>Vt quid die ligitis vanitatem, &amp; quaeritis mendatium?</hi> Why loue they vanitie, and ſeeke after lies? for a painted face is a vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and very lie.</p>
            <p>It is a point of pride to deſire by falſe deuiſes, to be reputed of others more excellent, then one is indeed. They therefore that paint or <hi>die</hi> their faces (as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) are not able to cleare themſelues of pride, and the practiſe of it, which is a thing moſt odious to God and man.</p>
            <p>Pride may ſhew it ſelfe in rich apparell, but it doth ſingularly appeare in a painted face; becauſe they that paint, would haue that, which is artificiall and borrowed, taken to be naturall and proper.</p>
            <p>A painted face is a <hi>ſuperfluous face:</hi> it were well, if the world were well rid of all ſuch ſuperfluous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. I cannot thinke that God, who is the Lord of our time, doth allow vs to ſpend one houre of all our

            <p>This art is often vſed vpon Sunday, which is the Lords day: and ſo by this meanes that holy day is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned, and God diſhonoured.</p>
            <p>They that practiſe theſe arts, doe often heare them reprooued by the Miniſters of Chriſt, who haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie <note place="margin">

Now what is this but groſſe irreuerence, and diſobedience, when women, and wanton wagges reſiſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne their iudgement and monitions; or elſe, to make themſelues wiſer then their maſters, and to bee wiſe in their owne eies, as if forſooth they knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what were good, and what were euill, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and what miſ-became Chriſtian men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then the Church or the moſt holy and learned Paſtors and Teachers, Prieſts and Biſhops, that haue been, and are therein?

            <p>They that paint or die their haire and faces, their necke and breaſts, doe either iudge they do well, and ſinne not; or elſe they know they doe euill, and yet do it, being tranſported by the corruption of their willes and affections; or otherwiſe they doe well, and ſinne not; or otherwiſe they doe it out of ignorance, not knowing that they doe euill. For the firſt, if they think and deeme it good, and not euill to vſe theſe arts, as the faſhion is, they receiue an errour, or falſe ground into their mindes. And how ſhall they repent of that, which they thinke is lawfull? How will they beg par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>don of that, wherin they glorie, and which they think is good and not euil? And if they ſhal iudge that good, which indeed is euill, how ſhall they not alſo ſpeake good of euill? And how are they ſafe then (ſpecially
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19158:25"/>
if they ſhall deſpiſe inſtruction) ſeeing the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth, <hi>Woe vnto thoſe, that ſpeake good of euill, and euill of good, which put darkneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe?</hi> Now without all queſtion the grounds of this colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring are pride, or wantonneſſe, or deceit, or ſomething that is ſinfull. And that, that is of the fleſh, is fleſh.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, if they know they doe ill to paint, and yet vſe it, the greater is their ſinne; if they know they doe well not to paint, why then doe they not forbeare? <hi>To him that knoweth to doe good, and doth it not, to him it is ſinne,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iames.</hi>

            <p>For the third, if they vſe theſe arts, as not knowing that they doe euill, they are not yet wholly excuſed. For euen this ignorance is a ſinne, and deſerueth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment in it ſelfe. But what if it be wilfull and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ignorance? Haue they not heard? Haue they no meanes of knowing it to be a ſinne? So they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the wiſeſt and holieſt of either ſex contemne and condemne ſuch vanities? Or are they not able to find out the reaſons, why they doe vſe them? See they not that pride, vaine-glorie, adulterous affections, and ſuch like, are the very motiues, that make them vſe them? Affected ignorance of that, which a man ought to know, is a two fold euill; one, that it is ignorance; the other, that it is affected. And the ſimple and vnaffected ignorance of ſuch things bee not ſo grieuous, yet in one reſpect it is more dangerous then when one ſins of knowledge. For he that ſinnes of ignorance, is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19158:25"/>
of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repentance, then he that ſins of knowledge. For he that knowes his dutie, may more eaſily repent and leaue it, then either he that doth euill, and knowes not that he doth euill, or then he alſo that thinkes hee doth good, when he doth an euill, and ſo is ſo far from repenting of it, that he rather glories in it.</p>
            <p>They that vſe theſe arts, doe iudge it better, ſafer, and more laudable, either not to paint and die them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, or to paint and die themſelues. If they hold the former, why cleaue they to the practiſe of ſuch arts? Why chuſe they not the better? If they maintaine the latter, why are they loth to depart out of the world in that kind of brauery? Why doe they not condemne thoſe, that altogether abſtaine from ſuch arts? Or what be their reaſons of their opinion? For my part, I thinke none to be ſo groſſe, as to thinke it better, or ſo good.</p>
            <p>There are ſome, whoſe leaders ſeeme greatly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ancient Fathers and Doctors of the Church, and the Conflitutions called Apoſtolicall: but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as may appeare by their writings, quoted in this Treatiſe, are altogether ſet againſt theſe arts and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and amongſt thoſe Canons, this rule is giuen, <hi>Noli depingere os tuum, quod fecit Deus,</hi> that is, <hi>Doe not paint thy face, which God hath made.</hi> Why then ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">

But it is to be noted, that though among women, and men too, of ſundrie opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in matters of religion, there are many differences and much diſcord, yet in the practiſe of pride and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, there is great conſent and concord. The diuell is a moſt politicke and peſtilent enemie of man: Hee cares not much, tho the manners of a man be good, if his faith be nought; nor though his faith bee good, if his manners he wicked. And he knowes, that as pride

It was thus; Their maner was at their feaſts to make certaine ſports or ieaſts, and that whatſoeuer any of them began to doe, the reſt muſt all of them follow. Now <hi>Phryne</hi> waſht her face in a baſin of water: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe her natural beauty was good, and her yeres freſh and flouriſhing, ſhe lookt nothing the worſer, but the better rather for it: whereas the reſt doing the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were al painted, they were al diſgraced. But (they ſay) ſome are now adaies both more cunning &amp; more coſtly, then that their art ſhould be waſht away with a little water. This is to trifle away and deuoure time, not to redeeme it. This is not to buy time, but to ſell it for nought. This art is worſe then ignorance: this curioſity is more to be blamed; then careleſnes. And of them that vſe it, it may be ſaid, <hi>They loue the praiſe of men more, then the promiſe of God,</hi> who delights in plainneſſe, not in deceitfulnes; in verity, not in hypocriſie. The eie of purity and iuſtice cannot abide falſhood and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting, as not counterfet money, counterfet men, counterfet friends, counterfet wares, counterfet zeale, counterfet deuotion, ſo not counterfet greatnes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfet wealth, counterfet beautie. I would faine know what a man would haue counterfet, or what counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet and baſe thing, hee would haue put vpon him, as true, naturall and proper. A friend, a wife, a child, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an horſe or dog, fire, water, meat, mony? What, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nothing? Why the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beauty? would any be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with art in ſtead of nature? No why then ſhold any deceiue another, if he wold not be deceiued by another Or why ſhold any ſtudy to get the praiſe of another by that, for the which, if hee did eſpie it, he would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow his praiſe vpon another? And how ill is a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19158:26"/>
to himſelfe, when hee takes paines, and is at coſt to bring an ill name vpon himſelfe? For were he not vaine and deceitful within, he would not expreſſe and ſhew it without. And he that is falſe and deceitful in trifles, how can he bee truſted in matters of greater importance? But it is not enough for theſe dyars and painters to do euil, but they will alſo defend it, and to this purpoſe they bring the Pſalmiſt vpon the ſtage, as if he taught or allowed theſe arts. But wheras the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaith, that God gaue men oyle to make the face ſhine, without doubt he meant it not by tincture or <hi>dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (for we may not make the holy Ghoſt to war with himſelfe) but ſome other way. For oyle is wholeſome to eate, it cheereth the hart, &amp; a chearefull hart cauſeth a cheareful countenance. Beſides, oile is vſed for lights or lampes, which illuminate the eies, and ſo ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it. And again, if the face be rubbed or annointed with it, it helpeth the natural color, becauſe it heateth and cheereth the bloud. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> ſaith, that oyle is <hi>phai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropoiòn,</hi> making the face of thoſe that are annointed with it, <hi>diathgête, càilampràn,</hi> bright &amp; ſhining. <hi>With the</hi>

            <p>Now becauſe this ſinne goeth not alone, but as it ſelfe is vſed to a prouocation and incitement to luſt, ſo luſt that it may accompliſh its deſire, will not ſticke to ſtoope to practiſe loue-potions by charmes and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie, yea rather then faile, wil make its way by bloud; let me therefore touch a little vpon theſe neighbour ſinnes. As vnto the bodies of men diſeaſes are very dangerous, eſpecially if they be let run, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in time, euen ſo are ſinnes vnto their ſoules.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19158:31"/>
ſo by diſobedience and wicked ſinning againſt God, his wrath was kindled, good things are hindred, and his iudgements, which are fearefull and intollerable, are moſt iuſtly procured. <hi>Vpon the wicked</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid) hee ſhall raine ſuaires, fire and brimſtone, and an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>

machiuelions and attempts of their wicked ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries?

And yet for all this, the wicked will not amend. but moſt horrible and tranſcendent villanies, moſt grieuous and foule enormities breake out among vs, to the diſhonour of God, the diſgrace of Religion, the ſhame of their Countrie, the griefe of their King, and of all good Chriſtian hearts, in ſo much, that if there were not amongſt vs thoſe, that mourned for theſe euils, which vngodly men reioyce to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and but that (thankes bee to God for it) there is an exact and iuſt proceeding againſt ali ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious perſons, wee might well haue feared ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and fearefull iudgement had been neere vnto vs. Now all ſinnes deſerue ill with God, but ſome there are, that for their heinouſneſſe are ſaid to crie in the eares of the Lord, ſuch as is the ſinne of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as appeares by the ſpeech of God to <hi>Caine,</hi> after he had murdered his brother <hi>Abel. What haſt thou done,</hi> ſaith God? <hi>The voyce of thy brothers blood crieth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee from the ground:</hi> Geneſis 4. 10.

And if we marke the dealings of God with murders, it wil appeare that very ſeldom, or neuer, they ſcape vnpuniſhed, but by one meanes or other, he finds them out, and meets with them, though it be by ſuffering them to murder themſelues. The firſt murderer in the world, <hi>Caine</hi> was not indeed kild by God: but hee was ſuffered to liue ſuch a life, in ſuch torments of conſcience and frightings, as if he had had an hell within him, wandring vp and downe like a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond vpon the earth, that whoſoeuer ſaw him, and was acquainted with the curſe of God, that went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, could not but bee terrified from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting murder. <hi>Abimelech</hi> out of ambition murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red 70. of his brethren, but after had his braine-pan crackt by a woman, and was kild out-right by one of <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iudges</hi> 9.</note> his owne men at his owne command. <hi>Cambyſes,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhot a noble mans ſonne to the heart with an arrow wittingly, and made his owne brother to bee murdered priuily, and ſlue his ſiſter for reprouing him for that deede: but at laſt as hee was riding, hee fell downe vpon the point of his ſword, which had fallen out of the ſcabbard, and ſo was ſlaine. <hi>Caſſius</hi> and <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that had helpt to murder <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> in the Senate, was afterwards murdered by themſelues. <hi>Phocas,</hi> that had like a barbarous traytor murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Mauricius</hi> the Emperour his Maſter, was at laſt taken and put to a moſt cruell death. <hi>Hemichild</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Lord <hi>Albenius</hi> a King of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> as hee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19158:32"/>
was in bed. <hi>Roſimund</hi> his Queene hauing her hand in the ſaid murder: but the Lord was euen with them both. For ſhee thinking to haue poiſoned him after, made him drinke halfe her poyſon, which he feeling in his vaines preſently ſtaied his draught, and made her drinke vp the remainder, and ſo they died both together. <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of the Eaſt-Angles vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly and deceitfully murdered at the perſwaſion of <hi>Offa</hi> (the King of <hi>Mercia)</hi> his Queene; which Queene liued not a quarter of a yeere after, and in her death was ſo tormented, that ſhe bither tong (which ſhe had abuſed to the cauſing of that murther) in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with her teeth. <hi>Selimus,</hi> a Turkiſh Emperour mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered his father <hi>Baiazet</hi> by poyſon: but not many yeeres after, God tooke him into his hands, and ſmote him with a moſt lothſome and ſtinking diſeaſe, which ſpread ouer all his body, and at length kild him. <hi>Calip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> that ſlue <hi>Dian,</hi> his familiar friend, and committed many other murders, afterwards liued an exile, and great neceſſities, and at length was kild himſelfe. And <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sa.</hi> 10. 10,</note> for <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe, whoſe hand had been defiled with blood, the Lord (notwithſtanding his great repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) did ſeuerely chaſten him. The Lord had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him ſaying, <hi>The ſword ſhall neuer depart from thine houſe: Behold, I wil raiſe vp euil againſt thee out of thine own houſe;</hi> and ſo indeed it came to paſſe. For one of his ſons killd another, and by his owne child hee had liked to haue loſt his kingdome. And as the Almightie God is iuſt in puniſhing of murders: ſo likewiſe his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence watcheth to diſcouer them, that murderers ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer lie hid, but firſt or laſt they are diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is ſtrange to conſider, how murders haue been detected, ſometimes by dogges, as that of <hi>Lothbroke</hi> the Dane, of <hi>Heſiode</hi> the Poet, and a certaine ſouldier of King <hi>Pyrrus,</hi> from whoſe dead body his dog could not be wonne, but fawning vpon the King, as deſirous
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:19158:33"/>
of his aide, the King commanded all his ſouldiers to come along by him by two and two in a ranke, till at length the murderers came, on whom the dog flew, as if hee would haue killed them, and turning to the King ran againe vpon them, whereupon they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined, and forth with they confeſt the fact, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their puniſhment. Somtimes they haue bin diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by birds, as <hi>Beſſus</hi> (who had murdered his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) by Swallowes; whom when he heard to chatter, his guiltie conſcience wrought him to think that they ſaid in their gibberiſh, that <hi>Beſſus</hi> had kild his father: So that now no longer able to containe himſelfe, hee confeſt his villany, and was put to death for it. The murder of the Poet <hi>Ibycus</hi> was diſcouered by Cranes: and <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeakes of the murder of a certaine Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, which was detected by Crowes: who alſo with <hi>Melancton</hi> ſaw a notable diſcouerie of a murder made by a young fellow at <hi>Iſenacum,</hi> who hauing kild his hoſt, and took from him all his money, began to make haſt away: but by the iudgement of God, and terrors of his owne conſcience, hee was ſo frighted and ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that he was not able to ſtirre one foot before hee was taken. A certaine Merchant trauelling to Paris, was in the way murdered by his man: now as the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was a doing, a blind man being led by his dogge paſſed by, and hearing one grone, asked who it was? To whom the murtherer anſwered, <hi>It was a ſickeman go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eaſe himſelfe.</hi> But it ſo fell out after, that this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous fellow was in queſtion for the murder of his maſter: but he denied it: the blindman alſo was heard of, and brought to the murtherer, and twentie men were cauſed to ſpeake one after another, and ſtill the blind man was askt, if he knew their voyces: at laſt when the murtherer had ſpoken, he knew his voice, &amp; ſaid, <hi>This is the man, which anſwered me on the mountaine.</hi> This courſe was often vſed, and ſtill the blind man
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19158:33"/>
named the ſame, and neuer fained. Whereupon the Court condemned him to death, and before he died, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſt the fact. But what need we go ſo far for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, euen this very yere in Lancaſhire was there a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous murder ſtrangely diſcouered by a young boy: which ſtory, I hope, wil by ſome that exactly know it, hereafter be declared and publiſhed. In like maner alſo the murder of Sir <hi>Tho. Ouerburie</hi> in the Tower, though it lay hid ſome time, yet at length by the prouidence of heauen it is diſcouered. Diuers that haue been found guiltie of that cruell and moſt mercileſſe murder, haue bin condemned to death for the ſame and hangd; who though they would faine haue ſhifted of the fault, and pleaded, <hi>Not guiltie,</hi> as though they had bin innocent, yet it pleaſed God ſtill before their deaths to touch their hearts, that they did ingeniouſly confeſſe their fault, and did beg of God the pardon of it. This ſinne of murder is ſo grieuous, that it cries aloud and ſhrill, and will not leaue the Lord, till he haue diſcloſed it: many and admirable are the waies, wherby God hath diſcouered it: ſome I haue already ſet downe, and many other might be named, but that I meane not to be large. All which ſhould teach vs to deteſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline this ſinne, which ſhuts mens prayers out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and puls downe the iudgements of God vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And the greateſt mercy, that God vſes to ſhew to Murderers, which repent, is this, That he ſaues them as it were by death, and preſerues their ſoules from hell by deliuering vp their bodies into the hands of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, his Miniſters, to take away their liues from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by law, as they haue taken away the liues of others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt law. But among all the deuiſes of murderers, which are many, theſe Italian deuiſes by poiſoning are moſt vile and diueliſh, and they ſay, <hi>An Engliſhman Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianated is a diuell incarnated.</hi> If theſe arts ſhould come in once amongſt vs, who ſhal be ſecure? Here can a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſee who hurts him, &amp; how ſhal a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preuent the blow, if he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:19158:34"/>
ſee not the arme that ſtrikes him? Yea here a man ſhal be made away vnder the pretext of friendſhip, yea, hee ſhall perhaps thank a man for that, that is made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, which hath death lapt vp in it, which thinks is ſent or giuen him as a tokan of loue vnto him. God deliuer vs from theſe euils, and ſtrengthen the hearts and hands of our Magiſtrates, to cut off all ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders without reſpect of perſons. But beſides this ſinne of blood, there are diuers others, which are acceſſaries thereunto; the very ſtaine of religion, and the bane of humane ſociety, as pride, ambition, witchcraft, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the mother and nurſe of all diſobedience to the Miniſterie of the Word.

They were throwne out of heauen, and were neuer ſo fortunate as to find the way thither againe. They are the ſpoile of vertues, the ſource of vices, the roots of euils, the diſgraces of religion, by remedies they beget diſeaſes and by medecines maladies. The bountie of the ambitious is ſhewne to rich men, and their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is for vanitie.

Incantation, in the doing whereof, euery witch is at a league with the diuell, open or ſecret, and doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly and willingly vſe his helpe. This Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (Gal. 5.) numbers vp among the deeds of the fleſh, and threatneth them, that vſe it, with the loſſe of heauen. Almightie God (in Deut. 18. 10.) forbids all kinds of witches and witcheries, as abominations vnto him, and for the which he driue out the Nations out of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, and in Leuit. 20. he bids, that a man or woman, that hath a familiar ſpirit, or that is a wizzard, bee put to death.

I will euen ſet my face againſt that ſoule, and will cut him off from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt my people. But behold ſome of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God vpon Magicians and Witches. <hi>Platina</hi> with others teſtifie that Pope <hi>Ione</hi> obtained the papacy by Magique: but after ſhe had been papeſſe ſome two yeeres, and a little more, ſhe (being thought an he) fell in trauell of a child in the open ſtreetes, as ſhee was going to the Church of Lateran, in which ſhee died? <hi>Bladud,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Lud</hi> King of Brittaine, was giuen much to theſe blacke arts, and wrought wonders by them: at laſt he made himſelfe wings, and aſſaied to flie, but the diuell forſooke him in his iourney, ſo that falling downe he broke his necke. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeakes of a notable witch, called <hi>Cleomedes,</hi> who being purſued by diuers that had had their children kild by him, hid himſelfe in a coffer, which when they came to ſearch vpon notice giuen them, they found not the murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring witch in it: for the diuell had carried him quicke away with him. A witch cald <hi>Cold</hi> in Lorraine would ſuffer piſtols to bee ſhot at him, and catch the bullets, as they were a comming: but at length one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants being angry with him, ſo ſhot him with a piſtoll,

Simon Pembroke,</hi> a figure-caſter of Saint <hi>Georges</hi> pariſh neere London, was preſented for a Coniurer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Saint Sauiours Church, where he was warned to appeare, he was ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſtrucken by the hand of God, and there died, and there being ſearcht, there were found about him diuers coniuring bookes, with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a man of tinne, and much other traſh. And it is reported, that the inuenter of Magicke, <hi>Zeoraſtres,</hi> a King of Bactria, was burned to death by the diuel. And I pray you what got <hi>Saul</hi> by his witch-ſeeking?

Cor. 5. 5. that they were deliuered ouer vnto death, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleſh, that their ſpirit might bee ſaued in the day of the Lord Ieſus.

And the truth is, that all the plagues and iudgements, that euer came vpon the children of Iſrael, light vpon them for their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, and their diſobedience to his word. And queſtionleſſe it is come to paſſe by the iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God that theſe offenders, we haue ſpoken of, and haue lately ſeene cut of, were giuen ouer of God, and left vnto themſelues, becauſe they liſtened not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but were diſobedient vnto his word. O this diſobedience, it is as the ſinne of Witchcraft, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, it is in truth the mother and nurſe of all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. God hath two ſorts of iudgements; iudgements for men to keepe, and iudgements for men to beare: and God hath two ſorts of Miniſters; Miniſters of his Word, and Miniſters of his Sword: now it is iuſt with God that they, which will not keepe his iudgements; ſhould vndergo his iudgements, and that they that wil not be reformed by his word, ſhould be puniſhed and cut off with the ſword, and that ſuch as regard not the power and doctrine of Miniſters, ſhould feele to their ſmart, the authoritie and force of Magiſtrates.</p>

She loues <hi>grace</hi> ſo well, that ſhe will rather <hi>die,</hi> then lacke it. There is no truth with her to fauour, no bleſſing to beautie, no conſcience to contentment. A good face is her god: and her cheeke <hi>well died,</hi> is the <hi>idoll,</hi> ſhe doth ſo much adore. Too much loue of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hath wrought her to loue painting: and her loue of painting hath transformed her into a <hi>picture.</hi> Now her

She loues a true looking-glaſſe, but to commend age, wants and wrinkles, becauſe otherwiſe ſhe cannot ſee to lay her falſhood right. Her body is (I weene) of Gods making: and yet it is a queſtion; for many parts thereof ſhe made her ſelfe. View her well, and you'ill ſay her beautie's ſuch, as if ſhee had <hi>bought</hi> it with her pennie. And to pleaſe her in euery of her toies, would make her maide runne beſides her wits, if ſhe had any. Shee's euer amending, as a begger's a peecing, yet is ſhe for all that no good penitent. For ſhe loues not weeping. Teares and mourning would marre her making: and ſhe ſpends more time in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, pranking and painting, then in praying. Shee's more in her oyntments a great deale, then in her ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons. Her religion is not to liue wel, but <hi>die</hi> well.

ſhe cares not though all her neighbours round about her were counted <hi>Kitchinſtuffe</hi> A good huſwife takes not more pleaſure in dreſſing her garden with variety of hearbes and flowers, then in tricking her ſelfe with toyes and gauds.

her. Her <hi>imagination</hi> is euer ſtirring, and keepes her mind in continuall motion, as fire doth the pot a playing, or as the <hi>weights</hi> doe the <hi>iacke</hi> in her kitchin. Her deuiſes follow her <hi>fanſie,</hi> as the motion of the <hi>Seaes</hi> doe the <hi>Moone.</hi> And nothing pleaſes her long, but that, which pleaſes her fanſies, with one of which ſhee driues out another, as boies doe pellets in <hi>Elderne</hi> gunnes. She thinkes 'tis falſe to ſay, that any woman liuing can be damned for theſe deuiſes: and it may be true ſhe thinkes. For ſo long as ſhe liues, ſhe cannot: but if ſhe die in them, there's the queſtion. Shee's euer buſie, yet neuer leſſe buſie, then when ſhe's beſt buſie. Shee's alwaies idle, yet neuer leſſe idle, then when ſhe is moſt idle. Once a yeere at leaſt ſhe would faine ſee <hi>London,</hi> tho when ſhe comes there, ſhe hath nothing to doe, but to learne a new faſhion, and to buy her a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigge, powder, ointments, a feather, or to ſee a play. One of her beſt vertues is, that ſhe reſpects none, that paint: and the <hi>reward</hi> of her painting, is <hi>to be reſpected of none, that paint not.</hi> If ſhe be a <hi>Maiden,</hi> ſhee would faine be rid of that charge? If a <hi>Widdow,</hi> ſhee's but a <hi>counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet relique;</hi> 'twere too groſſe ſuperſtition but to kiſſe or touch her. Old-age ſtill ſteales vpon her vnawares: which ſhe diſcernes not by increaſe of wiſedome, but of weakeneſſe, nor by her long-liuing, but by her <hi>need of dying.</hi> To conclude, whoſoeuer ſhe be, ſhee's but a <hi>Guilded Pill,</hi> compoſde of theſe two ingredients, <hi>defects</hi> of nature, and an <hi>artificiall ſeeming</hi> of <hi>ſupplie,</hi> tempered and made vp by <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>vanitie,</hi> and may wel be reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned among theſe creatures, that God neuer made. Her picture is now drawne out, and done.</p>
