            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Irſt for <hi>Apollogie</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> of the thinge I doe not ſee but I may well (without flattering or ouermuch affecting my owne doinges auouch it to be the beſt &amp; rareſt deuiſe for an Aſtrolabe that euer came forth in any age, &amp; to moſt vſe &amp; pleaſure, and do wiſh any man that thinketh hee can contradict it to doe it in writing that I may eyther yeild or aunſwere. For, to backbyte or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract by wordes any man that hath openly publiſhed himſelfe by writing is neyther honeſt nor credible, rather it bewrayeth himſelfe to bee eyther partiall, malicious, ignorante, or vaineglorious. But to the matter I ſay for an Aſtrolabe not comparing it (though the deuiſe be more new &amp; rare) with the <hi>Catholicon</hi> or <hi>Iewell,</hi> which contayneth in it the ſeuerall vſes, not onely of all Aſtrolabes but alſo of the Sphere and Globes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and of all other Inſtruments both <hi>Aſtronomicall</hi> and <hi>Geometricall,</hi> being fitted accordingly as hereafter if God permit I will yet more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt. Therefore very vnaptly by <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> named <hi>Aſtrolabum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon</hi> had he not added thereunto in his title. <hi>In quo quicquid vſpiam rerum mathematicarum tradi poſſit continetur &amp;c.</hi> And for that cauſe I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing amplyfied the deuiſe both in faſhion &amp; vſe, named it the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Iewell</hi> But to fetſorth an Aſtrolabe: and no more but an Aſtrolabe: then I ſay, that this and no other is <hi>Aſtrolabium Catholicon</hi> or <hi>Generale.</hi> Which muſt needes be confeſſed, if with <hi>Meſſahala</hi> we do but define the word <hi>Astrolabe</hi> who (as <hi>Io. Stophlerus</hi> reporteth) ſayth, that <hi>Aſtrolabium eſt nomen grecum cuius Interpretatio eſt acceptio ſtellaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> In latin it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led (as <hi>Stophler</hi> ſaith) <hi>Aſtrolat ſus: quaſi aſtrorum caſus vel lapſus, vel quia metitur lapſus vel tranſitus aſtrorumet ſignoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the diffinition of the name: that the very Intendement of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of the Aſtrolabe, was but to comprehende the lapſes, courſes, riſings, and ſettings of the ſignes, ſtarrs, and planets, vnto the ſundry Horizons in ſeuerall countries and latitudes: and no further. All which this my <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Aſtrolabe</hi> ſo effectually, ſo plauſibly, ſo pleaſingly, ſo eaſily, and ſo ſuffitiently performeth. That (the round globe it ſelfe excepted) neyther he <hi>Iewell,</hi> neither any other deuiſe of Aſtrolabe either generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,

of which many haue been, and with great ioy and applauſure hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore receiued, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth any way neere it. Therefore I can not ſee howe or with what face any man can iuſtly detract from it. Let me here examine the matter publicquely, and to make ſhort &amp; come ſpeedily to the point omitting ſuch horoſcopes as <hi>Apian</hi> &amp; others publiſhed with their cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhipps, rings &amp; many other learned <hi>Ludicra</hi> &amp; deuiſes in dyalls fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the riſing and ſetting of the ſignes &amp; ſtarrs, and leauing out ſuch Aſtrolabes as old <hi>Sconer</hi> and diuers other did ſet foorth which weare ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer much accompted of, and ſtraight iumpe in with that high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended and ſo euer wel accepted Aſtrolabe, euen the very foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al that haue been ſince which <hi>Io. Stophlerus</hi> laſt eſtabliſhed in his booke <hi>de Fabrica et vſu Aſtrolabij.</hi> euen that <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> without which on the backſide, <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> woulde not allowe his <hi>Catholicon</hi> currant: although in my Iewell I ſupply it on the face, and that more generall. Well then, if you throughly conſider of, or looke into that ſo excellent deuiſe: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a particular Horizon as <hi>Io. Stophlerus</hi> framed him: or generall to all Horizons as <hi>G. Friſius</hi> appointed him: or more general to al Horizons &amp; both Poles, as my ſelfe in my Iewell deuiſed him: yet by all thoſe deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in regard that of a 1000. ſtarts &amp; vpwards wel known &amp; recorded by Images in the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s conceiued, there could be no vſe of aboue 40. or 50. of them. &amp; that vſe halfe purblind for wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Images. And that in this <hi>Vranicall Aſtrolabe</hi> there is equal vſe of the whole trope &amp; of euery Image &amp; conſtellatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his full proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as plaine as the day to be feene: a few towards the South pole which with vs are neuer ſeen excepted: and that many more Aſtrolabicall propoſitiones are to be performed thereon, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to al Horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, then before could be done by that of <hi>Stophlers</hi> to one Horizon. Therefore I can not but moſt confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly defend, confirme, and preferr the deuiſe thereof before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all in his kinde.

with the precepts, which I vſed here and thought hereafter more to vſe for breuity of wryting, wil make the more prolixitie of vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding for yong practiſers.

            <p>THen for <hi>Addition</hi> to the parts of this Aſtrolabe, let the <hi>Mater</hi> or <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall</hi> thereof remaine as at the firſt, onely I thinke good in ſteede of the letters I.F.M.A &amp;c, for more readines to write the words <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarie, Februarie, March</hi> &amp;c. vnto the ſame places of the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> circle whereas the Sonne entereth the 12. Monethes of the yeare.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> alſo remaine as before ſauing that, I would not haue the hower-circle thereon diſcribed, neyther any numbers wtitten in capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall letters, becauſe they are comberſom, but in ſteede of them ſmaller fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ſet vpright the ſtanding way as in this figure of the Almcantifer you ſee done from 50. to 70. and thoſe are needefull, but in the Noone lyne for the double numbring from the centre out-wards, but in the North line there neede not any ſuch.</p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Curſor</hi> now carrie one quadrant of 90 deg. feruing chieflye for the Azimuthes, and therefore called the Azimuthall quadrant, numbred double <hi>vz.</hi> vpwards and downewards, and another of 6. howers double numbred alſo: but vpwards, al one way, called the hower quadrant: all which by his figure marked with <hi>A B C D.</hi> you may here ſee whoſe line <hi>A D</hi> is his fiducyall line which muſt alwayes run verye ſquare croſſe the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> as in the 1.

            <p>Let there be now planted to the fiducyall line of the <hi>Almicantifer E P G</hi> ſo many as the length will allow of thoſe radiall degrees which ſhould be on the Nooneline of the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> out-wards from the croſſe <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> or <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctials</hi> interſection therewith, to help to le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cauſe ſo requireth, for which purpoſe his <hi>Oſtenſor</hi> or pointer hath now two cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre loope holes at <hi>M</hi> &amp; <hi>N</hi> to hitch likewiſe a thred and pearle vnto when neede ſo requireth.

            <p>But to come vnto the reſidue of the booke wherein our newe deuiſed tackling is applyed to ſo excellent vſes generall to all <hi>Horizons:</hi> which as it ſeemeth hath more want of Explanation. The firſt thing you haue now to do when any queſtion is propoſed, is to ſet the <hi>Index</hi> of the hower cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle vnto the place of the ☉, for the day or time of your queſtion by helpe of the 5 <hi>cap.</hi> the &amp; noneline, that is to ſay bring the nooneline of the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitfer</hi> vnto the degree of thecliptick aunſwering your daye propoſed, and then apply the <hi>Index</hi> of the hower-circle euen therewith, ſo is the hower circle planted for that day, and in like ſort you ſhall from day to daye by helpe of the nooneline remoue the <hi>Index</hi> further &amp; further for euery day a degree rebating the odd minuts in the 5 <hi>cap.</hi> mentioned. So ſhall the nooneline now ſhew you ſtill theron the hower in euery queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnaſked as they ſay: without labelling to the ſon, as in moſt chapters of the booke was vſed, although he that deſireth variety may now vſe both: For the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micantifer</hi> labelled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tre of the <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> vnto the Sonnes place in thecliptick as in the booke is vſed, either it ſelfe or one of his three croſſe finnes ſhall ſhew yow the hower in the hower quadrant of the <hi>Curſor,</hi> ſo you take thoſe hower numbers which fit vnto the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fin writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thereon: that is to ſay, if the <hi>Matutine</hi> or <hi>Pomeridian</hi> fin come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the numbers from 1 to 6 muſt ſerue: if the <hi>Antemeridian</hi> or <hi>

            <p>The ſecond thing moſt materiall to be done is as in the 10 &amp; 17 <hi>cap.</hi> I indeuoured to ſhew to chuſe out on the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> the pointes &amp; lines ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to your latitude, <hi>Horizon,</hi> or place of your abode, &amp; to prepare him with his furniture to the <hi>Horizon</hi> of that place: Which hauing nowe foure <hi>Curſors</hi> you ſhall doe &amp; vnderſtand I hope with eaſe.

For example, to prepare the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> to the latitude &amp; <hi>Horizon</hi> of <hi>Reading,</hi> where the latit. or poles eleuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is by the 10 <hi>cap.</hi> to be found about 51 2/3 <hi>deg.</hi> you ſhall in ſteed of 51 2/3 take 52 <hi>deg.</hi> and accompt that for our latit. neglecting the od 20 min. which for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe wil hurt little.

And ſo at the laſt (your three lidgers thus placed at <hi>E R</hi> &amp; <hi>X</hi> &amp; the Curſor to <hi>B A</hi> &amp; the pointer diſtant from <hi>A</hi> according to the quantitie <hi>A R</hi> &amp; the perle

from <hi>X</hi> according to <hi>X A</hi>) your <hi>Zenitfer</hi> is prepared to the <hi>Horizon</hi> of this 52 latitude, which being done (once for all as they ſay) performeth al the Chapters of the booke without any altering or remouing, ſome 2 or 3 Chapters excepted, for which the <hi>Curſor</hi> onely is to be remoued but none of the reſt, and therefore in regarde thereof the labour is ſhort though it ſeeme long.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Zenitfer</hi> thus prepared to the <hi>Horizon</hi> of the 52 latitude &amp; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wercircles <hi>Index</hi> ſet to the ☉ as before, for the day and time propoſed, you may then preſently euen with one bare inſpection ſee almoſt halfe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions of the booke performed without any labour at all more then to apply the nooneline vnto that planet carrect or ſtarre which you meane to worke vpon.</p>
            <p>Example: the 5 day of Marche 1598. proceeding as in the 5. <hi>cap.</hi> is taught, you ſhall finde the ☉ his place in thecliptick 25 degr. 3 min. in ♓ thereto dyrect the <hi>Index</hi> of the hower-circle by helpe of the Noone-lyne. Where let him reſt fixed for all that day, ſo haue we no more troble with that part. And now will we here worke vppon the great ſtarre of the firſt magnitude which you ſee in the face of <hi>Taurus</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly called <hi>Paliliciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Aldebaram</hi> or <hi>Oculus tauri</hi> to knowe his ſtate in the heauens. His longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is eaſily deſcryed as in the 2 <hi>cap.</hi> is ſhewed by the circles deſcribed on the Celeſtiall, to be about 4 <hi>deg.</hi> &amp; an halfe, and his latitude in like ſort to bee almoſt 5 degrees Southwards from thecliptick, for all the Starres which haue North latitudes, euen the one halfe of the globe are in this <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> comprehended within the <hi>Zodiacke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then do but apply the Noone line of the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> as before prepared, vnto the middle pricke or centre of this ſtarre <hi>Oculus tauri,</hi> it ſhall there ſhew you in the <hi>Maters</hi> limbe 62. <hi>deg.</hi> and better his right aſcention and in theclipticke circle foure degrees and better in ♊ his <hi>deg.</hi> of culmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacon as in the 8 <hi>cap.</hi> and in the hower circle almoſt halfe an hower paſt 4 of the clock after-noone the time when as hee ſhall that day culminate or come vnto the meridian in the South part, as in the 16 <hi>cap.</hi> And thus much the bare line ſheweth you. Now do but marke what point or radiall degree of the nooneline cutteth vppon the middle pricke of the Starre, &amp; that point ſhall play as good a part, for if you reckon that point or degree according to the numbers ſet on the noone line, you ſhall find it 16 <hi>deg.</hi> and better, and ſo much is the declination of <hi>Oculus Tauri</hi> as in the 8 <hi>cap.</hi> and that Northwards from <hi>thequinoctiall</hi> circle becauſe hee is within it. Then reckon by the radiall de. on the nooneline counting them from the vertical lidger (ſet co the latitude as before) til you com to that 16 degree ouer the cnetre of the ſtar, you ſhall finde them amount to 36, &amp; ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:24993:5"/>
wil his diſtance from our <hi>Zenith</hi> be, when he commeth to the meridian, which 36 deg. taken out of 90 leaueth 54 degrees his Meridian altitude as in the 16 <hi>cap.</hi> And if you turne about the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> till the North line of <hi>Media nox</hi> come on this ſtarr, ſo ſhall the nooneline alſo (whoſe office alone is now to ſhew the howers) ſhew you halſe hower paſt 4 in the mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning and better, the iuſt time when as <hi>Oculus Tauri</hi> ſhall come vnto the Meridian in the North vnder the earth. And now if you liſt to remoue the hower circles, <hi>Index</hi> from daye to day the noone line (reſting ſtill on the ſtarre) may ſhew you what hower that <hi>Oculus</hi> ♉ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Meridian euery day of the yeare.</p>
            <p>And as all thoſe Meridian concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, (as I may terme them) are ſoone had by bare inſpectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without mouing. So you may as redily attaine al the Horizontall concluſions with a verie eaſie kinde of motion: but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with leading about the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> by the <hi>Almicantifer,</hi> as one ſhoulde leade a horſe by the halter rounde about an horſe mill, and all the ſkill is but to knowe which way to leade him, for if your queſtion propoſed bee, to bee performed on theſt halfe of the Horizon, which I call the Eaſt hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere (for the Meridian or nooneline alwaies deuideth euery Horizon in two equall parts) then muſt your <hi>Almicantifer</hi> play on the Eaſt or left ſide of the nooneline where <hi>Oriens</hi> is written, and leade him about leftwards till the pointer touch vpon the planet or ſtar propoſed, but if on the Weſt hemiſphere then right-wards: as for example, to know what hower the ☉ ſhal riſe the ſaid 5 of March 1598 play your <hi>Almicantifer</hi> in the Eaſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere and thereby leade about the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> left-wards till the pointer may be brough to touch the ſaid 25 deg, 3 mi. of ♓ there ſhal the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line ſhew you in the hower circle almoſt a quarter after 6 of the clock, the time of ſon riſing that day, and the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> labelled to the Eaſt line of the <hi>Zenitfer,</hi> vz, to <hi>L M</hi> ſheweth as in the 17 Chap. in the Celeſtialls limbe 355 1/2 deg. his oblique aſcention for that daye. Then if you liſt to leade him on leftwards till the pointer come to touch the middle prick of <hi>Oculus Tauri,</hi> there you ſhall ſee the nooneline to ſhew in the howercir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle a little paſt 9 in the forenoone the time of his riſing that daye, and the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> labelled or applyed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>L</hi> on <hi>M,</hi> ſhall ſhew in the <hi>Maters</hi> limbe 41 deg. his oblique aſcention for that day as in the 18 <hi>cap.</hi> And if now you would know what time they will ſet, then play the <hi>Almicanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> on the Weſt hemiſpheare, and by him leade about the prepared <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitfer</hi> right-wards till the pointer do touch eyther of them, and you ſhall ſo finde the nooneline to ſhew for the the ſon almoſt 6 of clock, and for <hi>Oculus Tauri</hi> the times of their ſetting, almoſt 12 at midnight. And the Veſpertine fin of the <hi>Almicantifer G I</hi> applyed to <hi>L M</hi> ſo ſhall the fidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

               </gap> deg. and for the ſtarre 86 deg. their oblique deſcentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for that day. Then if you reckon the howers betwene the Son riſing and ſetting the ſame is the length of the day, and thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of 24 leaueth the length of the night alſo, the howers betweene the riſing &amp; ſetting of <hi>Oculus Tauri</hi> are called his diurnall arch, thoſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of 24 leaueth his <hi>Nocturnall</hi> arch. Likewiſe the right aſcention of <hi>Oculus</hi> ♉ being as before 62 deg. and nowe his oblique aſcention found 41 degree take the bigger out of the leſſe there reſteth 21 deg. his diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of aſcention in this 52 latitude from that of the right <hi>Horizon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third difficultie and materiall matter is as it ſeemeth for any lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvde aſſigned to prepare the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> to any Altitude taken, taught in the 13 Cap. thereby to knowe what hower of the day or night it is and ſuch like queſtions.

And admit then you had taken the altitude of the Son 25 deg. the 2 of <hi>October</hi> 1596. in the Morning (the <hi>Index</hi> of the hower circle being ſet as now is taught to the ſame degree of the Son in Thecliptick at <hi>K</hi> vz. euen with the prickt line <hi>L K.</hi> Firſt you ſhall here ſeeke on the 52 <hi>Zenith</hi> line <hi>B E,</hi> for the 25 <hi>Almicantare</hi> roote which according to their nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers ſet in the left mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> you ſhall finde at the point <hi>A</hi> of the line <hi>B F,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you ſhall now apply the fiducyall line of the Curſor which ſhal then cut the 26 radiall deg. of the nooneline marked with <hi>C</hi> (but of that 26 radiall deg. there is no vſe) and there let the Curſor be ſet faſt, then exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> euen by the nooneline and ſlyde downe the poynter till it do touch the 25 North degree that is to ſay, at the 25 radiall degree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coned from the <hi>Horizontall</hi> lydger at <hi>R</hi> towardes the centre <hi>L</hi> (and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond if neede ſo requier as here it doth not) which will here fall out at the 37 rad. deg. according to the numb. ſet on the North line at the letter <hi>Q.</hi> but thoſe numbers as I ſayde are not much to bee regarded after your lydgers are ſet. And your Curſor thus planted at <hi>D C</hi> and the poynter diſtaunt from <hi>C</hi> according to the quantitye <hi>C Q</hi> ſo is your <hi>Zenitfer</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for that 25 altitude in this 52 latitude. Nowe therefore becauſe the Altitude taken was in the morning, play your <hi>Almicantifer</hi> on the Eaſt hemiſpheare, and by him lead aboute the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> left-wardes till the poynter come vppon the Sunnes place in thecliptick at <hi>K,</hi> ſo ſhall the nooneline <hi>L C A</hi> there preſentlye ſhewe you in the hower-circle 10 of the clocke the hower ſought for without any labelling to the ☉. But yf you will labell the hower becauſe the Booke ſheweth ſo: then bringe downe the fiducyall line of the Curſor to the centre <hi>L</hi> the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> ſtill
<pb facs="tcp:24993:6"/>
remayning where he was, and <figure/> there the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> label<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Sun at <hi>K</hi> ſhall ſhew you in the hower quadrant of the Curſor 10 of the clocke <hi>Antemeridian</hi> euen as the Noone-lyne doth on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer-circle.</p>
            <p>To performe the 15 Chap. applye the Noone-lyne to the <g ref="char:Moon">☽</g> and from thence reckon in the hower-circle ſet, ſo many howers eyther rightwardes or left-wardes according as you finde the hower giuen by his ſhade, diſtante from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> and at the end of that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning is your deſire.</p>
            <p>Now to the example of the 23 <hi>cap.</hi> yf you plant the none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line on the great Starre <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Tauri,</hi> the howercircles <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex</hi> planted at 26 <hi>deg.</hi> 3 min. of ♓ ſeeke thereon, 10 of the clocke at night the hower gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and thence reckon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the howers vnto the noone lyne, you ſhall finde then 5 2/3 howers thoſe ſhall be the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers diſtaunce of <hi>Oculus Tauri</hi> from the South there ſought, and that Weſtwards becauſe the reckonning goeth Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards from 10 of the clocke.</p>
            <p>Next to the 24 <hi>cap.</hi> the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wercircles <hi>Index</hi> planted (for ſtill that muſt firſt be done) at 20 de. 10 min. ♎. In ſteed of labelling to thee ☉ you ſhall applye the nooneline to 10 of
<pb facs="tcp:24993:7"/>
clocke in the morning, in the hower-circle, and there holding ſtill the <hi>Zenitfer,</hi> prepare it as before is taught to ſome altitude at auenture, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to 20 degrees: then playing about the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> if the poynter ſo ſet will come to touch the Sun his place or ſtarre propoſed, then bee ſure that altitude prepared is your deſire, but if the poynter ouer reach as at that proffer it will. Then holding ſtill the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> at the hower giuen, prepare it to a greater altitude, admit to 25 deg. at auenture, and then playing about the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> you ſhall find the poynter to cut theclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke in the 20 deg. 10 min. of ♎ at <hi>K</hi> being the Sonnes true place for that inſtant. Therefore you may conclude that the 10 of <hi>October</hi> 1596 at 10 of clocke in the morning the Son was 25 deg. high in our 52 latit. yf 25 had not hit you muſt haue aſſaied againe if neede had been.</p>
            <p>The laſt difficultie is for the generall waye to get the 12 houſes in the 27 cap. mentioned, and all the ſkill reſteth but in triple, preparing of the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> for that purpoſe, of which the firſt is but the preparing to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> as before is taught: And then the noneline layd to the hower pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the howercircle ſet vnto the Sons place in the 25 deg. 3 min. of ♓ in the example of the 27 cap. mentioned vz. vnto 10 of clock, ſheweth in theclipticke 22 deg. 30 min. the 10 houſe, and the North line 22 deg. 30 min. of ♌, the 4 houſe, and there (the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> holden ſtill) the <hi>Almican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifer</hi> played in the Eaſt Hemiſphere, the poynter ſhall cut in theclipticke 28 deg. 30 min. of ♊ the aſcendent or firſt houſe, and playde on the Weſt Hemiſphere 28. 30 of ♐ the 7 houſe. So have you the 4 chiefe <hi>Cardines</hi> of the 12 houſes. And the other 8 are as eaſily had by two other like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, for the which there are planted on the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> 60 ſlope lynes called <hi>Domifiyng</hi> lines, beginning from his centre line <hi>L M,</hi> and thence numbered downewards to 60. And alſo 60 radiall degrees called Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying degrees, planted in his left margent betweene <hi>M</hi> &amp; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> beginning at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
               </hi> with 30 &amp; thenſe numbered inwards with ſtanding figures ending at <hi>M</hi> with 90. And vnto theſe 60 Domifying degrees, there are lymit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 60 Domifying roots in the noone line, which are but the double ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall degrees thereof, numbered from the centre outwards, that is to ſaye euery 2 radial deg. accompted but for one Domifying roote and euery 10 but 5 &amp;c. and ſtanding numbers ſet vnto them accordingly, of which becauſe the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> yeildeth not ſufficient, therefore I haue now ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt from 45 forwards, in the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> as farre as it will ſtretch as before is ſhewed. And as one of the 90 <hi>Zenith</hi> lines ſerueth all the vſes in one latit. as before is ſhewed. So one of theſe 60 Domifying lynes ſerueth the turne to get the other 8 houſes at all times in one latit. which is eaſily choſen out by the ſayd numbers aſcribed vz. <hi>P O</hi> for the 52 latit.
<pb facs="tcp:24993:7"/>
Theſe thinges knowne, then to performe the ſecond preparation which ſhal get you the 2.8.6. &amp; 12. houſes is thus done: Remoue the <hi>Horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Lidger</hi> vnto <hi>O</hi> the outer end of the 50 Domifying line, which ſhal cut the North line at <hi>T,</hi> &amp; among the Domifying degrees 42 1/6 at <hi>W:</hi> there, at <hi>T.O.W.</hi> let the lidger reſt &amp; pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Curſor at the like number of the ſaid Domifying roots in the noneline, vz. at the 42 1/6 Domifying roote which will fall out as the 5 2/3 rad. deg. from the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> at <hi>Z</hi> there faſten the Curſor &amp; applying the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> euen by the noone line ſlip downe the pointer to the point <hi>T,</hi> &amp; there faſten him. And thus (the <hi>Horizontall</hi> lidger plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>TOW</hi> &amp; the Curſor to <hi>Z</hi> and the pointer diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Z</hi> to the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity <hi>Z T)</hi> is your <hi>Zenitfer</hi> prepared for getting thoſe other 4 houſes. The <hi>Zenitfer</hi> all this while ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſtill at 10 of clock: but now is twiſe to bee remoued, firſt two howers leftwards vz, to 12 of clocke where the <hi>Indez</hi> ſtandeth. And there the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> played about, his pointer ſhall cut theclipticke in the Eaſt Hemiſphere at 16 30 of ♉ for the 12 houſe &amp; in the Weſt Hemiſphere, at 16 30 of ♏♐ for the 6 houſe. Then remoue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the nooneline two howers rightwards from 10 of clocke vz, vnto 8 of clock, &amp; there the <hi>Almica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifer</hi> plaid about the pointer ſhal cut in the Eaſt Hemiſp. the 20 deg of ♋ for the 2 houſe &amp; in the Weſt Hemiſphere the 20 of ♑ for the 8 houſe. So <figure/> haue you 8 of your 12 houſes to be ſet in your figure or ſcheme drawn as the maner is here preſent for you to ſee, which had. Nowe you muſt againe thirdly prepare the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> to the inner end of the 52 domifiing line thus: by remouing the <hi>Horizo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> lydger vnto <hi>P</hi>: which ſhall there cut in the leſt margent the 57 2/3 Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifying degree at <hi>Y,</hi> and therefore you ſhall plant the Curſor vnto the 57 2/3 Domifying roote in the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line which will fall out at the 52 2/3 rad. deg. beyond the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> and thence ſlide downe the pointer to the lidger at <hi>P,</hi> and ſo is the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> prepared to get the other 4 houſes yet wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting by help of two other remoues, vz. you ſhall now firſt plant his nooneline at 4 howers leftwards of 10 of clocke, vz. at 2 of clocke &amp; there playing the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> about, it ſhall ſhew in the Eaſt Hemiſp. 22 deg. of ♓ for the 11 houſe, and in the weſt Hemiſp. 22 of ♍ for the 5 houſe. That done remoue the nooneline 4 howers rightwardes from 10 of clock vz.
<pb facs="tcp:24993:8"/>
to 6 of clock and there playing the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> about, the poynter ſhall cut in the Eaſt Hemiſp. 5. 30 of ♌ for the 3 houſe &amp; in the weſt Hemiſp. 5.30 of ♒ for the 9 houſe: Now place thoſe 4 houſes alſo as in this fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure you ſee and you haue done. Note that becauſe in the 27 cap. theſe 4 remooues of the nooneline are done by applying the pointer prepared vnto the <hi>Horozontall</hi> pointe pitched in the Celeſtiall, and this way there but barely touched. I thought good to ſhew it now at large leauing eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to do it which way he beſt affecteth. Note alſo that when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifying roots are gone out of the <hi>Zenitfer,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet the Curſor to the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> in the nooneline and there extende the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> outwardes euen with the nooneline where faſtening him with ſome deuiſe you may then hitch a thread and perle to the pointer, and vſe the pointer in ſtede of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor and the thred &amp; perle in ſteede of the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> and poynter.</p>
            <p>LAST of all for <hi>Addition</hi> in the vſe, take one deuiſe more with you for the <hi>Azmuth</hi> then before I wrate of: which with no ſmall ſtuddie I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, meaning to haue reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it with diuers other propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that I haue in ſtore for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond edition. But becauſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhall not ſay that my ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> wanteth any needefull part that other <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labes</hi> had. I will heere though I coulde performe it 2 or 3 wayes for breuity only deliuer the beſt. As to the example before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, where according to the altit. of the ☉ taken 25 degree high by the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> prepared to that 25 altit. and the pointer applyed on the Sun his place at <hi>K,</hi> his nooneline ſhewed in the howercircle 10 of clock. There holde faſt the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> till you haue done, if you deſire alſo to know what <hi>Azimuth</hi> the ☉ was then in. And play about the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micantifer</hi> (it is no matter on which ſide of the nonneline) till
<pb facs="tcp:24993:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it will mete at <hi>G.</hi> iuſtly with the pearle (prepared as before) of the thread faſtned in the loope of the <hi>Azimuthall</hi> lydger at <hi>X</hi> their hold alſo faſt the thred <hi>X G.</hi> The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apply the fiducyall line of the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> euen with the fiducyal line of the <hi>Curſor</hi> ſquare croſſing the <hi>Zenitfer</hi>: And ſo ſlyde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſquare down together til the <hi>Almica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifer</hi> cut the perle at <hi>G.</hi> which wil be at <hi>H.</hi> in the nooneline, &amp; there at <hi>H.</hi> faſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Curſor</hi> &amp; ſlice the poynter to <hi>G.</hi> &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnhitch the thred fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>X</hi> &amp; hitch it to the vertical lidger at <hi>E,</hi> &amp; from <hi>E</hi> extend the thread on the Suns place at <hi>K,</hi> laſtly playe about the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> till the poynter ſetled at <hi>G</hi> as before do touch the Verticall thread <hi>E K,</hi> which will be at <hi>I. H I.</hi> being equall to <hi>H G.</hi> So doth <hi>H I.</hi> the fiducyall line of the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> cut amonge the <hi>Antemeridian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of the Curſors <hi>Azimuthall</hi> quadrant, 57 deg. the <hi>Azimuth</hi> ſought for. That is to ſay, the degrees cut are to be taken by the outer numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being it was in the morning becauſe the <hi>Azimuthes</hi> are numbered from the Eaſt and Weſt pointes of the Horizon either-way vnto the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> there ending at 90, which is to be regarded by the letter <hi>P</hi> on the <hi>Almicantifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And out of this propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (becauſe we will leaue no hard chap. of the booke vnexplaned) you may eaſily learne how to performe the 20 chap. another way. For by another <hi>Synonomy</hi> of ſpeech to know the amplitude of riſing and ſetting of the Sun, or ſtars, is but to know vpon what <hi>Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth</hi> or point of the compaſſe they riſe. Wherefore being that the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon circle of any place is the begining of the firſt circle of altititude that is to ſay, of the 0 <hi>Almica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tare.</hi> Therfore to get this amplitude, you muſt firſt prepare your <hi>Zenitfer</hi> to that 0 altitude, that is to ſave, to the Horizon as before is taught by ſetting the Curſor to <hi>A D.</hi> and the pointer to <hi>R.</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>A.</hi> And being ſo prepared, if it be for ſonne riſing let the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> playe in the Eaſt Hemiſphere, and his pointer there touching the Suns place, hold faſt the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> till you have all done, whoſe noone lyne ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth in the hower-circle his hower of riſing. Then for the <hi>Azimuth</hi> work in all reſpects as is done laſt before, and you ſhall find the meeting of the pearle and pointer at <hi>G.</hi> will fall out in the centre line <hi>L. M.</hi> extended. Wherefore if a thread were hitched in the centre <hi>L.</hi> and his pearle exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beyond <hi>M.</hi> to that croſſing at <hi>G.</hi> the Curſor neede not here bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued at all from <hi>A. D.</hi> when the one threade is extended out of the Verticall point <hi>E</hi> on the ☉ &amp; this thred out of <hi>L</hi> till perle out that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal thred as before he did at <hi>I</hi> this centre thred ſhall ſhew in the limbe of the Celeſtiall the amplitude deſired,
<pb facs="tcp:24993:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deſired, If you reckon thence to 6 of clock that is to ſay; vnto that degree which the 6 of clock, howerline of the howercircle wold ſhew in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall limbe, if it were extended.</p>
            <p>Note that if any man ſhall affect to haue the howercircle on the <hi>Zenii<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> according to the firſt direction: and not on a plate or flat by it ſelfe as now I appoint him. Yet let him quite out away the <hi>Pomeridian</hi> howers which are without the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> numbered from noone vnto <hi>media nox,</hi> to to the end that nothing may hinder the ſight of the whole Hemiſphere at all times and that the Curſor maye alwayes haue free paſſage to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. And then to vſe in ſteede of the centre thread a rule or labell, like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Almicantifer</hi> before deſcribed, with the Veſpertine ſin onely. For ſo ſhall the rule ſhew the <hi>Antemeridian</hi> howers from midnight to noone and the fin the <hi>Pomeridian</hi> from noone to midnight, and all by that one halfe hower circle deſcribed on the <hi>Zenitfer</hi> euen as before it was done on the quadrant with three finnes, and as readily as in the booke by the whole circle.</p>
