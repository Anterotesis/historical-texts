            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG all the silly Scurrilous
Libels, that have been Printed since
the Liberty of the Press, I never
saw such a medley of Malice, and
Nonsense, as this piece of Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism.
And indeed 'tis an Affront
to any common Reader to suppose
him not able to see how ridiculous
a Trifle it is. But because I perceive the Scribler va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues
himself upon it, and has put out a Second Part,
and sets up for an Author; I thought fit to give him
a view of himself in his own Looking-Glass, that he
may, if he have any Sense or Ingenuity left, forbear
to expose himself any further, when he knows how
ridiculous he must needs appear to all, but such as
cannot, or will not judg.</p>
            <p>I have good reason to suspect this Looking-glass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker
was expelled one of the Universities (if he
were ever so happy as <hi>to prevail with some Pedagogue
to recommend him thither)</hi> or denied Orders for his
dulness, or debauchery, or both: sure I am he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to be banish'd the Society of all Men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense for the first, whatever he may for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But 'tis but a poor, impertinent revenge thus
to rave against the Universities, and Clergy; when all
the World knows there never was less reason. Those,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50310:3"/>
which he so much contemns of two or three years
Standing, would undergo a severe Censure, if in any
Exercise they should vent so much Nonsense, as this
Fop has done in his little Scrible. And there is no
part of Learning in which the conforming Clergy have
not shewn themselves eminently skilful. Their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
are famous throughout our Neighbour-Nations,
and their Stile as good generally as that of any other
Order of Men; yea many of them write in so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive,
and exact a manner, and with so true a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
that they out-do all that has ever been Written
in the <hi>English</hi> Tongue, and may deservedly be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> themselves. Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
himself confesses (in his Book against Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleet)</hi>
that they are but too exact. But whatever he
acknowledges, I think, I may with modesty say, Our
Sermons almost equal the powerful pious Eloquence
of the first Ages of the Church: I wish the practice
of our times were as like that of the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
as the Preaching is.</p>
            <p>The People now begin to see the Difference between
Enthusiastick Cant, and a sober rational Discourse;
and this makes our Libeller under Pretence of inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
against bad Preaching, exclaim against all Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in General, and call it <hi>Prating,</hi> &amp;c. Though this
was the beloved Ordinance of his dear Dissenting
Brethren, when they inveighed, and infatuated the
poor People into Rebellion, and play'd worse Pranks
in their Pulpits, than the most extravagant Farce durst
present upon a Stage.</p>
            <p>But I shall only mention this, because 'tis notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
but must take notice withal, that, whatever ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities
this man pretends our Clergy guilty off, I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50310:3"/>
doubt they are collected out of Nonconformists Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and he might have gone no further, than his
own Conventicle-Note-Book for 'em. Sure I am, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Stile can be more slovenly, or unhandsom,
than most of their Writings, as I could easily make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if it were not every mans observation; and the
<hi>Dissenters Sayings</hi> will sufficiently shew it, where you
have the most hellish Opinions set forth, in the ugliest
Dress, being a compleat Epitome of the whole <hi>Black
Art.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I come now to examine with what modesty
this man can censure other mens Stile, or pretend to
be so great a Master of it himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Church of England—is the closest to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Institution of any Religion in the World.</hi> So
that Church and Religion with him are all one, and
the Religion professed by the Church of <hi>England</hi> is
the Church it self, and by Church-Militant, we must
mean Religion militant. But I doubt all this is but
Complement, and is not <hi>without the Phylacteries of
Hypocritical Ceremonies</hi> (as he quaintly words it.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Nation is so over-stock'd with Crape-Gowns
that</hi>—What? that he must needs give his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
a silly Pedantick Title, as ridiculous as any
thing mentioned in it? Well! but he had reason for
it; he was loth this pretty conceit should be lost—
<hi>An ill Omen of sick divinity when it comes to be mant
led in the shrouds appropriated for the dead.</hi> This
facetious, lucky Touch put him upon inventing the
Title, and then who could forbear writing a Book,
that had such a Title for it? A Title well chosen,
that nicks the business, is commonly the most Taking
Part of a bad Book, and if it be in Latin, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50310:4"/>
Readers like it the better, because he does not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
it. But whoever said, <hi>Appropriated for?</hi> I
thought things had been appropriated To, and not
For, till this Critick came forth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They will do well to accept of this Mirrour here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
them new foyled and furbish'd up, to be placed
in their Studies, and look'd in every Morning—and
by reforming their contemplated blemishes,</hi> &amp;c. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable!
Was it not worth his while to call his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
a <hi>Looking-Glass</hi> for the sake of this fustian Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory?
Thus we have the reason of his Crape and
of his Looking-glass; now put these two together
and you have a Scheme of the whole Work so exact,
that you may easily discern, what is stoln, and what
is his own in it: for this Title, I assure you, is a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
-piece, and all the rest is but the same at large,
that you have here in little.</p>
            <p>Thus I have traced him through little more than
his first Page, which is the least obnoxious to Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of any in the whole Libel, so that the Reader
may judg by this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what he must expect from such a
Coxcomb, (to use a Term of Art, by which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
the ingenious Author of <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
the word to him, 'tis <hi>appropiated for.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No Plagiary Looking-Glass,</hi> pag. 2. That's a damned
lye: for there is scarce three words of sense, but
what is stoln out of a Book, entitled The <hi>Reasons,
and Grounds of the Contempt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>He refers <hi>the reason of the contempt of the Clergy
to two very plain things; the Ignorance of some, and
the Poverty of others:</hi> but sure I am, if this man be
as poor as he is ignorant, no Clergy-man in <hi>England</hi>
will change conditions with him. Then he exclaims
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50310:4"/>
against slavery to a few <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> words, and I
commend him, for I dare swear he understands nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in any tolerable manner; no, nor <hi>English</hi> any
more than a <hi>Ballad-singer,</hi> or <hi>merry Andrew.</hi> Next he
is mightily displeased with a tedious story how <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
broke his Neck: but if the Dunce had known the
<hi>moral,</hi> it might have deterred him from undertaking
a Task so much above him. Why he should be so
angry with poor <hi>Tityrus</hi>'s Apples and Nuts, I can't
imagine, unless it be because he has been lash'd at
School for not construing <hi>Virgils Eclogues,</hi> and so
now in his Buffoon way he disparages, what has been
so highly valued by all men of Wit, and Learning,
and is incomparably better than any thing he seems
ever to have read.</p>
            <p>But I must have a care what I do, for he that
writes against this Author may disoblige more than
one man; for the least Part of his Book is his own.
I shall pass therefore from the 2d <hi>pag.</hi> to the 15. for
all between is stoln, only a flourish or two perhaps
by the by to make it look sillily, and like his own.
I confess some things there mentioned are so grosly
foolish, that I can hardly believe any one would ever
please himself in 'em, but that I hope to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
our Author has pleased himself in as bad. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
him or any man else to instance in any one of
the conforming Clergy, that has vented any such
thing, and till he does, all this is at random, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
malice. Most of what he produces, I grant,
is meer Cant and Jargon, only some few things, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
might be excused, as this, <hi>My Text divides it
self into,</hi> &amp;c. For <hi>Virgil</hi> says,
<q>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50310:5"/>—Partes ubi se via findit in ambas:</q>
And why a Text has not as much power to divide it
self as a way to cleave it self, I cannot understand.
But I shall not undertake to defend any mans extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
I know none that are guilty of so gross
ones, nor I believe our Plagiary neither.</p>
            <p>To pass to what is his own, I shall give you his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
to the Clergy, and his dull fulsom Buffoon
expressions, as they come in my way, that any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Reader may judg how capable this man is of
being a Critick.</p>
            <p>The instances set down <hi>pag.</hi> 15. are his own, and
I defie him to prove any Minister ever said any such
thing in the Pulpit or elsewhere; which if he cannot
do, he must pass for a notorious Lyar?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every Whiffler in Divinity</hi> pag. 16. <hi>Too much Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in English in our great Cities—and all this
to feed the Ostentation of our Pulpit-threshers.</hi> ib. So
then he's for Preaching in an unknown Tongue, for
Preaching in <hi>English</hi> is Prating. But, pray, mind the
coherence: He blames some for going to Coffee-houses
(as if those places were <hi>appropriated for</hi> Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the Physitian were to be blamed for visiting
the Pest-house) and others, for <hi>handing</hi> young, brisk
Ladies (though St. <hi>Paul</hi> asks the Question, <hi>have not</hi>
we the Power to lead about a Sister?) as if there
were not laced <hi>Cravats and Ruffles enough about the
Town for this amorous Employment;</hi> and then continues,
<hi>To say truth, we have too much Prating in English,</hi> &amp;c.
if there be any dependence in this, I'le yield he can
write sense.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50310:5"/>Hackney-Sermon-Makers, <hi>ib.</hi> Were Sermons therefore
less frequent, they would be much more valued: for then
would men have time to meditate, and their abortive
irreverences, would not drop so often from their mouths
without soul or life, as not having staid their time in
womb of meditation, <hi>ib. There's a stroke of Art for

               <hi>Next for a touch of Politicks.</hi>—Now whether it
be most convenient to make Ministers for Churches, or
Churches for Ministers, is the Question, but the Proverb
is, Talk of any thing but building Churches: for if we
build more Churches, we must make more land for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment:
which cannot be done without drying up of the
Sea and that's a very difficult task. <hi>What a smart Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrase

            </p>
            <p>The Latin ones <hi>(Book-sellers shops)</hi> they seldom

            </p>
            <p>Now his fit of gravity takes him again, and he
talks pragmatically of what he does not understand,
and therefore he had better taken example of our
<hi>Crape-Gown-men; Who</hi> (he says,) <hi>think it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient

            </p>
            <p>But <hi>with a jerk</hi> he puts off his Asses gravity, and

life,</hi> pag. 15. <hi>to suffocate what God has so mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously
detected,</hi> ib. The Plot, I suppose, he means:
but whan sense is it to choak a Plot? But we must
pardon him, he takes Choaking and Stifling to be the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50310:6"/>
same, whereas stifling is but one way of Choaking,
and he might as well have said the Plot was kill'd, or,
in his own strain, Enecated. For in such expressions
the manner of doing is principally aimed at, and
the doing the thing only imply'd, and scarce attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to.</p>
            <p>They <hi>(the Clergy)</hi> pretend themselves Sons and

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place, commend me to that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and admirable Translation of a piece of Latin
printed by the Ludgate Excommunicator,</hi> Nunquam
nec Albiani, nec Nigriani, nec Cassiani inveniri potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt
Christiani, <hi>i. e.</hi> Never was a true Christian
found a Traytor to his Prince. <hi>This 'tis to have a
sharpness and acuteness of wit beyond the common reach
of mankind,</hi> ib. This 'tis to be dull and impertinent!
In my opinion a very little search into History
might have taught this Glass-maker, that <hi>Albiani,</hi> &amp;c.
are denominations of traiterous factions in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and then by the help of a little Logick, he
might have concluded, that what is denied of all the
Parts is denied of the whole; and then where's the
fault in the Translation? I desire him to get it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
better, or not to meddle with things he does
not understand. But what has this Fellow to do to
defame a Clergy-man for doing his duty, his Function
obliges him to, in excommunicating wilful, stubborn
Offenders, according to the Laws in force in this
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50310:7"/>
and all other Nations in the Christian World, as well
as to the injucntion of the Gospel, and the constant
practice of the Church in all Ages? Is the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
if any man act otherwise than he ought, in a
matter of so high Concern? or must men stand to the
Arbitrement of every Rascally Scribler? or do they
think to scare men out of their Duty? If any man act
contrary to Law, let them accuse him Legally, and
not Post him up at every Book-sellers stall. But the
Laws themselves cannot escape these mens venom, if
they contradict their refractory humour; witness the
Laws against Conventicles, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But I have wearied my self in tracing him thus far,
and therefore shall let his Essay of a Sermon alone; and
I hope by this time such an estimate may be made of
the Libeller, that no man will have any extraordinary
opinion of his Parts or Honesty. For what man that
has the least esteem for Religion, or but common Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
to the Ministers of it, would in so scurrilous a
manner treat the meanest and most contemptible of
the Clergy, as if their very Function ought not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
them from buffoonery, and reproachful, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
invective Language? Or what would expose his
malice so ridiculously as to stuff out a Pamphlet with
another mans wit impertinently applied, and commit
the very faults himself, that at the same time he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
in others, but an Ideot to all Learning and good
manners?</p>
            <p>I am sensible, I have omitted many things, I might
have taken notice of (and so I must needs do, unless
I should transcribe the whole) particularly two or
three Latin Scraps, though he derides others, that
<hi>spice and besprinkle their Harangues with Greek and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50310:7"/>
Latin Sentences:</hi> but he may the more easily be excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for not avoiding such indecencies, because those
that are worth any thing, are not his own observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and he forgot 'em, as soon as he had transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
'em.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I must apply his own words (his
own I call 'em, but the Reader will easily guess if
any of them be stoln) and desire all men to observe
how <hi>the poor man has laboured to make an Ass of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:
and to judg whether he has not shewn an equal
composition of Discretion, Learning, and Charity, of each
two drams:</hi> but then <hi>how strangely conceited are they,
that after a long consideration, serious meditation</hi> (what
pity 'tis <hi>womb of Meditation</hi> would not come in here
too!) <hi>and recollection of mind, are so vain as to put
their Conundrums, their Quibles, and their Quibus's in
Print?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I suppose this taste will be sufficient to shew the
Scribler is not capable of writing any thing, that will
bear Censure, or satisfie any man of ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
else I assure the Reader, I could with as
much ease have exposed his Second Part. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
I doubt the Reader by this time is as weary as
my self, of such <hi>Bankside and froth</hi> (to give him his
Character in his own civil Language) <hi>of this Iack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudding
to the Bear-garden,</hi> I shall pass by this Ribal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
his slip-slap slip-slap, his Hoytie, Toytie, and
all his little Conceits, which I suppose, he took in
Short-hand at some Mountebanks stage, (for he has
more ways of stealing, than one without doubt) I
shall take no notice of his <hi>So Almighty,</hi> as if there
were degrees in Omnipotency; nor of his Greek and
Hebrew in Latin Characters neither: For what's that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50310:8"/>
to me? he is but a Transcriber; let every man do as
he can, and take it, as he finds it, at the nighest hand;
Why should a man be troubled with more Languages
than will serve his turn? Now he took upon him to
write against the number of Scholars (Part 1. p. 1.)
who knows but his next pique may be at the number
of Languages?</p>
            <p>I wish the Dissenters much joy of his Arguments
(<hi>Never was ever, &amp;c.</hi>) in behalf of Conventicles,
which has been urged above forty times (as most of
theirs have) within this half year, and answered as
often, but he has dress'd it up so apishly in false Mode
and Figure, and exposed it so unluckily, that, I hope,
any one will be ashamed to use it after him.</p>
            <p>And so I have quitted my self of the biggest part
of his Book, which is nothing but a piece of Farce
between the two Dialogists, or a Trial of Skill, which
should express their Non-sense with more agreeable
Grace in wretched Pun and Quibble. I shall take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
then only of two or three choice Notions, which
are very extraordinary for their extravagance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
new, and so I suppose his own.</p>
            <p>First, he says, Ministers ought to insist upon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
and leave the Particulars to the Hearers, that is,
they ought to teach Obedience in General, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that Obedience consists, or what is agreeable to it,
they ought not pretend to determine. His reason is,
because the Scripture treats only of Generals and has
neither <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> nor the Oath of Allegiance
in it. So then our Casuistical Divinity is all gone at
a dash, and besides the Censures, and Discipline of the
Church are quite taken away; for what can the
Church censure but by its Ministers? and what falls
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50310:8"/>
under Censure, but particular Actions? And what more
heinous, and so more worthy of Censure than Diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?
Most men understand the General Heads
of their Duty, but what particulars fall under those
Heads is not so easily known, and to explain this is
the proper work of a Preacher. Every one knows an
Oath obliges, suppose the Oath of Allegiance, or the
Oath taken by Jurors; but if a Minister sees men act
contrary to this Oath, whether out of wilfulness or
ignorance, ought he not to admonish them of the sin?
I should think his sin as great as theirs, if he did not;
for his very Function obliges him to it, and he breaks
the most solemn Vow that can be made to God, if he
neglect it. I confess the same thing falls differently
under the consideration of a Lawyer and of a Divine;
the one considers it as matter of Law, the other as
matter of Conscience, yet every Action as it concerns
the Conscience, so it belongs to the Divine, and if the
niceties of Law make the Case doubtful, yet still the
Divine is to direct the doubting, or scrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>Certainly our Ancestors thought Divines might judg
not only whether a Law were obey'd or no; but even
of the matter it self, before the enacting of the Law,
whether it were agreeable to Gods Word; and this, I
make no Question, is one reason why our Bishops sit
in Parliament. Now 'tis much more easie to judg
what the Law obliges to, than to know whether that
Obligation be valid, that is, allowable by Scripture
and Reason, though this indeed be essential to every
Law properly so called.</p>
            <p>His most matchless heroic Attempt is yet behind, for
which, I suppose, he promises himself no small reward
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50310:9"/>
from the Faction, and to keep a Hank upon them, and
to scare us to an humble submission at the same time:
he threatens, he has more to say, and if we take no
care to oblige him, all shall out: so it seems, we must
buy this shrewd man off, or we are utterly undone.
Well! but perhaps there may be no such great danger
yet.—<hi>If the Presbyterians do hold King-killing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
they learned it from the Church of England<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
pag. 21. And then after a tedious impertinence
between the two Dialogists, he adds, <hi>Why then I say
you do not read in any story, since the growth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
that ever any crowned Head was ever brought
to a formal Bar of Iustice, till</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of Scots was
arraigned, tryed, convicted, sentenced, and formally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed
by Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and the Clergy were a part
of the Body, that pressed and urged the Queen to hasten
her Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here he compares the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> to King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
the loyal Nobility and Gentry of her days to the
<hi>Doegs</hi> of the Rabble and Refuse of all the Sects in
Christendom in 48. and all this meerly out of a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
design to prove the Church of <hi>England</hi> as bad as
the Phanaticks. But what is there alike in these two
Cases? The one was a Dependant Queen, and under
legal Conviction of Attempts upon the Crown: the
other an absolute Sovereign Prince, that neither had
given the least reason of suspicion to his People of
any design of invading their Rights, nor ought they
to have taken Arms against him, if he had given it:
the one was put to death by Foreigners, in a foreign
Countrey, at the command of a foreign Prince; the
other in his own Kingdom, beside his own Palace, by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50310:9"/>
his own Subjects, at the command of a most bloody
Tyrant, and Usurper.</p>
            <p>But in short, The Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> was put to
death justly, or unjustly; if justly, where's the fault?
if unjustly, yet 'twas not by her own Subjects: Nor
does the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> allow
it, if it were unjust, as the Doctrine as well as Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our Phanaticks does teach open Rebellion:
let them shew, if they can, any one Tenet of our
Church, which is seditious or any way pernicious to
Government as plainly, as their whole Doctrine and
Practice has appeared to all the World to be. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
since all those, whom this man follows, are of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
(as a thousand Pamphlets against the Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
witness) that she was justly put to death, 'tis but
too plain, that this comparison was brought to justifie
the latter part of it, and not to condemn the former.
As who should say, <hi>You of the Church of</hi> England
<hi>charge us with killing</hi> Charles I. <hi>and did not you kill
the Queen of</hi> Scots? <hi>You did it justly we confess, but
you ought to confess as much for us; for the case is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel.</hi>
That this is his meaning is plain from <hi>pag.</hi> 5.
Where he says; <hi>However to talk like a Divine it was
a Supreme Power (of those Vsurpers of the late times)
though set over us for our sins and our punishment, and
most certain it is, that we and the</hi> Calvinists <hi>agree in
this, that</hi> etiam infideli Magistratui obediendum est,
<hi>with safety of Conscience. I only speak this to shew, that
men ought not to urge upon the Conscience so severely,
that were so nice of it themselves.</hi> Here (<hi>Infideli</hi>)
must be interpreted an Usurper, or else it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to his purpose (and by the way we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how aptly this man uses his little shreds of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin)
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50310:10"/>
for the plain drift of his Argument is, That those
who refused to obey <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> ought to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to the Phanaticks now, because the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
commanding then, was equally lawful to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as this is now, but the things enjoyned were scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled.
And thus he levels our lawful Sovereigns Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
with the Usurpers, making it as necessary to
obey one as the other; that is, in all things, that a
man does not think in his Conscience unlawful.</p>
            <p>He goes on, speaking of the Queen of <hi>Scots: Could
you blame her for Plotting, though she absolutely denied
it, against a Person, that kept her from the enjoyment
of her Kingdom, one that had deceived her with Chains,
and Imprisonment, after she had made choice of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for Sanctuary and assistance?</hi> pag. 22. Did ever any
Jesuit speak more maliciously of our Glorious Queen
of blessed memory, than this impotent wretch does?
But this is the common Cry of the Phanaticks, and a
late Author in his Harmony of Non-Conformists (<hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
has taken a great deal of pains to prove her <hi>popishly
Affected.</hi> But this new invention of our Libeller to
calumniate the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is a piece of so
much folly as well as malice, that the Devil could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
hope before to prevail upon any one to publish it.</p>
            <p>Next follow his Cavils against some few late Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and them too written by men of greater Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Worth, than any, his Conventicles could ever
boast of. I shall only observe from them, how false
his charge in the first Part is, which certainly he would
have made good in these Reflections, if his malice had
not out-run his wit. After all his false Glosses and
sinister interpretations it amounts to but this; That a
Complement, in his opinion, is strained too high, or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50310:10"/>
that a Text is understood otherwise by some Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.
Only he is very severe upon the Gentleman
that quoted <hi>Valerius Maximus,</hi> when he ought to have
consulted <hi>Plutarch:</hi> because <hi>Plutarch</hi> he says, is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Author, and he and <hi>Valerius</hi> do'nt agree in that
particular: but he might have considered that that
quotation is brought for illustration, and allusion, not
in affirmation of any Historical Truth, so that whether
one, or the other, or neither be in the right, it matters
not. Besides, how does it appear that they disagree?
<hi>Plutarch</hi> says <hi>Sylla</hi> died of a <hi>Phthiriasis,</hi> or <hi>Morbus Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculosus;</hi>
and <hi>Valerius</hi> that he died of Rage: What
then? might not his Disease cause his Rage, and that
be the immediate cause of his death? or might not his
Disease be the cause why his Rage should so easily
carry him off? so both may speak truth, though not
all the truth. However this be, I am sure, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
may be ashamed to own, he has ever seen <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi>
or <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> to so little purpose. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
with a Passage out of Dr. <hi>Burnets</hi> Preface to the
second Part of his History of the Reformation (whom
I the rather quote, because he is so frequently quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by our Dissenters upon all occasions) where after
a just Character of our Bishops, he adds—<q>And
when I look into the Inferiour Clergy, there are,
chiefly about this great City of <hi>London,</hi> so many, so
eminent, both for the strictness of their lives, the
constancy of their labours, and plain way of Preaching,
which is now perhaps brought to as great aperfection
as ever was, since men spoke, as they received it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from the Holy Ghost; the great gentleness
of their deportment to such as differ from them, their
mutual love, and charity; and in a word, for all the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50310:11"/>
qualities that can adorn Ministers or Christians; that
if such a number of such men cannot prevail with
this debauched Age, this one thing to me looks
more dismally, than all the other affrighting Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
of our Condition, that God having sent so
many faithful Teachers, their labours are still so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.</q>
