         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

She was a woman much adicted to Popery, and to Papiſtical fancies that ſhe commonly obſerved, and would declare to her neighbours; ſhe would often tell thoſe, that had converſe with her of lucky and unlucky days, which ſhe would have them obſerve in their employments; ſhe was likewiſe addicted much to Goſſipping (as the vulgar call it) to tell ſtrange unheard-of tales and ſtories of tranſactions, and things that have been, and might be done, by cunning and wiſe people; ſhe was one that would undertake to cure almoſt any diſeaſes, which ſhe did for the moſt part by charms and ſpels, but ſometimes uſed phyſical ingredients, to cover her abominable practices; ſhe would undertake to procure things that were loſt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore ſtoln goods, upon which employments ſhe was made uſe of by many people, and amongſt the very many that came to her, there came one <hi>Anne Styles</hi> (then a ſervant to <hi>Richard Goddard</hi> Eſquire, of the Cloſe in new <hi>Sarum)</hi> who had loſt a ſilver Spoon of her Maſters, and it was ſuſpected by many ſervants of the houſe, that the Spoon was ſtollen, who amongſt

who they were, that ſhe could ſhew in that glaſs, and the Maid looking in the glaſs ſaw the ſhape of many perſons, and what they were doing of in her Maſters houſe, in particular ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſtriſs <hi>Elizabeth Roſewel</hi> ſtanding in her Miſtriſs Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, looking out of the Window with her hands in her ſleeves, and another walking alone in her Maſters Garden, one other ſtanding in a room within the Kitchin, one other ſtanding in a matted room of her Maſters, againſt the Window, with her Apron in her hand, and ſhewed others drinking with glaſſes of Beer in their hands; after the Witches ſhewing this to the Maid, ſhe then bad her go home, which when ſhe came home, ſhe asked the people (ſhe ſo ſaw in the Witches glaſs) what they had been doing while ſhe had been wanting, and by their anſwers to her ſhe found that they had been doing what ſhe ſaw they were in the glaſs, and the Maid relating this to <hi>Elizabeth Rouſewel,</hi> ſhe replyed, that Miſtriſs <hi>Bodden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> (meaning the ſaid Witch) was either a Witch, or a woman of God. This being about one of the Clock in the afternoon the maid went about her imploiment till 6. a Clock in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, about which time <hi>Elizabeth Roſewel</hi> acquainting the Maid, that her Miſtriſs going to borrow money of her Daughter in Law Miſtriſs <hi>Sarah Goddard,</hi> the money was ſtained black, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Elizabeth Roſewel</hi> told the Maid that her Miſtriſs was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of being poyſoned by the ſaid Miſtriſs <hi>Sarah,</hi> and by her Siſter Miſtriſs <hi>Anne Goddard,</hi> for that ſhe had been thrice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in danger of being poyſoned, and therefore deſired the Maid to go to the <note place="margin">Under the name of Mrs. <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denham.</hi>

ſhe would ſhew her a trick, as ſhe ſpoke the words, ſhe ſhould break her neck before ſhe went out of the Gate; and then the VVitch took five ſhillings of the Maid, (that ſhe had received from Miſtriſs <hi>Elizabeth Roſewel)</hi> and ſo the Maid left her and went home, and when the Maid came home, ſhe went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Maſter <hi>Maſons</hi> Chamber, where Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs <hi>Elizabeth Roſewel</hi> were, and acquainted them with what the VVitch had told her, and upon that, one of them replyed, the Devill appeared in the faces of Miſtriſs <hi>Sarah</hi> and Miſtriſs <hi>Anne,</hi> and deſired the maid to go again the next day, to know of the VVitch what the time ſhould be that her miſtriſs ſhould be poyſoned, and the next morning about ſix or ſeaven of the Clock, the maid went to the VVitches houſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried five ſhillings along with her, and gave it the VVitch, and told her ſhe was come to know the time when her miſtriſs ſhould be poyſoned, and the Witch told her, it ſhould be on a Friday, but ſhe would prevent it before that time, and bade the Maid come again in the afternoon; and when the Maid returned home, Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> ſpoke to her immediatly to go again to the Witch, to know of her, if one Maſter <hi>Rawley</hi> did intend him any miſchief, for winning his money from him at play, and gave the Maid two ſhillings to give the VVitch, And the Maid did accordingly go, and did ask of the Witch what Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> bid her, and the Witch told her that Maſter <hi>Rawley</hi> had intended ſome miſchief againſt him two ſeveral times, and had way-layd him, but ſhe had and would prevent it, and would ſend him a charm, and took a piece of paper and put therein yellow powder, and ſo made it up in a croſs figure, and gave it to the Maid to deliver it to Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> to wear about his neck; and the Witch further told her, that if the Charm were about him he need not fear what mony he owed, for no Bay liff could take hold or meddle with him, and ſo the Maid returned home and gave him the Charm. The next day Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> ſent the Maid again to the Witch, to tell her that he intended ſome Law ſutes with his Father in Law Maſter <hi>Goddard,</hi> and to know of her whether he ſhould have the better of it, and gave the Maid three ſhillings to give the Witch, and when the Maid came to the Witches houſe and told her what ſhe came for, the Witch took her ſtaff, and

there drew him about the houſe, making a kind of a Circle, and then took a book, and carrying it over the Circle, with her hands, and taking a green Glaſs, did lay it upon the book, and placed in the Circle an earthen pan of Coles, wherein ſhe threw ſomething, which burning cauſed a very noyſome ſtinck, and told the Maid ſhe ſhould not be afraid of what ſhe ſhould then ſee, for now they would come, they are the words ſhe uſed, and ſo calling Belzebub, Tormentor, Satan, and Lucifer appear, there ſuddainly aroſe a very high wind, which made the houſe ſhake, and preſently the back Door of the houſe flying open, there came five ſpirits, as the Maid ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, in the likeneſs of ragged Boys, ſome bigger than others, and ran about the houſe, where ſhe had drawn the Staff, and the VVitch threw down upon the ground Crums of Bread, which the Spirits picked up, and leapt over the Pan of Coals oftentimes, which ſhe ſet in the middeſt of the Circle, and a Dog and a Cat of the VVitches danced with them; and after ſome time the VVitch looked again in her book, and threw ſome great white ſeeds upon the ground, which the ſaid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits picked up, and ſo in a ſhort time the wind was layd, and the VVitch going forth at her back Door the Spirits vaniſhed, after which the VVitch told the Maid, that Maſter <hi>Maſon</hi> ſhould demand fifteen hundred pound, and one hundred and fifty pound <hi>per annum</hi> of Maſter <hi>Goddard,</hi> and if he deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, he ſhould proſecute the Law againſt him, and begone from his Father, and then he ſhould gain it, with which meſſage the Maid returned and acquainted Maſter <hi>Maſon.</hi> She was ſent by Miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> divers times to enquire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſweet-hearts, when ſhe ſhould be marryed, and how ſhe ſhould diſ-ingage her ſelf from her ſweet-hearts that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had ſolicited her in a way of marriage, the one now in <hi>France,</hi> the other with whom ſhe broke a piece of Gold to bind their contract, to which the VVitch gave her directions, and told her what would be the reſult and iſſue of thoſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of many more of the like nature, that ſhe was ſent to propound to the VVitch, And in a ſhort time after, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> ſent her again to the VVitch, to know of her when the day ſhould be, that Miſtriſs <hi>Goddard</hi> ſhould be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and delivered her eight ſhillings to give the VVitch, ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118450:6"/>
the Maid went again to the VVitch accordingly, and gave her the eight ſhillings, and the Witch replyed ſhe could not tell her then, but gave the Maid one ſhilling, and bid her go to an Apothecary, and buy ſome white <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and bring it to her to prevent it, which the Maid did, and carryed it to the Witch, who ſaid to her ſhe would take it and burn it, to prevent the poyſoning, but ſhe burnt it not as the Maid could ſee at all; then the Maid returned home, and told Maſter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and Miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> what ſhe had done, who laughed at it. The next day being Tueſday, ſhe was again ſent by Maſter <hi>Maſon,</hi> to know where the poyſon ſhould be found that ſhould be given her Miſtriſs, and when the Maid had propoſed the queſtion to the VVitch, ſhe took her ſtick (as formerly is related) and making therewith a Circle, the wind roſe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, then taking a Beeſom ſhe ſwept over the Circle, and made another, and looking in her Book and Glaſs, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and uſing ſome words ſoftly to her ſelf, ſhe ſtood in the Circle and ſaid, Belzebub, Tormentor, Lucifer, and Satan appear; there appeared firſt a Spirit in the ſhape of a little Boy as ſhe conceiv'd, which then turned into another ſhape ſomething like a Snake, and then into the ſhape of a ſhagged Dog with great eyes, which went about in the Circle; And in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſhe ſet an earthen pan of Coles, wherein ſhe threw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which burned and ſtank, and then the Spirit vaniſhed, after which the VVitch took her Book and Glaſs again, and ſhewed the Maid in the Glaſs, Miſtriſs <hi>Sarah Goddards</hi> Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the colour of the Curtains, and the Bed turned up the wrong way, and under that part of the Bed where the Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter lay, ſhe ſhewed the poyſon in a white paper; The Maid afterward returned home, and acquainted Miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> with what the Witch had ſhewed her in a Glaſs, that the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it lay under Miſtriſs <hi>Sarahs</hi> Bed, and alſo ſpoke to her that they might go together and take it away; but Miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> replyed no, let it alone for Gods ſake, and would not, neither did ſhe take it or ſuffer it to be taken away. And the Witch further told the Maid (when ſhe was with her the Thurſday) that the next day being Friday, about 7. or 8. of the Clock at night, there ſhould be Sage Ale made for her Miſtriſs, And that there ſhould be a white Pot ſet upon the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118450:6"/>
Dreſſer in the Kitchin wherein poyſon ſhould be put, but Miſtriſs <hi>Goddard</hi> ſhould not drink it, and that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> knew beſt what to do; And on the Friday Night, there was Aleſet on the fire (as the Witch before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated) the maid being that while ſleeping in the Hall; Miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> awaked her and bid her go into the Kitchin, and ſee whether or no there was not poyſon in the Cup; And the maid looked and found ſomething there, and called to Miſtriſs <hi>Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> and told her there was ſomething in it, which ſwimmed on the top, and ſomething in the bottom, as the Witch before had told the maid ſhould be. And then miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> took the ſame and carried it up to her miſtriſs, and ſhewed it her, and the maid afterward asking miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> if ſhe had told her miſtriſs of it, ſhe replyed, that her miſtriſs knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of it by her looks. The next day following being Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday the maid was ſent again to the Witch, to get ſome example ſhewen upon the Gentlewoman that ſhould procure the poyſon, upon which the maid went again to the VVitch, and told her for what ſhe was ſent. Then the Witch made a Circle as formerly, and ſet her pan of Coles as formerly, and burnt ſomething that ſtank extremely, and took her book and Glaſs as before is related, and ſaid Belzebub, Tormentor, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer, and Satan appear, and then appeared five Spirits, as ſhe conceived, in the ſhapes of little ragged Boyes, which the VVitch commanded to appear and go along with the maid to a meadow at <hi>Wilton,</hi> which the VVitch ſhewed in the Glaſs, and there to gather Vervine and Dill, and forthwith the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Boys ran away before the maid, and ſhe followed them to the ſaid meadow, and when they came thither the ragged Boys looked about for the Herbs, and removed the Snow in two or three places, before they could find any, and at laſt they found ſome, and brought it away with them, and then the maid and the Boys returned-back again to the VVitch, and found her in the Circle paring her Nayls, and then ſhe took the ſaid Herbs, and dryed the ſame, and made powder of ſome, and dryed the leaves of other, and threw Bread to the Boys, and they eat and danced as formerly, and then the VVitch reading in a book they vaniſhed away; And the VVitch gave the maid in one paper the powder, in another the leaves, and in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118450:7"/>
third the paring of the Nayls, all which the maid was to give to her Miſtriſs; the powder was to put in the young Gentlewomens Miſtriſs <hi>Sarah</hi> and Miſtriſs <hi>Anne Goddards</hi> drink or broth, to rot their Guts in their Bellies; the leaves to rub about the brims of the Pot, to make their Teeth fall out of their Heads; and the paring of the Nayls to make them drunk and mad. And the VVitch likewiſe told the maid, that ſhe muſt tell her Miſtriſs, and the reſt, that when they did give it them, they muſt croſs their Breaſts, and then ſay, <hi>In the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, grant that this may be,</hi> and that they muſt ſay the Creed backward and forward. And when the maid came home and delivered it to her miſtriſs, and told her the effects of the powder, and the other things, her miſtriſs laughed, and ſaid that it is a very brave thing indeed. And her miſtriſs ſent her again the ſame day to the Witch, to deſire her to ſend her ſome Charm, or writing under her own hand, that ſhould keep her from ill, and preſerve her from danger. And the VVitch took Pen Ink and Paper, and wrote ſomething, and put ſome yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low powder therein, and gave it to the maid to give it to her miſtriſs, and bad her tell her, that ſhe muſt never look in it, and muſt carry it in her Boſom by Day, and lay it in a purſe under her Head by Night; And the Monday following, the maids miſtriſs, maſter <hi>Maſon,</hi> and miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> importuned her to go again to the VVitch to know of her whether or no ſhe could not make the young Gentlewomen exemplary ſome other ways, ſeeing that they could not give them the powder, and whether ſhe could not ſend a Spirit to bring them upon their knees, to ask her mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſs forgiveneſs; but the VVitch told her ſhe could not have any power of them unleſs ſhee could get her the tayls of their Coats, or <hi>of their ſmocks,</hi> and if ſhe had but that ſhe could make the houſe fall about their ears, and could do more than maſter <hi>Lilly</hi> or any one what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; which meſſage the maid carryed to her miſtriſs, upon which her miſtriſs replyed, That would be pretty to be done, and miſtriſs <hi>Roſewel</hi> ſpoke to the maid to cut off the ſame when they ſhould be a bed, but the maid refuſed to do it, the young Gentlewomen miſtriſs <hi>Sarah</hi> and miſtriſs <hi>Anne,</hi>

hearing of theſe tranſactions about poyſon, and that it ſhould be laid to their charge, that they had a deſigne, and provided poyſon to poyſon their Mother; being much moved at it, and to vindicate themſelves, that no ſuch aſperſion might lie on them (in regard it was alſo reported, that they ſhould buy one Ounce and halfe of poyſon that coſt 6 <hi>d.</hi> at an Apothecaries) they went about <hi>Sarum</hi> to enquire whether any ſuch thing was bought, and by whom, that the truth might be diſcovered, and the aſperſion might be removed; and having found where the poyſon was bought, the Maids fellow-ſervant <hi>Mirian</hi> and Mris. <hi>Roſewell</hi> told the Maid, that her Miſtris wiſhed her to goe away and ſhift for her ſelfe, otherwiſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that ſhe ſhould be examined before ſome Juſtice, and ſo there might ſome trouble and diſgrace come upon them in the buſineſſe: And the ſame night the Maid went out of her Maſters houſe, and lay at one <hi>Matterſhawes</hi> the Cookes: The next day in the morning Mris. <hi>Roſewell</hi> ſent her word that ſhe would ſpeak with her at <hi>Longmans</hi> houſe, and the Maid went thither, where Mris. <hi>Roſewell</hi> brought her her Cloaths, and wiſht her to goe to <hi>London,</hi> and brought her 9 <hi>s.</hi> which ſhe laid out before to the Witch, and 12 <hi>d.</hi> as a gift from Mr. <hi>Maſon;</hi> and Mris. <hi>Roſewell</hi> ſent to the Witch, before ſhe went, to know whether ſhe did approve of her Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and the Witch wiſhed her to go, and told her that ſhe would ſend a Paper by her to Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> and did then write in the paper divers Croſſes and Pictures, and other things, and put black and yellow powder therein, and told the Maid ſhe ſhould give the ſame to Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> and bid him uſe it how he pleaſed; which Paper the Maid carryed along with her as far as <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> and there burnt it: But before the Maid went away from the Witch for <hi>London,</hi> the Witch asked the Maid whether ſhe would goe to <hi>London</hi> High or Low. To which ſhe replyed, What doe you mean by that? She anſwered, If you will goe on High, you ſhall be carryed to <hi>London</hi> in the Air, and be there in two hours; but if you goe a Low, you ſhall be taken at <hi>Suttons</hi> Towns end, and before, unleſſe you have help: But before ſhe departed,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118450:8"/>
the Witch earneſtly deſired the Maid to live with her, and told her, that if ſhe would do ſo, ſhe would teach her to doe as ſhe did, and that ſhe ſhould never be taken; then the Maid asked her what ſhe could doe? ſhe anſwered, You ſhal know preſently, and forthwith ſhe appeared in the ſhape of a great Black Cat, and lay along by the Chimny: at which the Maid being very much afrighted, ſhe came into her own ſhape again, and told her, I ſee you are afraid, and I ſee you are willing to be gone, and told her, if ſhe was, ſhe ſhould ſay ſo, and not ſpeak againſt her conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and the Maid replyed, ſhe was willing to goe, and not to dwell with the Witch; then the Witch ſaid, ſhe muſt ſeal unto her body and blood not to diſcover her; which ſhe promiſing to doe, ſhe forthwith made a Circle as formerly ſhe had done, and looking in her Book, and called <hi>Beelzebub, Tormentor, Lucifer,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> appeare, then appeared two Spirits in the likeneſſe of great Boys, with long ſhagged black hair, and ſtood by her, looking over her ſhoulder, and the Witch took the Maids fore-finger of her right hand, in her hand, and pricked it with a pin, and ſqueeſed out the blood, and put it into a Pen, and put the Pen into the Maids hand, and held her hand to write in a great Book, and one of the Spirits laid his Hand or Claw upon the Witches, whileſt the Maid wrote, and when ſhe had done writing, whileſt their hands were together, the Witch ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> and made the Maid ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> and the Spirits ſaid <hi>Amen, Amen;</hi> and the Spirits hand did feel cold to the Maid as it touched her hand, when the Witches hand and hers were together writing; and then the Spirit gave a peece of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (which he firſt bit) to the Witch, who gave it to the Maid, and alſo ſtuck two Pins in the Maids head-cloathes, and bid her keep them, and bid her be gone, and ſaid alſo I will vex the Gentlewoman well enough, as I did the Man in <hi>Clarington</hi> Park, which I made walk about with a bundle of Pales on his back all night in a Pond of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and could not lay them down till the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

            <p>Friendly Reader, what is here related was delivered upon oath at the Aſſiſes before the Judges by the Maid her ſelf, and is not a fancy, but a truth; yet if thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt doubt it, ſuſpend thy judgement till the laſt, and hear what others depoſe beſides her, and many witneſſes uſually fully confirme what may be dubious upon one Information.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe I have uſed ſome other names in the Narration before going, Mris. <hi>Goddard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> Mris. <hi>Betty Roſewell,</hi> Mris. <hi>Sarah</hi> and Mris. <hi>Anne Goddard,</hi> and others, but I could not avoyd them, for I have related as the Maids Evidence was, and ſhould I not have related the ground and foundation of the buſineſſe, or if any of theſe paſſages ſhould have been omitted, I ſhould have much covered the wickedneſſe, and ſewed fig-leaves to hide the vileneſſe of the Witch.</p>
            <p>And further know, Judicious Reader, I am not here to give a partiall relation of any thing, or to ſpeak in the praiſe or diſpraiſe of any perſon, neither doth it behove me to meddle with any actions of any perſons beſides the Witches and the Maids, therefore miſtake me not, my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was not, neither is it, by this, to lay any calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or prejudices on Mris. <hi>Goddard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Maſon,</hi> or others, far be it from me; I muſt confeſſe they were ſomething to blame in ſending up and down the Maid, if they knew the woman to be a Witch, and no doubt but they are ſorry for it, that ſuch an accident ſhould happen, but the title and drift of the following part of my book, ſhews, my intent is to diſcover the practiſe of the Witch, and ſhould wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly let paſſe any thing elſe that relates not to it; but,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118450:9"/>
ſince I am digreſſed a little, let me here inſert a word or two, and that is thus:</p>
            <p>There was for ſome ſhort time ſome conceivings or thinkings that the young Gentlewomen, Mris. <hi>Sarah</hi> and Mris. <hi>Anne Goddard,</hi> ſhould plot and attempt to poyſon their Mother in law: I need not ſay much in their vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, they have already ſufficiently cleared themſelves, and the relation before ſhews they knew of no ſuch thing; beſides their ſtirring and going about to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, to finde out the ground-work of the plot, was the firſt riſe and ground of the diſcovery of the Witch: ſo that they are ſo far from lying under any imputation, that it is to be acknowledged by all that they were the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of its diſcovery, and therefore Mris. <hi>Goddard</hi> or others have no ground to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>jecture any ſuch thing againſt them: I ſpeak not any thing partially, for Mris. <hi>Goddard</hi> is a Gentlewoman altogether unknown to me, Mr. <hi>Maſon</hi> is one whom I never to my knowledge ſaw, and the young Gentlewomen I never had any acquaintance with, and ſhould I ſpeak any thing to their diſhonor or diſeſteem, I ſhould ſpeak it not knowingly: Therefore friendly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, harbour not any prejudicate opinion againſt any of them, by reaſon of what is here inſerted; for my owne part I bear none againſt them, and I hope this will not raiſe or ſtir up any in the Reader; for what is before ſaid, is not enough to make them much faulty, but it ſhews and much aggravates the lewdneſſe and wickedneſſe of the Witch.</p>
            <p>But now to return where I left; you have heard what hath been the practiſe of the Witch in ſome meaſure, now I ſhall proceed to ſhew how ſhe got power over the Maid, and what miſerable torments ſhe was an inſtrument in bringing on her.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> Son in law to Mris. <hi>Goddard,</hi> hearing that his Mother in law was in danger of being poyſoned, and that a Servant of hers had bought the poyſon, and was ſled or gone away, he forthwith with one other man, <hi>William Atwood</hi> (that gave intelligence which way ſhe was gone) made after her, and overtook her neer <hi>Sutton,</hi> and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118450:9"/>
had her into the Inne at <hi>Sutton,</hi> and up into a room, ſhe being then and at the time of her being apprehended in a great trembling and ſhaking, and ſo continued, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a while Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> and the other man bringing back the Maid towards <hi>Sarum,</hi> upon the way between <hi>Sutton</hi> and <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> the Maid did confeſſe and acknowledge all the tranſactions and paſſages between the Witch and her, as are related before: And when the Maid was brought to <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> in the Inne at night, ſhe alſo confeſſed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract ſhe had made with the Devill, as is before related, and ſaid ſhe had received a peece of Silver of the Devill, which ſhe ſhewed and delivered to Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> which is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Ten pence half-penny, and the two Pins which the Witch ſtuck on her head, ſhe alſo delivered to him, which he took of her and threw them into the fire, and preſently took the Money out of the fire again, but found not the Pins; and this was about twelve of the clock at night: And the Maid then ſaid upon delivery of the ſaid Money and Pins, that ſhe ſhould be troubled, for that the Devil had promiſed her that ſhe ſhould never be troubled as long as ſhe kept it ſecret, and now having revealed it, ſhe feared ſhe ſhould be troubled: And about one hour after, the Maid ſitting by the fire, upon a ſudden fell into a trance, and cryed out ſhe ſhould be thrown into the fire; and upon that, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> with the reſt that were preſent with her, held her as faſt as they could, yet could hardly keep her out of the fire; and when the Trance was leaving her, the man that went along with Mr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> cryed out to him, and bid him look there, poynting behinde the Maid, and Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> looking (as he conceived) he ſaw a black ſhade goe from her, and then ſhe coming to her ſelfe, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> with her and the reſt went to prayers, and the Maid ſeemed to have ſuch a carriage in prayer as if ſhee minded it, and prayed fervently, holding faſt about Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s leg, and as they were concluding their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>William Atwood</hi> called to the Maid, and asked her what it was that ſhe had thrown into the fire, and ſhe ſaid, it was ſomething that the Devil had given her to throw upon Mr. <hi>Chandler:</hi> And after prayers were ended, the Maid ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118450:10"/>
from her knees, was not able to goe, and then ſaid, That baſe and plaguy Witch Mris. <hi>Boddenham</hi> hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched me; and afterwards the Maid would cry out, and ſay that the Devill, the Witch, and the five ragged Boyes did appeare before her as they formerly had done when ſhe was at the Witches houſe: And about two of the clock at night, the Maid found her ſelf very ſleepy, &amp; ſaid, Pray God bleſſe me, I wiſh it may be for my good, I am very ſleepy: whereupon Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> perſwaded her to lie upon the Truckle bed, which ſhe did, and then Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> lay down on the high bed, leaving the ſervants of the houſe with <hi>William Atwood</hi> by the fire ſide; and ſhortly after hearing a great noyſe, and a groaning, Mr. <hi>Chandler</hi> found the Maid in a great agony, and much perplexed, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he himſelf, <hi>William Atwood,</hi> and the Servants of the houſe held her as much and as faſt as they could, yet ſhe was taken from them, and thoſe parts which were hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by them were thrown from them upon the floore, onely her feet which were not holden continued upon the bed, but the head and the reſt thrown down, and all the while making a hideous noyſe, with skrieking and crying out, in an agony ſhe continued about one quarter of an hour; and then about four of the clock the ſame night ſhe was taken again, in the ſame manner, but onely the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then in the room were able to hold her, and ſhe was not thrown away from them as before; and about day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break the Maid was taken with another terrible fit, and continued in the ſame about one quarter of an hour, but Mr. <hi>Chandler, William Atwood,</hi> and the Servants in the houſe could hardly keep her from tearing her ſelfe: And when the day appeared, <hi>and the night was paſt;</hi> they brought the Maid to <hi>Sarum,</hi> and being examined before <hi>Edw. Tucker</hi> Eſq; one of the Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> ſhe was committed on ſuſpicion of the poyſon pretended to be provided for her Miſtris, as before, and the Witch alſo apprehended, and both put into priſon, where the Maid remained about three weeks till the Aſſiſes, and was conſtantly taken with violent fits, as ſtrange, as ſtrong, not parallel to any fits that ever any perſon was known to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:118450:10"/>
have naturally, and ſo ſtrong in them, that ſometimes ſix men, ſometimes more could not keep her from being hurryed from them, although holding her at the greateſt advantage that poſſibly they could take her, keeping her down on a low bed, lying on the ſame, and every man holding a particular part of her body: ſo violent were her fits, and ſo ſtrong was the motion of her body in them. Theſe fits were alſo as frequent as violent, ſhe having not for the moſt part one quarter of an hours reſpite from tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them, and they continuing halfe an hour, ſometimes an hour and more, and in this ſad condition ſhe continued ſometimes two hours; and ſo, many dayes together: And the Monday morning following I comming to <hi>Sarum,</hi> where there was a great rumour about the City of a Witch that was found out, that had bewitched a Maid, and they both were in priſon, and that the Maid was often troubled with ſuch ſtrange fits that drew both pity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration from the beholders, through the perſwaſion of ſome friends I accompanyed them to the priſon, and when I came into the Chamber where ſhe lay, ſhe was then in her fit, and ſo had been half an hour before I came, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued there one hour and half, and all that while her fit ſeiſed on her, ſhe lying on a low bed in the midſt of a Chamber, and ſeverall compaſſing her, holding her down: The nature of her fits I am unable to demonſtrate by my pen, onely thus far, they ſuddenly ſeiſed on her, and would cauſe an exceeding trembling in all the members of her body, cauſing her to tear her ſelf unleſſe held, and ſhe was ſo ſtrong in them, that two men could not hold one arm, but many times would be pulled from them, ſhe miſerably groaning and skrieking, being deprived of her ſpeech and ſight, and many times ſhe grinded her teeth, and ſweat in her fits continually, conſtantly in motion, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tear her ſelf, and when her fits were taking their leave of her, ſhe uſually had an exceeding trembling, <hi>and a little repoſed frame</hi> for two or three minutes before her violent hurryings would ceaſe: This being the firſt time I ſaw her, and beholding ſo ſad a ſpectacle, I could not but pity her, and by enquiry of other beholders, I underſtood

ſhe was ſenſible of what was ſaid in her preſence during her fits many times, though ſhe was not able to ſpeak her ſelf, (as ſhe ſaid between her fits) and did deſire the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all ſuch as came to her, to ſeek God on her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half: but there being no Miniſter then in the room, wee our ſelves went to ſeek God for her, and after wee had concluded our prayers, the Maid continuing in her fits not able to ſpeak or diſcourſe, I then left her for ſome time, afterwards went (being accompanyed with a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude) into the room where the Witch was, where ſhe ſate neer the fire in the midſt of a room, with many ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and ſhe in a very ſenſeleſſe idle manner and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them, and now and then curſing them if they uſed any diſtaſtefull words to her; I finding others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with her, after them began to propound ſome queſtions unto her, and asked her whether ſhe was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her miſerable condition? ſhe anſwered, I am not beſide my ſenſes. I told her, I did not mean, whether or no ſhe had loſt the common reaſon (all men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men naturally (more or leſſe) had) by a frenzy, madneſſe, or the like; but I told her I meant in reſpect of her ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all condition, whether ſhe was ſenſible of her damnable eſtate by nature, and the guilt ſhe had contracted on her ſelf by reaſon of her wicked living, and the vile and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable practiſes ſhe had (as it was to be feared) uſed, and whether ſhe had any minde or deſire to be ſaved? ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Yes, from the Jury; I replyed, But have you any minde to be ſaved from Hell?

Mr. <hi>Connant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stickland,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> or any Miniſter come to me to teach me, and to pray for me, but I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved never to hear our Miniſter of <hi>Fiſherton</hi> more, if I am releaſed, but I know I ſhall never be, but hanged I will warrant you; and I wiſh you would now teach me, and I will learn; pray with me and I will with you. <hi>Q.</hi> Can you pray for your ſelf, and doe you make it your conſtant buſineſſe to beg guidance and aſſiſtance from God, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in the whole courſe of your life, and daily return him prayſe and thanks for the mercies you receive? <hi>A.</hi> I can ſay a great many good prayers, and I ſay them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly; I doe alwayes ſay the <hi>Creed</hi> forward and backward every night, and other good Prayers that I finde in my Book.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more ſuch queſtions I propounded to her, ſhe anſwered me in ſuch manner as aboveſaid.</p>
            <p>Before I had ended my diſcourſe with the Witch, one came to me, and told me that the Maid was now out of her fits, and deſired to ſpeak with me; upon which I went to the Maid again, where I found her freed from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tormenting of her body; who ſitting up, deſired to diſcourſe with me; upon which I propounded theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How doe you apprehend your owne ſtate and condition to be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Oh very damnable, very wretched; this hand of mine writ my name in the Devils book, this finger of mine was pricked, here is yet the hole that was made, and with my blood I wrote my own Damnation, and have cut my ſelf off from Heaven and Eternall life; the Devill came, oh! in a terrible ſhape to me, entred within me, and there he lies, ſwelling in my body, gnawing at my heart, tearing my bowels within me, and there is no hopes, but one time or other will tear me all in pieces; had I not been held, I had been in hell, the Devil never leaves but tels me ſo; I ſee him alſo now ſtanding on the top of the houſe, looking on me, and now and then he ſtrives to get me from the people, and I think I were as good goe with him, for then I ſhall be at better eaſe and quiet; I am not able to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118450:12"/>
bear his beating and tearing me, he will kill me, there is no hope, I can ſcarce breath already, he will torment me as long as I am here, and will carry away my ſoul, hee tels me ſo, and I muſt goe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quſt</hi> Doe you not know ſalvation is to be had for the worſt of ſinners, if they are willing to be ſaved? greatneſſe of ſin cuts not off mercy, if any have a minde to be ſaved; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> voluntarily conſulted with familiar Spirits, yet had mercy; Chriſt himſelf when he was in the world made it much of his work to diſpoſſeſſe evill and wicked Spirits, he croſſed the Sea once on purpoſe, and all the work he did, was to diſpoſſeſſe one poſſeſſed, and lodged among the tombes; your caſe is not worſe then theirs, for yours was a forced act, theirs voluntary, you may have ſalvation; are you but ſenſible of the diſhonor you have done to God, and have a minde to break off your league with the Devill, and would have ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Oh, my act was willingly done as well as theirs; the Witch perſwaded me indeed, but I freely conſented, yet I doe heartily deſire ſalvation with my whole ſoul; Oh, what would I doe to be freed from hell! any thing in the world would I doe if I might for all this be ſaved; ſure I have deſerved hell, but if God would have mercy on me, I doe with my heart deſire it, and I would beg all the world to bleſſe God for it: Oh the Devils torments! how can I be ſaved, when it was my own act to ſell my ſelfe into the hands of the Devill! I cannot have one hours reſt, and long I cannot be in this condition, the Devil in a while will have me, doe what I can for my life, I ſhall not be able to help my ſelf, I perceive he is too ſtrong for me, and will get the maſterdome of me at laſt: Oh this baſe Witch, this wicked damnable woman, that ſhould make me murther my own ſoul, and would have carried me along with her into hell! Oh how ſhall I abide her company, it would be my death to ſee her, I was well enough before I ſaw her; no indeed, I was an ignorant wicked creature, and ſhould then have gone to hell, but yet I was not in ſuch torments; not one man or woman in the world knows my pain how great it is, but I hope
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118450:12"/>
this ſhall be the worſt of my miſery; But how can I hope ſo that deſerve hell, and the Devill is within me, and if any thing at the preſent would give me eaſe, it muſt bee the burning of the Witches Cat and Dog, for then I know and am ſure that the Devill will leave me, and goe and torment the Witch. But a while I was perſwading her that it was but a fancy, and a cure of the Devils own ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not a lawfull cure; ſhe then fell into another vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent fit, and the night approaching, I left her, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my occaſions that called me thither, and it was not in my thoughts to return to the priſon; but on the next day being Tueſday, as I was going in the ſtreet, a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman altogether unknown to my ſelf, met me, and told me that the Witch in priſon earneſtly deſired to ſpeak with me, and if I would come to her, ſhe would reveal that to me which ſhe was reſolved to keep ſecret from all the world beſides. And alſo that the Maid did wiſh for my company, and did deſire, if any knew me, to finde me forth if they could, and perſwade me to come to her. Whereupon, I did goe to the priſon, and when I came, found her in one of her former fits, not able to ſpeak or ſee any man, lying foaming, raving, groaning, skrieking, trembling in an unheard of manner, impoſſible to be related ſo exactly as it deſerves for the novelty; in which condition ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained all the time I was there, which was about one hour and half, and had been in that fit halfe an hour before I came; in which time, the violence thereof had wearied Six men that held her; and ſuch had been her condition all that night before, having not one quarter of an hours reſpit between her fits.</p>
            <p>Upon ſerious conſideration of which, it was thought, that in all humane probabilities 'twas impoſſible for her body and ſoul long to keep together; and by her words there was ſome ground of hope that ſhe had not quite ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away mercy, but that mercy might be obtained for her: The reſult of our thoughts that were then preſent (being many) was, to ſpend that afternoon in ſeeking God for her; having a great many there in the preſence, and alſo one Mr. <hi>Allena</hi> Priſoner, very well gifted in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118450:13"/>
and ſome knowledge concerning the nature of this wicked Art: I (for the preſent) departed, and ſaw not the Witch, but in the afternoon came to the priſon again, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout One of the clock; and when I came, the Maid was in her fits, in ſuch manner as formerly, and was not able to ſpeak, being by the violent hurryings of her body (quite) almoſt wearyed, which were ſo ſtrong, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible any naturall ſtrength could ſupport her long.</p>
            <p>Before we began our Exerciſe, the Maid was ſet up in a Chair, and four or five men endevoured to hold her in it; but ſhe got out of it notwithſtanding their endevours, and tore the Chair in pieces, and being hurryed halfe way to the end of the room, they were ſcarce able to recover her to the bed, that ſo laying her along they might have the advantage of holding her, but at laſt by very much ſtrength they got her down, and ſo had ſuch advantage an they held her; at which time there came into my thoughts a Story which I had long before read in Mr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s <hi>Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Witchcraft:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That one way of Diſcovery was, to bring the Suſpected party into the Afflicteds preſence; upon which I deſired that the Witch might be in the room that afternoon, while we were ſeeking God for mercy on the behalf of the Maid; I had my deſire granted, and authority to bring them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and ſo the Witch was brought up into the Maids Chamber, but unknown to the Maid, ſhe lying this while under moſt grievous hurryings and tortures of body; and as the Witch came into the roome, divers ſtood between the Maid and the dore that they could not ſee each other; at the very inſtant of time as the Witch ſet one foot within the room the Maid gave a moſt hideous glance with her eyes, and ſhut them preſently after, and fell aſleep in a moment, before it could be ſpoken almoſt. there were at that time in the room ſome women that were friends to the Maids, that had taken up a reſolution to fall foully on the Witch and get ſome blood from her; for prevention of which I ſtood by the Witch to ſave her, ſhe being very much afraid, and crying out, The wicked people will ſcratch and tear me: Now to inſinuate into
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118450:13"/>
her, I began to enter into diſcourſe with her, and ſaid to her as followeth: Mris. <hi>Boddenham,</hi> you ſee here is a Maid in a very ſad condition, and thus ſhe hath been manydayes; while I was thus ſpeaking, ſhee broke forth into bitter ſpeeches againſt the Maid; ſaying, Ah Whore! ah Devil! ſhe hath belyed me, and the Devils will tear her for it, I will warrant you. I replyed to her, Mris. <hi>Boddenham,</hi> the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe now is to know if you can preſcribe any thing that can cure her, you have formerly cured divers (many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay) that have been in the like condition; Pray pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a cure likewiſe for this Maid. She anſwered, I have cured hundreds, and beleeve can cure this Maid alſo, if you will let me alone with her; but we ſuffered her not to meddle with her, but deſired her to preſcribe what means ſhe uſed in the ſame caſe: To which ſhe replyed, Nothing but good prayers, and alſo hanging ſomething about her neck. And being asked what it was ſhe hung about the neck? ſhe anſwered, a Spell written in a peece of paper: And heing demanded to whom ſhe did pray for cure? ſhe anſwered, to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he is the beſt and fortunateſt of all the Planets, and in ſuch a caſe as this we always pray to the Planet <hi>Jupiter.</hi> I then told her (after a long diſcourſe of the like nature) that the buſineſſe that we had her here for, was, to the intent, that ſince the purpoſe of our hearts here preſent was to call on God, and wait on him at the throne of grace that afternoon, to ſhew mercy to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Maid, it being a lawfull way, and that which hath been a means formerly of prevailing with God in the like nature; and the way that Chriſt taught his Diſciples, when they would learn to caſte out Devils, telling them that it was to be done by Faſting and prayer; therefore we would know of her whether ſhe would willingly joyne with us? We told her our prayers ſhould be, that God would caſt an eye of pity on the Maid, and releaſe her from her miſery; that hee would acquit the Innocent, diſcover the Guilty, and bring to light the hidden and abominable works of darkneſſe: She anſwered, Yes, ſhee would joyn in prayer with us.</p>
            <p>And when we had concluded our ſeekings of God, it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118450:14"/>
was deſired that the Maid might be awaked, for that ſhe had ſlept ever ſince Mris. <hi>Boddenham</hi> the Witch came into the roome, which was almoſt three hours, and had not been known to ſleep, or take any reſt in many dayes and nights before; and I did apparently ſee, that the Maid was, and is the better at eaſe for the Witches preſence: The Witch preſently took hold about me, crying out, Oh pray by no means doe you awake the Maid; for if ſhe ſhould awake, I ſhould then be torn in pieces, and the Devill would fetch me away bodily; yet, notwithſtanding her cryings out and perſwadings to the contrary, I deſired the people to awake her; and they tryed what they could, ſtopt her breath, put things up into her noſtrils, took her from lying along, and held her upright, and ſtruck her extreamly; yet all the means we poſſibly could uſe did not awake her; which was a great admiration to all ſpectators, that ſhe could not take any reſt for many dayes and nights before, and ſhould be in ſuch violent fits untill the Witch came into the room, and then ſhe ſhould be on a ſudden ſo eaſed of her torments and pain, and fall aſleep that no art or means could awake her. I then deſired the Witch to uſe what means ſhe could to awake her, which ſhe was very loath to doe, ſaying, The Maid hath an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, and this ſleep would make her well, yet we made her to try to awake her: The Witch onely took her by the hand, but trembled extreamly, and called the Maid by her name, Awake, Awake; and that was the moſt we could make her doe; but ſtill begging and deſiring the people not to awake her: We ſeeing there was no remedy or means to awake her, (for my intention was to have cauſed them to have diſcourſed together, thinking by their diſcourſe ſomething might be found out to prove the ſuſpected a Witch, and to convict her the more evidently) I cauſed the Witch to goe forth of the Chamber, but ſhe would not goe unleſſe I went along with her, for ſhe then ſaid, I ſhould awake the Maid, and then ſhe ſhould be torn in pieces; but I would not yeeld to goe along with the Witch, but was reſolved to ſee the Maid awake out of her ſleep; but when (partly by force and partly by entreaty)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118450:14"/>
we had gotten the Witch out of the Chamber downe the ſtairs, as ſoon as ever ſhe was gone from under that roof where the Maid was, into the priſon-houſe where ſhe uſed to reſide, the Maid began immediately to awake, in ſuch an orderly manner, as if ſhe had been at the ſweeteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſt that poſſibly could be, and afterward having recovered her ſenſes both to look abroad and ſpeak, ſhe ſaid, I bleſſe God the Devill went away from me but even now, and to my owne thinking I have been in ſo ſweet a ſleep as ever I had in my life, and to my apprehenſion was in the moſt ſumptuous pleaſant place that ever my eyes beheld, where all the moſt pleaſant ſights of flowers and delights are: Oh how ſorry am I that I ſlept no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger! yet bleſſed be God I am now at eaſe, the Devill went forth of my ſtomach even now; indeed he made my body tremble when he went out, but that was the worſt he did to me; he is now departed, he hath ſtood all this day on the top of the houſe, in the likeneſſe of a Lyon, with fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming eyes, but he is now likewiſe gone from thence, and I ſee him no where, and I hope never to be vexed more: Indeed I have deſerved to be torn in pieces by him, but my Lord Juſus Chriſt in mercy hath now freed me, and I am verily perſwaded ſhall not be tormented more, the hour of mercy is now come; I have indeed had mercy in being kept out of hell, but now I have more mercy to be freed from my pain; 'tis a wonder to me, I ſhould be ſo well in ſo ſhort a time, that had more pains on me then ever I could, or ſhall be able to expreſſe: My body is now free from pain, my minde is now quieted, ſure God hath heard your prayers for me, the Lord hath ſtirred up ſome people to call on God for my ſalvation, and I truſt he hath heard them; ſure I ſhall never in the leaſt requite you all for your love, I hope God will likewiſe ſhew you all the ſame mercy, as (bleſſed be the Lord) I am this hour made partaker of. I now begin to be hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and I thank the Lord I have an appetite to my food, I would now eat any thing, and if you would help mee upon my feet, I am confident the Lord would enable me of my ſelf to goe about the Chamber: which ſhe did doe,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118450:15"/>
and ſaid, the greateſt pain ſhe felt was the bruiſings of her body, by reaſon of the peoples forcible holding her, and a ſwimming in her head by reaſon of the long diſtractions of her minde ſhe had lain under, but ſaid, Bleſſed be the Lord it is ſo well as it is with me, I am reſolved to ſerve this God that ſhewed mee this mercy; I will hereafter heedfully live, and will for ever avoyd ſuch baſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as this Witch, and for her I will never have any thing to doe with, while I live; yet I bleſſe God, ſhe can doe me no harm, ſhe hath done the worſt ſhe can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; the Devill hath told me many times, if I would keep counſell I ſhould not be tormented, but I will not hearken to him, I will ſpeak the truth, though it be my death, for I have diſhonoured God too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.</p>
            <p>Many more ſuch like expreſſions ſhe uſed, but are too many to be enumerated.</p>
            <p>The night being come, we returned prayſe to God for his ſeaſonable deliverance of the Maid, and becauſe he had mercifully and ſuddenly given a gracious hearing to our prayers: In this time I deſired ſome to eye the perſon and carriage of the Witch, that was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-houſe ſome diſtance from the Maid: Who informed me, that as ſoon as ever the Maid awaked, and began to be at eaſe, the Witch began to be tormented, and to roar and cry out, Oh the Devill, the Devill, the Devill will tear me in pieces, running from one corner of the room to the other, ſhaking and ratling her fetters, ſtriking with a ſtick in her hand thoſe that were in the room, Priſoners and others; crying out, and curſing the Maid, ſaying, Oh this Whore will be the death of me, ſhe will hang me, and I ſhall be killed and torn in pieces: And ſhe was in ſuch an hideous rage, that the people were fearfull to ſtay neer her: I being made acquainted that ſhe was very importunate to ſpeak with me, I left the Maid, and was going away, but I at a diſtance called to her, having then no great minde to come very neer her, ſhe being in ſuch a furious condition, and to ſatisfie her, told her that the Maid was now very well, and I make no doubt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118450:15"/>
but ſhe would in a while be releaſed: She replyed, Yes, at the gallows, no where elſe, for I am ſure I ſhall be hanged; and ſaid to me, For your part, I ſee you are a knowing man; and if you will come to me to morrow morning, when I may ſpeak privately with you, I will tell you all my Art: I told her, I would hearken to any thing ſhe would tell me, and would come to her the next morning.</p>
            <p>The next day, being Wedneſday, in the morning I went to the priſon, where I found the Maid then very well freed from her former fits, and was informed, had been all that night before freed from them, and had took her reſt very well.</p>
            <p>I then went to the Witch, who deſired me to go into a room by my ſelf with her, which I did, and ſhe ſhut the dore after we were in; ſhe then would have called for ſome beer to drink to me, but I would not permit her, telling her, I was reſolved not to drink; ſhe then made me ſit down by her, and ſhe took a peece of ſilver, I think it was a Shilling, and offered it to me, telling me I muſt take that peece of ſilver of her, if I intended to learn any thing of her: I replyed, I had no need of a ſhilling, and would not take it, for I was able to give her a ſhilling; ſaid ſhe, Give me one then, and that will be as well: I replyed, Not ſo neither, you doe not want one. Shee then fell a curſing and ſwearing that I muſt take that ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of her, otherwiſe ſhe could not teach me any thing: I replyed, Tell me what you can doe firſt, happily I can doe already what you can, if not, I may learn it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: She replyed, Thou muſt keep my counſell, or elſe all will doe thee no good; and thou muſt now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to me, that thou wilt not come to undermine me, to undoe me: I anſwered, you need not think ſo, for you ſee I am come into a room privately, that none elſe might know what you teach me. She then ſaid, ſhee could cure Diſeaſes by Charms and Spels, and had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that would doe ſo likewiſe; and they could cure ſuch Diſeaſes as the beſt Doctors could not doe; ſhe could diſcover ſtolen goods, and ſhew any one the Theef
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118450:16"/>
that had them, in a glaſſe; and that ſhe could raiſe Spirits by reading in her Books.</p>
            <p>I asked her, what Books ſhe had, and where ſhe had them? She anſwered, ſhe had a great many notable books, and ſhe had moſt part of them of Dr. <hi>Johnſon;</hi> and withal told me, if I would keep them ſecret, ſhe would let mee have them, if I would accept of them: I told her Yes, ſhe ſhould let me have what books ſhe would, and I ſhould be very thankfull to her for them; but deſired her to let me ſee the red Book that the Maid ſet her hand to, that was written half over with blood (being the names of Witches that had liſted themſelves under the Devils command.) She replyed, I cannot help you to that book, for <hi>Withers</hi> hath that, a man that lives in <hi>Hampſhire.</hi> But then ſaid I too her, Pray let me have what Books you can help me to: So ſhe ſent her Husband with me to her houſe, with one man more, to deliver mee her Books: And when I had them, I left them with a Gentleman in <hi>Sarum</hi> to keep them ſafe, that they might be brought to the fight of the Judges at the Aſſiſes. I then went to the Witch, and told her, that the Books I had were nothing concerning her art; I would willingly have that Book that did raiſe the Spirits: Ah! (ſaith ſhe) that is ſafe enough from my Hu<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>band, that is a book of Charms, he is hid ſafe, but that thou ſhalt have it, if I could have my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to goe home, for that book is worth thouſands of other books, and can doe more; I will ſhew the uſe of him, and what Charm thou ſhalt uſe to finde out a 1000 <hi>l.</hi> that lies hid in the North part of <hi>Wilton</hi> Garden, being hid by the old Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> Father to the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed, and 'tis not to be found but by a Charm: But for the preſent I could not have her liberty to goe for it, ſo that I had it not.</p>
            <p>And ſhe then alſo told me that ſhe had been a Servant to Dr. <hi>Lambe,</hi> and the occaſion ſhe came to live with him, ſhe ſaid was, that ſhe lived with a Lady in <hi>London,</hi> who was a Patient many times to him, and ſent her often in buſineſſe to him, and in particular, ſhe went to know what death King <hi>James</hi> ſhould die; and the Doctor told
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118450:16"/>
her what death, and withall ſaid that none of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould come to a natural death; and ſhe ſaid ſhe then ſaw ſo many curious ſights, and pleaſant things, that ſhe had a minde to be his Servant, and learn ſome of the art; and Dr. <hi>Lambe</hi> ſeeing her very docile, took her to be his Servant; and ſhe reading in ſome of his Books, with his help learnt her Art, by which ſhe ſaid ſhe had gotten many a penny, and done hundreds of people good, and no body ever gave her an ill word for all her paines, but alwayes called her Mris. <hi>Boddenham,</hi> and was never accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Witch but by reaſon of this wicked Maid now in priſon, and then fell a curſing of and reviling at the Maid extremely.</p>
            <p>Having ſpent out this forenoon likewiſe, I then left the priſon, and departed; and heard no more of any thing concerning the Witch or the Maid, onely that the Maid remained well, and that the Witch would tell thoſe ſhee eſteemed her friends, that ſurely ſhe did beleeve that I was a Witch, and did think I ſhould doe many notable things with her books.</p>
            <p>And about three weeks after I received a Letter from <hi>Edw. Tucker</hi> and <hi>Francis Swanton</hi> Eſq; two Juſtices of the Peace, to be at the Aſſiſe to proſecute againſt the Witch, who withall in their Letter acquainted me that the Maid was now troubled as formerly, and deſired me to come to <hi>Sarum</hi> again, to ſee if I could diſcover any thing more of the Witches practiſe, and I came on the Friday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tueſday night in which the Maid began to relapſe into her former fits, and was tormented as formerly; and at night about eleven or twelve of the clock, the Maid was miſerably tormented, crying out, the Devill would carry her away before the morning; and in ſhort time after ſhe was pulled from thoſe that held her, and the people in the room run away for fear: The Maid being thrown from the low bed whereon ſhe lay, to the top of the high bed, and her cloaths torne off her back, and a piece of her skin torn away, the Candle in the room ſtanding on a Table, was thrown downe, and put out; at which time, there being a little Boy that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt

aſleep, but with this noyſe being frighted, had not power, with the reſt, to goe out of the room, ſtayed there, and ſaw a Spirit in the likeneſſe of a great black man, with no head, in the room ſcuffling with the Maid, and took her and ſet her into a Chair, and told her that ſhee muſt goe with him, he was come for her ſoul, ſhe had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to him: But the Maid anſwered, that her ſoul was none of her owne to give, and he had already got her blood, but as for her ſoul he ſhould never have; and after a while tumbling and throwing about of the Maid, it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed away.</p>
            <p>It came into ſome of our thoughts that were afrighted out of the Maids Chamber, to goe into the Witches room to ſee whether ſhe was aſleep, and when they came, they found her running about the room with her cloaths off, and her iron fetters about her legs, and asked her what was the reaſon ſhee was not in her bed aſleep at this time of the night, and why ſhe run about the room? The Witch anſwered, I cannot keep my bed, nor lie in it at quiet, but am pulled forth by violence. They asked her the reaſon why? She replyed, Pray what is the matter in your Chamber: who being not willing to diſcover the truth ſaid, Nothing, but a Childe is not wel, that we are troubled with. The Witch replyed, Do you not lie to me? for I know what is the matter as well as your ſelves. The Witch ſate then down by her bed ſide, and there curſing and banning the people, they left her, and went again to the Maid, where they ſtayed all that night, holding the Maid from miſchieving her ſelf in her fits.</p>
            <p>That the Witch might yet more evidently be diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Melier Damer, Alice Cleverly, Grace Stockes,</hi> and other Women, ſearched the Witch in the Gaol, and they delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on their oaths at the Aſſiſes, that they found on her ſhoulder a certain mark or Teat, about the length and bigneſſe of the Niple of a Womans breaſt, and hollow and ſoft as a Niple, with a hole on the top of it: And ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching further, they likewiſe found in her ſecret place ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Teat, ſoft, and like the former on her ſhoulder: And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118450:17"/>
afterward, when the Witch was on her tryall, as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were giving in this their Evidence, they were ordered to look on that Teat again on her ſhoulder, as ſhe ſtood at the Bar, who did, and they then ſaid, that the Teat was more dryer then, and ſomething leſſe then it was before, and did ſeem not to be ſo freſhly pulled and ſucked as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>After which time, I coming to the priſon, went to the Maid, who was at the preſent under ſome inward conflict and horror of conſcience, who complained very much of her damnable condition, and ſaid, there was now no hope of her ſalvation, for the Devill was returned again to her, and had got faſter hold of her then ever; and alſo ſaid, My hope is now quite gone, in vain is it for me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect ſalvation: How can God ſave me? I know he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, and the worſt is, He will not; and it cannot be long before the Devill will tear me in pieces.</p>
            <p>I then told her the occaſion of her preſent trouble might be in giving way to ſome ſuggeſtions of Satan. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, I doe as little as I can: But he tels 'me I ſhall neer be at quiet, untill I get my name blotted out of the Red book, that the Witch made me ſet, when I ſealed with my blood to be a ſlave all the dayes of my life to <hi>Lucifer;</hi> and if I could have that peece of ſilver I had at that time given me, to give again to the Devill, I ſhould then be at reſt: But after a while I perſwaded her not to harbour any ſuch fancies within her, for that they were the meer ſuggeſtions of Satan; which ſhe was at laſt brought to beleeve: ſhe in a ſhort time after began to fall into her former fits, but not ſo violent as the former were: But after it was over, I asked the Maid whether ſhe was willing the Witch ſhould be brought into her Chamber, (knowing that the other time it was a means of her eaſe) to which ſhe would not conſent for ſome time: At laſt I perſwaded her to let her come and they ſhould talk together.</p>
            <p>Then I went to the Witch to bring her; and when I came to her, ſhe pretended ſhe did not remember me; for I heard ſhe was prejudiced againſt me at this ſecond coming; for that ſome had perſwaded her that I did but enſnare
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118450:18"/>
her, and did what I could onely to diſcover her; ſo that I could not without much perſwaſion cauſe her to own any acquaintance with me.</p>
            <p>I asked her how ſhe did? who replyed, Very naught, not well; and the Maid and I had undone her, for ſhee ſhould be hanged: I perſwaded her to goe to the Maid, and talk with her: But ſhe replyed, Ah Whore! Ah Raſcall! I will ſee her in hell firſt, I will never ſee her more, ſhe hath undone me, by raiſing theſe reports of mee that am an honeſt Woman; 'twill break my Husbands heart, he grieves to ſee me in theſe Irons: I did once live in good faſhion, and did not lie as now I doe; I am ſick in my ſtomach, I am tormented that I cannot ſleep at night, and am almoſt torne in pieces; and being not well, I will not goe forth without the dore this day.</p>
            <p>I ſeeing I could not perſwade her, went to the Maid, and perſwaded her to come into the preſence of the Witch; and after many entreaties I perſwaded her to go to her, which ſhe did: But being come into the room, with multitudes of people preſſing in along with her; (the Witch was in a very ſpacious upper room, that was capacious enough to hold 300 people) ſo ſoon as ever the Witch ſaw the Maid, ſhe ran skrieking and crying out from the Maid to the further ſide of the room, where a bed ſtood, and fell down, ſhe fell on her knees, and went to creep under the bed, but the people pull'd her out again, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe cryed out exceedingly, that there was not any tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to her; maliciouſly-curſing thoſe that held her, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them with her ſtick, and ſcratching and biting them, making a moſt hideous noyſe; words cannot expreſſe the manner of it; crying out, Have out of my ſight this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh Maid, I ſhall be torne in pieces.</p>
            <p>I went to perſwade her to be quiet, telling her, none ſhall doe her any harm. She anſwered, Oh! the Devill will tear me if I ſee her: And conſtantly ſhe kept crying out and roaring. I thought that in half an hour ſhee would be tyred out, making ſuch a noyſe, and then ſhee muſt of neceſſity be ſilent: But all the while the Maid
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:118450:18"/>
was there, ſhe kept ſuch a roaring and hideous noyſe, which was almoſt an hour: Now the Maid looking on her, ſeeing her in ſuch a torment, was at eaſe; and the Maids eaſe was her trouble.</p>
            <p>I being in the preſence of the Witch this while, had it come into my thoughts, that Mr. <hi>Holland</hi> Mr. <hi>Tucker</hi>'s Clerk, had told me the morning before, that he being a day or two before in the priſon with others, in company with the Witch, he ſaw about her neck a green ſilk ſtring, with ſomething tyed at the end of it, like a little bag, hanging down her ſtomach: Hee asked her, What was that about her neck? She replyed, It was a thing that ſhe could doe many things with; and if he would give her but half a dozen of Ale, ſhee would make a toad ſpring out of it: The remembrance of which, cauſed me to obſerve if I could ſee any ſuch thing about her neck, which I did; I then deſired a Gentleman that ſtood by me to endevour the ſecret getting it away from her; and to that end ſome kept a great diſturbance, pulling about her: Which while they were ſo doing, the Gentleman got away the bag and ſtring about her neck; which ſhe felt gone immediately: She then roared and cryed out much more then before; ſaying, Now ſhee was undone, her jewell was taken from her, her life was loſt; now there was no hope but that ſhe ſhould be hanged.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing there was no remedy, or poſſibility of pacify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, we all left her in her rage, and the Maid went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to her own Chamber; So her being in the preſence of the Witch, was a ſecond time of freeing her from her torments.</p>
            <p>We then went and opened the bag ſo taken away, that hung to the ſtring about her neck: It was a little ſilk bag, in which there was ſome powder and pieces of white pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with ſeverall ſorts of ſeeds in them; probably ſuch a Charm as ſhe did often uſe: And for the powder, both my ſelf and thoſe that were Phyſitians that ſaw it, could not otherwiſe judge of it, but that it was ſome ſympathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall powder, that ſhould have cauſed ſuch Evidence that came in againſt her, not to have teſtifyed any thing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118450:19"/>
to her: And probably it might be ſuch a powder, in regard of her trouble of loſing it. And Magicians write much of the nature of an herb called <hi>Anacrampferos,</hi> and the hearb <hi>Sowbread</hi> will work love and affection in any party whoſe good will and love they deſire to obtain; and this fooliſh conceit without doubt ſhe had, to think that the wearing ſuch a powder about her neck would have wrought ſuch a love in the Judge and Jury, that the one ſhould not have found her guilty, nor the other condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her.</p>
            <p>But in this, as wel as in the reſt, the Devil deceived her: For the aſſiſes being held at <hi>Sarum</hi> for the County of <hi>Wilts,</hi> the Witch was there arraigned on three ſeveral Bils of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment touching her compact and practiſe of Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft; and found guilty on all three, and ſentence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on her moſt juſtly for ſuch practiſes, by the Lord Chief Baron <hi>Wilde,</hi> then Judge of life and death at that Aſſiſes.</p>
            <p>After that Sentence was paſſed on her, ſhe was brought from the Court to the priſon again; but never valued it, or was much troubled that ſhe was to die.</p>
            <p>In the Evening after her Condemnation, Mr. <hi>Langley</hi> a Grocer of <hi>Sarum,</hi> with others came to the priſon to her, and entring into diſcourſe with her, ſhe began to rail againſt me, and ſaid I had betrayed her and wronged her, and they (to pleaſe her) ſpoke againſt me: Likewiſe, ſhe hearing that, began to be familiar with Mr. <hi>Langley,</hi> and told him that ſhe lived with Dr. <hi>Lambe,</hi> and he taught her to raiſe Spirits, and ſhe told him how people came to learn it: If thoſe that have a deſire to it, doe read in books, and when they come to read further then they can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, then the Devil will appear to them, and ſhew them what they would know; and they doing what he would have them, they may learn to doe what they deſired to do, and he would teach them: And further ſhe did in generall terms confeſſe to him, that ſhe did what the Maid had told of her, and did likewiſe promiſe him her books, but becauſe I did proſecute her, and informed the Judge what ſhe told me, ſhe would not teach me any thing; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:118450:19"/>
(as ſhe ſaid) Mr. <hi>Langley</hi> ſeemed to be a good honeſt man, ſhe would let him have her books, and teach him her Art.</p>
            <p>I went from <hi>Sarum</hi> to <hi>Dorchester</hi> after the Judges to the Aſſiſes, and after I had accompliſhed my buſineſſe I had there I returned to <hi>Sarum</hi> again, to ſpeak with her, and to ſee her executed: She hearing I came from the Judges, and ſome perſons informing her (though without cauſe) I had endevoured for a Repreive for her, ſhe was willing to ſpeak with me.</p>
            <p>The morning before ſhe was to be executed, I went to her; and when I came there, there was onely with her (the dore being ſhut) Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> a Miniſter, who comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her up to bear death Chriſtianly, boldly, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; and after he had brought her to that pitch as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe him ſhe would goe a true penitent to her place of Execution, and to die as a Lamb, he then kneeled down, and read over to her much of the Book of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, and ſhe repeated it after him: I being at the dore, when he had done, ſpoke to him to propound ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, which I told him were very requiſite ſhould be diſcovered: he did goe and ſay ſomething to her, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to me, and told me that ſhe would ſay nothing to it, and that it was not fit ſhe ſhould now be troubled, but to be left to her devotion; he alſo told me that ſhe denyed the things ſhe was condemned for, and that ſhe wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffered death, and did lament extremely, and deſired to die quietly: I replyed to him, God would have more honour by her confeſſion of other Witches, then ſhe can have comfort by a few prayers, and a little ſmoothing up at laſt. I was reſolved to put it home to her, and make her confeſſe what I could of her practiſe, and whom ſhee knew that practiſed ſuch Art; though what ſhe ſaid would not be enough to convict any, yet it would he enough to ſuſpect and examine them. He replyed, he was very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling truth ſhould be diſcovered, and ſo went away. I then told her that this morning was to be the time of her Execution, and there was no hope of any Reprieve, but die ſhe muſt; if any thing moved the Judge to mercy, it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118450:20"/>
would be her confeſſing her faults, and to ſay truth, and to confeſſe other Witches, and to tell what things they had done, that they might be convicted: She anſwered me, If I muſt die this morning, I care not; and ſwore three times one after another, by the name of God, ſhe was prepared to die: And for Confeſſing ſhe ſaid ſhe would never ſay that the Maid told truth, but the Maid belyed her, and the Devil would torment her for it; and as ſhe had dealt with her, ſhe ſaid, ſhe prayed to God that he would deal with her; and for her part, ſhe would never forgive the Maid the wrong ſhe had done her: And further ſaid, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had been put to this ſhame, ſhe would have given Forty pounds for the ſaving her life; but now ſhe would not live if ſhe ſhould, but was reſolved to be hanged, and her earneſt deſire was that ſhe might be buryed under the gallows: And ſhe ſaid, ſhe had made her Will, and given Legacies to many of her friends. But I told her, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band might chooſe whether he would let them have them: ſhe replyed, If he doe not, the Devill ſhall never let him be quiet. She alſo ſaid ſhe had writ a Letter, and put it into her pocket, which was to her Husband, that he ſhould never live in his own houſe more; and that her will was to goe directly to the gallows, and there be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and then brought back into her owne houſe, and there to be ſhrowded, and then to be carryed back to the gallows, and there buryed. Her will was alſo, that the Women that ſhrowded her ſhould goe into her Garden, and gather up all her herbs, ſpoyl all her flowers, and tear up the roots. She alſo was very deſirous for drink, and had not Mr. Underſheriffs prudence been ſuch as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain her from it, ſhe would have died drunk: She ſaid, ſhe would not have any Pſalm ſung, or any prayers for her at the Gallows; but ſhe would have a Pſalm ſung at the Gaol, and immediately ſhe her ſelf began to ſing. I alſo asked her who ſhe knew to be Witches? She ſaid, ſhe knew none but <hi>Withers,</hi> that lived by <hi>Rumſey</hi> in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> he did uſe to make Charms for her; and he did help the Woman that was Owner of the Brick Kill by <hi>Sarum</hi> to a Spell, and ſhe did frequent him for a while; and he could
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118450:20"/>
do the moſt tricks of any one ſhe knew: ſhee did alſo name one or two more that ſhe ſaid was able to do many ſuch things as ſhe could.</p>
            <p>I asked her, whether ſhe had any ground or teſtimny that repentance was wrought in her? She replyed, I hope for all this to be ſaved by my Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: and I defie the Devill; and I am wronged and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, and ſo theſe Rogues and Raſcals ſhall all know, for all this yet; and then ſhe ſwore an oath, I that they ſhould. She then would make a ſhew of ſorrow, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, I have not been in bed theſe three nights, but have been abuſed, and the Maids that were with me laſt night ſtole the money out of my purſe, that I had there to pay for my ſupper, and to buy me ſome drink; and then ſhe would make a noyſe as if ſhe wept; that I my ſelf, and I alſo deſired others to obſerve, but ſhe was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen to let fall a tear; but yet many times ſhe would make ſuch an artificiall noyſe, that one would have thought ſhe wept: And in ſuch diſcourſe ſhe ſpent the morning: And if any did bid her pray, ſhe would ſwear at them, and revile them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Under-ſheriff coming into the priſon to her, told her, She muſt goe along with him to the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She replyed, Be you ready, I am ready, in a jolly manner, and forth ſhe went: But before Mr. Underſheriff came in, I had ſo perſwaded her, that when ſhe came to the place of Execution, ſhe would confeſſe every thing; and in regard ſhe ſhould not be able to ſpeak loud enough, ſhe deſired me to ſtand by her, and ſhe would tell it unto me, and I ſhould ſpeak it out to all the people: Which I told her I would: And ſhe ſaid, ſhe would then tell e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and keep nothing ſecret.</p>
            <p>Afterwards ſhe fell into a rage, and wiſhed for a Knife, ſhe ſaid ſhe would run it into her heart-blood: Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto by ſome, Oh Mris. <hi>Boddenham</hi> you would not offer to doe ſuch wickedneſſe, would you? She ſwore by the name of God, but ſhe would, had ſhe a Knife. She then went forth to the place of her Execution, where a numerous company were ſpectators; and as ſhe went along
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118450:21"/>
towards the gallows, by every houſe ſhe went by, ſhe went with a ſmal piece of ſilver in her hand, calling for Beer, and was very paſſionate when denyed; one of the men that guarded her on the way, told her that Mr. Sheriff would not let her be buryed under the gallows, upon which ſhe railed at the man extremely that told her ſo, and ſaid, ſhe would be buryed there. When ſhe came to the place of execution, ſhe went immediately to goe up the Ladder, but ſhe was pulled back again and reſtrained: I then preſſed her to confeſſe what ſhe promiſed me ſhe would, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe dyed, but ſhe refuſed to ſay any thing. Being asked whether ſhe deſired the prayers of any of the people, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe had as many prayers already as ſhe intended, and deſired to have, but curſed thoſe that detained her from her death, and was importunate to goe up the Ladder, but was reſtrained for a while, to ſee whether ſhe would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe any thing, but would not: they then let her goe up the Ladder, and when the rope was about her neck, ſhe went to turn her ſelf off, but the Executioner ſtayed her, and deſired her to forgive him: She replyed, Forgive thee? A pox on thee, turn me off; which were the laſt words ſhe ſpake: She was never heard all the while ſhe was at the place of Execution to pray one word, or deſire any others to pray for her, but the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thus you have her wicked life, her wofull death. Thoſe that forſake God in their lives, ſhall be forſaken of him in their deaths.</p>

            <p>HIſtory often ſpeaks, and common obſervation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that Bees gather excellent honey out of the bittereſt herbs: So, were we wiſe, we might make good uſe of this foregoing Relation: Wherein we may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the Devill gulls and deceives the ſouls of the Sons of men, He (without doubt) to bring them into ſuch an unhappy league with himſelf, promiſeth them to be no Inferiors to the greateſt in the World. To the Poor hee promiſeth Food; to the Sick, Health; to the Irefull, to be revenged; to the Curious, Knowledge; to the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, Honour; and the Satisfying luſts to the Luſtfull: He makes large promiſes when he means no ſuch thing: Could ever any man at the laſt ſay he was a Gainer by his Contract with Satan? indeed he promiſed <hi>Adam</hi> fair, but the concluſion was a turning out of Paradiſe; he promiſed <hi>Sodome</hi> fair, but the concluſion was Burning: And how many can our experience teſtifie of, that (without doubt) after their league with him, built many Caſtles of Hope in the Air of their Thoughts, of their future happyneſſe; But what a ſad end have they came unto! How many han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and burned! And when they need moſt protection from the Devil, they have been moſt diſappointed by him: Shall any therefore wilfully be deceived by his allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Suppoſe the beſt, That ſuch a ſhamefull end ſhall not betyde them: Yet is there any happyneſſe or any good to be found in the Devils ſervice? Can he procure loſt goods, can he reſtore decayed health, can he ſatisfie a
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118450:22"/>
proud heart, can he content the ambitious minde, can he ſatisfie a fleſhly luſt, can he beſtow on thee and let thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enjoy all the glory of the world; yet he cannot ſave thee from death: can he prolong thy life in the land of the living, he cannot create comfort to thee in the day of Gods wrath: What will you then doe? Indeed your luſts perhaps by him have been ſatisfied, your health by him recovered, your loſt goods by him reſtored, your ambitious minde ſomething for a while quieted: But all this while your ſoul is not ſaved. Conſider how God himſelf pities thee: What will you doe, ſaith the Lord in the day of my Wrath? Intombing your ſouls in the world will not ſhelter you, nor your agreement with Hell and Death cannot relieve you: Beſides, what out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, temporall, forenamed accommodations you have by him, as Health, Wealth, and the like; you give a dearer rate then the moſt chargeable Phyſician in the world would or poſſibly could demand of you for the reſtauration ofyour loſt health; and it is much ſweeter, eaſier, and leſſe charge, to goe ſo long a voyage as to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and there dig for gold and ſilver, accounting all its difficulties, then to have it of the devils ſending or bringing it to us.</p>
            <p>In this ſad foregoing Relation, thou haſt the great and glorious attributes of Gods Juſtice and juſt Judgement, and of his rich Mercy and free grace.</p>
            <p>To demonſtrate the laſt firſt: Friendly Reader, Thou hadſt in this Narration the torments of a poor Maid, ſo fully expreſſed, that in the reading thereof thou mayſt take notice of the goodneſſe of God in her ſupport; ſure I am, no naturall ſtrength could have ſubſiſted under ſuch violent and ſtrong racks, tortures and pangs as did ſeiſe on her for almoſt five weeks: Beſides, a Maid ſo poorly principled as ſhe was; for as ſhe could not read, ſo ſhee could not anſwer, neither did ſhe know, but was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the Fundamentall grounds of Religion; and beſides, lived profanely, yet in the extremity of her condition, and in the loweſt ebbe of her ſorrows, there was a ground of hope, and expreſſed by her ſelf in ſuch terms as theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:118450:22"/>
Being asked whether ſhe gave way to the Devill, in yeelding to any thing that he ſuggeſted into her thoughts and minde: She anſwered, No: Indeed (ſaith ſhe) the Devill now appears to me from the top of the houſe in a fearfull ſhape, with flaming eyes, and calls to me to come away: But I tell him, I cannot, I am held, and glad I am that I am held, elſe I am afraid I ſhould be carryed away by force. And at any time, when ſhe had a little eaſe from the violent hurryings of her body, ſhe was deſirous to diſcourſe, and ſaid, ſhe would not keep the Devils counſel; The Devil (ſaith ſhe) claims his promiſe, and would have me away, for I have given him my ſoul: But, ſaith ſhe, I know my ſoul is none of mine own to give, Chriſt hath bought it, and his it is, &amp; none of my mine; and though I did ſo wickedly as to promiſe it him through the perſwaſions of a Witch, which I am heartily ſorry for, yet I have not my ſoul in my own cuſtody to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of as I will; and this (ſaith ſhe) I tell him, but it will not ſatisfie him. What ever queſtions ſhe was asked againſt her ſelf between her fits, when ſhe was able to ſpeak, ſhe would freely relate it, though never ſo much againſt her ſelf; replying, I have deſerved death and hell a thouſand times over, and if God ſhew me mercy, ſure I doe not deſerve it, yet I hope God will: I finde (ſaith ſhe) that the Devill is within me, he is got into my ſtomach, and there he lies, and hath broken all my bones, yet I hope to be ſaved at laſt; I know God is mercifull, the Devill had elſe torne my body in pieces, he hath tryed what he can, but God hath yet kept me, and I beleeve he will ſtill for all the Devill and this wicked baſe Woman: And further ſhe ſaid, I heartily deſire the prayers of the Miniſters and all good people, I doe deſire it ſurely with my whole ſoul, for though I am a ſinfull wretch, yet ſure I doe beleeve God will hear their prayers for me. And many other expreſſions ſhe uſed, which are ſet down in the former Narration. I onely relate theſe here, to ſhew the divine ſupport ſhe had in her diſtreſſe.</p>
            <p>And Reader, Hadſt thou ſeen the ſtrength of her ſpirit,

and of her minde in giving in her Evidence, thou wouldſt have beleeved ſhe ſpoke truth: And I think there are none of an unprejudicate opinion, but did beleeve what ſhe then ſaid: She ſometimes in her Accuſation, or rather in her Evidence, accuſed her owne obnoxiouſneſſe, and how guilty ſhe her ſelf was of death and hell: And after ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was paſſed on the Witch, I came to the Maid, and asked her whether ſhe was willing the Witch ſhould be reprieved? She replyed, With all my heart, and glad I ſhould be if any body could prevail for her reprieve; and I doe wiſh ſome body or other would try, if they did think they ſhould not ſin in ſo doing: She then at the ſame time wept exceedingly, and complaining, Oh my madneſſe and my folly! Oh wicked Creature that I am, that ever I ſhould ſin againſt ſo good a God, that hath been ſo mercifull to me in my torments! Surely the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in one of thoſe long nights would have carryed me away, had not God been mercifull to me: How hath Chriſt preſerved me! Did I ever deſerve ſvch mercy? Sure I did not; and it will be my ſorrow ſo long as I live, ſhould I ſin againſt ſo loving a Chriſt, and give away my ſoul from ſo good a God, and all by the perſwafions of ſo baſe a Woman: How can I forget this? Surely I ſhall never forget it as long as I live: I am reſolved to ſerve ſuch a God as this is, I will not count any thing too hard to doe for him that would have mercy upon me, that had given my ſoul to the Devil. I am not yet too old to learn, I will learn to read, ſure, if God will be pleaſed that I ſhall, though I break my ſleeping time to learn; and I will, if poſſibly I can, get into ſome good Miniſters houſe or ſervice, becauſe I would not have any let from living a holy life: I wil learn the knowledge of Religion, that I may ſerve God, ſince I have done ſo much to his diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. I am this day to go away home, I hope now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a holy life: and many more gracious expreſſions ſhe uſed, that thoſe that were preſent can teſtifie as well as my ſelf. All which ſhe ſpoke weeping bitterly: And longer diſcourſe I had had with her, but by reaſon of her much weeping, ſhe had not freedome of ſpeech.</p>

I relate not here any fancy, but a reall truth, and I beleeve all my own actions are under diviue obſervation, and I ſhould much offend, if I ſhould under pretence of relating truth, do otherwiſe; and truly I doubt not but all theſe tranſactions and providences, are but the fore-runners of her day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and God uſually, or at leaſt ſometimes, makes uſe of a wilderneſs condition to be a paſſage into <hi>Canaar.</hi> O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouls hath God in Heaven, that have had their paſſage thither by Hels gate? <hi>Manaſſes</hi> priſon was a means to break off his league with familiar ſpirits, ſo may I ſay, a Priſon was the place, where God in mercy viſited this poor Maid, and did there diſthrone Satan, and gave her freedom of ſpirit and liberty of body in one day; and I make no doubt but the ſame God, that hath brought to the birth, and I beleeve brought forth, will not ſuffer to be deſpiſed the day of ſmall things, but will make her a monument to his own praiſe, and although <hi>Jacob</hi> is but ſmall, yet he ſhall ariſe.</p>
            <p>I come to the period of my Narration, and ſhall cloſe up all with a word or two of the diſcovery of Gods judgement, and Juſtice on the Witch. I need not reiterate what former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath been ſaid, I have ſhewed ſomething of her miſerable life, and of her wofull death, but nothing in reſpect of what might be ſaid; I have only ſpoken of her practice concerning this Maid, but at her tryal there were many other things brought in againſt her, and there was at the leaſt eight wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes that gave in their Accuſations againſt her on oath, and it was not ſolely this buſineſs that ſhe was condemned for, but many other paſſages were brought in againſt her, of many of her vile and abominable practices, which would take up too much time to Inſert; but here is enough already ſaid ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently to evidence unto the world how vile and wicked ſhe was; and notwithſtanding this her miſerable condition (to the apprehenſion of all ſpectators) ſhe deſired nothing more than her end; thus the devil makes ſuch people willing ſlaves to himſelf, and notwithſtanding ſhe came to ſuch miſery and ſad condition, by reaſon of her wicked practices, yet ſhe would keep the devils Councel to the laſt, and would not diſcover others in League with her ſelf, although ſhe ſaw the iſſue of the Practitioners by her ſelf, neither would ſhe forewarn
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118450:24"/>
ſpectators of the like practice; we may ſee much of the Juſtice of God herein, that thoſe that will rebelliouſly harden their hearts againſt God, ſhall be judicially hardned by him; all judgements cannot break the heart, or humble the ſinner, if God ſoften it not; outward miſeries may break the back, not of themſelves melt the heart; all the torments the devils indure cannot bring down their pride, but they remain ſtill proud, though in Hell. What a madneſs reſts in the ſons of men, to think they can repent when theywill? I am confident this Witch could not ſhed one penitential tear, though thereby ſhe might have been reprieved from death. 'Tis dangerous to follow that trade will harden the heart, and 'tis uſual that thoſe that are ſo beſotted and hardned, as to ſin under daily mercies, are in time ſo hardned, that the worſt of judgements and torments can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mollifie them. This Narration was penned to reclame poor people from running after ſuch perſons, for the reſtauration of loſt health, or recovery of ſtollen goods, they may read the Iſſue thereof by this Maid, ſhe can and doth ſpeak forth, both by word of mouth, and alſo by her ſufferings ſhe lay under, the miſery of ſuch as reſort to them; thou haſt heard before how low ſhe was brought, into as ſad an eſtate as poor creature could be brought, and live, both in reſpect of her bodily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and inward condition. I have not related every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular word ſhe ſpake of her condition, neither indeed can I remember them all, but one time ſhe was brought ſo low with her pain, being in a trance, that when ſhe came to her ſelf, ſhe ſaid to a God<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Here ſee a poor creature, as to its own apprehenſion, could not lye under greater miſery, why then ſhould the devil prevail with any, thus to treaſure up to themſelves ſorrow?

of the Maid, the Witch her ſelf infinitely more beſpeaks all not to follow after, or practice ſuch wicked arts. Who would willingly have lived her life? but who then would dye her death? ſhe had ſorrows enough entayled to her practice here, while ſhe lived, but infinitely more now dead; 'tis no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing, ſuch a practice, but without infinite mercy 'tis damnation to the followers of it, and very few are reclamed from it, but as they live, uſually they dye. And my friendly Reader, not to detein thee from thy more ſerious imployment any longer, I ſay, thou haſt this relation, truly and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related unto thee; for what good or advantage would it be to me, to give a falſe relation of the ſame? which if I ſhould, many hundred ſpectators can diſprove me; but my own heart knows, and all obſervers can teſtifie, that the foregoing Hiſtory, is the birth and true iſſues of the life and death of the Witch; neither haſt thou it penned or illuſtrated with counterfeit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of curious language, for I know it matters not what Speech we uſe in telling truth, and I obliged my ſelf in my undertakings to uſe the ſame words and expreſſions as both the Witch and Maid uſed, and have not made them ſpeak my words in this relation. It is expected by ſome, having been urged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to annex to this Narration, a word or two concerning the practice of Witches, their nature and compact, how they may be diſcovered, and wherein there power conſiſts; what power Witches have over others, more than any other perſon, and how they came by their power, and that the practice of this Witch, is the way and common practice of ſuch as make compacts with devils; but thoſe to whom my ſelf am known, do alſo know, that I have other publike employment, to exerciſe my Pen, and Head about, than ſuch a work as this; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence caſting me on the afore-related buſineſs, I could not bury what I knew of it in oblivion, knowing that my ſelf knew the paſſages in general, aſwel as any, and I know none that would take the task to publiſh it but my ſelf, and I could not (being ſolicited by many Juſtices of the Peace, that were at the Bench and heard the tryal, and other men of eminent worth) wave i<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
