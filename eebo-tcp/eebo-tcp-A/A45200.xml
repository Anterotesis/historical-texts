            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen things are at worſt, then God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins a Change. The ſtate of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was extremely corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted immediately before the news of the Goſpell; yet, as bad as it was, not onely the Prieſthood, but the Courſes of attendence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, even from <hi>David</hi>'s time till <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s. It is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately-depraved condition of a Church, where no good Orders are left. <hi>Judaea</hi> paſſed many Troubles, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Alterations, yet this orderly Combination endured about eleven hundred years. A ſettled Good will not eaſily be defeated, but in the change of perſons will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unchanged; and if it be forced to give way, leaves memorable footſteps behind it. If <hi>David</hi> foreſaw the perpetuation of this holy Ordinance, how much did he rejoyce in the knowledge of it? Who would not be glad to doe good, on condition that it may ſo long out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:47750:4"/>The ſucceſſive Turns of the Legall miniſtration held on in a Line never interrupted. Even in a forlorn and miſerable Church there may be a perſonall Succeſſion. How little were the <hi>Jews</hi> better for this, when they had loſt the Urim and Thummim, Sincerity of Doctrine and Manners? This ſtayed with them even whilſt they and their Sons crucified <hi>Chriſt.</hi> What is more ordinary, then wicked Sons of holy Parents? It is the Succeſſion of Truth and Holineſs that makes or inſtitutes a Church, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of the Perſons. Never times were ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, as not to yield ſome good: The greateſt Dearth affords ſome few good Ears to the Gleaners. <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not have come into the World, but he would have ſome faithfull to entertain him: He, that had the diſpoſing of all Times and Men, would caſt ſome Holy ones into his own Times: There had been no equality, that all ſhould either over-run, or follow him, and none attend him. <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are juſt, both of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Bloud, and <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> of theirs. Whence ſhould an holy Seed ſpring, if not of the Loins of <hi>Levi?</hi> It is not in the power of Parents to traduce Holineſs to their Children: It is the bleſſing of God that feoffs them in the Vertues of their Parents, as they feoffe them in their Sins. There is no certainty, but there is likelihood, of an holy Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, when the Parents are ſuch. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was juſt as well as <hi>Zachary,</hi> that the Fore-runner of a Saviour might be holy on both ſides. If the Stock and the Graffe be not both good, there is much danger of the Fruit. It is an happy Match, when the Husband and the Wife are one, not onely in themſelves, but in God; not more in fleſh, then in the ſpirit. Grace makes no difference of Sexes: rather the weaker carries away the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, becauſe it hath had leſs helps. It is eaſie to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the New Teſtament affordeth more ſtore of good Women then the Old. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> led the ring of this mercy, whoſe Barrenneſs ended in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous

Fruit both of her body and of her time.</p>
            <p>This religious pair made no leſs progreſs in Vertue then in Age; and yet their Vertue could not make their beſt Age fruitfull. <hi>Elizabeth was barren.</hi> A juſt ſoul and a barren womb may well agree together. Amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> Barrenneſs was not a defect onely, but a reproach: yet while this good woman was fruitfull of holy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, ſhe was barren of Children. As <hi>John,</hi> who was miraculouſly conceived by man, was a fit Fore-runner of him that was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Matron was meet to make way for a Virgin.</p>
            <p>None but a ſon of <hi>Aaron</hi> might offer Incenſe to God in the Temple: and not every ſon of <hi>Aaron</hi>; and not any one at all ſeaſons. God is a God of Order, and hates Confuſion no leſs then Irreligion. Albeit he hath not ſo ſtreightned himſelf under the Goſpell, as to tie his ſervice to Perſons or Places; yet his choice is now no leſs curious, becauſe it is more large: He allows none but the authorized; he authorizeth none but the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. The Incenſe doth ever ſmell of the hand that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it. I doubt not but that Perfume was ſweeter which aſcended up from the hand of a juſt <hi>Zachary. The ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the wicked is abomination to God.</hi> There were Courſes of miniſtration in the Legall ſervices. God never purpoſed to burthen any of his creatures with Devotion. How vain is the ambition of any ſoul, that would load it ſelf with the univerſall charge of all men? How thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is their labour, that do wilfully over-ſpend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their ordinary vocations? As <hi>Zachary</hi> had a Courſe in God's Houſe, ſo he carefully obſerved it: The favour of theſe reſpites doubled his diligence. The more high and ſacred our Calling is, the more dangerous is Neglect. It is our honour, that we may be allowed to wait upon the God of heaven in theſe immediate ſervices. Woe be to us, if we ſlacken thoſe Duties wherein God honours us more then we can honour him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47750:5"/>Many ſons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> yea of the ſame Family, ſerved at once in the Temple, according to the variety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. To avoid all difference, they agreed by lot to aſſign themſelves to the ſeverall offices of each day. The lot of this day called <hi>Zachary</hi> to offer Incenſe in the outer Temple. I do not find any preſcription they had from God of this particular manner of deſignment. Matters of good Order in holy affairs may be ruled by the wiſe inſtitution of men according to reaſon &amp; expediency.</p>
            <p>It fell out well that <hi>Zachary</hi> was choſen by lot to this miniſtration, that God's immediate hand might be ſeen in all the paſſages that concerned his great Prophet; that as the Perſon, ſo the Occaſion might be of God's own chuſing. In Lots, and their ſeeming caſual diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, God can give a reaſon, though we can give none. Morning and Evening, twice a day, their Law called them to offer Incenſe to God, that both parts of the Day might be conſecrate to the Maker of Time. The outer Temple was the figure of the whole Church upon earth, like as the Holy of holieſt repreſented Heaven. Nothing can better reſemble our faithfull Prayers, then ſweet Perfume: Theſe God looks that we ſhould (all his Church over) ſend up unto him Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. The Elevations of our Hearts ſhould be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: but if twice in the day we do not preſent God with our ſolemn Invocations, we make the Goſpell leſs officious then the Law.</p>
            <p>That the reſemblance of Prayers and Incenſe might be apparent; whilſt the Prieſt ſends up his Incenſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Temple, the people muſt ſend up their Prayers without. Their Breath and that Incenſe, though remote in the firſt riſing, met e're they went up to Heaven. The people might no more go into the Holy place to offer up the incenſe of Prayers unto God, then <hi>Zachary</hi> might go into the Holy of holies. Whilſt the partition-wall ſtood betwixt <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, there were alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47750:5"/>
betwixt the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves. Now every man is a Prieſt unto God; every man (ſince the veil was rent) prays within the Temple. What are we the better for our greater freedome of acceſs to God under the Goſpell, if we do not make uſe of our privilege?</p>
            <p>Whilſt they were praying to God, he ſees an Angel of God. As <hi>Gideon</hi>'s Angel went up in the ſmoak of the ſacrifice, ſo did <hi>Zachary</hi>'s Angel (as it were) come down in the fragrant ſmoak of his incenſe. It was ever great news to ſee an Angel of God; but now more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had long withdrawn from them all the means of his ſupernaturall Revelations. As this wicked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſtrangers to their God in their Converſation, ſo was God grown a ſtranger to them in his Apparitions: yet now that the ſeaſon of the Goſpell approached, he viſited them with his Angels, before he viſited them by his Son. He ſends his Angel to men in the form of man, before he ſends his Son to take humane form. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Angels is no novelty, but their Apparition: they are always with us, but rarely ſeen; that we may awfully reſpect their meſſages when they are ſeen. In the mean time our faith may ſee them, though our ſenſes do not. Their aſſumed ſhapes do not make them more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but viſible.</p>
            <p>There is an Order in that heavenly Hierarchie, though we know it not. This Angel that appeared to <hi>Zachary</hi> was not with him in the ordinary courſe of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, but was purpoſely ſent from God with this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Why was an Angel ſent? and why this Angel? It had been eaſie for him to have raiſed up the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ſpirit of ſome <hi>Simeon</hi> to this prediction: the ſame Holy Ghoſt which revealed to that juſt man that he ſhould not ſee death, e're he had ſeen the <hi>Meſſias</hi>; might have as eaſily revealed unto him the Birth of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and by him to <hi>Zachary.</hi> But God would have this Voice, which ſhould goe before his Son,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47750:6"/>
come with a noiſe: He would have it appear to the world, that the Harbinger of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be conceived by the marvellous power of that God, whoſe coming he proclaimed. It was fit the firſt Herald of the Goſpel ſhould begin in wonder. The ſame Angel that came to the Bleſſed Virgin with the news of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, came to <hi>Zachary</hi> with the news of <hi>John</hi>'s, for the honour of him that was the greateſt of them which were born of women, and for his better reſemblance to him which was the Seed of the woman. Both had the Goſpell for their errand, one as the Meſſenger of it, the other as the Authour: Both are foretold by the ſame mouth.</p>
            <p>When could it be more fit for the Angel to appear unto <hi>Zachary,</hi> then when Prayers and Incenſe were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by him? Where could he more fitly appear then in the Temple? in what part of the Temple more fitly then at the Altar of Incenſe? and whereabouts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then on the right ſide of the Altar? Thoſe glorious ſpirits as they are always with us, ſo moſt in our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and as in all places, ſo moſt of all in God's Houſe. They rejoyce to be with us, whilſt we are with God; as contrarily, they turn their faces from us, when we goe about our Sins.</p>
            <p>He that had wont to live and ſerve in the preſence of the Maſter, was now aſtoniſhed at the preſence of the Servant. So much difference there is betwixt our Faith, and our Senſes, that the apprehenſion of the preſence of the God of Spirits by faith goes down ſweetly with us, whereas the ſenſible apprehenſion of an Angel diſmays us. Holy <hi>Zachary,</hi> that had wont to live by Faith, thought he ſhould die when his Senſe began to be ſet on work. It was the weakneſs of him, that ſerved at the Altar without horrour, to be daunted with the face of his Fellow-ſervant. In vain do we look for ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God as are without infirmities, when juſt <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47750:6"/>
was troubled in his Devotions with that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſhould have been comforted. It was partly the ſuddenneſs, and partly the glory of the Apparition that affrighted him. The good Angel was both apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and compaſſionate of <hi>Zachary</hi>'s weakneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently incourages him with a chearfull excitation; <hi>Fear not, Zacharias.</hi> The bleſſed Spirits, though they do not often vocally expreſs it, do pity our humane frailties, and ſecretly ſuggeſt comfort unto us, when we perceive it not. Good and evil Angels, as they are contrary in eſtate, ſo alſo in diſpoſition: The good deſire to take away Fear, the evil to bring it. It is a fruit of that dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enmity which is betwixt Satan and us, that he would, if he might, kill us with terrour: whereas the good Spirits, affecting our relief and happineſs, take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in terrifying us, but labour altogether for our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and chearfulneſs.</p>
            <p>There was not more Fear in the face, then Comfort in the ſpeech; <hi>Thy prayer is heard.</hi> No Angel could have told him better news. Our deſires are uttered in our Prayers: What can we wiſh but to have what we would? Many good ſuits had <hi>Zachary</hi> made, and amongſt the reſt for a Son. Doubtleſs it was now ſome ſpace of years ſince he made that requeſt; for he was now ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in age, and had ceaſed to hope: yet had God laid it up all the while, and when he thinks not of it, brings it forth to effect. Thus doth the mercy of our God deal with his patient and faithfull Suppliants: In the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their expectation he many times holds them off; and when they leaſt think of it, and have forgotten their own ſuits, he graciouſly condeſcends. Delay of effect may not diſcourage our Faith: It may be God hath long granted, e're we ſhall know of his grant. Many a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repents him of his fruitfulneſs, and hath ſuch Sons as he wiſhes unborn: but to have ſo gracious and happy a Son as the Angel foretold, could not be leſs comfort then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47750:7"/>
honour to the age of <hi>Zachary.</hi> The proof of Children makes them either the Bleſſings or Croſſes of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. To hear what his Son ſhould be before he was; to hear that he ſhould have ſuch a Son, a Son whoſe birth ſhould concern the joy of many, a Son that ſhould be great in the ſight of the Lord, a Son that ſhould be ſacred to God, filled with God, beneficiall to man, an Harbinger to him that was God and Man; was news e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prevent the Angel, and to take away that Tongue with Amazement, which was after loſt with Incredulity.</p>
            <p>The ſpeech was ſo good, that it found not a ſudden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: This good news ſurprized <hi>Zachary.</hi> If the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence had taken leiſure, that his thoughts might have had time to debate the matter, he had eaſily apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the infinite power of him that had promiſed; the Pattern of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sara</hi>; and would ſoon have concluded the appearance of the Angel more mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous then his prediction. Whereas now, like a man masked with the ſtrangeneſs of that he ſaw and heard, he miſdoubts the meſſage, and asks, <hi>How ſhall I know?</hi> Nature was on his ſide, and alledged the impoſſibility of the event, both from Age and Barrenneſs. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural tidings at the firſt hearing aſtoniſh the heart, and are entertained with Doubts by thoſe, who upon farther acquaintance give them the beſt Welcome.</p>
            <p>The weak apprehenſions of our imperfect Faith are not ſo much to be cenſured, as pitied. It is a ſure way for the heart, to be prevented with the aſſurance of the omnipotent power of God, to whom nothing is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: ſo ſhall the hardeſt points of Faith goe down eaſily with us. If the Eye of our mind look upward, it ſhall meet with nothing to avert or interrupt it; but if right forward, or downward, or round about, every thing is a block in our way.</p>
            <p>There is a difference betwixt Deſire of aſſurance, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47750:7"/>
Unbelief. We cannot be too carefull to raiſe up our ſelves arguments to ſettle our Faith; although it ſhould be no Faith, if it had no feet to ſtand upon but diſcurſive. In matters of Faith, if reaſons may be brought for the conviction of the gainſayers, it is well; if they be helps, they cannot be grounds of our Belief. In the moſt faithfull heart there are ſome ſparks of infidelity: So to believe, that we ſhould have no doubt at all, is ſcarce incident unto fleſh and bloud. It is a great perfection, if we have attained to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Doubts. What did miſ-lead <hi>Zachary,</hi> but that which uſes to guide others, Reaſon? <hi>I am old, and my wife is of great age.</hi> As if years and dry loins could be any lett to him, who is able of very ſtones to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> Faith and Reaſon have their limits; where Reaſon ends, Faith begins: and if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will be encroaching upon the bounds of Faith, ſhe is ſtraight taken captive by Infidelity. We are not fit to follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if we have not denied our ſelves; and the chief piece of our ſelves is our Reaſon. We muſt yield God able to doe that which we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; and we muſt comprehend that by our Faith which is diſclaimed by Reaſon. <hi>Hagar</hi> muſt be driven out of doors, that <hi>Sara</hi> may rule alone.</p>
            <p>The authority of the Reporter makes way for belief in things which are otherwiſe hard to paſs: although in the matters of God, we ſhould not ſo much care who ſpeaks, as what is ſpoken, and from whom. The Angel tells his name, place, office, unasked; that <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> might not think any news impoſſible that was brought him by an Heavenly Meſſenger. Even where there is no uſe of language, the Spirits are diſtinguiſhed by names, and each knows his own appellation, and others. He that gave leave unto Man, his Image, to give names unto all his viſible and inferiour creatures, did himſelf put names unto the ſpirituall: and as their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47750:8"/>
name is, ſo are they mighty and glorious. But leſt <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> ſhould no leſs doubt of the ſtyle of the Meſſenger, then of the Errand it ſelf, he is at once both confirmed, and puniſhed with Dumbneſs. That Tongue which moved the Doubt muſt be tied up: He ſhall ask no more queſtions for forty weeks, becauſe he asked this one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfully.</p>
            <p>Neither did <hi>Zachary</hi> loſe onely his Tongue for the time, but his Ears alſo; he was not onely mute, but deaf: For otherwiſe, when they came to ask his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for the name of his Son, they needed not to have demanded it by ſigns, but by words. God will not paſs over ſlight offences, and thoſe which may plead the moſt colourable pretences, in his beſt children, without a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible check. It is not our holy entireneſs with God that can bear us out in the leaſt ſin; yea rather, the more acquaintance we have with his Majeſty, the more ſure we are of correction when we offend. This may procure us more favour in our well-doing, not leſs juſtice in evill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zachary</hi> ſtaied, and the people waited. Whether ſome longer diſcourſe betwixt the Angel and him then needed to be recorded, or whether aſtoniſhment at the apparition and news withheld him, I inquire not. The multitude thought him long; yet though they could but ſee afar off, they would not depart till he returned to bleſs them. Their patient attendence without ſhames us, that are hardly perſwaded to attend within, whilſt both our Senſes are imployed in our Divine ſervices, and we are admitted to be Co-agents with our Miniſters.</p>
            <p>At laſt <hi>Zachary</hi> comes out ſpeechleſs, and more amazes them with his preſence then with his delay. The eyes of the multitude, that were not worthy to ſee his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet ſee the ſigns of his Viſion; that the world might be put into the expectation of ſome extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſequell. God makes way for his Voice by Silence: His Speech could not have ſaid ſo much as his Dumbneſs.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47750:8"/>
               <hi>Zachary</hi> would fain have ſpoken, and could not: with us, too many are dumb, and need not. Negligence, Fear, Partiality ſtop the mouths of many, which ſhall once ſay, Woe to me, becauſe I held my peace. His Hand ſpeaks that which he cannot with his Tongue, and he makes them by ſigns to underſtand that which they might reade in his Face. Thoſe powers we have we muſt uſe. But though he have ceaſed to ſpeak, yet he ceaſed not to miniſter. He takes not this Dumbneſs for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but ſtays out the eight days of his Courſe, as one that knew the Eyes and Hands and Heart would be accepted of that God which had bereaved him of his Tongue. We may not ſtraight take occaſions of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing our ſelves from the publick Services of our God, much leſs under the Goſpell. The Law, which ſtood much upon Bodily perfection, diſpenſed with Age for attendence: The Goſpell, which is all for the Soul, regards thoſe inward powers, which whilſt they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, exclude all excuſes of our miniſtration.</p>

            <p>THe Spirit of God was never ſo accurate in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as that which concerns the Incarnation of GOD. It was fit no circumſtance ſhould be omitted in that Story, whereon the Faith and Salvation of all the World dependeth. We cannot ſo much as doubt of this truth, and be ſaved. No, not the number of the Moneth, not the Name of the Angel is concealed. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particle imports not more certainty, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence.

The time is the ſixth moneth after <hi>John</hi>'s Conception, the prime of the Spring. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Spring, born in the Solſtice. He in whom the World received a new Life, receives Life in the ſame ſeaſon wherein the World received its firſt Life from him; and he which ſtretches out the days of his Church, and lengthens them to Eternity, appears after all the ſhort and dim light of the Law, and enlightens the World with his Glory. The Meſſenger is an Angel. A Man was too mean to carry the news of the Conception of God. Never any buſineſs was conceived in Heaven that did ſo much concern the Earth, as the Conception of the God of Heaven in the Womb of Earth. No leſs then an Arch-angel was worthy to bear theſe tidings; never any Angel received a greater honour, then of this Embaſſage.</p>
            <p>It was fit our Reparation ſhould anſwer our Fall. An evill Angel was the firſt Motioner of the one to <hi>Eve,</hi> a Virgin, then eſpouſed to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Garden of <hi>Eden:</hi> A good Angel is the firſt Reporter of the other to <hi>Mary,</hi> a Virgin, eſpouſed to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> in that place which (as the Garden of <hi>Galilee</hi>) had a name from Flouriſhing. No good Angel could be the Authour of our Reſtauration, as that evill Angel was of our Ruine. But that which thoſe glorious Spirits could not doe themſelves, they are glad to report as done by the God of Spirits. Good news rejoyces the bearer. With what joy did this holy Angel bring the news of that Saviour, in whom we are redeemed to Life, himſelf eſtabliſhed in Life and Glory? The firſt Preacher of the Goſpell was an Angel: that Office muſt needs be glorious that derives it ſelf from ſuch a Predeceſſour. God appointed his Angel to be the firſt Preacher, and hath ſince called his Preachers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. The Meſſage is well ſuited. An Angel comes to a Virgin, <hi>Gabriel</hi> to <hi>Mary</hi>; he that was by ſignification <hi>the ſtrength of God,</hi> to her that was by ſignification <hi>exalted by God,</hi> to the conceiving of him that was the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47750:9"/>
God of ſtrength. To a Maid, but eſpouſed: a Maid, for the honour of Virginity; eſpouſed, for the honour of Marriage. The Marriage was in a ſort made, not conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, through the inſtinct of him that meant to make her not an Example, but a Miracle of women. In this whole work God would have nothing ordinary. It was fit that ſhe ſhould be a married Virgin, which ſhould be a Virgin-mother. He that meant to take Man's nature without man's corruption, would be the Son of man without man's ſeed, would be the Seed of the Woman without Man; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all Women, of a pure Virgin; but amongſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, of one eſpouſed, that there might be at once a Witneſs and a Guardian of her fruitfull Virginity. If the ſame God had not been the authour of Virginity and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he had never countenanced Virginity by Marriage.</p>
            <p>Whither doth this glorious Angel come to find the Mother of him that was God, but to obſcure <hi>Galilee?</hi> A part which even the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves deſpiſed, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of their privileges: <hi>Out of Galilee ariſeth no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> Behold, an Angel comes to that <hi>Galilee</hi> out of which no Prophet comes; and the God of Prophets and Angels deſcends to be conceived in that <hi>Galilee</hi> out of which no Prophet ariſeth. He that filleth all places makes no difference of places. It is the Perſon which gives honour and privilege to the place, not the Place to the perſon: as the Preſence of God makes the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Heaven doth not make the Owner glorious. No blind corner of <hi>Nazareth</hi> can hide the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from the Angel. The Favours of God will find out his Children whereſoever they are withdrawn.</p>
            <p>It is the faſhion of God to ſeek out the moſt deſpiſed, on whom to beſtow his Honours. We cannot run away, as from the Judgments, ſo from the Mercies of our God. The Cottages of <hi>Galilee</hi> are preferred by God to the famous Palaces of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> he cares not how home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he converſes with his own. Why ſhould we be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47750:10"/>
with the outward glory of Places, whilſt our God regards it not? We are not of the Angel's diet, if we had not rather be with the Bleſſed Virgin at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> then with the proud Dames in the Court of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> It is a great vanity to reſpect any thing above Goodneſs, and to diſeſteem Goodneſs for any want. The Angel ſalutes the Virgin, he prays not to her: He ſalutes her as a Saint, he prays not to her as a Goddeſs. For us to ſalute her as he did, were groſs Preſumption: For neither are we as he was, neither is ſhe as ſhe was. If he that was a Spirit ſaluted her that was Fleſh and bloud here on earth, it is not for us, that are Fleſh and bloud, to ſalute her, which is a glorious Spirit in Heaven. For us to pray to her in the Angel's Salutation, were to abuſe the Virgin, the Angel, the Salutation.</p>
            <p>But how gladly do we ſecond the Angel in the praiſe of her, who was more ours then his? How juſtly do we bleſs her, whom the Angel pronounceth <hi>bleſſed?</hi> How worthily is ſhe honoured of men, whom the Angel proclaimeth <hi>beloved of God?</hi> O Bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> he cannot bleſs thee, he cannot honour thee too much, that deifies thee not. That which the Angel ſaid of thee, thou haſt propheſied of thy ſelf; we believe the Angel, and thee: <hi>All Generations ſhall call thee bleſſed,</hi> by the fruit of whoſe womb all Generations are bleſſed. If <hi>Zachary</hi> were amazed with the ſight of this Angel, much more the Virgin. That very Sex had more diſadvantage of Fear. If it had been but a Man that had come to her in that ſecrecy and ſuddenneſs, ſhe could not but have been troubled; how much more when the ſhining Glory of the Perſon doubled the Aſtoniſhment?</p>
            <p>The Troubles of Holy minds end ever in Comfort. Joy was the errand of the Angel, and not Terrour. Fear (as all Paſſions) diſquiets the heart, and makes it for the time unfit to receive the meſſages of God. Soon hath the Angel cleared theſe troubleſome miſts of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47750:10"/>
and ſent out the beams of heavenly Conſolation into the remoteſt corner of her Soul by the glad news of her Saviour. How can Joy but enter into her heart, out of whoſe womb ſhall come Salvation? What room can Fear find in that breaſt that is aſſured of Favour? <hi>Fear not, Mary; for thou haſt found favour with God.</hi> Let thoſe fear who know they are in diſpleaſure, or know not they are gracious: Thine happy eſtate calls for Confidence, and that Confidence for Joy. What ſhould, what can they fear, who are favoured of him at whom the Devils tremble? Not the Preſence of the good Angels, but the Temptations of the evill ſtrike many terrours into our weakneſs: we could not be diſmaied with them, if we did not forget our condition. We <hi>have not received the ſpirit of bondage to fear again, but the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby</hi> we <hi>cry, Abba, Father.</hi> If that Spirit (O God) witneſs with our ſpirits that we are thine, how can we fear any of thoſe ſpirituall wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? Give us aſſurance of thy Favour, and let the powers of Hell doe their worſt.</p>
            <p>It was no ordinary favour that the Virgin found in Heaven. No mortall Creature was ever thus graced, that he ſhould take part of her nature that was the God of Nature; that he, who made all things, ſhould make his humane Body of hers; that her Womb ſhould yield that Fleſh which was perſonally united to the Godhead; that ſhe ſhould bear him that upholds the World. <hi>Loe, thou ſhalt conceive and bear a Son, and ſhalt call his name JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S.</hi> It is a queſtion, whether there be more wonder in the Conception, or in the Fruit; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Virgin, or <hi>Jeſus</hi> conceived: Both are marvellous; but the former doth not more exceed all other Wonders, then the latter exceedeth it. For the child of a Virgin is the improvement of that power which created the world: but that God ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate of a Virgin, was an abaſement of his Majeſty,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:47750:11"/>
and an exaltation of the Creature beyond all example. Well was that Child worthy to make the Mother bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Here was a double Conception; one in the womb of her Body, the other of the Soul. If that were more miraculous, this was more beneficiall: that was her Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, this was her Happineſs. If that were ſingular to her, this is common to all his choſen: There is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Heart wherein thou, O Saviour, art not formed again. Bleſſed be thou that haſt herein made us bleſſed. For what womb can conceive thee, and not partake of thee? who can partake of thee, and not be happy?</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs the Virgin underſtood the Angel as he meant, of a preſent Conception, which made her ſo much more inquiſitive into the manner and means of this event: <hi>How ſhall this be, ſince I know not a man?</hi> That ſhe ſhould conceive a Son by the knowledge of Man after her Marriage conſummate, could have been no wonder: But how then ſhould that Son of hers be the Son of God? This demand was higher. How her preſent Virginity ſhould be inſtantly fruitfull, might be well worthy of admiration, of inquiry. Here was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of information, not doubts of infidelity: yea rather, this queſtion argues Faith; it takes for granted that which an unbelieving heart would have ſtuck at. She ſays not, Who and whence art thou? what Kingdome is this? where and when ſhall it be erected? but ſmoothly ſuppoſing all thoſe ſtrange things would be done, ſhe inſiſts onely in that which did neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a farther intimation, and doth not diſtruſt, but demand: neither doth ſhe ſay, This cannot be, nor, How can this be? but, <hi>How ſhall this be?</hi> So doth the Angel anſwer, as one that knew he needed not to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Curioſity, but to inform Judgment, and uphold Faith. He doth not therefore tell her of the manner, but of the Authour of this act; <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the Moſt high ſhall over-ſhadow
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47750:11"/>
thee.</hi> It is enough to know who is the Undertaker, and what he will doe. O God, what do we ſeek a clear Light, where thou wilt have a Shadow? No Mother knows the manner of her naturall Conception: what preſumption ſhall it be for fleſh and bloud, to ſearch how the Son of God took fleſh and bloud of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? It is for none but the Almighty to know thoſe works which he doeth immediately concerning himſelf: thoſe that concern us he hath revealed. Secrets to God, things revealed to us.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer was not ſo full, but that a thouſand diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties might ariſe out of the particularities of ſo ſtrange a Meſſage: yet after the Angel's Solution, we hear of no more Objections, no more Interrogations. The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Heart, when it once underſtands the good pleaſure of God, argues no more, but ſweetly reſts it ſelf in a quiet expectation. <hi>Behold the Servant of the Lord, be it to me according to thy Word.</hi> There is not a more noble proof of our Faith, then to captivate all the powers of our Underſtanding and Will to our Creatour, and without all ſciſcitations to goe blindfold whither he will lead us. All Diſputations with God (after his will known) ariſe from Infidelity. Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs; and if we will give Nature leave to cavill, we cannot be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. O God, thou art faithfull, thou art powerfull: It is enough that thou haſt ſaid it; in the humility of our obedience we reſign our ſelves over to thee. Behold the Servants of the Lord, be it unto us according to thy word.</p>
            <p>How fit was her Womb to conceive the Fleſh of the Son of God by the power of the Spirit of God, whoſe Breaſt had ſo ſoon by the power of the ſame Spirit concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved an aſſent to the will of God? And now of an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid of God, ſhe is advanced to the Mother of God. No ſooner hath ſhe ſaid, <hi>Be it done,</hi> then it is done; the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt overſhadows her, and forms her Saviour in her
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47750:12"/>
own Body. This very Angel, that talks with the Bleſſed Virgin, could ſcarce have been able to expreſs the Joy of her heart in the ſenſe of this Divine Burthen. Never any mortal creature had ſo much cauſe of Exultation. How could ſhe, that was full of God, be other then full of Joy in that God? Grief grows greater by concealing, Joy by expreſſion. The Holy Virgin had underſtood by the Angel, how her Couſin <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was no leſs of kin to her in condition; the fruitfulneſs of whoſe Age did ſomewhat ſuit the fruitfulneſs of her Virginity. Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs communicated doubles it ſelf. Here is no ſtraining of courteſie: The Bleſſed Maid, whom vigour of Age had more fitted for the way, haſtens her journey into the Hill-country, to viſit that gracious Matron, whom God had made a ſign of her miraculous Conception. Onely the meeting of Saints in Heaven can parallel the meeting of theſe two Couſins: the two Wonders of the World are met under one roof, and congratulate their mutuall Happineſs. When we have <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpiritually conceived in us, we cannot be quiet till we have imparted our Joy. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that holy Matron, did no ſooner welcome her Bleſſed Couſin, then her Babe welcomes his Saviour: Both in the retired Cloſets of their Mother's Womb are ſenſible of each other's preſence; the one by his Omniſcience, the other by Inſtinct. He did not more forerun <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then over-run Nature. How ſhould our hearts leap within us, when the Son of God vouchſafes to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſecret of our Souls, not to viſit us, but to dwell with us, to dwell in us?</p>

            <p>AS all the actions of men, ſo eſpecially the publick actions of publick men are ordered by God to other ends then their own. This Edict went not ſo much out from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> as from the Court of Heaven. What did <hi>Caeſar</hi> know <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary?</hi> His charge was univerſal, to a world of Subjects, through all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire: God intended this Cenſion onely for the Bleſſed Virgin and her Son, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> might be born where he ſhould. <hi>Caeſar</hi> meant to fill his Coffers, God meant to fulfill his Prophecies; and ſo to fulfill them, that thoſe whom it concerned might not feel the Accompliſhment. If God had directly commanded the Virgin to goe up to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhe had ſeen the intention, and expected the iſſue: But that wiſe Moderatour of all things, that works his will in us, loves ſo to doe it, as may be leaſt with our fore-ſight and acquaintance, and would have us fall under his Decrees unawares, that we may ſo much the more adore the depths of his Providence. Every Creature walks blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; onely He that dwells in light ſees whither they goe.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> meant to have been delivered of her Divine burthen at home, and little thought of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the place of Conception for another of her Birth. That houſe was honoured by the Angel, yea, by the over-ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt: none could equally ſatisfie her hopes or deſires. It was fit that He, who made choice of the Womb wherein his Son ſhould be conceived, ſhould make choice of the place where his Son ſhould be born. As the Work is all his, ſo will he alone contrive all the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47750:13"/>
Circumſtances to his own ends. O the infinite Wiſedome of God in caſting all his deſigns! There needs no other proof of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; and of <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi> then <hi>Auguſtus</hi>: his Government, his Edict pleads the truth of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> His Government: Now was the deep Peace of all the world under that quiet Scepter, which made way for him who was the Prince of Peace. If Wars be a ſign of the time of his ſecond Coming, Peace was a ſign of his firſt. His Edict: Now was the Scepter departed from <hi>Juda</hi>; it was the time for <hi>Shilo</hi> to come: no power was left in the <hi>Jews,</hi> but to obey. <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is the Emperour of the World; under him <hi>Herod</hi> is the King of <hi>Judaea; Cyrenius</hi> is Preſident of <hi>Syria: Jewrie</hi> hath nothing of her own. For <hi>Herod,</hi> if he were a King, yet he was no <hi>Jew</hi>; and if he had been a <hi>Jew,</hi> yet he was no otherwiſe a King then tributary and titular. The Edict came out from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> was executed by <hi>Cyrenius; Herod</hi> is no actour in this ſervice. Gain and glory are the ends of this Taxation: each man profeſt himſelf a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and paid for the privilege of his Servitude. Now their very Heads were not their own, but muſt be payed for to the Head of a forrein State: They which before ſtood upon the terms of their Immunity, ſtoop at the laſt. The proud ſuggeſtions of <hi>Judas</hi> the <hi>Galilaean</hi> might ſhed their bloud, and ſwell their ſtomacks, but could not eaſe their yoak: neither was it the meaning of God, that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs (if they had been as they pretended) ſhould ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from Subjection. A Tribute is impoſed upon God's free people. This act of Bondage brings them Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: Now when they ſeemed moſt neglected of God, they are bleſſed with a Redeemer; when they are moſt preſſed with forrein Sovereignty, God ſends them a King of their own, to whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf muſt be a Subject. The goodneſs of our God picks out the moſt needfull times for our relief and comfort: Our extremities give him the moſt glory. Whither muſt <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> come
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47750:13"/>
to be taxed, but unto <hi>Bethlehem, David</hi>'s City? The very Place proves their Deſcent. He that ſucceeded <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his Throne, muſt ſucceed him in the place of his Birth. So clearly was <hi>Bethlehem</hi> deſigned to this honour by the Prophets, that even the Prieſts and the Scribes could point <hi>Herod</hi> unto it, and aſſured him, the King of the <hi>Jews</hi> could be no-where elſe born. <hi>Bethlehem</hi> juſtly <hi>the Houſe of Bread</hi>; the Bread that came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is there given to the world. Whence ſhould we have the Bread of life, but from the Houſe of bread? O holy <hi>David,</hi> was this the Well of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> whereof thou didſt ſo thirſt to drink of old, when thou ſaidſt, <hi>Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the Well of Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem?</hi> Surely that other Water, when it was brought thee by thy Worthies, thou pouredſt it on the ground, and wouldſt not drink of it: This was that <hi>living Water</hi> for which thy ſoul longed, whereof thou ſaidſt elſewhere, <hi>As the Hart brayeth after the water-brooks, ſo longeth my ſoul after thee, O God: My ſoul thirſteth for God, for the living God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was no leſs then four days journey from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> How juſt an excuſe might the Bleſſed Virgin have pleaded for her abſence? What woman did ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſuch a journey ſo near her delivery? And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who was now taught of God to love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her, was loth to draw forth a dear Wife, in ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wieldy a caſe, into ſo manifeſt hazard. But the Charge was peremptory, the Obedience exemplary: The deſire of an inoffenſive obſervance even of Heatheniſh autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity digeſts all difficulties. We may not take eaſie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to withdraw our Obedience to ſupreme commands. Yea, how didſt thou, (O Saviour) by whom <hi>Auguſtus</hi> reigned, in the womb of thy Mother yield this Homage to <hi>Auguſtus?</hi> The firſt Leſſon that ever thy Example taught us was Obedience.</p>
            <p>After many ſteps are <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> come to <hi>Bethlehem.</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:47750:14"/>
The plight wherein ſhe was would not allow any ſpeed, and the forced leiſure of the journey cauſeth diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the end was worſe then the way; there was no reſt in the way, there was no room in the Inne. It could not be, but that there were many of the kindred of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> at that time in <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; for both there were their Anceſtours born, if not themſelves; and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came up all the Couſins of their bloud: yet there and then doth the Holy Virgin want room to lay either her head, or her burthen. If the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> had not loſt all mercy and good nature, a Daughter of <hi>David</hi> could not ſo near the time of her travail have been deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of lodging in the City of <hi>David.</hi> Little did the <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemites</hi> think what a Gueſt they refuſed; elſe they would gladly have opened their doors to him, who was able to open the gates of Heaven to them. Now their Inhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality is puniſhment enough to it ſelf: They have loſt the honour and happineſs of being Hoſt to their God. Even ſtill, O Bleſſed Saviour, thou ſtandeſt at our doors and knockeſt; every motion of thy good Spirit tells us thou art there: Now thou comeſt in thine own name, and there thou ſtandeſt, whilſt thy <hi>head is full of dew, and</hi> thy <hi>locks wet with the drops of the night.</hi> If we ſuffer car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſires and worldly thoughts to take up the lodging of our Heart, and revell within us, whilſt thou waiteſt upon our admiſſion, ſurely our judgement ſhall be ſo much the greater, by how much better we know whom we have excluded. What do we cry ſhame on the <hi>Bethlehemites,</hi> whilſt we are wilfully more churliſh, more unthankfull? There is no room in my heart for the wonder at this Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. He, for whom Heaven is too ſtreight, whom the Heaven of heavens cannot contain, lies in the ſtreight cabbin of the womb, and when he would inlarge himſelf for the world, is not allowed the room of an Inne. The <hi>many manſions</hi> of Heaven were at his diſpoſing; <hi>the Earth</hi> was his, <hi>and the fulneſs of it:</hi> yet he ſuffers himſelf
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47750:14"/>
to be refuſed of a baſe Cottage, and complaineth not. What meaſure ſhould diſcontent us wretched men, when thou (O God) fareſt thus from thy creatures? How ſhould we learn both <hi>to want and abound,</hi> from thee, who, abounding with the glory and riches of Heaven, wouldſt want a lodging in thy firſt welcome to the earth? Thou <hi>cameſt to</hi> thine <hi>own, and</hi> thy <hi>own received</hi> thee <hi>not.</hi> How can it trouble us to be rejected of the world, which is not ours? What wonder is it if thy ſervants <hi>wandred abroad in ſheep-skins and goat-skins, deſtitute and afflicted,</hi> when their Lord is denied harbour? How ſhould all the world bluſh at this indignity of <hi>Bethlehem?</hi> He that came to ſave Men, is ſent for his firſt lodging to the Beaſts: The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is become his Inne, the Cratch his Bed. O ſtrange Cradle of that great King, which Heaven it ſelf may envy! O Saviour, thou that wert both the Maker and Owner of Heaven, of Earth, couldſt have made thee a Palace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, couldſt have commanded thee an empty room in thoſe houſes which thy creatures had made. When thou didſt but bid the Angels avoid their firſt place, they fell down from Heaven like lightning; and when in thy hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled eſtate thou didſt but ſay, <hi>I am he,</hi> who was able to ſtand before thee? How eaſie had it been for thee, to have made place for thy ſelf in the throngs of the ſtatelieſt Courts? Why wouldſt thou be thus homely, but that, by contemning worldly Glories, thou mighteſt teach us to contemn them? that thou mighteſt-ſanctify Poverty to them whom thou calledſt unto want? that ſince thou, who hadſt the choice of all earthly conditions, wouldſt be born poor and deſpiſed, thoſe which muſt want out of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity might not think their Poverty grievous. Here was neither friend to entertain, nor ſervant to attend, nor place wherein to be attended; onely the poor Beaſts gave way to the God of all the world. It is the <hi>great myſtery of godlineſs,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> was <hi>manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſeen of Angels:</hi> but here, which was the top of all wonders,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47750:15"/>
the very Beaſts might ſee their Maker. For thoſe Spirits to ſee God in the fleſh, it was not ſo ſtrange, as for the brute creatures to ſee him who was the God of ſpirits. He, that would be led into the wilderneſs amongſt wild beaſts to be tempted, would come into the houſe of beaſts to be born, that from the height of his Divine Glory his Humiliation might be the greater. How can we be abaſed low enough for thee, (O Saviour) that haſt thus neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thy ſelf for us? That the viſitation might be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the homelineſs of the place, attendents, proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who ſhall come to congratulate his birth but poor Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds? The Kings of the earth reſt at home, and have no ſummons to attend him by whom they reign: God hath <hi>choſen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty.</hi> In an obſcure time (the night) unto obſcure men (Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds) doth God manifeſt the light of his Son by glorious Angels. It is not our meanneſs (O God) that can exclude us from the beſt of thy mercies: yea, thus far doſt thou reſpect perſons, that thou haſt <hi>put down the mighty, and exalted them of low degree.</hi> If theſe Shepherds had been ſnorting in their beds, they had no more ſeen Angels, nor heard news of their Saviour, then their neighbours: Their vigilancy is honoured with this heavenly Viſion. Thoſe who are induſtrious in any calling are capable of farther Bleſſings; whereas the Idle are fit for nothing but Temptation. No leſs then a whole Chore of Angels are worthy to ſing the Hymn of <hi>Glory to God,</hi> for the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Son. What joy is enough for us, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he took, and whom he came to reſtore by his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? If we had the tongues of Angels, we could not raiſe this note high enough to the praiſe of our glorious Redeemer. No ſooner do the Shepherds hear the news of a Saviour, then they run to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to ſeek him: Thoſe that left their beds to tend their flocks, leave their flocks to enquire after their Saviour. No earthly thing is too dear to be forſaken for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If we ſuffer any worldly occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47750:15"/>
to ſtay us from <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> we care more for our ſheep then our ſouls. It is not poſſible that a faithfull heart ſhould hear where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, and not labour to the ſight, to the fruition of him. Where art thou, O Saviour, but at home in thine own houſe, in the aſſembly of thy Saints? Where art thou to be found but in thy Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Yea, there thou ſeekeſt for us: if there we haſte not to ſeek for thee, we are worthy to want thee, worthy that our want of thee here ſhould make us want the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thy face for ever.</p>

            <p>THE Shepherds and the Cratch accorded well; yet even they ſaw nothing which they might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn: neither was there any of thoſe Shepherds that ſeemed not more like a King, then that King whom they came to ſee. But O the Divine Majeſty that ſhined in this Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! There lies the Babe in the Stable, crying in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, whom the Angels came down from Heaven to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, whom the Sages come from the Eaſt to adore, whom an heavenly Star notifies to the world; that now men might ſee, that Heaven and Earth ſerves him that neglected himſelf. Thoſe Lights that hang low are not far ſeen, but thoſe that are high placed are equally ſeen in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſtances. Thy light, O Saviour, was no leſſe then heavenly. The Eaſt ſaw that which <hi>Bethlehem</hi> might have ſeen. Oft-times thoſe which are neareſt in place are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt off in affection. Large objects, when they are too cloſe to the eye, do ſo over-fill the ſenſe, that they are not diſcerned. What a ſhame is this to <hi>Bethlehem</hi>? the Sages
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47750:16"/>
came out of the Eaſt to worſhip him, whom that village refuſed. The <hi>Bethlehemites</hi> were <hi>Jews,</hi> the Wiſe men Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. This firſt entertainment of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was a preſage of the ſequell: The Gentiles ſhall come from far to adore <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Jews</hi> reject him. Thoſe Eaſterlings were great ſearchers of the depths of nature, profeſſed Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; them hath God ſingled out to the honour of the manifeſtation of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Humane Learning well improved makes us capable of Divine. There is no Knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God is not the Authour: he would never have beſtowed any gift that ſhould lead us away from himſelf. It is an ignorant conceit, that inquiry into Nature ſhould make men Atheous. No man is ſo apt to ſee the Star of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a diligent diſciple of Philoſophy. Doubtleſſe this light was viſible unto more; onely they followed it, who knew it had more then nature. He is truly wiſe, that is wiſe for his own Soul. If theſe Wiſe men had been acquainted with all the other ſtars of heaven, and had not ſeen the Star of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they had had but light enough to lead them into utter darkneſſe. Philoſophie without this Star is but the wiſp of errour. Theſe Sages were in a mean between the Angels and the Shepherds. God would in all the ranks of intelligent Creatures have ſome to be witneſſes of his Son. The Angels direct the Shepherds, the Star guides the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: the duller capacitie hath the more clear and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full helps. The wiſedome of our good God proportions the means unto the diſpoſition of the perſons. Their Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy had taught them, this Star was not ordinary, whether in ſight, or in brightneſſe, or in motion. The eyes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might well ſee, that ſome ſtrange news was portended to the world by it: but that this Star deſigned the Birth of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> there needed yet another light. If the Star had not beſides had the commentary of a revelation from God, it could have led the Wiſe men onely into a fruitleſſe wonder. Give them to be the offspring of <hi>Balaam,</hi> yet the true Prediction of that falſe Prophet was not enough
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47750:16"/>
warrant. If he told them, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould ariſe as a Star out of <hi>Jacob,</hi> he did not tell them that a Star ſhould ariſe far from the poſterity of <hi>Jacob</hi> at the birth of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> He that did put that Prophecy into the mouth of <hi>Balaam,</hi> did alſo put this Illumination into the heart of the Sages. The Spirit of God is free to breathe where he liſteth. <hi>Many ſhall come from the Eaſt and the Weſt</hi> to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdom ſhall be ſhut out.</hi> Even then God did not ſo confine his election to the pale of the Church, as that he did not ſometimes look out for ſpecial inſtruments of his glory. Whither do theſe Sages come, but to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>? where ſhould they hope to hear of the new King, but in the Mother-city of the Kingdome? The conduct of the Star was firſt onely generall to <hi>Judaea</hi>; the reſt is for a time left to inquiry. They were not brought thither for their own ſakes, but for <hi>Jewrie</hi>'s, for the world's; that they might help to make the <hi>Jews</hi> inexcuſable, and the world faithfull. That their tongues therefore might blazon the birth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are brought to the Head-citie of <hi>Judaea,</hi> to report and inquire. Their wiſedome could not teach them to imagine, that a King could be born to <hi>Judaea</hi> of that note and magnificence, that a Star from Heaven ſhould publiſh him to the earth, and that his ſubjects ſhould not know it: and therefore, as preſuppoſing a common notice, they ſay, <hi>Where is he that is born King of the Jews?</hi> There is much deceit in probabilities, eſpecially when we meddle with ſpirituall matters. For God uſes ſtill to go a way by himſelf.</p>
            <p>If we judge according to reaſon and appearance, who is ſo likely to underſtand heavenly Truths as the profound Doctours of the world? Theſe God paſſes over, and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals</hi> his will to <hi>babes.</hi> Had theſe Sages met with the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of the villages near <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> they had received that intelligence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which they did vainly ſeek from the learned Scribes of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The greateſt Clerks are not alwaies the wiſeſt in the affairs of God: theſe things goe not by diſcourſe, but by revelation.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:47750:17"/>No ſooner hath the Star brought them within the noiſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then it is vaniſhed out of ſight. God would have their eyes lead them ſo far, as till their tongues might be ſet on work to win the vocal atteſtation of the chief Prieſts and Scribes to the fore-appointed place of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Nativity. If the Star had carried them directly to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the learned <hi>Jews</hi> had never ſearched the truth of thoſe Prophecies wherewith they are ſince juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. God never withdraws our helps, but for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage. However our hopes ſeem croſſed, where his Name may gain, we cannot complain of loſs.</p>
            <p>Little did the Sages think this Queſtion would have troubled <hi>Herod</hi>: they had (I fear) concealed their meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, if they had ſuſpected this event. Sure, they thought, it might be ſome Son or Grandchild of him which then held the Throne; ſo as this might win favour from <hi>Herod,</hi> rather then an unwelcome fear of rivality. Doubtleſs they went firſt to the Court; where elſe ſhould they ask for a King? The more pleaſing this news had been if it had faln upon <hi>Herod</hi>'s own loins, the more grievous it was to light upon a Stranger. If <hi>Herod</hi> had not over-much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Greatneſs, he had not upon thoſe indirect terms aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Crown of <hi>Jewry:</hi> ſo much the more therefore did it trouble him to hear the rumour of a Succeſſour, and that not of his own. Settled Greatneſs cannot abide ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther change, or partnerſhip. If any of his Subjects had moved this queſtion, I fear his head had anſwered it. It is well that the name of forreiners could excuſe theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. <hi>Herod</hi> could not be brought up among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not have heard many and confident reports of a <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that ſhould ere long ariſe out of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and now when he hears the fame of a King born, whom a Star from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſignifies and attends, he is nettled with the news. Every thing affrights the guilty. Uſurpation is full of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and fear, no leſs full of projects and imaginations: it makes us think every buſh a man, and every man a thief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47750:17"/>Why art thou troubled, O <hi>Herod?</hi> A King is born, but ſuch a King, as whoſe Scepter may ever concur with lawfull Sovereignty; yea ſuch a King, as by whom Kings do hold their Scepters, not loſe them. If the Wiſe men tell thee of a King, the Star tells thee he his Heavenly. Here is good cauſe of ſecurity, none of fear. The moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral enmities and oppoſitions to good ariſe from miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. If men could but know how much ſafety and ſweetneſs there is in all Divine truth, it could receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them but welcomes and gratulations. Miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits have been ſtill guilty of all wrongs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perſecutions. But if <hi>Herod</hi> were <hi>troubled,</hi> (as Tyranny is ſtill ſuſpicious,) why was <hi>all Jeruſalem troubled with him? Jeruſalem,</hi> which now might hope for a relaxation of her bonds, for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of her liberty and right? <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which now onely had cauſe to lift up her drooping head in the joy and happineſs of a Redeemer? Yet not onely <hi>Herod</hi>'s Court, but even <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was troubled. So had this miſerable City been over-toiled with change, that now they were ſettled in a condition quietly evil, they are troubled with the news of better. They had now got a habit of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and now they are ſo acquainted with the yoke, that the very noiſe of Liberty (which they ſuppoſed would not come with eaſe) began to be unwelcome.</p>
            <p>To turn the cauſes of joy into ſorrow, argues extreme dejectedneſs, and a diſtemper of judgment no leſs then deſperate. Fear puts on a viſour of Devotion. <hi>Herod</hi> calls his learned counſell, and, as not doubting whether the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould be born, he asks where he ſhall be born. In the diſparition of that other light, there is a perpetually-fixed Star ſhining in the writings of the Prophets, that guides the chief Prieſts and Scribes directly unto <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> As yet envy and prejudice had not blinded the eyes and perverted the hearts of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Teachers; ſo as now they clearly juſtifie that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whom they afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and by thus juſtifying him condemn themſelves in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47750:18"/>
rejecting him. The water that is untroubled yields the viſage perfectly. If God had no more witneſs but from his enemies, we have ground enough of our faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> feared, but diſſembled his fear, as thinking it a ſhame that ſtrangers ſhould ſee there could any power ariſe under him worthy of his reſpect or awe. Out of an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs therefore to diſcover the impotency of his paſſion, he makes little adoe of the matter, but onely, after a privy inquiſition into the time, imploys the informers in the ſearch of the perſon; <hi>Goe, and ſearch diligently for the Babe,</hi> &amp;c. It was no great journey from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi>; how eaſily might <hi>Herod</hi>'s cruelty have ſecretly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned ſome of his bloudy Courtiers to this inquiry and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? If God had not meant to mock him, before he found himſelf mocked of the Wiſe men, he had rather ſent before their journey, then after their diſappointment. But that God in whoſe hands all hearts are did purpoſely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot him, that he might not find the way to ſo horrible a miſchief.</p>
            <p>There is no Villany ſo great, but it will mask it ſelf under a ſhew of Piety: <hi>Herod</hi> will alſo worſhip the Babe. The courteſie of a falſe Tyrant is death. A crafty Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite never means ſo ill, as when he ſpeaketh faireſt. The Wiſe men are upon their way full of expectation, full of deſire: I ſee no man either of the City or Court to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them. Whether diſtruſt or fear hindred them, I inquire not: but of ſo many thouſand <hi>Jews,</hi> no one ſtirs his foot to ſee that King of theirs, which Strangers came ſo far to viſit. Yet were not theſe reſolute Sages diſcouraged with this ſolitarineſs and ſmall reſpect, nor drawn to repent of their journey, as thinking, What do we come ſo far to honour a King whom no man will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge? what mean we to travel ſo many hundred miles to ſee that which the inhabitants will not look out to behold? but chearfully renew their journey to that place which the ancient light of Prophecy had deſigned.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47750:18"/>
And now behold, God encourages their holy forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from Heaven, by ſending them their firſt Guide; as if he had ſaid, What need ye care for the neglect of men, when ye ſee Heaven honours the King whom ye ſeek? What joy theſe Sages conceived when their eyes firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the re-appearance of that happy Star, they onely can tell, that, after a long and ſad night of Temptation, have ſeen the loving countenance of God ſhining forth upon their Souls. If with obedience and courage we can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the calling of God in difficult enterpriſes, we ſhall not want ſupplies of comfort. Let not us be wanting to God, we ſhall be ſure he cannot be wanting to us.</p>
            <p>He that led <hi>Iſrael</hi> by a Pillar of fire into the Land of Promiſe, leads the Wiſe men by a Star to the Promiſed ſeed. All his directions partake of that Light which is in him; for God is Light. This Star moves both ſlowly and low, as might be fitteſt for the pace, for the purpoſe of theſe Pilgrims. It is the goodneſs of God, that in thoſe means wherein we cannot reach him, he deſcends unto us. Surely, when the Wiſe men ſaw the Star ſtand ſtill, they looked about to ſee what Palace there might be near unto that ſtation, fit for the birth of a King; neither could they think that ſorry Shed was it which the Star meant to point out: but finding their guide ſettled over that baſe roof, they go in to ſee what gueſt it held. They enter, and, O God! what a King do they find? how poor? how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible? wrapt in clouts, laid in ſtraw, cradled in the manger, attended with beaſts? What a ſight was this, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the glorious promiſes of that Star, after the Predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Prophets, after the magnificence of their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?</p>
            <p>All their way afforded nothing ſo deſpicable as that Babe whom they came to worſhip. But as thoſe which could not have been wiſe men, unleſs they had known that the greateſt glories have ariſen from mean beginnings, they fall down, and worſhip that hidden Majeſty. This Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47750:19"/>
hath bred wonder in them, not contempt: they well knew the Star could not lie. They which ſaw his Star afar off in the Eaſt, when he lay ſwaddled in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> do alſo ſee his Royalty farther off, in the deſpiſed eſtate of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: a Royalty more then humane. They well knew that Stars did not uſe to attend earthly Kings; and if their aim had not been higher, what was a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> King to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Strangers? Anſwerable therefore hereunto was their adoration. Neither did they lift up empty hands to him whom they worſhipt, but preſented him with the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious commodities of their Country, <hi>Gold, Incenſe, Myrrh</hi>; not as thinking to enrich him with theſe, but by way of homage acknowledging him the Lord of theſe. If theſe Sages had been Kings, and had offered a Princely weight of Gold, the Bleſſed Virgin had not needed in her Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to have offered two young Pigeons, as the ſign of her penury. As God loves not empty hands, ſo he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures fulneſs by the affection. Let it be Gold, or Incenſe, or Myrrh, that we offer him, it cannot but pleaſe him, who doth not uſe to ask how much, but how good.</p>

            <head>V. The Purification.</head>
            <p>THere could be no impurity in the Son of God; and if the beſt ſubſtance of a pure Virgin carried in it any taint of <hi>Adam,</hi> that was ſcoured away by ſanctification in the womb; and yet the Son would be circumciſed, and the Mother purified. He that came to be ſin for us, would in our perſons be legally unclean, that, by ſatisfying the Law, he might take away our uncleanneſs. Though he were
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:47750:19"/>
exempted from the common condition of our birth, yet he would not deliver himſelf from thoſe ordinary rites that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the weakneſſe and blemiſhes of Humanity. He would fulfill one Law to abrogate it, another to ſatisfie it. He that was above the Law, would come under the Law, to free us from the Law. Not a day would be changed, either in the Circumciſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Purification of <hi>Mary.</hi> Here was neither convenience of place, nor of neceſſaries for ſo painfull a work, in the Stable of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>: yet he that made and gave the Law, will rather keep it with difficulty, then tranſgreſſe it with eaſe.</p>
            <p>Why wouldeſt thou, O Bleſſed Saviour, ſuffer that ſacred Foreskin to be cut off, but that, by the power of thy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the ſame might be done to our Souls that was done to thy Body? We cannot be therefore thine, if our hearts be uncircumciſed. Doe thou that in us which was done to thee for us; cut off the ſuperfluitie of our maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that we may be holy in and by thee, which for us wert content to be legally impure.</p>
            <p>There was ſhame in thy Birth, there was pain in thy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion. After a contemptible welcome into the world, that a ſharp Raſour ſhould paſſe through thy skin for our ſakes, (which can hardly endure to bleed for our own,) it was the praiſe of thy wonderfull mercy, in ſo early Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. What pain or contempt ſhould we refuſe for thee, that haſt made no ſpare of thy ſelf for us? Now is <hi>Bethlehem</hi> left with too much honour; there is <hi>Chriſt</hi> born, adored, circumciſed. No ſooner is the Bleſſed Virgin either able or allowed to walk then ſhe travels to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to perform her holy Rites for her ſelf, for her Son; to purifie her ſelf, to preſent her Son. She goes not to her own houſe at <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> ſhe goes to God's Houſe at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> If Purifying were a ſhadow, yet Thankſgiving is a ſubſtance. Thoſe whom God hath bleſſed with fruit of body, and ſafety of deliverance, if they make not their firſt journey to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, they partake more of the Unthankfullneſſe of <hi>Eve,</hi> then <hi>Marie</hi>'s Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47750:20"/>Her forty days therefore were no ſooner out, then <hi>Mary</hi> comes up to the holy City. The rumour of a new King born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was yet freſh at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſince the report of the Wiſe men: and what good news had this been for any pick-thank to carry to the Court, Here is the Babe whom the Star ſignified, whom the Sages inquired for, whom the Angels proclaimed, whom the Shepherds talkt of, whom the Scribes and High prieſts notified, whom <hi>Herod</hi> ſeeks after? Yet unto that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was troubled at the report of his Birth, is <hi>Chriſt</hi> come, and all tongues are ſo lockt up, that he which ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to ſeek him finds him not, who (as to countermine <hi>Herod</hi>) is come from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Dangers that are aloof off, and but poſſible, may not hinder us from the duty of our Devotion. God ſaw it not yet time to let looſe the fury of his adverſaries, whom he holds up like ſome eager maſtives, and then onely lets goe, when they ſhall moſt ſhame themſelves, and glorifie him.</p>
            <p>Well might the Bleſſed Virgin have wrangled with the Law, and challenged an immunity from all ceremonies of Purification. What ſhould I need purging, which did not conceive in ſin? This is for thoſe mothers whoſe births are unclean; mine is from God, which is purity it ſelf. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> reaches onely to thoſe women which have conceived ſeed; I conceived not this ſeed, but the Holy Ghoſt in me. The Law extends to the mothers of thoſe ſons which are under the Law; mine is above it. But, as one that cared more for her peace then her privilege, and more deſired to be free from offence then from labour and charge, ſhe dutifully fulfills the Law of that God whom ſhe carried in her womb and in her arms: like the Mother of him, who, though he knew <hi>the children of the Kingdome free,</hi> yet would pay tribute unto <hi>Caeſar:</hi> like the Mother of him, whom it <hi>behoved to fulfill all righteouſneſſe.</hi> And if ſhe were ſo officious in Ceremonies, as not to admit of any excuſe in the very Circumſtance of her Obedience, how much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47750:20"/>
more ſtrict was ſhe in the main Duties of morality? That Soul is fit for the Spirituall conception of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcioanbly ſcrupulous in obſerving all God's Commandments; whereas he hates all alliance to a negligent or froward Heart.</p>
            <p>The Law of Purification proclaims our Uncleanneſſe: The mother is not allowed after her child-birth to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sanctuary, or to touch any hallowed thing, till her ſet time be expired. What are we, whoſe very birth infects the mother that bears us? At laſt ſhe comes to the Temple; but with Sacrifices, either a Lamb and a Pigeon or Turtle, or (in the meaner eſtate) two Turtle-doves or young Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons; whereof one is for a Burnt-offering, the other for a Sin-offering; the one for Thankſgiving, the other for Expiation; for expiation of a double ſin, of the mother that conceived, of the child that was conceived. We are all born ſinners, and it is a juſt queſtion, whether we do more infect the world, or the world us. They are groſſe flatterers of nature that tell her ſhe is clean. If our lives had no ſin, we bring enough with us: the very infant, that lives not to ſin as <hi>Adam,</hi> yet ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and is ſinfull in himſelf. But oh the unſpeakable mercy of our God! we provide the Sin, he provides the Remedy. Behold an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation well-near as early as our Sin: the bloud of a young Lamb or Dove, yea rather the bloud of Him whoſe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence was repreſented by both, cleanſeth us preſently from our filthineſſe. Firſt went Circumciſion, then came the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; that, by two holy acts, that which was naturally unholy might be hallowed unto God. Under the Goſpell our Baptiſm hath the force of both: it does away our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by the Water of the Spirit; it applies to us the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Bloud, whereby we are cleanſed. Oh that we could magnifie this goodneſſe of our God, which hath not left our very infancy without redreſſe, but hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded helps whereby we may be delivered from the danger of our hereditary evils.</p>
            <p>Such is the favourable reſpect of our wiſe God, that he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47750:21"/>
would not have us undoe our ſelves with Devotion: the ſervice he requires of us is ruled by our abilities. Every poor mother was not able to bring a Lamb for her offering: there was none ſo poor but might procure a pair of Turtles or Pigeons. Theſe doth God both preſcribe, and accept from poorer hands, no leſſe then the beaſts of a thouſand mountains: He looks for ſomewhat of every one, not of every one alike. Since it is he that makes differences of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, (to whom it were as eaſie to make all rich,) his mercy will make no difference in the acceptation. The truth and heartineſs of Obedience is that which he will crown in his meaneſt ſervants. A Mite from the poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow is more worth to him then the Talents of the wealthy.</p>
            <p>After all the preſents of thoſe Eaſtern Worſhippers, (who intended rather homage then ditation,) the Bleſſed Virgin comes in the form of poverty with her two Doves unto God. She could not without ſome charge lie all this while at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhe could not without charge travell from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Her offering confeſſeth her Penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The beſt are not ever the wealthieſt. Who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe any one for want, when the Mother of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not rich enough to bring a Lamb for her purification? We may be as happy in ruſſet, as in tiſſue.</p>
            <p>While the Bleſſed Virgin brought her Son into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with that pair of Doves, here were more Doves then a pair: They for whoſe ſake that Offering was brought, were more Doves, then the Doves that were brought for that Offering. Her Son, for whom ſhe brought that Dove to be ſacrificed, was that Sacrifice which the Dove repreſented. There was nothing in him but perfection of innocence, and the oblation of him is that whereby all mothers and ſons are fully purified. Since in our ſelves we cannot be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, happy are we, if we can have the ſpotleſs Dove ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us, to make us innocent in him.</p>
            <p>The Bleſſed Virgin had more buſineſs in the Temple then her own; ſhe came, as to purifie her ſelf, ſo to preſent her
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47750:21"/>
Son. Every male that firſt opened the womb was holy unto the Lord. He that was the Son of God by eternal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before times, and by miraculous conception in time, was alſo by common courſe of nature conſecrate unto God. It is fit the Holy Mother ſhould preſent God with his own: Her firſt-born was <hi>the firſt-born of all creatures.</hi> It was he, whoſe Temple it was that he was preſented in, to whom all the firſt-born of all creatures were conſecrated, by whom they were accepted; and now is he brought in his mother's arms to his own Houſe, and as Man is preſented to himſelf as God. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had never written a Law of God's ſpecial propriety in the firſt-born, this Son of God's Eſſence and Love had taken poſſeſſion of the Temple; his right had been a perfect Law to himſelf: Now his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to that Law, which himſelf had given, doth no leſs call him thither, then the challenge of his peculiar intereſt.</p>
            <p>He that was the Lord of all creatures, ever ſince he ſtruck the firſt-born of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> requires the firſt male of all creatures, both man and beaſt, to be dedicated to him: wherein God cauſed a miraculous event to ſecond nature, which ſeems to challenge the firſt and beſt for the Maker. By this rule, God ſhould have had his ſervice done onely by the Heirs of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> But ſince God, for the honour and remuneration of <hi>Levi,</hi> had choſen out that Tribe to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter unto him, now the firſt-born of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to God as his due, but by allowance redeemed to their parents. As for Beaſts, the firſt male of the clean beaſts muſt be ſacrificed, of unclean exchanged for a price. So much morality is there in this conſtitution of God, that the beſt of all kinds is fit to be conſecrated to the Lord of all. Every thing we have is too good for us, if we think any thing we have too good for him.</p>
            <p>How glorious did the Temple now ſeem, that the Owner was within the walls of it? Now was the hour and gueſt come, in regard whereof the ſecond Temple ſhould ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47750:22"/>
the firſt: this was his Houſe built for him, dedicated to him; there had he dwelt long in his ſpiritual Preſence, in his typicall. There was nothing either placed or done within thoſe walls whereby he was not reſembled; and now the Body of thoſe Shadows is come, and preſents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf where he had been ever repreſented. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is now every-where: There is no Church, no Chriſtian heart, which is not a Temple of the living God: There is no Temple of God wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not preſented to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Look upon him (O God) in whom thou art well pleaſed, and in him and for him be well pleaſed with us.</p>
            <p>Under the Goſpel we are all firſt-born, all heirs; every Soul is to be holy unto the Lord; we are <hi>a Royal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an holy Prieſthood.</hi> Our Baptiſm, as it is our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and our ſacrifice of Purification, ſo is it alſo our Preſentation unto God. Nothing can become us but Holineſs. O God, to whom we are devoted, ſerve thy ſelf of us, glorifie thy ſelf by us, till we ſhall by thee be glorified with thee.</p>

            <p>WEll might theſe Wiſe men have ſuſpected <hi>Herod</hi>'s Secrecy: If he had meant well, what needed that whiſpering? That which they publiſhed in the ſtreets, he asks in his privy-chamber: yet they, not miſdoubting his intention, purpoſe to fulfill his charge.

ſee, it was not Fancy that led them, but an aſſured Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. That God which brought them thither diverted them, and cauſed their eyes to ſhut, to guide them the beſt way home.</p>
            <p>Theſe Sages made a happy voiage, for now they grew into farther acquaintance with God: They are honoured with a ſecond Meſſenger from Heaven: They ſaw the Star in the way, the Angel in their bed. The Star guided their journey unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Angel directed their return. They ſaw the Star by day, a Viſion by night. God ſpake to their eyes by the Star, he ſpeaks to their heart by a Dream. No doubt, they had left much noiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them: they that did ſo publiſh his Birth by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not be ſilent when they found him at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> If they had returned by <hi>Herod,</hi> I fear they had come ſhort home. He that meant death to the Babe for the name of a King, could mean no other to thoſe that honoured and proclaimed a new King, and erected a throne beſides his. They had done what they came for; and now that God whoſe buſineſs they came about takes order at once for his Son's ſafety, and for theirs. God, who is Perfection it ſelf, never begins any buſineſs, but he makes an end, and ends happily. When our ways are his, there is no danger of miſcarriage.</p>
            <p>Well did theſe Wiſe men know the difference, as of Stars, ſo of Dreams; they had learned to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the natural and divine: and once apprehending God in their ſleep, they follow him waking, and <hi>return another way.</hi> They were no Subjects to <hi>Herod,</hi> his command preſſed them ſo much the leſs: or if the being within his dominions had been no leſs bond then native ſubjection, yet where God did countermand <hi>Herod,</hi> there could be no queſtion whom to obey. They ſay not, We are in a ſtrange Country, <hi>Herod</hi> may meet with us, it can be no leſs then death to mock him in his own territories; but chearfully put themſelves upon the way, and truſt God with the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.

When men command with God, we muſt obey men for God, and God in men; when againſt him, the beſt obedience is to deny obedience, and to turn our backs upon <hi>Herod.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wiſe men are ſafely arrived in the Eaſt, and fill the world full of expectation, as themſelves are full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> are returned with the Babe to that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the Wiſe men had inquired for his Birth. The City was doubtleſs ſtill full of that rumour, and little thinks, that he whom they talk of was ſo near them. From thence they are at leaſt in their way to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where they purpoſe their abode. God prevents them by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and ſends them for ſafety into <hi>Egypt. Joſeph</hi> was not wont to be ſo full of Viſions: It was not long ſince the Angel appeared unto him to juſtifie the innocency of the Mother, and the Deity of the Son; now he appears for the preſervation of both, and a preſervation by flight. Could <hi>Joſeph</hi> now chuſe but think, Is this the King that muſt ſave <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that needs to be ſaved by me? If he be the Son of God, how is he ſubject to the violence of men? How is he Almighty, that muſt ſave himſelf by flight? or how muſt he flie to ſave himſelf out of that land, which he comes to ſave? But faithful <hi>Joſeph</hi> having been once tutoured by the Angel, and having heard what the Wiſe men ſaid of the Star, what <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Anna</hi> ſaid in the Temple, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not ſo much to reconcile his thoughts, as to ſubject them; and, as one that knew it ſafer to ſuppreſs doubts then to aſſoil them, can believe what he underſtands not, and can wonder where he cannot comprehend.</p>
            <p>Oh ſtrange condition of the King of all the world! He could not be born in a baſer eſtate, yet even this he cannot enjoy with ſafety. There was no room for him in <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem,</hi> there will be no room for him in <hi>Judaea.</hi> He is no ſooner come to his own, then he muſt flie from them; that he may ſave them, he muſt avoid them. Had it not been eaſie for thee (O Saviour) to have acquit thy ſelf from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:47750:23"/>
               <hi>Herod</hi> a thouſand ways? What could an arm of fleſh have done againſt the God of ſpirits? What had it been for thee to have ſent <hi>Herod</hi> five years ſooner unto his place? what to have commanded fire from heaven on thoſe that ſhould have come to apprehend thee? or to have bidden the earth to receive them alive, whom ſhe meant to ſwallow dead? We ſuffer miſery, becauſe we muſt; thou, becauſe thou wouldeſt. The ſame will that brought thee from Heaven into earth, ſends thee from <hi>Jewry</hi> to <hi>Egypt.</hi> As thou wouldſt be born mean and miſerable, ſo thou wouldſt live ſubject to humane vexations; that thou, who haſt taught us how good it is to bear the yoke even in our youth, mightſt ſanctifie to us early afflictions. Or whether, O Father, ſince it was the purpoſe of thy wiſedom to manifeſt thy Son by degrees unto the world, was it thy will thus to hide him for a time under our infirmity? And what other is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? we are no ſooner born thine, then we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted. If the Church travail, and bring forth a male, ſhe is in danger of the Dragons ſtreams. What do the Members complain of the ſame meaſure which was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Head? Both our Births are accompanied with Tears.</p>
            <p>Even of thoſe whoſe mature age is full of trouble, yet the infancy is commonly quiet: but here life and toil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan together. O Bleſſed Virgin, even already did the <hi>ſword</hi> begin to <hi>pierce thy Soul.</hi> Thou which wert forced to bear thy Son in thy womb from <hi>Nazareth</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> muſt now bear him in thy arms from <hi>Jewry</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Yet couldſt thou not complain of the way, whileſt thy Saviour was with thee: His preſence alone was able to make the Stable a Temple, <hi>Egypt</hi> a Paradiſe, the way more pleaſing then reſt. But whither then, O whither doſt thou carry that bleſſed burthen, by which thy ſelf and the world are upholden? To <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Slaughter-houſe of God's people, the Furnace of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ancient affliction, the Sink of the world: <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</hi> ſaith God. That
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47750:24"/>
thou calledſt thy Son out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> O God, is no marvell. It is a marvell that thou calledſt him into <hi>Egypt</hi>; but that we know, all earths are thine, and all places and men are like figures upon a table, ſuch as thy diſpoſition makes them. What a change is here? <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the firſt-born of God, flies out of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the promiſed Land of <hi>Judaea. Chriſt,</hi> the firſt-born of all creatures, flies from <hi>Judaea</hi> into <hi>Egypt. Egypt</hi> is become the Sanctuary, <hi>Judaea</hi> the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-houſe of the Son of God. He, that is every where the ſame, makes all places alike to his: He makes the fiery Furnace a Gallery of pleaſure, the Lions den an houſe of defence, the Whales belly a lodging-chamber, <hi>Egypt</hi> an harbour.</p>
            <p>He flees, that was able to preſerve himſelf from danger; to teach us, how lawfully we may flee from thoſe dangers we cannot avoid otherwiſe. It is a thankleſs fortitude, to offer our throat unto the knife. He that came to die for us fled for his own preſervation, and hath bid us follow him; <hi>When they perſecute you in one City, flee into another.</hi> We have but the uſe of our lives, and we are bound to husband them to the beſt advantage of God and his Church. God hath made us, not as Butts to be perpetually ſhot at, but as the marks of Rovers movable, as the wind and ſun may beſt ſerve.</p>
            <p>It was warrant enough for <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> that God commands them to flee; yet ſo familiar is God grown with his approved ſervants, that he gives them the reaſon of his commanded flight: <hi>For Herod will ſeek the young child, to deſtroy him.</hi> What wicked men will do, what they would doe, is known unto God beforehand. He that is ſo infinitely wiſe to know the deſigns of his enemies before they are, could as eaſily prevent them, that they might not be: but he lets them run on in their own courſes, that he may fetch glory to himſelf out of their wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Joſeph,</hi> having this charge in the night, ſtaies not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47750:24"/>
till the morning: no ſooner had God ſaid, <hi>Ariſe,</hi> then he ſtarts up and ſets forward. It was not diffidence, but obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that did ſo haſten his departure. The charge was direct, the buſineſs important. He dares not linger for the light, but breaks his reſt for the journey, and taking advantage of the dark, departs toward <hi>Egypt.</hi> How knew he this occaſion would abide any delay? We cannot be too ſpeedy in the execution of Gods commands, we may be too late. Here was no treaſure to hide, no hangings to take down, no lands to ſecure: The poor Carpenter needs do no more but lock the doors, and away. He goes lightly that wants a load. If there be more pleaſure in abundance, there is more ſecurity in a mean eſtate. The Buſtard or the Oſtridge, when he is purſued, can hardly get upon his wings; whereas the Lark mounts with eaſe. The rich hath not ſo much advantage of the poor in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, as the poor hath of the rich in leaving.</p>
            <p>Now is <hi>Joſeph</hi> come down into <hi>Egypt. Egypt</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the Name, as that whereto it did owe no leſs then their univerſal preſervation. Well might it repay this act of Hoſpitality to that Name and Bloud. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging down into <hi>Egypt</hi> had not ſo much difficulty as the ſtaying there. Their abſence from their Country was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better then a Baniſhment. But what was this other, then to ſerve a Prentiſhip in the houſe of bondage? To be any-were ſave at home was irkſome: but to be in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo many years amongſt idolatrous Pagans, muſt needs be painfull to religious hearts. The Command of their God, and the Preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes amends for all. How long ſhould they have thought it to ſee the Temple of God, if they had not had the God of the Temple with them? how long to preſent their Sacrifices at the Altar of God, if they had not had him with them who made all Sacrifices accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and who did accept the Sacrifice of their Hearts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> was ſubtle in mocking the Wiſe men, whiles he promiſed to worſhip him whom he meant to kill. Now
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47750:25"/>
God makes the Wiſe men to mock him, in diſappointing his expectation. It is juſt with God, to puniſh thoſe which would beguile others with illuſion. Great ſpirits are ſo much more impatient of diſgrace. How did <hi>Herod</hi> now rage and fret, and vainly wiſh to have met with thoſe falſe ſpies, and tell with what torments he would revenge their treachery, and curſe himſelf for truſting Strangers in ſo important a buſineſs?</p>
            <p>The Tyrants ſuſpicion would not let him reſt long: Ere many days he ſends to inquire of them, whom he ſent to inquire of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The notice of their ſecret departure increaſeth his jealouſie; and now his anger runs mad, and his fear proves deſperate. All the Infants of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> ſhall bleed for this one. And (that he may make ſure work) he cuts out to himſelf large meaſures both of time and place. It was but very lately that the Star appeared, that the Wiſe men re-appeared not: They asked for him that was born, they did not name when he was born: <hi>Herod,</hi> for more ſecurity, over-reaches their time, and fetches into the ſlaughter all the Children of two years age. The Prieſts and Scribes had told him, the Town of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> muſt be the place of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>'s nativity: He fetches in all the Children of the coaſts adjoyning; yea, his own ſhall for the time be a <hi>Bethlehemite.</hi> A tyrannous guiltineſs never thinks it ſelf ſafe, but ever ſeeks to aſſure it ſelf in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of cruelty. Doubtleſs he, who ſo privily inquired for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did as ſecretly brew this Maſſacre. The Mothers were ſet with their Children on their laps, feeding them with the breaſt, or talking to them in the familiar language of their love, when ſuddenly the Executioner ruſhes in, and ſnatches them from their arms; and at once pulling forth his Commiſſion and his Knife, without regard to ſhrieks or tears, murthers the innocent Babe, and leaves the paſſionate Mother in a mean between madneſs and death. What curſing of <hi>Herod</hi>? what wringing of hands? what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling? what exclaiming was now in the ſtreets of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:47750:25"/>O bloudy <hi>Herod,</hi> that couldſt ſacrifice ſo many harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs lives to thine Ambition! What could thoſe Infants have done? If it were thy perſon whereof thou wert afraid, what likelihood was it thou couldſt live till thoſe Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings might endanger thee? This news might affect thy Succeſſours, it could not concern thee, if the heat of an impotent and furious envy had not made thee thirſty of bloud. It is not long that thou ſhalt enjoy this cruelty: After a few hatefull years thy ſoul ſhall feel the weight of ſo many Innocents, of ſo many juſt Curſes. He, for whoſe ſake thou killedſt ſo many, ſhall ſtrike thee with death; and then what wouldeſt thou have given to have been as one of thoſe Infants whom thou murtheredſt? In the mean time, when thine Executioners returned, and told thee of their unpartial diſpatch, thou ſmiledſt to think how thou hadſt defeated thy Rival, and beguiled the Star, and eluded the Prophecies; whiles God in Heaven and his Son on earth laugh thee to ſcorn, and make thy rage an occaſion of farther glory to him whom thou meanteſt to ſuppreſs.</p>
            <p>He that could take away the lives of others cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract his own. <hi>Herod</hi> is now ſent home. The coaſt is clear for the return of that Holy Family. Now God calls them from their Exile. <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Mother had not ſtayed ſo long out of the confines of the reputed viſible Church, but to teach us continuance under the Croſs. Sometimes God ſees it good for us, not to ſip of the cup of Affliction, but to make a diet-drink of it, for conſtant and common uſe. If he allows us no other liquour for many years, we muſt take it off chearfully, and know that it is but the meaſure of our betters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> ſtir not without a Command; their Departure, Stay, Removal is ordered by the voice of God. If <hi>Egypt</hi> had been more tedious unto them, they durſt not move their foot till they were bidden. It is good in our own buſineſs to follow Reaſon or Cuſtome: but in God's
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47750:26"/>
buſineſs, if we have any other guide but himſelf, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and cannot expect a bleſſing.</p>
            <p>O the wonderfull diſpenſation of God in concealing of himſelf from men! <hi>Chriſt</hi> was now ſome five years old: he bears himſelf as an Infant, and, knowing all things, neither takes nor gives notice of ought concerning his removall and diſpoſing, but appoints that to be done by his Angel, which the Angel could not have done but by him. Since he would take our nature, he would be a perfect child, ſuppreſſing the manifeſtation and exerciſe of that Godhead whereto that Infant nature was conjoined. Even ſo, O Saviour, the Humility of thine Infancy was anſwerable to that of thy Birth. The more thou hideſt and abaſeſt thy ſelf for us, the more ſhould we magnifie thee, the more ſhould we deject our ſelves for thee. Unto thee with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glory, now and for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>EVen the Spring ſhews us what we may hope for of the tree in Summer. In his Nonage therefore would our Saviour give us a taſte of his future proof, leſt if his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould have ſhewed it ſelf without warning to the world, it ſhould have been entertained with more wonder then belief; now this act of his Childhood ſhall prepare the faith of men by fore-expectation. Notwithſtanding all this ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demonſtration of his Divine graces, the incredulous <hi>Jews</hi> could afterwards ſay, <hi>Whence hath this man his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47750:26"/>
and great works?</hi> What would they have ſaid, if he had ſuddenly leapt forth into the clear light of the world? The Sun would dazzle all eyes, if he ſhould break forth at his firſt riſing into his full ſtrength: now he hath both the Day-ſtar to goe before him, and to bid men look for that glorious body, and the lively colours of the Day, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his approach; the eye is comforted, not hurt by his appearance.</p>
            <p>The Parents of <hi>Chriſt</hi> went up yearly to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the feaſt of the Paſsover; the Law was onely for the males. I do not find the Bleſſed Virgin bound to this voiage; the weaker ſex received indulgence from God: yet ſhe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſpirituall profit of that journey, takes pains volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to meaſure that long way every year. Piety regards not any diſtinction of ſexes or degrees, neither yet doth God's acceptation: rather doth it pleaſe the mercy of the Higheſt, more to reward that ſervice which, though he like in all, yet out of favour he will not impoſe upon all. It could not be but that ſhe whom the Holy Ghoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed ſhould be zealous of God's ſervice. Thoſe that will goe no farther then they are dragged in their religious exerciſes, are no whit of kin to her whom all generations ſhall call bleſſed.</p>
            <p>The Child <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the minority of his age went up with his Parents to the holy Solemnity, not this year one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in all likelihood others alſo. He in the power of whoſe Godhead, and by the motion of whoſe Spirit, all others aſcended thither, would not himſelf ſtay at home. In all his Examples he meant our inſtruction: this pious act of his Nonage intended to lead our firſt years into time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Devotion. The firſt liquor ſeaſons the veſſell for a long time after. It is every way good for a man to bear God's yoke even from his infancy: it is the policie of the Devill to diſcourage early Holineſs. He that goes out betimes in the morning, is more like to diſpatch his journey, then he that lingers till the day be ſpent. This bleſſed Family
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47750:27"/>
came not to look at the feaſt and be gone; but they duly ſtaid out all the appointed days of unlevened bread. They and the reſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not want houſhold-buſineſſes at home: thoſe ſecular affairs could not either keep them from repairing to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or ſend them away immature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Worldly cares muſt give place to ſacred. Except we will depart unbleſſed, we muſt attend God's ſervices till we may receive his diſmiſſion.</p>
            <p>It was the faſhion of thoſe times and places, that they went up, (and ſo returned,) by troups to thoſe ſet meetings of their holy Feſtivals. The whole Pariſh of <hi>Nazareth</hi> went and came together. Good fellowſhip doth no way ſo well as in the paſſage to Heaven: much comfort is added by ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety to that journey, which is of it ſelf pleaſant. It is an happy word, <hi>Come, let us go up to the houſe of the Lord.</hi> Mutuall incouragement is none of the leaſt benefits of our holy Aſſemblies. Many ſticks laid together make a good fire, which if they lie ſingle, loſe both their light and heat.</p>
            <p>The Feaſt ended, what ſhould they doe but return to <hi>Nazareth?</hi> God's ſervices may not be ſo attended, as that we ſhould neglect our particular callings. Himſelf calls us from his own houſe to ours, and takes pleaſure to ſee a painfull Client. They are foully miſtaken, that think God cares for no other trade but Devotion. Piety and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence muſt keep meet changes with each other: neither doth God leſs accept of our return to <hi>Nazareth,</hi> then our going up to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot think that the Bleſſed Virgin, or good <hi>Joſeph,</hi> could be ſo negligent of their Divine charge, as not to call the Child <hi>Jeſus</hi> to their ſetting forth from <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But their back was no ſooner turned upon the Temple, then his face was towards it: He had buſineſs in that place, when theirs was ended: there he was both worſhipped, and repreſented. He, <hi>in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily,</hi> could doe nothing without God: His true Father led him away from his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Sometimes the affairs of our ordinary vocation may
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47750:27"/>
not grudge to yield unto ſpiritual occaſions. The Parents of <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew him well to be of a diſpoſition, nor ſtrange, nor ſullen and Stoical, but ſweet and ſociable: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſuppoſed he had ſpent the time and the way in company of their friends and neighbours. They do not ſuſpect him wandered into the ſolitary fields: but when evening came, they go to ſeek him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. If he had not wonted to converſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with them, he had not now been ſought amongſt them. Neither as God, nor Man, doth he take pleaſure in a ſtern froward auſterity, and wild retiredneſs; but in a mild affableneſs, and amiable converſation.</p>
            <p>But, O Bleſſed Virgin, who can expreſs the ſorrows of thy perplexed ſoul, wben all that evening-ſearch could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford thee no news of thy Son <hi>Jeſus?</hi> Was not this one of thoſe Swords of <hi>Simeon,</hi> which ſhould pierce through thy tender breaſt? How didſt thou chide thy credulous neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, in not obſerving ſo precious a charge, and blame thine eyes, for once looking beſide this object of thy love? How didſt thou, with thy carefull Husband ſpend that reſtleſs night in mutual expoſtulations, and bemoanings of your loſs? How many ſuſpicious imaginations did that while rack thy grieved ſpirit? Perhaps thou migteſt doubt, leſt they which laid for him, by <hi>Herod</hi>'s command, at his birth, had now by the ſecret inſtigation of <hi>Archelaus</hi> ſurpriſed him in his childhood. Or it may be thou thoughteſt thy Divine Son had now withdrawn himſelf from the earth, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his Heavenly Glory, without warning. Or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture thou ſtudiedſt with thy ſelf, whether any care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs on thy behalf had not given occaſion to this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>O dear Saviour, who can miſs, and not mourn for thee? Never any ſoul conceived thee by faith, that was leſs afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſenſe of thy deſertion, then comforted with the joy of thy preſence. Juſt is that ſorrow, and thoſe tears ſeaſonable, that are beſtowed upon thy loſs. What
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47750:28"/>
comfort are we capable of, whiles we want thee? What reliſh is there in theſe earthly delights without thee? What is there to mitigate our paſſionate diſcomforts, if not from thee? Let thy ſelf looſe, O my ſoul, to the fulneſs of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when thou findeſt thy ſelf bereaved of him, <hi>in whoſe preſence is the fulneſs of joy</hi>; and deny to receive comfort from any thing ſave from his return.</p>
            <p>In vain is <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſought among his kindred according to the fleſh. So far are they ſtill from giving us their aid to find the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that they lead us from him. Back again therefore are <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> gone to ſeek him at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> She <hi>goes about in the City, by the ſteets and by the open places, and ſeeks him whom her ſoul loveth: ſhe ſought him</hi> for the time, <hi>and found him not.</hi> Do we think ſhe ſpared her ſearch? The evening of her return ſhe haſtes to the Inn where ſhe had left him; where miſſing him, ſhe inquires of every one ſhe met, <hi>Have you not ſeen him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> At laſt, the third day, ſhe finds him in the Temple. One day was ſpent in the journey towards <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> another in the return to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; the third day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers him. He, who would riſe again the third day, and be found amongſt the living, now alſo would the third day be found of his Parents, after the ſorrow of his abſence. But where wert thou, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> for the ſpace of theſe three days? where didſt thou beſtow thy ſelf, or who tended thee, whilſt thou wert thus alone at <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> I know, if <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould have been as unkind to thee as <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> thou couldſt have commanded the Heavens to harbour thee; and if men did not miniſter to thee, thou couldſt have commanded the ſervice of Angels. But ſince the form of a ſervant called thee to a voluntary homelineſs, whether it pleaſed thee to exerciſe thy ſelf thus early with the difficulties of a ſtranger, or to provide miraculouſly for thy ſelf, I inquire not, ſince thou revealeſt not; onely this I know, that hereby thou intendedſt to teach thy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that thou couldſt live without them; and that not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:47750:28"/>
of any indigency, but out of a gracious diſpenſation, thou wouldſt ordinarily depend upon their care.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, thy Divine wiſedome could not but fore-know all theſe corroding thoughts wherewith the heart of thy dear Mother muſt needs bleed, through this ſudden dereliction; yet wouldſt thou leave her for the time to her ſorrow. Even ſo, O Saviour, thou thoughteſt fit to viſit her that bore thee with this early affliction. Never any loved thee, whom thou doſt not ſometimes exerciſe with the grief of miſſing thee; that both we may be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to hold thee, and more joyfull in recovering thee. Thou haſt ſaid, and canſt not lie, <hi>I am with you to the end of the world:</hi> but even whiles thou art really preſent, thou thinkeſt good to be abſent unto our apprehenſions. Yet if thou leave us, thou wilt not forſake us; if thou leave us for our humiliation, thou wilt not forſake us to our finall diſcomfort: thou mayeſt for three days hide thy ſelf, but then we ſhall find thee in the Temple. None ever ſought thee with a ſincere deſire of whom thou wert not found. Thou wilt not be either ſo little abſent, as not to whet our appetites, nor ſo long, as to fainten the heart. After three days we ſhall find thee: and where ſhould we rather hope to find thee then in the Temple? There is the <hi>habitation for the God of Iſrael,</hi> there is thy <hi>reſting-place for ever.</hi> Oh all ye that are grieved with the want of your Saviour, ſee where you muſt ſeek him. In vain ſhall ye hope to find him in the ſtreets, in the Taverns, in the Theaters: ſeek him in his holy Temple. Seek him with piety, ſeek him with faith, there ſhall ye meet him, there ſhall ye recover him. Whilſt Children of that age were playing in the ſtreets, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was found ſitting in the Temple; not to gaze on the outward glory of that Houſe, or on the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks or Tables, but to hear and appoſe the Doctours. He who, as God, gave them all the wiſedome they had, as the Son of man hearkens to the wiſedom he had given them. He, who ſate in their Hearts, as the Authour of all learning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:47750:29"/>
and knowledge, ſits in the midſt of their School as an humble Diſciple: that by learning of them, he might teach all the younger ſort humility, and due attendance upon their Inſtructors. He could at the firſt have taught the great Rabbins of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the deep myſteries of God: but becauſe he was not yet called by his Father to the publick function of a Teacher, he contents himſelf to hear with diligence, and to ask with modeſty, and to teach onely by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let thoſe conſider this, who will needs run as ſoon as they can go; and when they find ability, think they need not ſtay for a farther vocation of God or men. Open your eyes, ye rathe-ripe invaders of God's Chair; and ſee your Saviour in his younger years, not ſitting in the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent pulpits of the Doctours, but in the lowly floors of the Auditours. See him, that could have taught the Angels, liſtning in his minority to the voice of men. Who can think much to learn of the Ancients, when he looks upon the Son of God ſitting at the feet of the Doctours of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Firſt he hears, then he asks. How much more doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us to be Hearers ere we offer to be Teachers of others? He gathers that hears, he ſpends that teacheth. If we ſpend before we gather, we ſhall ſoon prove bankrupts.</p>
            <p>When he hath heard, he asks, and after that he anſwers. Doubtleſs thoſe very Queſtions were Inſtruction, and meant to teach more then to learn. Never had theſe great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins heard the voice of ſuch a Tutor; in whom they might ſee the wiſedom of God ſo concealing it ſelf, that yet it would be known to be there. No marvel then if <hi>they all wondred at his underſtanding and anſwers.</hi> Their eyes ſaw nothing but humane weakneſs, their ears heard Divine ſublimity of matter: betwixt what they ſaw and what they heard, they could not but be diſtracted with a doubting admiration. And why did ye not (O ye <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Teachers) remember, <hi>That to us a Child is born, and unto us a Son is given, and the government is upon his ſhoulder, and his name ſhall be called Wonderfull, Counſellor, the mighty God; the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:47750:29"/>
everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace?</hi> Why did ye not now bethink your ſelves what the Star, the Sages, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, the Shepherds, <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Anna,</hi> had premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed you? Fruitleſs is the wonder that endeth not in faith. No Light is ſufficient, where the eyes are held through unbelief or prejudice.</p>
            <p>The Doctours were not more amazed to hear ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found a Childhood, then the Parents of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were to ſee him among the Doctours: the joy of finding him did ſtrive with the aſtoniſhment of finding him thus. And now, not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> (he knew how little right he had to that Divine Son) but <hi>Mary</hi> breaks forth into a loving expoſtulation, <hi>Son, why haſt thou dealt ſo with us?</hi> That ſhe might not ſeem to take upon her as an imperious Mother, it is like ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this queſtion till ſhe had him alone: wherein ſhe meant rather to expreſs grief then correption. Onely here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Bleſſed Virgin offended, that her inconſideration did not ſuppoſe, (as it was,) that ſome higher reſpects then could be due to fleſh and bloud called away the Son of God from her that was the daughter of Man. She, that was but the mother of Humanity, ſhould not have thought that the buſineſs of God muſt for her ſake be neglected. We are all partial to our ſelves naturally, and prone to the regard of our own rights. Queſtionleſs this gracious Saint would not for all the world have willingly preferred her own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence to that of her God: through heedleſneſs ſhe doeth ſo. Her Son and Saviour is her monitour, out of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love reforming her natural: <hi>How is it that ye ſought me? Know ye not that I muſt go about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> Immediately before the Bleſſed Virgin had ſaid, <hi>Thy Father &amp; I ſought thee with heavy hearts:</hi> Wherein, both, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſuppoſition of the world, ſhe calleth <hi>Joſeph</hi> the Father of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and, according to the faſhion of a dutifull wife, ſhe names her <hi>Joſeph</hi> before her ſelf. She well knew that <hi>Joſeph</hi> had nothing but a name in this buſineſs, ſhe knew how God had dignified her beyond him; yet ſhe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47750:30"/>
ſays, <hi>Thy Father and I ſought thee.</hi> The Son of God ſtands not upon contradiction to his mother, but leading her thoughts from his ſuppoſed Father to his true, from earth to heaven, he anſwers; <hi>Knew ye not that I muſt go about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> It was honour enough to her, that he had vouchſafed to take fleſh of her. It was his eternall Honour, that he was <hi>God of God,</hi> the everlaſting Son of the heavenly Father: Good reaſon therefore was it, that the reſpects to fleſh ſhould give place to the God of Spirits. How well contented was Holy <hi>Mary</hi> with ſo juſt an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer? how doth ſhe now again in her heart renew her anſwer to the Angel, <hi>Behold the ſervant of the Lord, be it according to thy word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are all the Sons of God in another kind, Nature and the World think we ſhould attend them. We are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſay we have a Father in Heaven, if we cannot ſteal away from theſe earthly diſtractions, and imploy our ſelves in the ſervices of our God.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>JOhn</hi> did every way forerun <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not ſo much in the time of his Birth, as in his Office: neither was there more unlikelineſs in their diſpoſition and carriage, then ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude in their function. Both did preach and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize: onely <hi>John</hi> baptized by himſelf, our Saviour by his Diſciples. Our Saviour wrought miracles by himſelf, by his Diſciples; <hi>John</hi> wrought none by either. Wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> meant to ſhew himſelf a Lord, and <hi>John</hi> a Servant; and <hi>John</hi> meant to approve himſelf a true Servant to him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47750:30"/>
whoſe Harbinger he was. He that leapt in the womb of his mother when his Saviour (then newly conceived) came in preſence, beſtir'd himſelf when he was brought forth into the light of the Church, to the honour and ſervice of his Saviour. He did the ſame before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> charged his Diſciples to doe after him, preach and baptize. The Goſpel ran always in one tenour, and was never but like it ſelf. So it became the Word of him, in whom <hi>there is no ſhadow by turning,</hi> and whoſe Word it is, <hi>I am Jehova, I change not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was fit that he which had the Prophets, the Star, the Angel to foretell his coming into the world, ſhould have his Uſher to go before him, when he would notifie himſelf to the world. <hi>John</hi> was <hi>the Voice of a Cryer; Chriſt</hi> was <hi>the Word</hi> of his Father. It was fit this Voice ſhould make a noiſe to the world, ere the Word of the Father ſhould ſpeak to it. <hi>John</hi>'s note was ſtill, <hi>Repentance, the Axe to the root, the Fan to the floor, the Chaffe to the fire:</hi> as his Raiment was rough, ſo was his Tongue; and if his Food were wild Hony, his Speech was ſtinging Locuſts. Thus muſt the way be made for <hi>Chriſt</hi> in every heart. Plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is no fit preface to Regeneration. If the heart of man had continued upright, God might have been entertained without contradiction: but now violence muſt be offered to our corruption, ere we can have room for Grace. If the great Way-maker do not caſt down hills, and raiſe up val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys in the boſomes of men, there is no paſſage for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Never will <hi>Chriſt</hi> come into that Soul, where the Herald of Repentance hath not been before him.</p>
            <p>That Saviour of ours, who from eternity lay hid in the Counſel of God, who in the fulneſs of time ſo came, that he lay hid in the womb of his mother for the ſpace of forty weeks, after he was come thought fit to lie hid in <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth</hi> for the ſpace of thirty years, now at laſt begins to ſhew himſelf to the world, and comes from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jordan.</hi> He that was God always, and might have been perfect Man
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47750:31"/>
in an inſtant, would by degrees riſe to the perfection both of his Manhood, and execution of his Mediatourſhip; to teach us the neceſſity of leiſure in ſpiritual proceedings; that many Suns, and ſucceſſions of ſeaſons, and means muſt be ſtayed for, ere we can attain our maturity; and that when we are ripe for the imployments of God, we ſhould no leſs willingly leave our obſcurity, then we took the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it for our preparation. He that was formerly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed would now be baptized. What is Baptiſm but an Evangelical Circumciſion? What was Circumciſion but a legal Baptiſm? One both ſupplied and ſucceeded the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet the Authour of both will undergo both. He would be circumciſed, to ſanctifie his Church that was; and baptized, to ſanctifie his Church that ſhould be; that ſo in both Teſtaments he might open a way into Heaven. There was in him neither filthineſs, nor foreskin of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhould need either knife or water. He came not to be a Saviour for himſelf, but for us. We are all uncleanneſs and uncircumciſion. He would therefore have that done to his moſt pure Body, which ſhould be of force to clear our impure Souls: thus <hi>making himſelf ſin for us,</hi> that <hi>we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Baptiſm gives virtue to ours. His laſt action (or rather paſſion) was his Baptizing with bloud; his firſt was his Baptization with water: both of them waſh the world from their ſins. Yea, this latter did not onely waſh the ſouls of men, but waſheth that very water by which we are waſhed: from hence is that made both clean and holy, and can both cleanſe and hallow us. And if the very Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief which touched his Apoſtles had power of cure, how much more that Water which the ſacred body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> touched? <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes far to ſeek his Baptiſm; to teach us (for whoſe ſake he was baptized) to wait upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of God, and to ſue for the favour of ſpiritual bleſſings. They are worthleſs commodities that are not worth ſeeking for. It is rarely ſeen, that God is found of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47750:31"/>
any man unſought for. That deſire which onely makes us capable of good things, cannot ſtand with neglect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> durſt not baptize unbidden; his Maſter ſent him to do this ſervice; and behold, the Maſter comes to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to call for the participation of that priviledge which he himſelf had inſtituted and injoyned. How willingly ſhould we come to our ſpiritual Superious, for our part in thoſe myſteries which God hath left in their keeping? yea, how gladly ſhould we come to that <hi>Chriſt</hi> who gives us theſe bleſſings, who is given to us in them?</p>
            <p>This ſeemed too great an honour for the modeſty of <hi>John</hi> to receive. If his mother could ſay, when her Bleſſed Couſin the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came to viſit her, <hi>Whence is this to me, that the Mother of my Lord ſhould come to me?</hi> how much more might he ſay ſo, when the Divine Son of that mother came to call for a favour from him? <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me?</hi> O holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, if there were <hi>not a greater born of woman than</hi> thou, yet thou couldſt not be born of a woman, and not need to be baptized of thy Saviour. He baptized with fire, thou with water. Little would thy water have availed thee without his fire. If he had not baptized thee, how wert thou ſanctified from the womb? There can be no fleſh without filthineſs. Neither thy ſupernatural conception, nor thy auſtere life could exempt thee from the need of Baptiſm. Even thoſe that have not lived to ſin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet are they ſo tainted with <hi>Adam,</hi> that, unleſs the Second <hi>Adam</hi> cleanſe them by his Baptiſm, they are hopeleſs. There is no leſs uſe of Baptiſm unto all, then there is certainty of the need of Baptiſm. <hi>John</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized without, <hi>Chriſt</hi> within. The more holy a man is, the more ſenſible he is of his unholineſs. No carnal man could have ſaid, <hi>I have need to be baptized of thee,</hi> neither can he find what he is the better for a little Font-water. The ſenſe of our wretchedneſs, and the valuation of our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual helps, is the beſt trial of our Regeneration. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:47750:32"/>
doth not deny, that either <hi>John</hi> hath need to be baptized of him, or that it is ſtrange that he ſhould come to be baptized of <hi>John</hi>; but he will needs thus far both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>John,</hi> and diſparage himſelf, to be baptized of his Meſſenger. He that would take fleſh of the Virgin, edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from his Parents, ſuſtenance from his creatures, will take Baptiſm from <hi>John.</hi> It is the praiſe of his mercy, that he will ſtoop ſo low as to be beholden to his creatures, which from him receive their being and power, both to take and give.</p>
            <p>Yet not ſo much reſpect to <hi>John,</hi> as obedience to his Father, drew him to this point of Humiliation; <hi>Thus it behoves us to fulfill all righteouſneſs.</hi> The Counſels and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of God are Righteouſneſs it ſelf. There needs no other motive either to the Servant or the Son, then the knowledge of thoſe righteous purpoſes. This was enough to lead a faithfull man through all difficulties and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; neither will it admit of any reply, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. <hi>John</hi> yieldeth to this honour which his Saviour puts upon him, in giving Baptiſm to the Authour of it. He <hi>baptized</hi> others <hi>to the remiſſion of their ſins:</hi> now he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes him by whom they are remitted, both to the Baptizer and to others.</p>
            <p>No ſooner is <hi>Chriſt</hi> baptized, then he comes forth of the water. The element is of force but during the uſe; it turns common, when that is paſt. Neither is the water ſooner poured on his head, then the Heavens are opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcendeth upon that head which was baptized. The Heavens are never ſhut whiles either of the Sacraments is duly adminiſtred and received: Neither do the Heavens ever thus open, without the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt. But now that the God of Heaven is baptized, they open unto him, which are opened to all the faithfull by him; and that Holy Ghoſt which proceeded from him, together with the Father, joyns with the Father in a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible teſtimony of him: that now the world might ſee what
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:47750:32"/>
intereſt he had in the Heavens, in the Father, in the Holy Spirit, and might expect nothing but divine from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of ſuch a Mediator.</p>

            <p>NO ſooner is <hi>Chriſt</hi> come out of the water of Baptiſm, then he enters into the fire of Temptation. No ſooner is the Holy Spirit deſcended upon his head in the form of a Dove, then he is led by the Spirit to be tempted. No ſooner doth God ſay, <hi>This is my Son,</hi> then Satan ſays, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> It is not in the power either of the gift or ſeals of Grace, to deliver us from the aſſaults of Satan. They may have the force to repell evil ſuggeſtions, they have none to prevent them. Yea, the more we are ingaged unto God by our publick vows, and his pledges of favour, ſo much more buſie and violent is the rage of that Evil one to encounter us. We are no ſooner ſtept forth into the field of God, then he labours to wreſt our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons out of our hands, or to turn them againſt us.</p>
            <p>The voice from Heaven acknowledged <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God: this Divine Teſtimony did not allay the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of Satan, but exaſperate it. Now that venomous Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſwells with inward poiſon, and haſts to aſſail him whom God hath honoured from Heaven. O God, how ſhould I look to eſcape the ſuggeſtions of that Wicked one, when the Son of thy love cannot be free? when even Grace it ſelf draws on enmity? That enmity that ſpared not to ſtrike at the head, will it forbear the weakeſt and remoteſt limb? Arm thou me therefore with an expectation of that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47750:33"/>
evil I cannot avoid. Make thou me as ſtrong as he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious. Say to my ſoul alſo, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> and let Satan doe his worſt.</p>
            <p>All the time of our Saviour's obſcurity I do not find him ſet upon. Now that he looks forth to the publick execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Divine Office, Satan bends his forces againſt him. Our privacy, perhaps, may ſit down in peace; but never man did endeavour a common good without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. It is a ſign that both the Work is holy, and the Agent faithfull, when we meet with ſtrong affronts.</p>
            <p>We have reaſon to be comforted with nothing ſo much as with reſiſtence. If we were not in a way to do good, we ſhould find no rubs: Satan hath no cauſe to moleſt his own, and that whilſt they go about his own ſervice. He deſires nothing more, then to make us ſmooth paths to ſin: but when we would turn our feet to holineſs, he blocks up the way with Temptations.</p>
            <p>Who can wonder enough at the ſawcineſs of that bold Spirit, that dares to ſet upon the Son of the everliving God? Who can wonder enough at thy meekneſs and patience, O Saviour, that wouldſt be tempted? He wanted not malice and preſumption to aſſault thee? thou wantedſt not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to endure thoſe aſſaults. I ſhould ſtand amazed at this voluntary diſpenſation of thine, but that I ſee the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our humane nature lays thee open to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. It is neceſſarily incident to manhood to be liable to Temptations. Thou wouldeſt not have put on Fleſh, if thou hadſt meant utterly to put off this conſequence of our infirmity. If the ſtate of innocence could have been any defence againſt evil motions, the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had not been tempted, much leſs the Second. It is not the preſenting of Temptations that can hurt us, but their entertainment. Ill counſel is the fault of the Giver, not of the Refuſer. We cannot forbid lewd eyes to look in at our windows, we may ſhut our doors againſt their entrance. It is no leſs our praiſe to have reſiſted, then Satan's blame to ſuggeſt evil.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47750:33"/>
Yea, O Bleſſed Saviour, how glorious was it for thee, how happy for us, that thou wert tempted? Had not Satan tempted thee, how ſhouldſt thou have overcome? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blows there can be no victory, no triumph. How had thy power been manifeſted, if no adverſary had tried thee? The Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was tempted and vanquiſhed; the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> to repay and repair that foil, doth vanquiſh in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempted. Now <hi>have we not a</hi> Saviour, and <hi>High Prieſt, that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but</hi> ſuch an one as <hi>was in all things tempted in like ſort, yet without ſin.</hi> How <hi>boldly</hi> therefore may <hi>we go unto the Throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace of help in time of need?</hi> Yea, this Duel was for us: Now we ſee by this conflict of our Almighty Champion, what manner of Adverſary we have, how he fights, how he is reſiſted, how overcome. Now our very Temptation affords us comfort, in that we ſee, the dearer we are unto God, the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious we are to this trial. Neither can we be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the hainouſneſs of thoſe evils whereto we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſince we ſee the Son of God ſolicited to Infidelity, Covetouſneſs, Idolatry. How glorious therefore was it for thee, O Saviour, how happy for us, that thou wert tempted?</p>
            <p>Where then waſt thou tempted, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu</hi>? or whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wenteſt thou to meet with our great Adverſary? I do not ſee thee led into the market-place, or any other part of the City, or thy home-ſtead of <hi>Nazareth</hi>; but into the vaſt wilderneſs, the habitation of beaſts; a place that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth in it both horrour and opportunity. Why wouldſt thou thus retire thy ſelf from men? But as confident Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions are wont to give advantage of ground or weapon to their Antagoniſt, that the glory of their victory may be the greater: ſo wouldſt thou, O Saviour, in this conflict with our common Enemy, yield him his own terms for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that thine honour and his foil may be the more. Solitarineſs is no ſmall help to the ſpeed of a Temptation.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47750:34"/>
               <hi>Woe to him that is alone: for if he fall, there is not a ſecond to lift him up.</hi> Thoſe that out of an affectation of Holineſs ſeek for ſolitude in rocks and caves of the deſarts, do no other then run into the mouth of the danger of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whilſt they think to avoid it. It was enough for thee, to whoſe Divine power the gates of hell were weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thus to challenge the Prince of darkneſs. Our care muſt be always to eſchew all occaſions of ſpiritual danger, and (what we may) to get us out of the reach of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>But, O the depth of the Wiſedome of God! How cameſt thou, O Saviour, to be thus tempted? That <hi>Spirit</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou waſt conceived as Man, and which was one with thee and the Father as God, <hi>led thee into the wilderneſs to be tempted of Satan.</hi> Whilſt thou taughteſt us to pray to thy Father, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> thou meanteſt to inſtruct us, that if the ſame Spirit led us not into this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous way, we goe not into it. We have ſtill the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: Let the path be what it will, how can we miſcarry in the hand of a Father? Now may we ſay to Satan, as thou didſt unto <hi>Pilate, Thou couldſt have no power over me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given thee from above.</hi> The Spirit <hi>led</hi> thee, it did not drive thee. Here was a ſweet invitation, no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of violence. So abſolutely conformable was thy will to thy Deity, as if both thy Natures had but one Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition. In this firſt draught of thy bitter potion, thy ſoul ſaid in a real ſubjection, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> We imitate thee, O Saviour, though we cannot reach to thee: All thine are led by thy Spirit. O teach us to forget that we have wills of our own. The Spirit <hi>led</hi> thee; thine invincible ſtrength did not animate thee into this combat uncalled. What do we weaklings ſo far preſume upon our abilities or ſucceſs, as that we dare thruſt our ſelves upon Temptations unbidden, unwarranted? Who can pity the ſhipwrack of thoſe Mariners, who will needs put forth and hoiſe ſails in a tempeſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:47750:34"/>Forty days did our Saviour ſpend in the wilderneſs, faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſolitary, all which time was worn out in Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; however the laſt brunt, becauſe it was moſt violent, is onely expreſſed. Now could not the Adverſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain or diſadvantage, whilſt he had the full ſcope both of time and place to do his worſt. And why did it pleaſe thee, O Saviour, to faſt forty days and forty nights: unleſs, as <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty days at the delivery of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> at the reſtitution of the Law; ſo thou thoughteſt fit at the accompliſhment of the Law, and the promulgation of the Goſpel, to fulfill the time of both theſe Types of thine; wherein thou intendeſt our wonder, not our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; not our imitation of the time, though of the act. Here were no faulty deſires of the fleſh in thee, to be tamed, no poſſibility of a freer and more eaſie aſſent of the ſoul to God, that could be affected of thee, who waſt perfectly united unto God: but, as for us thou wouldeſt ſuffer death, ſo for us thou wouldeſt ſuffer hunger, that we might learn by faſting to prepare our ſelves for Temptations. In faſting ſo long, thou intendedſt the manifeſtation of thy Power; in faſting no longer, the truth of thy Manhood. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> through the miraculous ſuſtentation of God, faſted ſo long, without any queſtion made of the truth of their bodies. So long therefore thou thoughteſt good to faſt, as by the reaſon of theſe precedents might be without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of thine Humanity; which if it ſhould have pleaſed thee to ſupport, as thou couldſt, without means, thy very power might have opened the mouth of cavils againſt the verity of thine Humane nature. That thou mighteſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore well approve, that there was no difference betwixt thee and us but ſin, thou that couldſt have faſted without hunger, and lived without meat, wouldſt both feed, and faſt, and hunger.</p>
            <p>Who can be diſcouraged with the ſcantineſs of friends or bodily proviſions, when he ſees his Saviour thus long deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all earthly comforts, both of ſociety and ſuſtenance?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47750:35"/>
Oh the policy and malice of that old Serpent, When he ſees <hi>Chriſt</hi> bewray ſome infirmity of nature in being hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, then he lays ſoreſt at him by Temptations. His eye was never off from our Saviour all the time of his ſequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and now that he thinks he eſpies any one part to lie open, he drives at it with all his might. We have to doe with an Adverſary no leſs vigilant then malicious, who will be ſure to watch all opportunities of our miſchief, and where he ſees any advantage of weakneſs, will not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it. How ſhould we ſtand upon our guard for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both that we may not give him occaſions of our hurt, nor take hurt by thoſe we have given?</p>
            <p>When our Saviour was hungry, Satan tempts him in matter of Food; not then of Wealth or Glory. He well knows both what baits to fiſh withall, and when, and how to lay them. How ſafe and happy ſhall we be, if we ſhall bend our greateſt care where we diſcern the moſt danger.</p>
            <p>In every Temptation there is an appearance of good, whether of the body, mind, or eſtate. The firſt is the luſt of the fleſh, in any carnal deſire; the ſecond the pride of heart and life; the third the luſt of the eyes. To all theſe the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> is tempted, and in all miſcarried; the Second <hi>Adam</hi> is tempted to them all, and overcometh. The firſt man was tempted to carnal appetite, by the forbidden fruit; to pride, by the ſuggeſtion of being as God; to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, in the ambitious deſire of knowing good and evil. Satan having found all the motions ſo ſucceſsful with the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocent eſtate, will now tread the ſame ſteps in his Temptations of the Second. The ſtones muſt be made bread, there is the motion to a carnal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. The guard and attendence of Angels muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed on, there is a motion to pride. The Kingdomes of the earth and the glory of them muſt be offered, there to covetouſneſs and ambition.</p>
            <p>Satan could not but have heard God ſay, <hi>This is my wel-beloved
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47750:35"/>
Son</hi>; he had heard the Meſſage and the Caroll of the Angels; he ſaw the Star, and the Journey and Offerings of the Sages; he could not but take notice of the gratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Zachary, Simeon, Anna</hi>; he well knew the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Prophets: yet now that he ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with hunger, as not comprehending how infirmities could conſiſt with a Godhead, he can ſay, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> Had not Satan known that the Son of God was to come into the World, he had never ſaid, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> His very ſuppoſition convinces him: The ground of his temptation anſwers it ſelf. If therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeemed to be a meer Man, becauſe after forty days he was hungry, why was he not confeſſed more then a Man, in that for forty days he hungred not? The motive of the temptation is worſe then the motion, <hi>If thou be the Son of God.</hi> Satan could not chuſe another ſuggeſtion of ſo great importance. All the work of our Redemption, of our Salvation, depends upon this one Truth, <hi>Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> How ſhould he elſe have ranſomed the World? how ſhould he have done, how ſhould he have ſuffered that which was ſatisfactory to his Father's wrath? How ſhould his actions or paſſion have been valuable to the ſins of all the World? What marvell is it if we, that are ſons by Adoption, be aſſaulted with the doubts of our intereſt in God, when the naturall Son, the Son of his Eſſence, is thus tempted? Since all our comfort conſiſts in this point, here muſt needs be laid the chief battery; and here muſt be placed our ſtrongeſt defence.</p>
            <p>To turn Stones into Bread, had been no more faulty in it ſelf, then to turn Water into Wine: But to doe this in a diſtruſt of his Father's Providence, to abuſe his power and liberty in doing it, to work a miracle of Satan's choice, had been diſagreeable to the Son of God. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ordinary with our ſpirituall Enemy, then by occaſion of want to move us to unwarrantable courſes: Thou art poor, ſteal; Thou canſt not riſe by honeſt means,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:47750:36"/>
uſe indirect. How eaſie had it been for our Saviour, to have confounded Satan by the power of his Godhead? But he rather chuſes to vanquiſh him by the Sword of the Spirit, that he might teach us how to reſiſt and overcome the powers of darkneſs. If he had ſubdued Satan by the Almighty power of the Deity, we might have had what to wonder at, not what to imitate: now he uſeth that weapon which may be familiar unto us, that he may teach our weakneſs how to be victorious. Nothing in heaven or earth can beat the forces of Hell, but the Word of God. How carefully ſhould we furniſh our ſelves with this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull munition? how ſhould our hearts and mouths be full of it? <hi>Teach me, 0 Lord, the way of thy Statutes: O take not from me the words of Truth.</hi> Let them be <hi>my Songs in the houſe of my pilgrimage; ſo ſhall I make anſwer to my Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers.</hi> What needed <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have anſwered Satan at all, if it had not been to teach us, that Temptations muſt not have their way, but muſt be anſwered by reſiſtence, and reſiſted by the Word?</p>
            <p>I do not hear our Saviour averre himſelf to be a God, againſt the blaſphemous inſinuation of Satan; neither do I ſee him working this miraculous Converſion, to prove himſelf the Son of God: but moſt wiſely he takes away the ground of the Temptation. Satan had taken it for granted, that man cannot be ſuſtained without bread; and therefore infers the neceſſity of making bread of ſtones. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhews him from an infallible Word, that he had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed his ſuggeſtion; That <hi>man lives not by</hi> uſual food <hi>onely, but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.</hi> He can either ſuſtain without bread, as he did <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi>; or with a miraculous bread, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with Manna; or ſend ordinary means miraculouſly, as food to his Prophet by the Ravens; or miraculouſly multiply ordinary means, as the Meal and Oil to the <hi>Sareptan</hi> Widow. <hi>All things</hi> are <hi>ſuſtained by his Almighty Word.</hi> Indeed we live by food, but not by any virtue that is without God; without the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47750:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
concurrence of whoſe Providence, bread would rather choak then nouriſh us. Let him withdraw his hand from his creatures, in their greateſt abundance we periſh. Why do we therefore bend our eyes on the means, and not look up to the hand that gives the bleſſing?</p>
            <p>What ſo neceſſary dependence hath the bleſſing upon the creature, if our Prayers hold them not together? As we may not neglect the means, ſo we may not neglect the procurement of a bleſſing upon the means, nor be unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the hand that hath given the bleſſing.</p>
            <p>In the firſt aſſault Satan moves <hi>Chriſt</hi> to doubt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Providence, and to uſe unlawfull means to help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: in the next he moves him to preſume upon his Father's protection, and the ſervice of his bleſſed Angels. He grounds the firſt upon a conceit of want, the next of abundance. If he be in extremes, it is all to one end, to miſlead unto evill. If we cannot be driven down to Deſpair, he labours to lift us up to Preſumption. It is not one foil that can put this bold Spirit out of countenance. Temptations, like waves, break one in the neck of another. Whilſt we are in this warfare, we muſt make account, that the repulſe of one Temptation doth but invite to another.</p>
            <p>That Bleſſed Saviour of ours that was content to be led from <hi>Jordan</hi> into the Wilderneſs, for the advantage of the firſt Temptation, yields to be led from the Wilderneſs to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the advantage of the ſecond. The Place doth not a little avail to the Act. The Wilderneſs was fit for a Temptation ariſing from want, it was not fit for a Temptation moving to vain-glory: The populous City was the fitteſt for ſuch a motion. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the glory of the World, the Temple was the glory of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Pinacle the higheſt piece of the Pinacle: there is <hi>Chriſt</hi> content to be ſet for the opportunity of Temptation. O Saviour of men, how can we wonder enough at this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of thine, that thou wouldſt ſo far abaſe thy ſelf, as to ſuffer thy pure and ſacred Body to be tranſported by the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47750:37"/>
preſumptuous and malicious hand of that unclean Spirit? It was not his power, it was thy patience that deſerves our admiration. Neither can this ſeem over-ſtrange to us, when we conſider, that if Satan be the Head of wicked men, wicked men are the Members of Satan. What was <hi>Pilate,</hi> or the <hi>Jews</hi> that perſecuted thine innocence, but lims of this Devil? And why are we then amazed, to ſee thee touched and locally tranſported by the Head, when we ſee thee yielding thy ſelf over to be crucified by the Members? If Satan did the worſe and greater mediately by their hands, no marvel if he doe the leſs and eaſier imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by his own; yet neither of them without thy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary diſpenſation. He could not have looked at thee without thee. And if the Son of God did thus ſuffer his own holy and precious Body to be carried by Satan; what wonder is it, if that Enemy have ſometimes power given him over the ſinfull bodies of the adopted ſons of God? It is not the ſtrength of Faith that can ſecure us from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward violences of that Evil one. This difference I find be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his ſpiritual and bodily aſſaults: thoſe are beaten back by the ſhield of Faith, theſe admit not of ſuch repulſe. As the beſt man may be lame, blind, diſeaſed; ſo, through the permiſſion of God, he may be bodily vexed by the old Man-ſlayer. Grace was never given us for a Target againſt external Afflictions.</p>
            <p>Methinks I ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> hoiſed upon the higheſt Battlements of the Temple, whoſe very roof was an hundred and thirty cubits high; and Satan ſtanding by him, with this ſpeech in his mouth: Well then, ſince in the matter of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou wilt needs depend upon thy Father's Providence, that he can without means ſuſtain thee, take now farther trial of that Providence in thy miraculous preſervation; Caſt thy ſelf down from this height. Behold, thou art here in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the famous and holy City of the World; here thou art on the top of the Pinacle of that Temple which is dedicated to thy Father, and, if thou be God, to thy
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47750:37"/>
ſelf; the eyes of all men are now fixt upon thee: there cannot be deviſed a more ready way to ſpread thy glory, and to proclaim thy Deity, then by caſting thy ſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Earth. All the World will ſay, there is more in thee then a Man; and for danger, there can be none: What can hurt him that is the Son of God? And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerves that glorious Guard of Angels, which have by Divine Commiſſion taken upon them the charge of thine Humanity? Since therefore in one act thou maiſt be both ſafe and celebrated, truſt thy Father and thoſe thy ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Spirits with thine aſſured preſervation; <hi>Caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> And why didſt thou not, O thou malignant Spirit, endeavour to caſt down my Saviour by thoſe ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous hands that brought him up, ſince the deſcent is more eaſie then the raiſing up? Was it becauſe it had not been ſo great an advantage to thee that he ſhould fall by thy means, as by his own? Falling into ſin was more then to fall from the pinacle. Still thy care and ſuit is, to make us authours to our ſelves of evil. Thou gaineſt nothing by our bodily hurt, if the Soul be ſafe. Or was it rather for that thou couldſt not? I doubt not but thy malice could as well have ſerved to have offered this meaſure to himſelf, as to his holy Apoſtle ſoon after: but he that bounded thy power tethers thee ſhorter. Thou couldſt not; thou canſt not doe what thou wouldſt. He that would permit thee to carry him up, binds thy hands from caſting him down. And woe were it for us, if thou wert not ever ſtinted.</p>
            <p>Why did Satan carry up <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo high, but on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that his fall might be the more deadly? So deals he ſtill with us, he exalts us, that we may be dangerouſly abaſed: He puffs men up with ſwelling thoughts of their own worthineſs, that they may be vile in the eyes of God, and fall into condemnation. It is the manner of God, to caſt down, that he may raiſe, to abaſe, that he may exalt: contrarily Satan raiſes up, that he may throw
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47750:38"/>
down, and intends nothing but our dejection in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>Height of place gives opportunity of Temptation. Thus buſie is that Wicked one in working againſt the members of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If any of them be in eminence above others, thoſe he labours moſt to ruinate. They had need to ſtand faſt, that ſtand high: Both there is more danger of their falling, and more hurt in their fall.</p>
            <p>He that had preſumed thus far to tempt the Lord of Life, would fain now dare him alſo to preſume upon his Deity: <hi>If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down.</hi> There is not a more tried ſhaft in all his quiver then this, a perſwaſion to men to bear themſelves too bold upon the favour of God. Thou art the Elect and Redeemed of God; ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Grace hath abounded; ſin, that it may abound. Thou art ſafe enough though thou offend; be not too much an adverſary to thy own liberty. Falſe Spirit, it is no liberty to ſin, but ſervitude rather; there is no liberty but in the freedome from ſin. <hi>Every one</hi> of us <hi>that hath the hope</hi> of Sons muſt <hi>purge himſelf, even as he is pure</hi> that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us. <hi>We are bought with a price,</hi> therefore muſt <hi>we glorifie God in our body and ſpirits, for they are God's.</hi> Our Sonſhip teaches us awe and obedience; and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are Sons, we will not caſt our ſelves down into ſin.</p>
            <p>How idlely do Satan and wicked men meaſure God by the crooked line of their own miſconceit? I wiſs <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be the Son of God, unleſs he caſt himſelf down from the Pinacle, unleſs he come down from the Croſs. God is not mercifull, unleſs he humour them in all their deſires; not juſt, unleſs he take ſpeedy vengeance where they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it. But when they have ſpent their folly upon theſe vain imaginations, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Son of God, though he ſtay on the top of the Temple: God will be mercifull, though we miſcarry, and juſt, though ſinners ſeem lawleſs. Neither will he be any other then he is, or meaſured by any rule but himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:47750:38"/>But what is this I ſee? Satan himſelf with a Bible under his arm, with a Text in his mouth, <hi>It is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee?</hi> How ſtill in that Wicked one doth Subtlety ſtrive with Preſumption? Who could not but over-wonder at this, if he did not conſider, that ſince the Devil dares to touch the ſacred Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his hand, he may well touch the Scriptures of God with his tongue? Let no man henceforth marvel to hear Hereticks or Hypocrites quote Scriptures, when Satan himſelf hath not ſpared to cite them. What are they the worſe for this, more then that holy Body which is tranſported? Some have been poiſoned by their meats and drinks; yet either theſe nouriſh us, or nothing. It is not the Letter of the Scripture that can carry it, but the Senſe: if we divide theſe two, we profane and abuſe that Word we alledge. And wherefore doth this foul Spirit urge a Text, but for imitation, for prevention, and for ſucceſs? <hi>Chriſt</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a Scripture unto him, he re-alledges Scripture unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi> At leaſtwiſe he will counterfeit an imitation of the Son of God. Neither is it in this alone; what one act ever paſſed the hand of God, which Satan did not apiſhly attempt to ſecond? If we follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action with contrary intentions, we follow Satan in following <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Or, perhaps, Satan meant to make <hi>Chriſt</hi> hereby weary of this weapon: As we ſee faſhions, when they are taken up of the unworthy, are caſt off by the Great. It was, doubtleſs, one cauſe why <hi>Chriſt</hi> afterward forbad the Devil even to confeſs the Truth, becauſe his mouth was a Slander. But chiefly doeth he this for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter colour of his Temptation: He gilds over this falſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal with Scripture, that it may paſs current. Even now is Satan transformed into an Angel of light, and will ſeem godly for a miſchief. If Hypocrites make a fair ſhew to deceive with a glorious luſtre of holineſs, we ſee whence they borrowed it. How many thouſand ſouls are betrayed by the abuſe of that Word, whoſe uſe is ſovereign and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47750:39"/>
No Devil is ſo dangerous as the religious Devil. If good meat turn to the nouriſhment, not of nature, but of the diſeaſe, we may not forbear to feed, but endeavour to purge the body of thoſe evil humours which cauſe the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to work againſt it ſelf. O God, thou that haſt given us light, give us clear and ſound eyes, that we may take comfort of that light thou haſt given us. Thy Word is holy; make our Hearts ſo, and then ſhall they find that Word not more true then cordial. Let not this Divine Table of thine be made a ſnare to our ſouls.</p>
            <p>What can be a better act then to ſpeak Scripture? It were a wonder if Satan ſhould doe a good thing well. He cites Scripture then, but with mutilation and diſtortion: it comes not out of his mouth, but maimed and perverted: one piece is left, all miſapplied. Thoſe that wreſt or mangle Scripture for their own turn, it is eaſie to ſee from what School they come. Let us take the Word from the Authour, not from the Uſurper. <hi>David</hi> would not doubt to eat that ſheep which he pulled out of the mouth of the Bear or Lion. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee.</hi> O comfortable aſſurance of our protection! God's Children never goe unattended: Like unto great Princes we walk ever in the midſt of our Guard, though inviſible, yet true, carefull, powerfull. What creatures are ſo glorious as the Angels of heaven? yet their Maker hath ſet them to ſerve us. Our Adoption makes us at once great and ſafe. We may be contemptible and ignominious in the eyes of the world; but the Angels of God obſerve us the while, and ſcorn not to wait upon us in our homelieſt occaſions. The Sun or the Light may we keep out of our houſes, the Air we cannot; much leſs theſe Spirits, that are more ſimple and immaterial. No walls, no bolts can ſever them from our ſides: they accompany us in dungeons, they go with us into our exile. How can we either fear danger, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of ſolitarineſs, whilſt we have ſo unſeparable, ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Companions?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47750:39"/>Is our Saviour diſtaſted with Scripture becauſe Satan miſ-lays it in his diſh? Doth he not rather ſnatch this ſword out of that impure hand, and beat Satan with the weapon which he abuſeth? <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> The Scripture is one, as that God whoſe it is. Where it carries an appearance of difficulty or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, it needs no light to clear it, but that which it hath in it ſelf. All doubts that may ariſe from it are fully anſwered by collation. It is true that God hath taken this care, and given this charge of his own: He will have them kept, not in their ſins: they may truſt him, they may not tempt him: he meant to incourage their Faith, not their Preſumption. To caſt our ſelves upon any immediate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence when means fail not, is to diſobey, in ſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving God. We may challenge God on his word, we may not ſtrain him beyond it: We may make account of what he promiſed, we may not ſubject his promiſes to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt examinations; and where no need is, make trial of his Power, Juſtice, Mercy, by devices of our own. All the Devils in Hell could not elude the force of this Divine anſwer: and now Satan ſees how vainly he tempteth <hi>Chriſt</hi> to tempt God.</p>
            <p>Yet again for all this do I ſee him ſetting upon the Son of God. Satan is not foiled, when he is reſiſted. Neither Diffidence nor Preſumption can faſten upon <hi>Chriſt</hi>; he ſhall be tried with Honour. As ſome expert Fencer that challenges at all weapons, ſo doth his great Enemy. In vain ſhall we plead our skill in ſome, if we fail in any. It muſt be our wiſedom to be prepared for all kind of Aſſaults. As thoſe that hold Towns and Forts do not onely defend themſelves from Incurſions, but from the Cannon and the Pioneer. Still doth that ſubtle Serpent traverſe his ground for an advantage. The Temple is not high enough for his next Temptation; he therefore carries up <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the top of an exceeding high Mountain. All enemies in pitcht fields ſtrive for the benefit of the Hill, or River, or Wind,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47750:40"/>
or Sun. That which his ſervant <hi>Balak</hi> did by his inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, himſelf doth now immediately, change places in hope of prevailing. If the obſcure Country will not move us, he tries what the Court can doe; if not our Home, the Tavern; if not the Field, our Cloſet. As no place is left free by his malice, ſo no place muſt be made prejudicial by our careleſneſs: and as we ſhould always watch over our ſelves, ſo then moſt when the opportunity carries cauſe of ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>Wherefore is <hi>Chriſt</hi> carried up ſo high but for proſpect? If the Kingdoms of the earth and their glory were onely to be preſented to his Imagination, the Valley would have ſerved; if to the outward Senſe, no Hill could ſuffice. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular bodies, though ſmall, cannot be ſeen at once. This ſhow was made to both: divers Kingdoms lying round about <hi>Judaea</hi> were repreſented to the Eye; the glory of them to the Imagination. Satan meant the Eye could tempt the Fancy, no leſs then the Fancy could tempt the Will. How many thouſand ſouls have died of the wound of the Eye? If we do not let in ſin at the window of the Eye, or the door of the Ear, it cannot enter into our Hearts.</p>
            <p>If there be any pomp, majeſty, pleaſure, bravery in the world, where ſhould it be but in the Courts of Princes, whom God hath made his Images, his Deputies on earth? There is ſoft raiment, ſumptuous feaſts, rich jewels, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable attendence, glorious triumphs, royal ſtate. Theſe Satan lays out to the faireſt ſhow. But oh the craft of that old Serpent! Many a Care attends Greatneſs: No Crown is without Thorns: High ſeats are never but uneaſie. All thoſe infinite diſcontentments which are the ſhadow of earthly Sovereignty he hides out of the way; nothing may be ſeen but what may both pleaſe and allure. Satan is ſtill and ever like himſelf. If Temptations might be but turn'd about and ſhewn on both ſides, the Kingdom of darkneſs would not be ſo populous. Now whenſoever the Tempter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47750:40"/>
ſets upon any poor Soul, all ſting of conſcience, wrath, judgment, torment is concealed, as if they were not. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may appear to the eye but pleaſure, profit, and a ſeeming happineſs in the enjoying our deſires. Thoſe other wofull objects are reſerved for the farewell of ſin; that our miſery may be ſeen and felt at once. When we are once ſure, Satan is a Tyrant; till then, he is a Paraſite. There can be no ſafety, if we do not view as well the back as the face of Temptations.</p>
            <p>But oh preſumption and impudence that Hell it ſelf may be aſhamed of! The Devil dares ſay to <hi>Chriſt, All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> That beggarly Spirit, that hath not an inch of Earth, can offer the whole World to the Maker, to the Owner of it. The Slave of God would be adored of his Creatour. How can we hope he ſhould be ſparing of falſe boaſts, and of unreaſonable promiſes unto us, when he dares offer King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to him by whom Kings reign?</p>
            <p>Temptations on the right hand are moſt dangerous. How many that have been hardned with Fear, have melted with Honour? There is no doubt of that Soul that will not bite at the golden hook.</p>
            <p>Falſe Liars and vain-glorious Boaſters ſee the top of their pedigree: if I may not rather ſay, that Satan doth borrow the uſe of their tongues for a time. Whereas <hi>faithfull is he that hath promiſed, who will alſo doe it.</hi> Fidelity and Truth is the iſſue of Heaven.</p>
            <p>If Idolatry were not a dear ſin to Satan, he would not be ſo importunate to compaſs it. It is miſerable to ſee how he draws the world inſenſibly into this ſin, which they profeſs to deteſt. Thoſe that would rather hazzard the furnace then worſhip Gold in a Statue, yet do adore it in the ſtamp, and find no fault with themſelves. If our hearts be drawn to ſtoop unto an over-high reſpect of any creature, we are Idolaters. O God, it is no marvel if thy jealouſie be kindled at the admiſſion of any of thine own
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47750:41"/>
works into a competition of honour with their Creatour.</p>
            <p>Never did our Saviour ſay, <hi>Avoid, Satan,</hi> till now. It is a juſt indignation that is conceived at the motion of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vality with God. Neither yet did <hi>Chriſt</hi> exerciſe his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power in this command, but by the neceſſary force of Scripture drives away that impure Tempter; <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> The reſt of our Saviour's anſwers were more full and direct then that they could admit of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; but this was ſo flat and abſolute, that it utterly daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the courage of Satan, and put him to a ſhamefull flight, and made him for the time weary of his trade.</p>
            <p>The way to be rid of the troubleſome ſolicitations of that Wicked one is continued reſiſtence. He that forcibly drove the Tempter from himſelf, takes him off from us, and will not abide his aſſaults perpetual. It is our exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and trial that he intends, not our confuſion.</p>

We cannot offend thee, O God, with the importunity of our deſires. It likes thee well, that <hi>the Kingdom of heaven</hi> ſhould <hi>ſuffer violence.</hi> Our ſlackneſs doth ever diſpleaſe thee, never our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency.</p>
            <p>The throng of Auditours forced <hi>Chriſt</hi> to leave the ſhore, and to make <hi>Peter</hi>'s Ship his Pulpit. Never were there ſuch nets caſt out of that fiſher-boat before. Whilſt he was upon the land, he healed the ſick bodies by his touch: now that he was upon the Sea, he cured the ſick ſouls by his doctrine; and is purpoſely ſevered from the multitude, that he may unite them to him. He that made both Sea and Land, cauſeth both of them to conſpire to the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon</hi> was buſie waſhing his nets. Even thoſe nets that caught nothing muſt be waſhed, no leſs then if they had ſped well. The night's toil doth not excuſe his day's work. Little did <hi>Simon</hi> think of leaving thoſe nets which he ſo carefully waſhed; and now <hi>Chriſt</hi> interrupts him with the favour and bleſſing of his gracious preſence. Labour in our calling (how homely ſoever) makes us capable of Divine benediction. The honeſt Fiſher-man, when he ſaw the people flock after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and heard him ſpeak with ſuch power, could not but conceive a general and confuſe apprehenſion of ſome excellent worth in ſuch a Teacher,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47750:42"/>
and therefore is glad to honour his Ship with ſuch a Gueſt; and is firſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Hoſt by Sea, ere he is his Diſciple by land. An humble and ſerviceable entertainment of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of God was a good foundation of his future honour. He that would ſo eaſily lend <hi>Chriſt</hi> his hand and his Ship, was likely ſoon after to beſtow himſelf upon his Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon</hi> hath no ſooner done this ſervice to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then <hi>Chriſt</hi> is preparing for his reward: when the Sermon is ended, the Ship-room ſhall be paid for abundantly: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the Hoſt expect any other Pay-maſter then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Lanch forth into the deep, and let down your Nets to make a draught.</hi> That ſhip which lent <hi>Chriſt</hi> an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of catching men upon the ſhore, ſhall be requited with a plentifull draught of fiſh in the deep. It had been as eaſie for our Saviour to have brought the fiſh to <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſhip, cloſe to the ſhore; yet, as chuſing rather to have the ſhip carried to the ſhole of fiſh, he bids, <hi>Lanch forth into the deep.</hi> In his Miracles, he loves ever to meet Nature in her bounds; and when ſhe hath done her beſt, to ſupply the reſt by his over-ruling power. The ſame power therefore that could have cauſed the fiſhes to leap upon dry land, or to leave themſelves forſaken of the waters upon the ſands of the Lake, will rather find them, in a place natural to their abiding. <hi>Lanch out into the deep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rather in a deſire to gratifie and obey his Gueſt, then to pleaſure himſelf, will <hi>Simon</hi> beſtow one caſt of his Net. Had <hi>Chriſt</hi> injoyned him an harder task, he had not refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Yet not without an allegation of the unlikelihood of ſucceſs; <hi>Maſter, we have travailed all night, and caught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; yet at thy word I will let down the Net.</hi> The night was the fitteſt time for the hopes of their trade; not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly might <hi>Simon</hi> miſ-doubt his ſpeed by day, when he had worn out the night in unprofitable labour. Sometimes God croſſeth the faireſt of our expectations, and gives a bleſſing to thoſe times and means whereof we deſpair. That
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:47750:42"/>
pains cannot be caſt away, which we reſolve to loſe for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> O God, how many do I ſee caſting out their Nets in the great Lake of the world, which in the whole night of their life have caught nothing? <hi>They conceive miſchief, and bring forth iniquity: They hatch Cockatrices eggs, and weave the Spider's web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is troden upon breaketh out into a Serpent. Their webs ſhall be no garment, neither ſhall they cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their labours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O ye ſons of men, how long will ye love vanity, and follow after lies?</hi> Yet if we have thus vainly miſ-ſpent the time of our darkneſs, let us at the command of <hi>Chriſt</hi> caſt out our new-waſhen nets; our humble and penitent obedience ſhall come home laden with bleſſings. <hi>And when they had ſo done, they incloſed a great multitude of fiſhes, ſo that their Net brake.</hi> What a difference there is betwixt our own voluntary acts, and thoſe that are done upon command; not more in the grounds of them, then in the iſſue? Thoſe are oft-times fruitleſs, theſe ever ſucceſsfull. Never man threw out his Net at the word of his Saviour, and drew it back empty. Who would not obey thee, O <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſince thou doſt ſo bountifully requite our weakeſt ſervices? It was not meer retribution that was intended in this event, but inſtruction alſo: This act was not without a myſtery. He that ſhould be made <hi>a Fiſher of men,</hi> ſhall in this draught foreſee his ſucceſs. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net caſt into the Sea, which, when it is full, men draw to land.</hi> The very firſt draught that <hi>Peter</hi> made after the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Apoſtleſhip incloſed no leſs then three thouſand ſouls. O powerfull Goſpel, that can fetch ſinfull men from out of the depths of natural corruption! O happy ſouls, that from the blind and muddy cells of our wicked nature are drawn forth to the glorious liberty of the Sons of God! <hi>Simon</hi>'s Net breaks with the ſtore. Abundance is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no leſs troubleſome then want. The Net ſhould have held, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had not meant to over-charge <hi>Simon</hi> both
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:47750:43"/>
with bleſſing and admiration. How happily is that Net broken, whoſe rupture draws the Fiſher to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Though the Net brake, yet the fiſh eſcaped not. He that brought them thither to be taken, held them there till they were taken. <hi>They beckened to their partners in the other ſhip, that they ſhould come and help them.</hi> There are other ſhips in partnerſhip with <hi>Peter,</hi> he doth not fiſh all the Lake alone. There cannot be a better improvement of ſociety, then to help us gain, to relieve us in our profitable labours, to draw up the ſpiritual draught into the veſſel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Church. Wherefore hath God given us partners, but that we ſhould becken to them for their aid in our neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſions? Neither doth <hi>Simon</hi> ſlacken his hand, becauſe he had aſſiſtents. What ſhall we ſay to thoſe lazy Fiſhers, who can ſet others to the Drag, whilſt themſelves look on at eaſe; caring onely to feed themſelves with the Fiſh, not willing to wet their hands with the Net? What ſhall we ſay to this exceſs of gain? The Nets break, the ſhips ſink with their burthen. O happy complaint of too large a capture! O Saviour, if thoſe Apoſtolical veſſels of thy firſt rigging were thus over-laid, ours flote and totter with a balaſted lightneſs. Thou, who art no leſs preſent in theſe bottoms of ours, lade them with an equal fraught of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſouls, and let us praiſe thee for thus ſinking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon</hi> was a skilfull Fiſher, and knew well the depth of his trade; and now perceiving more then Art or Nature in this draught, he falls down at the knees of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lord, goe from me, for I am a ſinfull man.</hi> Himſelf is caught in this Net. He doth not greedily fall upon ſo unexpected and profitable a booty, but he turns his eyes from the draught to himſelf, from the act to the Authour, acknowledging vileneſs in the one, in the other Majeſty: <hi>Goe from me, Lord, for I am a ſinfull man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It had been pity the honeſt Fiſher-man ſhould have been taken at his word. O <hi>Simon,</hi> thy Saviour is come into thine own ſhip to call thee, to call others by thee unto
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47750:43"/>
Bleſſedneſs, and doſt thou ſay, <hi>Lord, goe from me?</hi> As if the Patient ſhould ſay to the Phyſician, Depart from me, for I am ſick. It was the voice of Aſtoniſhment, not of Diſlike; the voice of Humility, not of Diſcontentment. Yea, becauſe thou art a ſinfull man, therefore hath thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour need to come to thee, to ſtay with thee; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art humble in the acknowledgment of thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> delights to abide with thee, and will call thee to abide with him. No man ever fared the worſe for abaſing himſelf to his God. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left many a ſoul for froward and unkind uſage; never any for the diſparagement of it ſelf, and intreaties of humility. <hi>Simon</hi> could not deviſe how to hold <hi>Chriſt</hi> faſter, then by thus ſuing to him to be gone, then by thus pleading his Unworthineſs.</p>
            <p>O my ſoul, be not weary of complaining of thine own wretchedneſs; diſgrace thy ſelf to him that knows thy vileneſs; be aſtoniſhed at thoſe mercies which have ſhamed thine ill deſervings. Thy Saviour hath no power to go away from a proſtrate heart. He that reſiſts the proud, heartens the lowly. <hi>Fear not, for I will make thee hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth a Fiſher of men.</hi> Loe, this Humility is rewarded with an Apoſtleſhip. What had the Earth ever more glorious then a Legacy from Heaven? He that bade <hi>Chriſt</hi> go from him, ſhall have the honour to go firſt on this happy errand. This was a Trade that <hi>Simon</hi> had no skill of: it could not but be enough to him, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will make thee:</hi> the Miracle ſhewed him able to make good his word. He that hath power to command the Fiſhes to be taken, can eaſily inable the hands to take them.</p>
            <p>What is this Divine Trade of ours then but a ſpiritual Piſcation? The World is a Sea, Souls like Fiſhes ſwim at liberty in this Deep, the Nets of wholſome Doctrine draw up ſome to the ſhore of Grace and Glory. How much skill, and toil, and patience is requiſite in this Art? <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> This Sea, theſe Nets, the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47750:44"/>
Fiſhers, the Fiſh, the Veſſels, are all thine, O God; doe what thou wilt in us, and by us. Give us ability and grace to take; give men will and grace to be taken; and take thou Glory by that which thou haſt given.</p>

            <p>WAS this then thy firſt Miracle, O Saviour, that thou wroughteſt in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galilee?</hi> And could there be a greater Miracle then this, that having, been thirty years upon earth, thou didſt no Miracle till now? that thy Divinity did hide it ſelf thus long in Fleſh? that ſo long thou wouldſt lie obſcure in a corner of <hi>Galilee,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to that World thou cameſt to redeem? that ſo long thou wouldſt ſtrain the patient expectation of thoſe who, ever ſince thy Star, waited upon the revelation of a <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias?</hi> We ſilly wretches, if we have but a dram of Vertue, are ready to ſet it out to the beſt ſhow: Thou, who <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivedſt not the Spirit by meaſure,</hi> wouldſt content thy ſelf with a willing obſcurity, and concealedſt that Power that made the World, in the roof of an Humane breaſt, in a Cottage of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> O Saviour, none of thy Miracles is more worthy of aſtoniſhment, then thy not doing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. What thou didſt in private, thy wiſedom thought fit for ſecrecy: but if thy Bleſſed Mother had not been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſome domeſtical Wonders, ſhe had not now expected a Miracle abroad. The Stars are not ſeen by day; the Sun it ſelf is not ſeen by night. As it is no ſmall art to hide Art, ſo is it no ſmall glory to conceal Glory. Thy firſt publick Miracle graceth a Marriage. It is an ancient
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47750:44"/>
and laudable inſtitution, that the Rites of Matrimony ſhould not want a ſolemn celebration. When are Feaſts in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if not at the recovery of our loſt Rib? if not at this main change of our eſtate, wherein the joy of obtaining meets with the hope of farther comforts? The Son of the Virgin and the Mother of that Son are both at a Wedding. It was in all likelihood ſome of their Kindred to whoſe nuptiall feaſt they were invited ſo far: yet was it more the honour of the act, then of the perſon, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. He that made the firſt Marriage in Paradiſe, beſtows his firſt Miracle upon a <hi>Galilaean</hi> Marriage. He that was the Authour of Matrimony and ſanctified it, doth by his Holy preſence honour the reſemblance of his eternall union with his Church. How boldly may we ſpit in the faces of all the impure Adverſaries of Wedlock, when the Son of God pleaſes to honour it?</p>
            <p>The glorious Bridegroom of the Church knew well how ready men would be to place ſhame even in the moſt law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conjunctions; and therefore his firſt work ſhall be to countenance his own Ordinance. Happy is that Wedding where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a Gueſt. O Saviour, thoſe that marry in thee cannot marry without thee. There is no holy Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age whereat thou art not (however inviſible, yet) truly preſent, by thy Spirit, by thy gracious Benediction. Thou makeſt Marriages in Heaven, thou bleſſeſt them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. O thou that haſt betrothed us to thy ſelf in Truth and Righteouſneſs, do thou conſummate that happy Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of ours in the higheſt Heavens. It was no rich or ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Bridal to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> with his Mother and Diſciples vouchſafed to come from the farther parts of <hi>Galilee.</hi> I find him not at the magnificent feaſts or triumphs of the Great: The proud pomp of the World did not agree with the ſtate of a Servant. This poor needy Bridegroom wants drink for his gueſts. The Bleſſed Virgin, (though a ſtranger to the houſe,) out of a charitable compaſſion, and a friendly deſire to maintain the decency of an hoſpitall entertainment,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47750:45"/>
inquires into the wants of her Hoſt, pities them, bemoans them, where there was power of redreſs. <hi>When the wine failed, the mother of Jeſus ſaid unto him, They have no wine.</hi> How well doth it beſeem the eyes of piety and Chriſtian love, to look into the neceſſities of others? She that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the God of mercies both in her heart and in her womb, doth not fix her eyes upon her own Trencher, but ſearcheth into the penury of a poor <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and feels thoſe wants whereof he complains not. They are made for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whoſe thoughts are onely taken up with their own ſtore or indigence.</p>
            <p>There was wine enough for a meal, though not for a feaſt; and if there were not wine enough, there was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough water: yet the Holy Virgin complains of the want of wine, and is troubled with the very lack of ſuperfluity. The bounty of our God reaches not to our life onely, but to our contentment; neither hath he thought good to allow us onely the bread of ſufficiency, but ſometimes of pleaſure. One while that is but neceſſary, which ſome other time were ſuperfluous. It is a ſcrupulous injuſtice, to ſcant our ſelves, where God hath been liberal.</p>
            <p>To whom ſhould we complain of any want, but to the Maker and Giver of all things? The Bleſſed Virgin knew to whom ſhe ſued. She had good reaſon to know the Divine nature and power of her Son. Perhaps the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom was not ſo needy, but, if not by his purſe, yet by his credit he might have ſupplied that want, or, it were hard if ſome of the neighbour-gueſts (had they been duely ſolicited) might not have furniſhed him with ſo much wine as might ſuffice for the laſt ſervice of a dinner: But Bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> knew a nearer way; ſhe did not think beſt to lade at the ſhallow Chanel, but runs rather to the Well-head, where ſhe may dip and fill the Firkins at once with eaſe. It may be ſhe ſaw that the Train of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which unbidden followed unto that Feaſt, and unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly added to the number of the gueſts) might help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:47750:45"/>
that defect; and therefore ſhe juſtly ſolicits her Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> for a ſupply. Whether we want Bread, or Water, or Wine, Neceſſaries or Comforts, whither ſhould we run, O Saviour, but to that infinite munificence of thine, which neither denieth, nor upbraideth any thing? We cannot want, we cannot abound, but from thee. Give us what thou wilt, ſo thou give us Contentment with what thou giveſt.</p>
            <p>But what is this I hear? A ſharp anſwer to the ſuit of a Mother: <hi>O woman, what have I to doe with thee?</hi> He whoſe ſweet mildneſs and mercy never ſent away any ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant diſcontented, doth he onely frown upon her that bare him? He that commands us to honour Father and Mother, doth he diſdain her whoſe fleſh he took? God forbid: Love and Duty doth not exempt Parents from due admonition. She ſolicited <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Mother, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers her as a Woman. If ſhe were the Mother of his Fleſh, his Deity was eternal. She might not ſo remember her ſelf to be a Mother, that ſhe ſhould forget ſhe was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; nor ſo look upon him as a Son, that ſhe ſhould not regard him as a God. He was ſo obedient to her as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that withall ſhe muſt obey him as her God. That part which he took from her ſhall obſerve her: She muſt obſerve that nature which came from above, and made her both a Woman and a Mother. Matter of miracle concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Godhead onely; Supernatural things were above the ſphere of fleſhly relation. If now the Bleſſed Virgin will be preſcribing either time or form unto Divine acts, <hi>O woman, what have I to doe with thee, my hour is not come?</hi> In all bodily actions his ſtyle was, <hi>O Mother:</hi> in ſpiritual and heavenly, <hi>O Woman.</hi> Neither is it for us in the holy affairs of God to know any faces; yea, <hi>if we have known Chriſt heretofore according to the fleſh, henceforth know we him ſo no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Bleſſed Virgin, if in that heavenly Glory wherein thou art thou canſt take notice of theſe earthly things,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47750:46"/>
with what indignation doſt thou look upon the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Superſtition of vain men, whoſe ſuits make thee more then a Solicitour of Divine Favours? Thy Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not loſt in thy Motherhood, nor in thy Glory: The reſpects of Nature reach not ſo high as Heaven. It is far from thee to abide that Honour which is ſtoln from thy Redeemer.</p>
            <p>There is a Marriage whereto we are invited, yea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are already intereſſed, not as the Gueſts onely, but as the Bride; in which there ſhall be no want of the Wine of gladneſs. It is marvel, if in theſe earthly Banquets there be not ſome lack. <hi>In thy preſence,</hi> O Saviour, <hi>there is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore. Bleſſed are they that are called to the Marriage-ſupper of the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even in that rough Anſwer doth the Bleſſed Virgin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry cauſe of hope. If his hour were not yet come, it was therefore coming: When the expectation of the gueſts and the neceſſity of the occaſion had made fit room for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it ſhall come forth, and challenge their wonder. Faithfully therefore and obſervantly doth ſhe turn her ſpeech from her Son to the Waiters: <hi>Whatſoever he ſaith unto you, doe it.</hi> How well doth it beſeem the Mother of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to agree with his Father in Heaven, whoſe voice from Heaven ſaid, <hi>This is my wel-beloved Son, hear him?</hi> She that ſaid of her ſelf, <hi>Be it unto me according to thy word,</hi> ſays unto others, <hi>Whatſoever he ſaith unto you, doe it.</hi> This is the way to have Miracles wrought in us, Obedience to his Word. The power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not ſtand upon their Officiouſneſs; he could have wrought wonders in ſpite of them: but their perverſe refuſal of his commands might have made them uncapable of the favour of a miraculous action. He that can (when he will) convince the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, will not grace the diſobedient. He that could work without us, or againſt us, will not work for us, but by us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:47750:46"/>This very poor Houſe was furniſhed with many and large Veſſels for outward purification. As if Sin had dwelt upon the skin, that ſuperſtitious people ſought holineſs in frequent Waſhings. Even this rinſing fouled them with the uncleanneſs of a traditional will-worſhip. It is the Soul which needs ſcowring; and nothing can waſh that, but the Bloud which they deſperately wiſhed upon themſelves and their children, for guilt, not for expiation. <hi>Purge thou us,</hi> O Lord, <hi>with hyſſop, and we ſhall be clean; waſh us, and we ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Waiters could not but think ſtrange of ſo unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a command, <hi>Fill the water-pots.</hi> It is Wine that we want, what do we go to fetch Water? Doth this Holy man mean thus to quench our feaſt, and cool our ſtomacks? If there be no remedy, we could have ſought this ſupply unbidden. Yet ſo far hath the charge of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Mother prevailed, that, in ſtead of carrying flagons of Wine to the Table, they go to fetch pails-full of Water from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns. It is no pleading of unlikelihoods againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of an Almighty power.</p>
            <p>He that could have created Wine immediately in thoſe veſſels, will rather turn Water into Wine. In all the courſe of his Miracles, I do never find him making ought of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; all his great works are grounded upon former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtences: He multiplied the Bread, he changed the Water, he reſtored the withered Lims, he raiſed the Dead, and ſtill wrought upon that which was, and did not make that which was not. What doeth he in the ordinary way of nature, but turn the watery juice that ariſes up from the root into wine? He will onely doe this now ſuddenly and at once, which he doeth uſually by ſenſible degrees. It is ever duly obſerved by the Son of God, not to doe more Miracles then he needs.</p>
            <p>How liberal are the proviſions of <hi>Chriſt</hi>? If he had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but one of thoſe veſſels, it had been a juſt proof of his power; and perhaps that quantity had ſerved the preſent
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47750:47"/>
neceſſity: now he furniſheth them with ſo much wine as would have ſerved an hundred and fifty gueſts for an intire feaſt. Even the meaſure magnifies at once both his power and mercy. The munificent hand of God regards not our need onely, but our honeſt affluence. It is our ſin and our ſhame, if we turn his favour into wantonneſs. There muſt be firſt a filling ere there be a drawing out. Thus, in our veſſels, the firſt care muſt be of our receit; the next, of our expence: God would have us Ciſterns, not Chanels. Our Saviour would not be his own taſter, but he ſends the firſt draught to the Governour of the feaſt. He knew his own power, they did not. Neither would he bear witneſs of himſelf, but fetch it out of others mouths. They that knew not the original of that wine, yet praiſed the taſte: <hi>Every man at the beginning doth ſet forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worſe; but thou haſt kept the good wine untill now.</hi> The ſame boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that expreſſed it ſelf in the quantity of the wine, ſhews it ſelf no leſs in the excellence. Nothing can fall from that Divine hand not exquiſite. That liberality hated to provide Crab-wine for his gueſts. It was fit that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous effects of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (which came from his immediate hand) ſhould be more perfect then the natural. O Bleſſed Saviour, how delicate is that <hi>new Wine</hi> which we ſhall one day <hi>drink with</hi> thee, <hi>in</hi> thy <hi>Father's Kingdom!</hi> Thou ſhalt turn this Water of our earthly affliction into that Wine of gladneſs, wherewith our ſouls ſhall be ſatiate for ever. <hi>Make haſte, O my Beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young Hart upon the mountain of ſpices.</hi>

            <p>EVen the bloudy trade of War yielded worthy Clients to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This <hi>Roman</hi> Captain had learned to believe in that <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom many <hi>Jews</hi> deſpiſed. No Nation, no Trade can ſhut out a good heart from God. If he were a forreiner for birth, yet he was a domeſtick in heart: He could not change his bloud, he could over-rule his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He loved that Nation which was choſen of God; and if he were not of the Synagogue, yet he built a Synagogue: where he might not be a party, he would be a Benefactour. Next to being good, is a favouring of Goodneſs. We could not love Religion, if we utterly wanted it. How many true <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſo zealous? Either will or ability lacked in them, whom duty more obliged. Good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do many times more then ſupply nature. Neither doth God regard whence, but what we are. I do not ſee this Centurion come to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Captain came to <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Carmel,</hi> but with his cap in his hand, with much ſuit, much ſubmiſſion, by others, by himſelf. He ſends firſt the Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom he might hope their Nation and Place might make gracious: then, left the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of others might argue neglect, he ſeconds them in perſon. Cold and fruitleſs are the motions of friends, where we do wilfully ſhut up our own lips. Importunity cannot but ſpeed well in both. Could we but ſpeak for our ſelves, as this Captain did for his ſervant, what could we poſſibly want? What marvell is it if God be not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to give, where we care not to ask, or ask as if we cared not to receive? Shall we yet call this a ſuit, or a complaint? I hear no one word of intreaty. The leſs is ſaid, the more
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47750:48"/>
is concealed: It is enough to lay open his want. He knew well, that he had to deal with ſo wiſe and mercifull a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, as that the opening of the maladie was a craving of cure. If our ſpirituall miſeries be but confeſſed, they cannot fail of redreſs.</p>
            <p>Great variety of Suitours reſorted to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> One comes to him for a Son, another comes for a Daughter, a third for Himſelf: I ſee none come for his Servant, but this one Centurion. Neither was he a better man then a Maſter. His Servant is ſick; he doth not drive him out of doors, but lays him at home: neither doth he ſtand gazing by his bed-ſide, but ſeeks forth. He ſeeks forth, not to Witches or Charmers, but to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> He ſeeks to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not with a faſhionable relation, but with a vehement aggravation of the diſeaſe. Had the Maſter been ſick, the faithfulleſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant could have done no more. He is unworthy to be well ſerved, that will not ſometimes wait upon his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Conceits of inferiority may not breed in us a neglect of charitable offices. So muſt we look down upon our Servants here on earth, as that we muſt ſtill look up to our Maſter which is in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But why didſt thou not, O Centurion, rather bring thy Servant to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for cure, then ſue for him abſent? There was a Paralytick whom Faith and Charity brought to our Saviour, and let down through the uncovered roof in his Bed: why was not thine ſo carried, ſo preſented? Was it out of the ſtrength of thy Faith, which aſſured thee thou neededſt not ſhew thy Servant to him who ſaw all things? One and the ſame grace may yield contrary effects. They, becauſe they believed, brought the Patient to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> thou broughteſt not thine to him, becauſe thou believedſt. Their act argued no leſs deſire, thine more confidence. Thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was leſs, becauſe thy faith was more. Oh that I could come thus to my Saviour, and make ſuch moan to him for my ſelf, Lord, my Soul is ſick of Unbelief, ſick of Self-love, ſick of inordinate Deſires! I ſhould not need to ſay
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:47750:48"/>
more. Thy mercy, O Saviour, would not then ſtay by for my ſuit, but would prevent me (as here) with a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ingagement, <hi>I will come and heal thee.</hi> I do not hear the Centurion ſay, <hi>Either come, or heal him:</hi> The one he meant, though he ſaid it not; the other he neither ſaid nor meant. <hi>Chriſt</hi> over-gives both his words and intentions. It is the manner of that Divine munificence, where he meets with a faithfull Suitour, to give more then is requeſted; to give when he is not requeſted. The very inſinuations of our neceſſities are no leſs violent then ſucceſsfull. We think the meaſure of humane bounty runs over, when we obtain but what we ask with importunity: that infinite Goodneſs keeps within bounds, when it overflows the deſires of our hearts.</p>
            <p>As he ſaid, ſo he did. The word of <hi>Chriſt</hi> either is his act, or concurs with it. He did not ſtand ſtill when he ſaid, <hi>I will come,</hi> but he went as he ſpake. When the Ruler in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him for his Son, <hi>Come down ere he die,</hi> our Saviour ſtirr'd not a foot: The Centurion did but complain of the ſickneſs of his Servant, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> unasked ſays, <hi>I will come and heal him.</hi> That he might be far from ſo much as ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to honour wealth, and deſpiſe meanneſs, he that came in the ſhape of a Servant, would goe down to the ſick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Pallet, would not goe to the Bed of the rich Ruler's Son. It is the baſeſt motive of reſpect, that ariſeth meerly from outward Greatneſs. Either more Grace, or more need, may juſtly challenge our favourable regards, no leſs then private Obligations.</p>
            <p>Even ſo, O Saviour, that which thou offeredſt to doe for the Centurion's Servant, haſt thou done for us. We were ſick unto death; ſo far had the dead palſie of Sin over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken us, that there was no life of Grace left in us: when thou wert not content to ſit ſtill in Heaven, and ſay, <hi>I will cure them</hi>; but addedſt alſo, <hi>I will come and cure them.</hi> Thy ſelf cameſt down accordingly to this miſerable World, and haſt perſonally healed us; ſo as now <hi>we ſhall not die,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:47750:49"/>
but live, and declare thy works,</hi> O Lord. And oh that we could enough praiſe that love and mercy which hath ſo graciouſly abated thee, and could be but ſo low dejected before thee, as thou haſt ſtooped low unto us; that we could be but as lowly ſubjects of thy Goodneſs, as we are unworthy!</p>
            <p>O admirable return of humility! <hi>Chriſt</hi> will goe down to viſit the ſick Servant: The Maſter of that Servant ſays, <hi>Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt come under my roof.</hi> The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Elders, that went before to mediate for him, could ſay, <hi>He is worthy that thou ſhouldſt doe this for him:</hi> but the Centurion, when he comes to ſpeak for himſelf, <hi>I am not worthy.</hi> They ſaid, he was worthy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle: he ſays, he is unworthy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Preſence. There is great difference betwixt others valuations, and our own. Sometimes the world under-rates him that finds reaſon to ſet an high price upon himſelf: Sometimes again it over-va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues a man that knows juſt cauſe of his own humiliation. If others miſtake us, this can be no warrant for our errour. We cannot be wiſe, unleſs we receive the knowledge of our ſelves by direct beams, not by reflexion, unleſs we have learned to contemn unjuſt applauſes, and, ſcorning the flattery of the World, to frown upon our own vileneſs. <hi>Lord, I am not worthy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many a one, if he had been in the Centurion's coat, would have thought well of it. A Captain, a man of good ability and command, a founder of a Synagogue, a Patron of Religion; yet he overlooks all theſe, and when he caſts his eye upon the Divine worth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his own weakneſs, he ſays, <hi>I am not worthy:</hi> Alas! Lord, I am a Gentile, an Alien, a man of bloud; thou art Holy, thou art Omnipotent. True Humility will teach us to find out the beſt of another, and the worſt piece of our ſelves. Pride contrarily ſhews us nothing but matter of admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our ſelves, in others of contempt. Whilſt he confeſt himſelf unworthy of any favour, he approved himſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47750:49"/>
of all. Had not <hi>Chriſt</hi> been before in his heart, he could not have thought himſelf unworthy to entertain that Gueſt within his houſe. Under the low roof of an humble breaſt doth God ever delight to dwell. The ſtate of his Palace may not be meaſured by the height, but by the depth. Brags and bold faces do ofttimes carry it away with men; nothing prevails with God but our voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>It is fit the foundation ſhould be laid deep, where the building is high. The Centurion's Humility was not more low then his Faith was lofty: That reaches up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and in the face of humane weakneſs deſcries Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence: <hi>Onely ſay the word, and my Servant ſhall be whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had the Centurion's roof been Heaven it ſelf, it could not have been worthy to be come under of him whoſe Word was Almighty, and who was the Almighty Word of his Father. Such is <hi>Chriſt</hi> confeſſed by him that ſays, <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay the word.</hi> None but a Divine power is unlimited: neither hath Faith any other bounds then God himſelf. There needs no footing to remove Mountains, or Devils, but a word. Do but ſay the word, O Saviour, my Sin ſhall be remitted, my Soul ſhall be healed, my Body ſhall be raiſed from duſt; both Soul and Body ſhall be glorious.</p>
            <p>Whereupon then was the ſteddy confidence of the good Centurion? He ſaw how powerfull his own word was with thoſe that were under his command, (though himſelf were under the command of another,) the force whereof exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded even to abſent performances: well therefore might he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that a free and unbounded power might give infallible commands, and that the moſt obſtinate Diſeaſe muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs yield to the beck of the God of Nature. Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may ſhew us what is in ſtrength: By one drop of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we may ſee what is in the main Ocean. I marvell not if the Centurion were kind to his Servants, for they were duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him: he can but ſay, <hi>Doe this,</hi> and it is done. Theſe mutuall reſpects draw on each other: Chearfull and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:47750:50"/>
ſervice in the one, calls for a due and favourable care in the other. They that neglect to pleaſe, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to be neglected. Oh that I could be but ſuch a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to mine heavenly Maſter! Alas! every of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſays, <hi>Doe this,</hi> and I doe it not: every of his Inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions ſays, <hi>Doe it not,</hi> and I doe it. He ſays, Goe from the World; I run to it: he ſays, <hi>Come to me</hi>; I run from him. Woe is me! this is not ſervice, but enmity. How can I look for favour, whilſt I return rebellion? It is a gracious Maſter whom we ſerve; there can be no Duty of ours that he ſees not, that he acknowledges not, that he crowns not. We could not but be happy, if we could be officious.</p>
            <p>What can be more marvellous then to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> marvell? All marvelling ſuppoſes an ignorance going before, and a knowledge following ſome accident unexpected. Now who wrought this Faith in the Centurion, but he that wondred at it? He knew well what he wrought, becauſe he wrought what he would; yet he wondred at what he both wrought and knew; to teach us, much more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that which he at once knows and holds admirable. He wrought this Faith as God, he wondred at it as Man: God wrought, and Man admired: he that was both did both, to teach us where to beſtow our wonder. I never find <hi>Chriſt</hi> wondring at gold or ſilver, at the coſtly and curious works of humane skill or induſtry: yea, when the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wondred at the magnificence of the Temple, he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them rather. I find him not wondring at the frame of Heaven and Earth, nor at the orderly diſpoſition of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and events: the familiarity of theſe things intercepts the admiration. But when he ſees the grace or acts of Faith, he ſo approves them, that he is raviſhed with wonder. He that rejoyced in the view of his Creation, to ſee that of nothing he had made all things good, rejoyces no leſs in the reformation of his Creature, to ſee that he had made good of evill. <hi>Behold, thou art fair, my Love, behold, thou
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47750:50"/>
art fair, and there is no ſpot in thee. My Siſter, my Spouſe, thou haſt wounded my heart, thou haſt wounded my heart with one of thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Wealth, Beauty, Wit, Learning, Honour, may make us accepted of men, but it is our Faith onely that ſhall make God in love with us. And why are we of any other ſave God's diet, to be more affected with the leaſt meaſure of Grace in any man, then with all the outward glories of the World? There are Great men whom we juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pity; we can admire none but the Gracious.</p>
            <p>Neither was that plant more worthy of wonder in it ſelf, then that it grew in ſuch a ſoil, with ſo little help of rain and Sun. The weakneſs of means addes to the praiſe and acceptation of our proficiency. To doe good upon a little is the commendation of thrift: it is ſmall thank to be full-handed in a large eſtate. As contrarily, the ſtrength of means doubles the revenge of our neglect. It is not more the ſhame of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then the glory of the Centurion, that our Saviour ſays, <hi>I have not found ſo great faith in Iſrael.</hi> Had <hi>Iſrael</hi> yielded any equall faith, it could not have been uneſpied of theſe All-ſeeing eyes: yet though their Helps were ſo much greater, their Faith was leſs: and God never gives more then he requires. Where we have laid our Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and Compoſt and Seed, who would not look for a Crop? but if the uncultured Fallow yield more, how juſtly is that unanſwerable ground near to a curſe?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour did not mutter this cenſorious teſtimony to himſelf, not whiſper it to his Diſciples, but he turned him about to the people, and ſpake it in their ears, that he might at once work their ſhame and emulation. In all other things, except ſpirituall, our ſelf-love makes us impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of equalls; much leſs can we endure to be out-ſtripped by thoſe who are our profeſſed inferiours. It is well if any thing can kindle in us holy ambitions. Dull and baſe are the ſpirits of that man, that can abide to ſee another over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him in the way, and out-run him to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47750:51"/>He that both wrought this Faith, and wondred at it, doth now reward it. <hi>Go thy ways, and as thou haſt believed, ſo be it unto thee.</hi> Never was any Faith unſeen of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> never was any ſeen without allowance, never was any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed without remuneration. The meaſure of our receits in the matter of favour is the proportion of our belief. The infinite Mercy of God (which is ever like it ſelf) follows but one rule in his gift to us, the Faith that he gives us. Give us, O God, to believe, and be it to us as thou wilt, it ſhall be to us above that we will.</p>
            <p>The Centurion ſues for his Servant, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>So be it unto thee.</hi> The Servant's health is the benefit of the Maſter; and the Maſter's Faith is the health of the Servant. And if the Prayers of an earthly Maſter prevailed ſo much with the Son of God for the recovery of a Servant, how ſhall the interceſſion of the Son of God prevail with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven for us that are his impotent Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants upon Earth? What can we want, O Saviour, whilſt thou ſueſt for us? He that hath given thee for us can deny thee nothing for us, can deny us nothing for thee. In thee we are happy, and ſhall be glorious. To thee, O thou mighty Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with thine Eternal Father, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thy Bleſſed Spirit, one God infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible, be given all Praiſe, Honour and Glory, for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>XIII. The Widow's Son raiſed.</head>
            <p>THE favours of our beneficent Saviour were at the leaſt contiguous: No ſooner hath he raiſed the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion's Servant from his Bed, then he raiſes the Widow's Son from his Bier.</p>
            <p>The fruitfull clouds are not ordained to fall all in one field: <hi>Nain</hi> muſt partake of the bounty of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as well as <hi>Cana</hi> or <hi>Capernaum.</hi> And if this Sun were fixed in one Orb, yet it diffuſeth heat and light to all the world. It is not for any place to ingroſs the Meſſengers of the Goſpel, whoſe errand is univerſal: This immortal Seed may not fall all in one furrow.</p>
            <p>The little City of <hi>Nain</hi> ſtood under the hill of <hi>Hermon,</hi> near unto <hi>Tabor:</hi> but now it is watered with better dews from above, the Doctrine and Miracles of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Not for ſtate, but for the more evidence of the work, is our Saviour attended with a large train; ſo entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the gate of that walled City, as if he meant to beſiege their Faith by his Power, and to take it. His providence hath ſo contrived his journey, that he meets with the ſad pomp of a Funeral. A wofull Widow attended with her weeping neighbours is following her onely Son to the grave. There was nothing in this ſpectacle that did not command compaſſion.</p>
            <p>A young man in the flower, in the ſtrength of his age ſwallowed up by death. Our decrepit age both expects death, and ſolicits it; but vigorous youth looks ſtrangely upon that grim Serjeant of God. Thoſe mellow apples that fall alone from the tree we gather up with content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47750:52"/>
we chide to have the unripe unſeaſonably beaten down with cudgels.</p>
            <p>But more, a young man, the onely Son, the onely Child of his mother. No condition can make it other then grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for a well-natur'd mother to part with her own bowels; yet ſurely ſtore is ſome mitigation of loſs. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many children one may be more eaſily miſſed; for ſtill we hope the ſurviving may ſupply the comforts of the dead. But when all our hopes and joys muſt either live or die in one, the loſs of that one admits of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
            <p>When God would deſcribe the moſt paſſionate expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſorrow that can fall into the miſerable, he can but ſay, <hi>O daughter of my people, gird thee with ſackcloath, and wallow thy ſelf in aſhes, make lamentation and bitter mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as for thine onely Son.</hi> Such was the loſs, ſuch was the ſorrow of this diſconſolate mother: neither words nor tears can ſuffice to diſcover it.</p>
            <p>Yet more, had ſhe been aided by the counſel and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of a loving Yoke-fellow, this burthen might have ſeemed leſs intolerable. A good Husband may make amends for the loſs of a Son. Had the Root been left to her intire, ſhe might better have ſpared the Branch: now both are cut up, all the ſtay of her life is gone, and ſhe ſeems abandoned to a perfect miſery. And now when ſhe gave her ſelf up for a forlorn mourner, paſt all capacity of redreſs, the God of comfort meets her, pities her, relieves her. Here was no Solicitour but his own Compaſſion: In other occaſions he was ſought and ſued to. The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion comes to him for a Servant, the Ruler for a Son, <hi>Jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> for a Daughter, the neighbours for the Paralytick: here he ſeeks the Patient, and offers the Cure unrequeſted. Whilſt we have to doe with the Father of mercies, our Afflictions are the moſt powerfull ſuitours: No tears, no prayers can move him ſo much as his own commiſeration. O God, none of our ſecret ſorrows can be either hid from
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47750:52"/>
thine eyes, or kept from thine heart: and when we are paſt all our hopes, all poſſibilities of help, then art thou neareſt to us for deliverance.</p>
            <p>Here was a conſpiration of all parts to mercy. The Heart had compaſſion, the Mouth ſaid, <hi>Weep not,</hi> the Feet went to the Bier, the Hand touched the Coffin, the power of the Deity raiſed the dead. What the Heart felt was ſecret to it ſelf, the Tongue therefore expreſſes it in words of comfort, <hi>Weep not.</hi> Alas! what are words to ſo ſtrong and juſt paſſions? To bid her not to weep that had loſt her onely Son, was to perſwade her to be miſerable, and not feel it; to feel, and not regard it; to regard, and yet to ſmother it. Concealment doth not remedy, but aggravate ſorrow. That with the counſel of not weeping therefore ſhe might ſee cauſe of not weeping, his Hand ſeconds his Tongue: He arreſts the Coffin, and frees the Priſoner; <hi>Young man, I ſay unto thee, Ariſe:</hi> the Lord of life and death ſpeaks with command. No finite power could have ſaid ſo without preſumption, or with ſucceſs. That is the voice that ſhall one day call up our vaniſhed bodies from thoſe elements into which they are reſolved, and raiſe them out of their duſt. Neither ſea, nor death, nor hell can offer to detain their dead, when he charges them to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. Incredulous nature, what doſt thou ſhrink at the poſſibility of a Reſurrection, when the God of nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes it? It is no more hard for that Almighty Word which gave being unto all things, to ſay, <hi>Let them be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,</hi> then, <hi>Let them be made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſee our Saviour ſtretching himſelf upon the dead corps, as <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> upon the Sons of the <hi>Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> and <hi>Sareptan</hi>; nor kneeling down, and praying by the Bier, as <hi>Peter</hi> did to <hi>Dorcas:</hi> but I hear him ſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the dead as if he were alive, and ſo ſpeaking to the dead, that by the word he makes him alive; <hi>I ſay unto thee, Ariſe.</hi> Death hath no power to bid that man lie ſtill, whom the Son of God bids <hi>Ariſe.</hi> Immediatly <hi>he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47750:53"/>
that was dead ſate up.</hi> So at the ſound of the laſt Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, by the power of the ſame voice, we ſhall ariſe out of the duſt, and ſtand up glorious; <hi>this mortal ſhall put on immortality, this corruptible incorruption.</hi> This body ſhall not be buried, but ſown; and at our day ſhall therefore ſpring up with a plentifull increaſe of glory. How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs, how deſperate ſhould be our lying down, if it were not for this aſſurance of riſing? And now, behold, leſt our weak faith ſhould ſtagger at the aſſent to ſo great a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, he hath already, by what he hath done, given us taſts of what he will doe. The power that can raiſe one man can raiſe a thouſand, a million, a world. No power can raiſe one man but that which is infinite; and that which is infinite admits of no limitation. Under the Old Teſtament God raiſed one by <hi>Elias,</hi> another by <hi>Eliſha</hi> living, a third by <hi>Eliſha</hi> dead: By the hand of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the New Teſtament he raiſed here the ſon of the Widow, the daughter of <hi>Jairus, Lazarus,</hi> and, in atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his own Reſurrection, he made a Gaol-delivery of holy Priſoners at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He raiſes the daughter of <hi>Jairus</hi> from her Bed, this Widow's ſon from his Coffin, <hi>Lazarus</hi> from his Grave, the dead Saints of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from their Rottenneſs; that it might appear, no degree of death can hinder the efficacy of his over-ruling command. He that <hi>keeps the keys of death</hi> cannot onely make way for himſelf through the common Hall and outer rooms, but through the inwardeſt and moſt reſerved cloſets of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Methinks I ſee this young man, who was thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly awaked from his deadly ſleep, wiping and rubbing thoſe eyes that had been ſhut up in death, and deſcending from the Bier, wrapping his winding-ſheet about his loins, caſt himſelf down in a paſſionate thankfulneſs at the feet of his Almighty Reſtorer, adoring that Divine power which had commanded his ſoul back again to her forſaken lodging: and though I hear not what he ſaid, yet I dare ſay they were words of praiſe and wonder which his returned ſoul
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47750:53"/>
firſt uttered. It was the Mother whom our Saviour pitied in this act, not the Son, (who now forced from his quiet reſt muſt twice paſs through the gates of death.) As for her ſake therefore he was raiſed, ſo to her hands was he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered; that ſhe might acknowledge that ſoul given to her, not to the poſſeſſour. Who cannot feel the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ecſtaſie of joy that was in this revived mother, when her ſon now ſalutes her from out of another world, and both receives and gives gratulations of his new life? How ſuddenly were all the tears of that mournfull train dried up with a joyfull aſtoniſhment? How ſoon is that Funeral-banquet turned into a new Birth-day-feaſt? What ſtriving was here to ſalute the late carkaſs of their returned neighbour? What awfull and admiring looks were caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Lord of life, who ſeeming homely, was approved Omnipotent? How gladly did every tongue celebrate both the work and the authour? <hi>A great Prophet is raiſed up amongſt us,</hi> and, <hi>God hath viſited his people.</hi> A Prophet was the higheſt name they could find for him, whom they ſaw like themſelves in ſhape, above themſelves in power. They were not yet acquainted with <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> This Miracle might well have aſſured them of more then a Prophet: but he that raiſed the dead man from the Bier would not ſuddenly raiſe theſe dead hearts from the grave of Infidelity. They ſhall ſee reaſon enough to know, that the Prophet who was raiſed up to them was the God that now viſited them, and at laſt ſhould doe as much for them as he had done for the young man, raiſe them from death to life, from duſt to glory.</p>

            <head>XIV. The Ruler's Son cured.</head>
            <p>THE Bounty of God ſo exceedeth man's, that there is a contrariety in the exerciſe of it. We ſhut our hands becauſe we opened them; God therefore opens his becauſe he hath opened them. God's mercies are as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable in their iſſue, as in themſelves. Seldome ever do bleſſings go alone: Where our Saviour ſupplied the Bride-groom's Wine, there he heals the Ruler's Son. He had not in all theſe coaſts of <hi>Galilee</hi> done any Miracle but here. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We do not find <hi>Chriſt</hi> oft attended with Nobility; here he is. It was ſome great Peer, or ſome noted Courtier, that was now a ſuitour to him for his dying Son. Earthly Greatneſs is no defence againſt Afflictions. We men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the mighty: Diſeaſe and Death know no faces of Lords or Monarchs. Could theſe be bribed, they would be too rich. Why ſhould we grudge not to be privileged, when we ſee there is no ſpare of the Greateſt?</p>
            <p>This noble Ruler liſtens after <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s return into <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee.</hi> The moſt eminent amongſt men will be glad to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their neceſſity. Happy was it for him that his Son was ſick; he had not elſe been acquainted with his Saviour, his Soul had continued ſick of ignorance and unbelief. Why elſe doth our good God ſend us pain, loſſes, oppoſition, but that he may be ſought to? Are we afflicted, whither ſhould we go but to <hi>Cana,</hi> to ſeek <hi>Chriſt?</hi> whither but to the <hi>Cana</hi> of Heaven, where our water of ſorrow is turned to the wine of gladneſs, to that Omnipotent Phyſician who healeth all our infirmities? that we may once ſay, <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:47750:54"/>It was about a day's journey from <hi>Capernaum</hi> to <hi>Cana:</hi> Thence hither did this Courtier come for the cure of his Son's Fever. What pains even the greateſt can be content to take for bodily health? No way is long, no labour te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the deſirous. Our Souls are ſick of a ſpiritual fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, labouring under the cold fit of Infidelity, and the hot fit of Self-love; and we ſit ſtill at home, and ſee them lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh unto death.</p>
            <p>This Ruler was neither faithleſs, nor faithfull. Had he been quite faithleſs, he had not taken ſuch pains to come to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Had he been faithfull, he had not made this ſuit to <hi>Chriſt</hi> when he was come, <hi>Come down, and heal my ſon, ere he die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come down</hi>; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not have cured him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: <hi>Ere he die</hi>; as if that power could not have raiſed him being dead. How much difference was here betwixt the Centurion and the Ruler? That came for his Servant, this for his Son. This Son was not more above the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, then the Faith which ſued for the Servant ſurpaſſed that which ſued for the Son. The one can ſay, <hi>Maſter, come not under my roof, for I am not worthy; onely ſpeak the word, and my ſervant ſhall be whole:</hi> The other can ſay, Maſter, either come under my roof, or my Son can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be whole. <hi>Heal my ſon,</hi> had been a good ſuit; for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the onely Phyſician for all diſeaſes: but, <hi>Come down and heal him,</hi> was to teach God how to work.</p>
            <p>It is good reaſon that he ſhould challenge the right of preſcribing to us, who are every way his own: it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in us to ſtint him unto our forms. An expert workman cannot abide to be taught by a novice: how much leſs ſhall the All-wiſe God endure to be directed by his creature? This is more then if the Patient ſhould take upon him to give a Recipe to the Phyſician. That God would give us Grace, is a beſeeming ſuit: but to ſay, Give it me by proſperity, is a ſawcy motion.</p>
            <p>As there is faithfulneſs in deſiring the end, ſo modeſty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47750:55"/>
and patience in referring the means to the authour. In ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things God hath acquainted us with the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he will work, even his own Sacred Ordinances. Upon theſe, becauſe they have his own promiſe, we may call ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely for a bleſſing: In all others, there is no reaſon that beggars ſhould be chuſers. He who doeth whatſoever he will, muſt doe it how he will. It is for us to receive, not to appoint.</p>
            <p>He who came to complain of his Son's ſickneſs, hears of his own: <hi>Except ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> This Nobleman was (as is like) of <hi>Capernaum.</hi> There had <hi>Chriſt</hi> often preached, there was one of his chief reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies. Either this man had heard our Saviour oft, or might have done: yet becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miaracles came to him onely by hear-ſay, (for as yet we find none at all wrought where he preached moſt,) therefore the man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not enough; but ſo ſpeaks to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as to ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Phyſician, <hi>Come down, and heal.</hi> It was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſeaſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Incredulity, which no Receit could heal but Wonders. <hi>A wicked and adulterous gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration ſeeks ſigns.</hi> Had they not been wilfully graceleſs, there was already proof enough of the <hi>Meſſias</hi>; the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conception and life of the Fore-runner, <hi>Zachary</hi>'s dumbneſs, the atteſtation of Angels, the apparition of the Star, the journey of the Sages, the viſion of the Shepherds, the teſtimonies of <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Simeon,</hi> the Prophecies fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Voice from Heaven at his Baptiſm, the Divine words that he ſpake: and yet they muſt have all made up with Miracles; which though he be not unwilling to give at his own times, yet he thinks much to be tied unto at theirs. Not to believe without Signs, was a ſign of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born hearts.</p>
            <p>It was a foul fault, and a dangerous one: <hi>Ye will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi> What is it that ſhall condemn the world but Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? what can condemn us without it? No Sin can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Repentant. Repentance is a fruit of Faith:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47750:55"/>
where true Faith is then, there can be no condemnation; as there can be nothing but condemnation without it. How much more foul in a noble <hi>Capernaite,</hi> that had heard the Sermons of ſo Divine a Teacher? The greater light we have, the more ſhame it is for us to ſtumble.</p>
            <p>Oh what ſhall become of us, that reel and fall in the cleareſt Sun-ſhine that ever looked forth upon any Church? Be mercifull to our ſins, O God, and ſay any thing of us, rather then, <hi>Ye will not believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Saviour tells him of his Unbelief; he feels not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſick of that diſeaſe: all his mind is on his dying Son. As eaſily do we complain of bodily griefs, as we are hardly affected with ſpiritual. O the meekneſs and mercy of this Lamb of God! When we would have look'd that he ſhould have puniſhed this Suitour for not believing, he condeſcends to him that he may believe: <hi>Goe thy way, thy ſon liveth.</hi> If we ſhould meaſure our hopes by our own worthineſs, there were no expectation of bleſſings: but if we ſhall meaſure them by his bounty and compaſſion, there can be no doubt of prevailing. As ſome tender mother that gives the breaſt to her unquiet child in ſtead of the rod, ſo deals he with our perverſeneſs.</p>
            <p>How God differences men according to no other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then of their Faith! The Centurion's Servant was ſick, the Ruler's Son. The Centurion doth not ſue unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> to come, onely ſays, <hi>My ſervant is ſick of a palſie: Chriſt</hi> anſwers him, <hi>I will come and heal him.</hi> The Ruler ſues unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he would come, and heal his Son: <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not goe, onely ſays, <hi>Goe thy way, thy ſon liveth.</hi> Outward things carry no reſpect with God. The image of that Divine Majeſty ſhining inwardly in the Graces of the Soul is that which wins love from him in the meaneſt eſtate. The Centurion's Faith therefore could doe more then the Ruler's Greatneſs; and that faithfull man's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant hath more regard then this great man's Son.</p>
            <p>The Ruler's requeſt was, <hi>Come and heal: Chriſt</hi>'s anſwer
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47750:56"/>
was, <hi>Goe thy way, thy ſon liveth.</hi> Our mercifull Saviour meets thoſe in the end, whom he croſſes in the way. How ſweetly doth he correct our prayers, and whilſt he doth not give us what we ask, gives us better then we asked?</p>
            <p>Juſtly doth he forbear to go down with this Ruler, leſt he ſhould confirm him in an opinion of meaſuring his power by conceits of locality and diſtance: but he doeth that in abſence, for which his preſence was required with a repulſe, <hi>Thy ſon liveth</hi>; giving a greater demonſtration of his Omnipotency then was craved. How oft doth he not hear to our will, that he may hear us to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage? The choſen veſſel would be rid of Temptations, he hears of a ſupply of Grace. The ſick man asks releaſe, receives patience; life, and receives glory. Let us ask what we think beſt, let him give what he knows beſt.</p>
            <p>With one word doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> heal two Patients, the Son, and the Father; the Son's Fever, the Father's Unbelief. That operative word of our Saviour was not without the intention of a trial. Had not the Ruler gone home ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that intimation of his Son's life and recovery, neither of them had been bleſſed with ſucceſs. Now the news of performance meets him one half of the way: and he that believed ſomewhat ere he came, and more when he went, grew to more Faith in the way; and when he came home, inlarged his Faith to all the skirts of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. A weak Faith may be true, but a true Faith is growing. He that boaſts of a full ſtature in the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his aſſent, may preſume, but doth not believe.</p>
            <p>Great men cannot want clients, their example ſways ſome, their authority more; they cannot go to either of the other worlds alone. In vain do they pretend power over others, who labour not to draw their families unto God.</p>

            <head>XV. The Dumb Devil ejected.</head>
            <p>THat the Prince of our Peace might approve his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories perfect, whereſoever he met with the Prince of darkneſs he foiled him, he ejected him. He found him in Heaven; thence did he throw him headlong, and veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Prophet, <hi>I have caſt thee out of mine holy mountain.</hi> And if the Devils <hi>left their firſt habitation,</hi> it was becauſe (being Devils) they could not keep it. Their eſtate indeed they might have kept, and did not; their habitation they would have kept, and might not. <hi>How art thou faln from heaven, O Lucifer?</hi> He found him in the Heart of man, (for in that cloſet of God did the evill Spirit after his exile from Heaven ſhrowd himſelf; Sin gave him poſſeſſion, which he kept with a willing violence;) thence he caſts him by his Word and Spirit. He found him tyrannizing in the Bodies of ſome poſſeſſed men, and with power com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the unclean Spirits to depart.</p>
            <p>This act is for no hand but his. When a ſtrong man keeps poſſeſſion, none but a ſtronger can remove it. In voluntary things the ſtrongeſt may yield to the weakeſt, <hi>Sampſon</hi> to a <hi>Dalilah</hi>; but in violent, ever the mightieſt carries it. A ſpirituall nature muſt needs be in rank above a bodily; neither can any power be above a Spirit, but the God of Spirits.</p>
            <p>No otherwiſe is it in the mentall poſſeſſion. Where ever Sin is, there Satan is: As on the contrary, <hi>whoſoever is born of God, the ſeed of God remains in him.</hi> That Evill one not onely is, but <hi>rules in the ſons of diſobedience:</hi> in vain ſhall we try to eject him, but by the Divine power of the Redeemer. <hi>For this cauſe the Son of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:47750:57"/>
that he might deſtroy the works of the Devill.</hi> Do we find our ſelves haunted with the familiar Devills of Pride, Self-love, Senſuall deſires, Unbelief? None but thou, O Son of the ever-living God, can free our boſoms of theſe helliſh gueſts. O <hi>cleanſe thou me from my ſecret ſins, and keep me that preſumptuous ſins prevail not over me.</hi> O Saviour, it is no Paradox to ſay that thou caſteſt out more Devils now then thou didſt whilſt thou wert upon earth. It was thy word, <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me.</hi> Satan weighs down at the feet, thou pulleſt at the head, yea at the heart. In every converſion which thou workeſt, there is a diſpoſſeſſion. Convert me, O Lord, and I ſhall be converted. I know thy means are now no other then ordinary: If we expect to be diſpoſſeſſed by miracle, it would be a miracle if ever we were diſpoſſeſſed. O let thy Goſpell have the perfect work in me, ſo onely ſhall I be delivered from the powers of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be ſaid to be dumb but what naturally ſpeaks; nothing can ſpeak naturally but what hath the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of ſpeech; which becauſe ſpirits want, they can no otherwiſe ſpeak vocally, then as they take voices to themſelves in taking bodies. This Devill was not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dumb in his nature, but in his effect: The man was dumb by the operation of that Devill which poſſeſſed him; and now the action is attributed to the ſpirit, which was ſubjectively in the man. <hi>It is not you that ſpeak,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it is in bodily diſeaſes, that they do not infect us alike, ſome ſeize upon the humours, others upon the ſpirits; ſome aſſault the brain, others the heart or lungs: ſo in bodily and ſpirituall poſſeſſions; in ſome the evill ſpirit takes away their ſenſes, in ſome their lims, in ſome their inward faculties; like as ſpiritually they affect to move us unto ſeverall ſins, one to Luſt, another to Covetouſneſs or Ambition, another to Cruelty: and their names have diſtinguiſhed them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to theſe various effects. This was a dumb Devill,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:47750:57"/>
which yet had poſſeſſed not the tongue onely of this man, but his ear; nor that onely, but (as it ſeems) his eyes too.</p>
            <p>O ſubtle and tyrannous ſpirit, that obſtructs all ways to the Soul, that keeps out all means of grace both from the door and windows of the Heart; yea, that ſtops up all paſſages, whether of ingreſs, or egreſs; of ingreſs at the Eye, or Ear, of egreſs at the Mouth; that there might be no capacity of redreſs!</p>
            <p>What holy uſe is there of our Tongue but to praiſe our Maker, to confeſs our ſins, to inform our brethren? How riſe is this dumb Devill every-where, whilſt he ſtops the mouths of Chriſtians from theſe uſefull and neceſſary duties?</p>
            <p>For what end hath man thoſe two privileges above his fellow-creatures, Reaſon, and Speech, but that, as by the one he may conceive of the great works of his Maker, which the reſt cannot, ſo by the other he may expreſs what he conceives to the honour of the Creatour both of them and himſelf? And why are all other creatures ſaid to praiſe God, and bidden to praiſe him, but becauſe they doe it by the apprehenſion, by the expreſſion of man? If <hi>the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God</hi>; how doe they it but to the eyes and by the tongue of that man for whom they were made? It is no ſmall honour whereof the envious Spirit ſhall rob his Maker, if he can cloſe up the mouth of his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rationall and vocall creature, and turn the beſt of his workmanſhip into a dumb Idol, that <hi>hath a mouth and ſpeaks not. Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Praiſe is not more neceſſary then complaint; praiſe of God, then complaint of our ſelves, whether to God or men. The onely amends we can make to God, when we have not had the grace to avoid ſin, is to confeſs the ſin we have not avoided: This is the ſponge that wipes out all the blots and blurs of our lives. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithfull and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:47750:58"/>That cunning Man-ſlayer knows there is no way to purge the ſick ſoul but upward, by caſting out the vicious humour wherewith it is clogged; and therefore holds the lips cloſe, that the heart may not diſ-burthen it ſelf by ſo wholſome evacuation. <hi>When I kept ſilence, my bones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: For day and night thy hand,</hi> O Lord, <hi>was heavy upon me; my moiſture is turned into the drought of ſummer.</hi> O let me confeſs againſt my ſelf my wickedneſs unto thee, that thou maiſt forgive the puniſhment of my ſin.</p>
            <p>We have a Tongue for God, when we praiſe him; for our ſelves, when we pray and confeſs; for our brethren, when we ſpeak the truth for their information; which if we hold back in unrighteouſneſs, we yield unto that dumb Devil. Where do we not ſee that accurſed Spirit? He is on the Bench, when the mute or partial Judge ſpeaks not for truth and innocence: He is in the Pulpit, when the Prophets of God ſmother, or halve, or adulterate the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of their Maſter: He is at the Bar, when irreligious Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours dare lend an oath to fear, to hope, to gain: He is in the Market, when godleſs Chapmen for their peny ſell the truth and their ſoul: He is in the common converſation of men, when the tongue belies the heart, flatters the guilty, balketh reproofs even in the fouleſt crimes. O Thou who onely art ſtronger then that ſtrong one, caſt him out of the hearts and mouths of men. <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have deſtroyed thy Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it might well appear this impediment was not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſo ſoon as the man is freed from the ſpirit, his tongue is free to his ſpeech. The effects of ſpirits as they are wrought, ſo they ceaſe at once. If the Son of God do but remove our ſpiritual poſſeſſion, we ſhall preſently break forth into the praiſe of God, into the confeſſion of our vileneſs, into the profeſſion of truth.</p>
            <p>But what ſtrange variety do I ſee in the ſpectatours of his Miracle, ſome wondering, others cenſuring, a third ſort tempting, a fourth applauding? There was never man
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47750:58"/>
or action but was ſubject to variety of conſtructions. What man could be ſo holy as he that was God? what act could be more worthy then the diſpoſſeſſion of an evil ſpirit? Yet this man, this act paſſeth theſe differences of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. What can we doe to undergoe but one opinion? If we give alms, and faſt, ſome will magnifie our charity and devotion, others will tax our hypocriſie: if we give not, ſome will condemn our hard-heartedneſs, others will allow our care of juſtice. If we preach plainly, to ſome it will ſavour of a careleſs ſlubbering, to others of a morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſincerity: elaborately, ſome will tax our affectation, others will applaud our diligence in dreſſing the delicate viands of God. What marvel is it if it be thus with our imperfection, when it fared not otherwiſe with him that was purity and righteouſneſs it ſelf? The auſtere Fore-runner of <hi>Chriſt came neither eating nor drinking; they ſay, He hath a Devil: The Son of man came eating and drinking; they ſay,</hi> This man is <hi>a glutton, a friend of Publicans and ſinners.</hi> And here one of his holy acts carries away at once wonder, cenſure, doubt, celebration. There is no way ſafe for a man, but to ſquare his actions by the right rule of juſtice, of charity; and then let the world have leave to ſpend their gloſſes at pleaſure. It was an heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal reſolution of the choſen Veſſel, <hi>I paſs very little to be judged of you, or of man's day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I marvell not if the people marvelled, for here were four wonders in one; the blind ſaw, the deaf heard, the dumb ſpake, the Demoniack is delivered. Wonder was due to ſo rare and powerfull a work, and, if not this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. We can caſt away admiration upon the poor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices or activities of men; how much more upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary works of Omnipotency? Whoſo knows the frame of Heaven and Earth, ſhall not much be affected with the imperfect effects of frail humanity; but ſhall with no leſs raviſhment of ſoul acknowledge the miraculous works of the ſame Almighty hand. Neither is the ſpiritual ejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47750:59"/>
worthy of any meaner entertainment. Rarity and Difficulty are wont to cauſe wonder. There are many things which have wonder in their worth, and loſe it in their frequency: there are ſome which have it in their ſtrangeneſs, and loſe it in their facility: Both meet in this. To ſee men haunted, yea poſſeſſed with a dumb Devil, is ſo frequent, that it is a juſt wonder to find a man free: but to find the dumb ſpirit caſt out of a man, and to hear him praiſing God, confeſſing his ſins, teaching others the ſweet experiments of mercy, deſerves juſt admiration. If the Cynick ſought in the market for a Man amongſt men, well may we ſeek amongſt men for a Convert. Neither is the difficulty leſs then the rareneſs. The ſtrong man hath the poſſeſſion, all paſſages are block'd up, all helps barred, by the treachery of our nature. If any ſoul be reſcued from theſe ſpiritual wickedneſſes, it is the praiſe of him that doeth wonders alone.</p>
            <p>But whom do I ſee wondering? <hi>The multitude.</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned beholders follow that act with wonder, which the learned Scribes entertain with obloquy. God hath <hi>revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> thoſe <hi>things to babes,</hi> which he hath <hi>hid from the wiſe and prudent.</hi> With what ſcorn did thoſe great Rabbins ſpeak of theſe ſons of the earth, <hi>This people that knows not the Law is accurſed?</hi> Yet the mercy of God makes an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of their ſimplicity; in that they are therefore leſs ſubject to cavillation and incredulity: As contrarily, his juſtice cauſes the proud knowledge of others to lie as a block in their way to the ready aſſent unto the Divine power of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Let the pride of glorious adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries diſdain the poverty of the clients of the Goſpel; it ſhall not repent us to go to Heaven with the vulgar, whilſt their great ones go in ſtate to Perdition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The multitude wondered.</hi> Who cenſured, but Scribes, great Doctours of the Law, of the divinity of the <hi>Jews</hi>? what Scribes, but thoſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the moſt eminent Academy of <hi>Judaea?</hi> Theſe were the men who, out of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47750:59"/>
their deep reputed judgment, caſt theſe foul aſperſions upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Great wits oft-times miſ-lead both the owners and followers. How many ſhall once wiſh they had been born dullards, yea idiots, when they ſhall find their wit to have barred them out of Heaven? <hi>Where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> Hath not <hi>God made the wiſedome of the world fooliſhneſs?</hi> Say the world what it will, a dram of Holineſs is worth a pound of Wit. Let others cenſure, with the Scribes; let me wonder, with the multitude.</p>
            <p>What could malice ſay worſe, <hi>He caſteth out Devils through Beelzebub the Prince of Devils?</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> well knew that the Gods of the heathen were no other then Devils; amongſt whom, for that the <hi>Lord of Flies</hi> (ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whether for the concourſe of flies to the abundance of his ſacrifices, or for his aid implored againſt the infeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe ſwarms) was held the chief, therefore they ſtyle him, <hi>The Prince of Devils.</hi> There is a ſubordination of Spirits, ſome higher in degree, ſome inferiour to others. Our Saviour himſelf tells us of the Devil, and his Angels: Meſſengers are inferiour to thoſe that ſend them. The ſeven Devils that entered into the ſwept and garniſhed houſe were worſe then the former. Neither can <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and Governours, and <hi>Princes of the darkneſs of this World,</hi> deſign other then ſeveral ranks of evil Angels. There can be no being without ſome kind of order, there can be no order in parity. If we look up into Heaven, there is the King of Gods, <hi>the Lord of Lords,</hi> higher then the higheſt. If to the Earth, there are Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, Kings, Princes, Peers, People. If we look down to Hell, there is <hi>the Prince of Devils.</hi> They labour for confuſion that call for parity. What ſhould the Church doe with ſuch a form as is not exemplified in Heaven, in Earth, in Hell?</p>
            <p>One Devil (according to their ſuppoſition) may be uſed to caſt out another. How far the command of one
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47750:60"/>
ſpirit over another may extend, it is a ſecret of infernal ſtate, too deep for the inquiry of men. The thing it ſelf is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent; upon compact, and precontracted compoſition, one gives way to other for the common advantage. As we ſee in the Commonwealth of Cheaters and Cutpurſes, one doeth the fact, another is feed to bring it out, and to procure reſtitution: both are of the trade, both conſpire to the fraud; the actour falls not out with the revealer, but divides with him that cunning ſpoil.</p>
            <p>One malicious miſcreant ſets the Devil on work to the inflicting of diſeaſe or death; another upon agreement, for a farther ſpiritual gain, takes him off: There is a Devil in both: And if there ſeem more bodily favour, there is no leſs ſpiritual danger in the latter: In the one Satan wins the agent, the ſuitour in the other. It will be no cauſe of diſcord in Hell, that one Devil gives eaſe to the body which another tormented, that both may triumph in the gain of a ſoul. Oh God, that any creature which bears thine Image ſhould not abhor to be beholden to the powers of hell for aid, for advice! <hi>Is it not becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that men go to inquire of the God of Ekron?</hi> Can men be ſo ſottiſh, to think that the vowed enemy of their ſouls can offer them a bait without an hook? What <hi>evil is there in the City which the Lord hath not done?</hi> what is there which he cannot as eaſily redreſs? He wounds, he heals again: And if he will not, <hi>it is the Lord, let him doe what ſeems good in his eyes.</hi> If he do not deliver us, he will crown our faithfulneſs in a patient perſeverance. The wounds of God are better then are the ſalves of Satan.</p>
            <p>Was it poſſible that the wit of Envy could deviſe ſo high a Slander? <hi>Beelzebub</hi> was a God of the heathen; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore herein they accuſe him for an Idolater: <hi>Beelzebub</hi> was a Devil to the <hi>Jews</hi>; therefore they accuſe him for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer: <hi>Beelzebub</hi> was the chief of Devils; therefore they accuſe him for an Arch-exorciſt, for the worſt kind of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:47750:60"/>
Some profeſſours of this black Art, though their work be devilliſh, yet they pretend to doe it in the name of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; and will preſumptuouſly ſeem to doe that by command, which is ſecretly tranſacted by agreement. The Scribes accuſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> of a direct compact with the Devil, and ſuppoſe both a league and familiarity, which by the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> (in the very hand of a <hi>Saul</hi>) was no other then deadly. Yea, ſo deep doth this wound reach, that our Saviour ſearching it to the bottom, finds no leſs in it then the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt; inferring hereupon that dreadfull ſentence of the irremiſſibleneſs of that <hi>ſin unto death.</hi> And if this horrible crimination were caſt upon thee, O Saviour, in whom the Prince of this world found nothing, what wonder is it if we thy ſinfull Servants be branded on all ſides with evil tongues?</p>
            <p>Yea, (which is yet more) how plain is it that theſe men forced their tongue to ſpeak this ſlander againſt their own heart? Elſe this Blaſphemy had been onely againſt the Son of man, not againſt the Holy Ghoſt: but now that the Searcher of hearts finds it to be no leſs then againſt the Bleſſed Spirit of God, the ſpight muſt needs be obſtinate; their malice doth wilfully croſs their conſcience. Envy never regards how true, but how miſchievous: So it may gall or kill, it cares little whether with truth or falſhood. For us; <hi>Bleſſed are</hi> we <hi>when men revile</hi> us, <hi>and ſay all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of evil of</hi> us, <hi>for the name of Chriſt.</hi> For them; <hi>What reward ſhall be given to thee, thou falſe tongue? Even ſharp arrows with hot burning coals</hi>; yea thoſe very coals of hell from which thou wert enkindled.</p>
            <p>There was yet a third ſort that went a mid way betwixt wonder and cenſure. Theſe were not ſo malicious as to impute the Miracle to a Satanical operation: they confeſs it good, but not enough, and therefore urge <hi>Chriſt</hi> to a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof. Though thou haſt caſt out this dumb Devil, yet this is no ſufficient argument of thy Divine power: We have yet ſeen nothing from thee like thoſe ancient Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47750:61"/>
of the times of our forefathers. <hi>Joſhua</hi> cauſed the Sun to ſtand ſtill; <hi>Elias</hi> brought fire down from heaven; <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> aſtoniſht the people with thunder and rain in the midſt of harveſt: If thou wouldſt command our belief, doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like to theſe. The caſting out of a Devil ſhews thee to have ſome power over Hell; ſhew us now that thou haſt no leſs power over Heaven. There is a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs of deſire and inſatiableneſs in Infidelity; it never knows when it hath evidence enough. This which the <hi>Jews</hi> over-looked was a more irrefragable demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divinity, then that which they deſired. A Devil was more then a Meteor, or a parcel of an element: to caſt out a Devil by command, more then to command fire from heaven. Infidelity ever loves to be her own carver.</p>
            <p>No ſon can be more like a father, then theſe <hi>Jews</hi> to their progenitors in the deſart. That there might be no fear of degenerating into good, they alſo of old tempted God in the Wilderneſs. Firſt, they are weary of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, and are ready to fall out with God and <hi>Moſes</hi> for their ſtay in thoſe furnaces. By ten miraculous Plagues they are freed; and going out of thoſe confines the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> follow them, the Sea is before them: now they are more afflicted with their liberty then their ſervitude. The Sea yields way, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are drowned: and now that they are ſafe on the other ſhore, they tempt the providence of God for water. The Rock yields it them; then, no leſs for bread and meat. God ſends them Manna and Quails: they cry out of the <hi>food of Angels.</hi> Their preſent enemies in the way are vanquiſhed; they whine at the men of meaſures in the heart of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Nothing from God but mercy; nothing from them but temptations.</p>
            <p>Their true brood both in nature and in ſin had abundant proofs of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; if curing the blind, lame, diſeaſed, deaf, dumb, ejecting Devils, over-ruling the elements, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the dead, could have been ſufficient: yet ſtill they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47750:61"/>
muſt have a ſign from Heaven, and ſhut up in the ſtyle of the Tempter, <hi>If thou be the Chriſt.</hi> The gracious heart is credulous: Even where it ſees not, it believes; and where it ſees but a little, it believes a great deal. Neither doth it preſume to preſcribe unto God what and how he ſhall work; but takes what it finds, and unmovably reſts in what it takes. Any miracle, no miracle ſerves enough for their aſſent, who have built their faith upon the Goſpel of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47750:62"/>The juſt man is the firſt accuſer of himſelf. Whom do we hear to blazon the ſhame of <hi>Matthew,</hi> but his own mouth? <hi>Matthew</hi> the Evangeliſt tells us of <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican. His fellows call him <hi>Levi,</hi> as willing to lay their finger upon the ſpot of his unpleaſing profeſſion: himſelf will not ſmother nor blanch it a whit, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes it to all the world, in a thankfull recognition of the mercy that called him; as liking well that his baſeneſs ſhould ſerve for a fit foil to ſet off the glorious luſtre of his grace by whom he was elected. What matters it how vile we are, O God, ſo thy glory may ariſe in our abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>That word was enough, <hi>Follow me</hi>; ſpoken by the ſame tongue that ſaid to the corps at <hi>Nain, Young man, I ſay to thee, Ariſe.</hi> He that ſaid at firſt, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> ſays now, <hi>Follow me.</hi> That power ſweetly inclines which could forcibly command: the force is not more unreſiſtible then the inclination.

Do we ſee the Jet drawing up ſtraws to it, the Load-ſtone iron, and do we marvel if the Omnipotent Saviour, by the influence of his grace, attract the heart of a Publican? <hi>He aroſe, and followed him.</hi> We are all naturally averſe from thee, O God: do thou but bid us <hi>follow</hi> thee, <hi>draw</hi> us by thy powerfull word, and we ſhall <hi>run after thee.</hi> Alas! thou ſpeakeſt, and we ſit ſtill; thou ſpeakeſt by thine outward Word to our ear, and we ſtir not: Speak thou by the ſecret and effectual Word of thy Spirit to our heart; the World cannot hold us down, Satan cannot ſtop our way, we ſhall ariſe, and follow thee.</p>

happy attendence. If any commodity be valued of us too dear to be parted with for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we are more fit to be Publicans then Diſciples. Our Saviour invites <hi>Matthew</hi> to a Diſcipleſhip; <hi>Matthew</hi> invites him to a Feaſt. The joy of his Call makes him begin his abdication of the world in a Banquet.</p>
            <p>Here was not a more chearfull thankfulneſs in the Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then a gracious humility in the Gueſt. The new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant bids his Maſter, the Publican his Saviour, and is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with ſo bleſſed a preſence. I do not find where <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ever bidden to any table, and refuſed: If a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, if a Publican invited him, he made not dainty to go: Not for the pleaſure of the diſhes, what was that to him, who began his work in a whole Lent of days? But (as it was his <hi>meat and drinks to doe the will of</hi> his <hi>Father</hi>) for the benefit of ſo winning a converſation. If he ſate with Sinners, he converted them; if with Converts, he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and inſtructed them; if with the Poor, he fed them; if with the Rich in ſubſtance, he made them richer in grace. At whoſe board did he ever ſit, and left not his hoſt a gainer? The poor Bridegroom entertains him, and hath his water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots filled with Wine: <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee entertains him, and hath his table honoured with the publick remiſſion of a penitent ſinner, with the heavenly doctrine of remiſſion: <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> entertains him, ſalvation came that day to his houſe with the Authour of it. That preſence made the Publican a ſon of <hi>Abraham: Matthew</hi> is recompenſed for his feaſt with an Apoſtleſhip: <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> entertain him, and beſides Divine inſtruction receive their brother from the dead. O Saviour, whether thou feaſt us, or we feaſt thee, in both of them is bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>Where a Publican is the Feaſt-maſter, it is no marvel if the gueſts be Publicans and Sinners. Whether they came alone, out of the hope of that mercy which they ſaw their fellow had found; or whether <hi>Matthew</hi> invited them, to be partners of that plentifull grace whereof he had taſted;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:47750:63"/>
I inquire not. Publicans and Sinners will flock together; the one hatefull for their trade, the other for their vicious life. Common contempt hath wrought them to an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity, and ſends them to ſeek mutual comfort in that ſociety, which all others held loathſome and contagious. Moderate correction humbleth and ſhameth the offender: whereas a cruel ſeverity makes men deſperate, and drives them to thoſe courſes whereby they are more dangerouſly infected. How many have gone into the priſon faulty, and returned flagitious? If Publicans were not Sinners, they were no whit beholden to their neighbours.</p>
            <p>What a table-full was here? The Son of God beſet with Publicans and Sinners. O happy Publicans and Sinners, that had found out their Saviour! O mercifull Saviour, that diſdained not Publicans and Sinners!</p>
            <p>What ſinner can fear to kneel before thee, when he ſees Publicans and Sinners ſit with thee? Who can fear to be deſpiſed of thy meekneſs and mercy, which didſt not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor to converſe with the outcaſts of men? Thou didſt not deſpiſe the Thief confeſſing upon the Croſs, nor the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner weeping upon thy feet, nor the <hi>Canaanite</hi> crying to thee in the way, nor the bluſhing Adultereſs, nor the odious Publican, nor the forſwearing Diſciple, nor the perſecutour of Diſciples, nor thine own Executioners. How can we be unwelcome to thee, if we come with tears in our eyes, faith in our hearts, reſtitution in our hands? O Saviour, our breaſts are too oft ſhut upon thee, thy boſome is ever open to us. We are as great ſinners as the conſorts of theſe Publicans, why ſhould we deſpair of a room at thy Table?</p>
            <p>The ſquint-eyed Phariſees look a-croſs at all the actions of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> where they ſhould have admired his mercy, they cavil at his holineſs; <hi>They ſaid to his Diſciples, Why eateth your Maſter with Publicans and Sinners?</hi> They durſt not ſay thus to the Maſter, whoſe anſwer (they knew) would ſoon have convinced them: This wind (they hoped) might
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:47750:64"/>
ſhake the weak faith of the Diſciples: They ſpeak where they may be moſt likely to hurt. All the crue of Satani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inſtruments have learnt this craft of their old Tutour in Paradiſe. We cannot reverence that man whom we think unholy. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had loſt the hearts of his followers, if they had entertained the leaſt ſuſpicion of his impurity, which the murmur of theſe envious Phariſees would fain inſinuate; He cannot be worthy to be followed that is unclean; He cannot but be unclean that eateth with Publicans and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Proud and fooliſh Phariſees! Ye faſt whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> eateth; ye faſt in your houſes, whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> eateth in other mens; ye faſt with your own, whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> feaſts with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: But if ye faſt in pride, whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> eats in humility; if ye faſt at home for merit or popularity, whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> feaſts with ſinners for compaſſion, for edification, for converſion; your faſt is unclean, his feaſt is holy; ye ſhall have your portion with hypocrites, when thoſe Publicans and Sinners ſhall be glorious.</p>
            <p>When theſe cenſurers thought the Diſciples had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they ſpeak not to them, but to their Maſter, <hi>Why doe thy Diſciples that which is not lawfull?</hi> now, when they thought <hi>Chriſt</hi> offended, they ſpeak not to him, but to the Diſciples. Thus, like true make-bates, they go about to make a breach in the family of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by ſetting off the one from the other. The quick eye of our Saviour hath ſoon eſpied the pack of their fraud, and therefore he takes the words out of the mouths of his Diſciples into his own. They had ſpoke of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the Diſciples; <hi>Chriſt</hi> anſwers for the Diſciples concerning himſelf, <hi>The whole need not the Phyſician, but the ſick.</hi> According to the two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of pride, ſcorn and over-weening, theſe inſolent Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees over-rated their own holineſs, contemned the noted unholineſs of others: as if themſelves were not tainted with ſecret ſins, as if others could not be cleanſed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The ſearcher of hearts meets with their arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and finds thoſe Juſticiaries ſinfull, thoſe Sinners juſt.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:47750:64"/>
The ſpiritual Phyſician finds the ſickneſs of thoſe Sinners wholſome, the health of thoſe Phariſees deſperate: that wholſome, becauſe it calls for the help of the Phyſician; this deſperate, becauſe it needs not. Every ſoul is ſick; thoſe moſt that feel it not. Thoſe that feel it complain; thoſe that complain have cure: thoſe that feel it not ſhall find themſelves dying ere they can with to recover. O bleſſed Phyſician, <hi>by</hi> whoſe <hi>ſtripes we are healed,</hi> by whoſe death we live, happy are they that are under thy hands, ſick, as of ſin, ſo of ſorrow for ſin. It is as unpoſſible they ſhould die, as it is unpoſſible for thee to want either skill, or power, or mercy. Sin hath made us ſick unto death: make thou us but as ſick of our ſins, we are as ſafe as thou art gracious.</p>

            <p>I Do not any-where find ſo furious a Demoniack as amongſt the <hi>Gergeſens.</hi> Satan is moſt tyrannous where he is obeyed moſt. <hi>Chriſt</hi> no ſooner ſailed over the lake, then he was met by two poſſeſſed <hi>Gadarenes.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme rage of the one hath drowned the mention of the other. Yet in the midſt of all that cruelty of the evil Spirit, there was ſometimes a remiſſion, if not an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, of vexation. If <hi>oft-times</hi> Satan caught him, then ſometimes, in the ſame violence, he caught him not. It was no thank to that malignant one, who, as he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable in his executions, ſo unmeaſurable in his malice;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47750:65"/>
but to the mercifull over-ruling of God, who, in a gracious reſpect to the weakneſs of his poor creatures, limits the ſpightfull attempts of that immortal Enemy, and takes off this Maſtive whilſt we may take breath. He, who in his juſtice gives way to ſome onſets of Satan, in his mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains them: ſo regarding our deſervings, that withall he regards our ſtrength. If way ſhould be given to that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſpirit, we could not ſubſiſt; no violent thing can endure: and if Satan might have his will, we ſhould no moment be free. He can be no more weary of doing evil to us, then God is of doing good. Are we therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the malignity of theſe powers of darkneſs, <hi>Bleſſed be</hi> our ſtrong helper, <hi>that hath not given us over to be a prey unto their teeth.</hi> Or if ſome ſcope have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that envious one to afflict us, hath it been with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable limitations, it is thine onely mercy, O God, that hath chained and muzzled up this band-dog, ſo as that he may ſcratch us with his paws, but cannot pierce us with his fangs. Far, far is this from our deſerts, who had too well merited a juſt abdication from thy favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and an interminable ſeiſure by Satan, both in ſoul and body.</p>
            <p>Neither do I here ſee more matter of thanks to our God, for our immunity from the external injuries of Satan, then occaſion of ſerious inquiry into his power over us for the ſpiritual. I ſee ſome that think themſelves ſafe from this ghoſtly tyranny, becauſe they ſometimes find themſelves in good moods, free from the ſuggeſtions of groſs ſins, much more from the commiſſion. Vain men, that feed themſelves with ſo falſe and frivolous comforts! will they not ſee Satan, through the juſt permiſſion of God, the ſame to the Soul in mental poſſeſſions that he is to the Body in corporal? The worſt Demoniack hath his lightſome reſpites; not ever tortured, not ever furious: betwixt whiles he might look ſoberly, talk ſenſibly, move regularly. It is a wofull comfort that we ſin not always. There is no Maſter
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47750:65"/>
ſo barbarous as to require of his Slave a perpetual unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted toil: yet, though he ſometimes eat, ſleep, reſt, he is a vaſſal ſtill. If that Wicked one have drawn us to a cuſtomary perpetration of evil, and have wrought us to a frequent iteration of the ſame ſin, this is gage enough for our ſervitude, matter enough for his tyranny and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation. He that would be our Tormentour always, cares onely to be ſometimes our Tempter.</p>
            <p>The poſſeſſed is bound, as with the inviſible fetters of Satan, ſo with the material chains of the inhabitants. What can bodily force prevail againſt a ſpirit? Yet they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this reſtraint of the man, whether out of charity, or juſtice: charity, that he might not hurt himſelf; juſtice, that he might not hurt others. None do ſo much befriend the Demoniack as thoſe that bind him. Neither may the ſpiritually poſſeſſed be otherwiſe handled: for though this act of the enemy be plauſible, and to appearance pleaſant; yet there is more danger in this dear and ſmiling tyranny. Two ſorts of chains are fit for outrageous ſinners; good Laws, unpartial Executions; that they may not hurt, that they may not be hurt to eternal death.</p>
            <p>Theſe iron chains are no ſooner faſt then broken. There was more then an humane power in this diſruption. It is not hard to conceive the utmoſt of nature in this kind of actions. <hi>Sampſon</hi> doth not break the cords and ropes like a thread of tow, but God by <hi>Sampſon:</hi> The man doth not break theſe chains, but the Spirit. How ſtrong is the arm of theſe evil angels? how far tranſcending the ordinary courſe of nature? They are not called <hi>Powers</hi> for nothing. What fleſh and bloud could but tremble at the palpable inequality of this match, if herein the mercifull protection of our God did not the rather magnifie it ſelf, that ſo much ſtrength met with ſo much malice hath not prevailed againſt us? In ſpite of both we are in ſafe hands. He that ſo eaſily brake the iron fetters, can never break the adamantine chain of our Faith. In vain do the chafing
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47750:66"/>
billows of Hell beat upon that Rock whereon we are built. And though theſe brittle chains of earthly metall be eaſily broken by him, yet the ſure tempered chain of God's eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Decree he can never break. That Almighty Arbiter of Heaven, and Earth, and Hell, hath chained him up in the bottomleſs pit, and hath ſo reſtrained his malice, that (but for our good) we cannot be tempted; we cannot be foiled, but for a glorious victory.</p>
            <p>Alas! it is no otherwiſe with the ſpiritually poſſeſſed. The chains of reſtraint are commonly broken by the fury of wickedneſs. What are the reſpects of civility, fear of God, fear of men, wholſome laws, carefull executions, to the deſperately licentious, but as cobwebs to an hornet? Let theſe wild Demoniacks know, that God hath provided chains for them that will hold, even <hi>everlaſting chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der darkneſs.</hi> Theſe are ſuch as muſt hold the Devils themſelves (their Maſters) <hi>unto the judgment of the great Day</hi>; how much more thoſe impotent Vaſſals? Oh that men would ſuffer themſelves to be bound to their good behaviour by the ſweet and eaſie recognizances of their duty to their God, and the care of their own ſouls, that ſo they might rather be bound up in the bundle of life.</p>
            <p>It was not for reſt that theſe chains were torn off, but for more motion. This priſoner runs away from his friends, he cannot run away from his Jaolour. He is now carried into the Wilderneſs, not by meer external force, but by internal impulſion; carried by the ſame power that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound him, for the opportunity of his tyranny, for the horrour of the place, for the affamiſhment of his body, for the avoidance of all means of reſiſtence. Solitary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts are the delights of Satan. It is an unwiſe zeal that moves us to doe that to our ſelves, in an opinion of merit and holineſs, which the Devil wiſhes to doe to us for a puniſhment, and conveniency of temptation. The evil Spirit is for ſolitarineſs, God is for ſociety: He dwells in the aſſembly of his Saints, yea, there he hath a delight to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47750:66"/>
dwell. Why ſhould not we account it our happineſs, that we may have leave to dwell where the Authour of all happineſs loves to dwell?</p>
            <p>There cannot be any miſery incident unto us whereof our gracious Redeemer is not both conſcious and ſenſible. Without any intreaty therefore of the miſerable Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack, or ſuit of any friend, the God of ſpirits takes pity of his diſtreſs; and from no motion but his own, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the evil Spirit to come out of the man. O admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable precedent of mercy, preventing our requeſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding our thoughts, forcing favours upon our impotence, doing that for us which we ſhould, and yet cannot deſire! If men upon our inſtant ſolicitations would give us their beſt aid, it were a juſt praiſe of their bounty: but it well became thee, O God of mercy, to go without force, to give without ſuit. And do we think thy goodneſs is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by thy glory? If thou wert thus commiſerative upon earth, art thou leſs in Heaven? How doſt thou now take notice of all our complaints, of all our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? how doth thine infinite pity take order to redreſs them? What evil can befall us which thou knoweſt not, feeleſt not, relieveſt not? How ſafe are we that have ſuch a Guardian, ſuch a Mediatour in Heaven?</p>
            <p>Not long before had our Saviour commanded the winds and waters, and they could not but obey him: now he ſpeaks in the ſame language to the evil Spirit; he intreats not, he perſwades not, he commands. Command argues ſuperiority. He onely is infinitely ſtronger then the ſtrong one in poſſeſſion. Elſe where powers are matcht, though with ſome inequality, they tug for the victory, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reſiſtence yield nothing. There are no fewer ſorts of dealing with Satan then with men. Some have dealt with him by ſuit, as the old <hi>Satanian</hi> Hereticks, and the preſent <hi>Indian</hi> Savages, ſacrificing to him, that he hurt not: others by covenant, conditioning their ſervice upon his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, as Witches and Magicians: others by inſinuation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47750:67"/>
of implicit compact, as Charmers and Figure-caſters: others by adjuration, as the ſons of <hi>Scaeva</hi> and modern Exorciſts, unwarrantably charging him by an higher name then their own. None ever offered to deal with Satan by a direct and primary command, but the God of Spirits. The great Archangel, when the ſtrife was about the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> commanded not, but imprecated rather, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.</hi> It is onely the God that made this Spirit an Angel of light that can command him, now that he hath made himſelf the Prince of darkneſs. If any created power dare to uſurp a word of command, he laughs at their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and knows them his Vaſſals, whom he diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to fear as his Lords. It is thou onely, O Saviour, at whoſe beck thoſe ſtubborn Principalities of hell yield and tremble. No wicked man can be ſo much a ſlave to Satan, as Satan is to thee: the interpoſition of thy grace may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat that dominion of Satan: thy rule is abſolute, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of no lett. What need we to fear, whilſt we are under ſo omnipotent a Commander? The waves of the deep rage horribly, yet the Lord is ſtronger then they. Let thoſe Principalities and Powers doe their worſt: Thoſe mighty adverſaries are under the command of him who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us ſo well as to bleed for us. What can we now doubt of? his power, or his will? How can we profeſs him a God, and doubt of his power? How can we profeſs him a Saviour, and doubt of his will? He both can and will command thoſe infernall powers. We are no leſs ſafe then they are malicious.</p>
            <p>The Devill ſaw <hi>Jeſus</hi> by the eyes of the Demoniack: For the ſame ſaw that ſpake; but it was the ill Spirit that ſaid, <hi>I beſeech thee torment me not.</hi> It was ſore againſt his will that he ſaw ſo dreadfull an object. The over-ruling power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> dragged the foul Spirit into his preſence. Guiltineſs would fain keep out of ſight. The Lims of ſo wofull an Head ſhall once call on the Hills and Rocks to hide them from the face of the Lamb; ſuch Lion-like ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47750:67"/>
is in that mild face when it looks upon wickedneſs. Neither ſhall it be one day the leaſt part of the torment of the damned, to ſee the moſt lovely ſpectacle that Heaven can afford. He from whom they fled in his offers of grace ſhall be ſo much more terrible, as he was and is more graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. I marvel not therefore that the Devill, when he ſaw <hi>Jeſus,</hi> cried out: I could marvell that he fell down, that he worſhipped him. That which the proud Spirit would have had <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have done to him in his great Duell, the ſame he now doeth unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> fearfully, ſervilely, forced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Who ſhall henceforth brag of the externall homage he performs to the Son of God, when he ſees Satan himſelf fall down and worſhip? What comfort can there be in that which is common to us with Devils, who, as they <hi>believe and tremble,</hi> ſo they tremble and worſhip? The outward bowing is the body of the action, the diſpoſition of the Soul is the ſoul of it: therein lies the difference from the counterfeit ſtoopings of wicked men and ſpirits. The reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious heart <hi>ſerves the Lord in fear,</hi> and <hi>rejoyces</hi> in him <hi>with trembling.</hi> What it doeth is in way of ſervice: in ſervice to his Lord, whoſe ſovereignty is his comfort and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in the fear of a ſon, not of a ſlave; in fear tempered with joy; in a joy, but allayed with trembling. Whereas the proſtration of wicked men and Devils is onely an act of form, or of force; as to their Judge, as to their Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, not as to their Lord; in meer ſervility, not in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; in an uncomfortable dulneſs, without all delight; in a perfect horrour, without capacity of joy. Theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip without thanks, becauſe they fall down without the true affections of worſhip.</p>
            <p>Whoſo marvels to ſee the Devill upon his knees, would much more marvel to hear what came from his mouth, <hi>Jeſus, the Son of the Moſt high God.</hi> A confeſſion, which if we ſhould hear without the name of the Authour, we ſhould ask from what Saint it came. Behold the ſame name given to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the Devil, which was formerly given him by
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:47750:68"/>
the Angel, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name</hi> JESUS. That awfull <hi>Name, whereat every knee ſhall bow, in heaven, in earth, and under the earth,</hi> is called upon by this proſtrate Devil. And leſt that ſhould not import enough, (ſince others have been honoured by this name in Type,) he adds for full diſtinction, <hi>the Son of the Moſt high God.</hi> The good <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophoenician</hi> and blind <hi>Bartimaeus</hi> could ſay, <hi>the Son of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi> it was well to acknowledge the true deſcent of his pedigree according to the fleſh: But this infernal Spirit looks aloft, and fetcheth his line out of the higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, <hi>the Son of the Moſt high God.</hi> The famous confeſſion of the prime Apoſtle (which honoured him with a new name to immortality) was no other then, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the living God:</hi> and what other do I hear from the lips of a Fiend? No more Divine words could fall from the higheſt Saint. Nothing hinders but that the verieſt miſcreant on earth, yea the fouleſt Devil in Hell, may ſpeak holily. It is no paſſing of judgment upon looſe ſentences. So <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have been caſt for a Satan, in denying, forſwearing, curſing; and the Devil ſhould have been ſet up for a Saint, in confeſſing, <hi>Jeſus, the Son of the Moſt high God.</hi> Fond hypocrite, that pleaſeſt thy ſelf in talking well, hear this Devil; and when thou canſt ſpeak better then he, look to fare better: but in the mean time know, that a ſmooth tongue and a foul heart carrie away double judgments.</p>
            <p>Let curious heads diſpute whether the Devil knew <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be God: In this I dare believe himſelf, though in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. He knew what he believed, what he believed that he confeſſed, <hi>Jeſus, the Son of the Moſt high God.</hi> To the confuſion of thoſe Semi-Chriſtians, that have either held doubtfully, or ignorantly miſ-known, or blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly denied what the very Devils have profeſſed. How little can a bare ſpeculation avail us in theſe caſes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity? So far this Devil hath attained, to no eaſe, no comfort. Knowledge alone doth but <hi>puffe up:</hi> it is our
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47750:68"/>
Love that edifies. If there be not a ſenſe of our ſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a power to apply his merits and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, we are no whit the ſafer, no whit the better; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are ſo much the wiſer, to underſtand who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us.</p>
            <p>This piece of the clauſe was ſpoken like a Saint, <hi>Jeſus, the Son of the Moſt high God:</hi> the other piece like a Devil, <hi>What have I to doe with thee?</hi> If the diſclamation were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, the latter words would impugn the former: for whilſt he confeſſes <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be the Son of the Moſt high God, he withall confeſſes his own inevitable ſubjection. Wherefore would he beſeech, if he were not obnoxious? He cannot, he dare not ſay, <hi>What haſt thou to doe with me?</hi> but, <hi>What have I to doe with thee?</hi> Others indeed I have vexed, thee I fear: in reſpect then of any violence, of any perſonal provocation, <hi>What have I to doe with thee?</hi> And doſt thou ask, O thou evil Spirit, what haſt thou to doe with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whilſt thou vexeſt a Servant of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Haſt thou thy name from Knowledge, and yet ſo miſtakeſt him whom thou confeſſeſt, as if nothing could be done to him but what immediately concerns his own perſon? Hear that great and juſt Judge ſentencing upon his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tribunal; <hi>Inaſmuch as thou didſt it unto one of theſe little ones, thou didſt it unto me:</hi> It is an idle miſpriſion, to ſever the ſenſe of an injury done to any of the Members from the Head.</p>
            <p>He that had humility enough to kneel to the Son of God, hath boldneſs enough to expoſtulate; <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> Whether it were that Satan, who uſeth to enjoy the torment of ſinners, whoſe muſick it is to hear our ſhrieks and gnaſhings, held it no ſmall piece of his torment, to be reſtrained in the exerciſe of his tyranny: Or whether the very preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were his rack; For the guilty ſpirit projecteth terrible things, and cannot behold the Judge or the executioner without a renovation of horrour: Or whether that (as himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth)
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47750:69"/>
he were now in a fearfull expectation of being commanded down into the deep, for a farther degree of actual torment, which he thus deprecates.</p>
            <p>There are Tortures appointed to the very ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of evil Angels. Men, that are led by ſenſe, have ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily granted the Body ſubject to torment, who yet have not ſo readily conceived this incident to a Spiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The Holy Ghoſt hath not thought it fit to acquaint us with the particular manner of theſe inviſible acts, rather willing that we ſhould herein fear then enquire: but as all matters of faith, though they cannot be proved by reaſon, (for that they are in a higher ſphere,) yet afford an anſwer able to ſtop the mouth of all reaſon that dares bark againſt them, (ſince truth cannot be oppoſite to it ſelf;) ſo this of the ſufferings of Spirits. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both an intentional torment incident to Spirits, and a real. For, as in Bleſſedneſs the good Spirits find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves joyned unto the chief good, and hereupon feel a perfect love of God, and unſpeakable joy in him, and reſt in themſelves: ſo contrarily, the evil Spirits perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves eternally excluded from the preſence of God, and ſee themſelves ſettled in a wofull darkneſs; and from the ſenſe of this ſeparation ariſes an horrour not to be expreſſed, not to be conceived. How many men have we known to torment themſelves with their own thoughts? There needs no other gibbet then that which their troubled ſpirit hath erected in their own heart. And if ſome pains begin at the Body, and from thence afflict the Soul in a copartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of grief; yet others ariſe immediately from the Soul, and draw the Body into a participation of miſery. Why may we not therefore conceive meer and ſeparate Spirits capable of ſuch an inward excruciation?</p>
            <p>Beſides which, I hear the Judge of men and Angels ſay, <hi>Go, ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels:</hi> I hear the Prophet ſay, <hi>Tophet is prepared of old.</hi> If with fear and without curioſity we may look
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47750:69"/>
upon thoſe flames, why may we not attribute a ſpiritual nature to that more then natural fire? In the end of the world the elements ſhall be diſſolved by fire: and if the pure quinteſſential matter of the sky, and the element of fire it ſelf, ſhall be diſſolved by fire, then that laſt fire ſhall be of another nature then that which it conſumeth. What hinders then but that the Omnipotent God hath from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity created a fire of another nature, proportionable even to ſpiritual eſſences? Or why may we not diſtinguiſh of fire, as it is it ſelf a bodily creature, and as it is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God's juſtice, ſo working not by any material virtue or power of its own, but by a certain height of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural efficacy, to which it is exalted by the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of that Supreme and Righteous Judge? Or, laſtly, why may we not conceive that, though Spirits have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material in their nature which that fire ſhould work upon, yet by the judgment of the Almighty Arbiter of the world, juſtly willing their torment, they may be made moſt ſenſible of pain, and, by the obedible ſubmiſſion of their created nature, wrought upon immediately by their appointed tortures; beſides the very horrour which ariſeth from the place whereto they are everlaſtingly confined? For if the incorporeal ſpirits of living men may be held in a loathed or painfull body, and conceive ſorrow to be ſo impriſoned; why may we not as eaſily yield that the evil ſpirits of Angels, or men, may be held in thoſe dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full flames, and much more abhor therein to continue for ever? Tremble rather, O my ſoul, at the thought of this wofull condition of the evil Angels, who, for one onely act of Apoſtaſie from God, are thus perpetually tormented; whereas we ſinfull wretches multiply many and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous offences againſt the Majeſty of our God: And withall admire and magnifie that infinite mercy to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable generation of man, which, after this holy ſeverity of juſtice to the revolted Angels, ſo graciouſly forbears our hainous iniquities, and both ſuffers us to be free for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47750:70"/>
time from theſe helliſh torments, and gives us opportunity of a perfect freedome from them for ever. <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me praiſe his holy Name, Who forgiveth all thy ſins, and healeth all thine infirmities; who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, and crowneth thee with mercy and compaſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no time wherein the evil Spirits are not tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: there is a time wherein they expect to be tormented yet more. <hi>Art thou come to torment us before our time?</hi> They knew that the laſt Aſſiſes are the prefixed term of their full execution; which they alſo underſtood to be not yet come. For though they knew not when the Day of Judgment ſhould be, (a point concealed from the glorious Angels of heaven,) yet they knew when it ſhould not be; and therefore they ſay, <hi>before the time.</hi> Even the very evil ſpirits confeſs, and fearfully attend, a ſet day of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Seſſions. They believe leſs then Devils, that either doubt of, or deny that Day of final retribution.</p>
            <p>O the wonderfull mercy of our God, that both to wicked men and Spirits reſpites the utmoſt of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! He might upon the firſt inſtant of the fall of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels have inflicted on them the higheſt extremity of his vengeance; he might upon the firſt ſins of our youth (yea of our nature) have ſwept us away, and given us our portion in that fiery lake: He ſtays a time for both; though with this difference of mercy to us men, that here not onely is a delay, but may be an utter prevention of puniſhment; which to the evil Spirits is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. They do ſuffer, they muſt ſuffer: and though they have now deſerved to ſuffer all they muſt, yet they muſt once ſuffer more then they do.</p>
            <p>Yet ſo doth this evil Spirit expoſtulate, that he ſues, <hi>I beſeech thee, torment me not.</hi> The world is well changed ſince Satan's firſt onſet upon <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Then he could ſay, <hi>If thou be the Son of God</hi>; now, <hi>Jeſus, the Son of the Moſt high God:</hi> then, <hi>All theſe will I give thee, if thou wilt fall
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47750:70"/>
down and worſhip me</hi>; now, <hi>I beſeech thee, torment me not.</hi> The ſame power, when he liſts, can change the note of the Tempter to us. How happy are we that have ſuch a Redeemer as can command the Devils to their chains? O conſider this, ye lawleſs ſinners, that have ſaid, <hi>Let us break his bands, and caſt his cords from us.</hi> However the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſuffers you for a judgment to have free ſcope to evil, and ye can now impotently reſiſt the revealed will of your Creatour; yet the time ſhall come, when ye ſhall ſee the very maſters whom ye have ſerved (the powers of darkneſs) unable to avoid the revenges of God. How much leſs ſhall <hi>man ſtrive with his Maker</hi>; Man, <hi>whoſe breath is in his noſtrils, whoſe houſe is clay, whoſe foundation is the duſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nature teaches every creature to wiſh a freedome from pain. The fouleſt Spirits cannot but love themſelves; and this love muſt needs produce a deprecation of evil. Yet what a thing is this, to hear the Devil at his prayers? <hi>I beſeech thee, torment me not.</hi> Devotion is not guilty of this, but fear. There is no grace in the ſuit of Devils, but nature; no reſpect of glory to their Creatour, but their own eaſe; they cannot pray againſt ſin, but againſt torment for ſin. What news is it now to hear the profaneſt mouth, in extremity, imploring the Sacred Name of God, when the Devils do ſo? The worſt of all creatures hates puniſhment, and can ſay, <hi>Lead me not into pain</hi>; onely the good heart can ſay, <hi>Lead me not into temptation.</hi> If we can as heartily pray againſt ſin, for the avoiding of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, as againſt puniſhment, when we have diſpleaſed, there is true Grace in the ſoul. Indeed, if we could fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently pray againſt ſin, we ſhould not need to pray againſt puniſhment, which is no other then the inſeparable ſhadow of that body: but if we have not laboured againſt our ſins, in vain do we pray againſt puniſhment. God muſt be juſt; and <hi>the wages of ſin is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It pleaſed our Holy Saviour, not onely to let fall words
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47750:71"/>
of command upon this Spirit, but to interchange ſome ſpeeches with him. All <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s actions are not for example. It was the errour of our Grandmother to hold chat with Satan. That God who knows the craft of that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and our weak ſimplicity, hath charged us not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of an evil Spirit. Surely if the Diſciples returning to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Well wondred to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> talk with a woman, well may we wonder to ſee him talking with an unclean Spirit. Let it be no preſumption, O Saviour, to ask upon what grounds thou didſt this wherein we may not follow thee. We know that ſin was excepted in thy conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thy ſelf to us; we know there was <hi>no guile found in</hi> thy <hi>mouth,</hi> no poſſibility of taint in thy nature, in thine actions. Neither is it hard to conceive how the ſame thing may be done by thee without ſin, which we cannot but ſin in doing. There is a vaſt difference in the Intention, in the Agent. For, as on the one ſide, thou didſt not ask the name of the Spirit, as one that knew not, and would learn by enquiring; but that by the confeſſion of that miſchief which thou pleaſedſt to ſuffer the grace of the cure might be the more conſpicuous, the more glorious: ſo, on the other, God and Man might doe that ſafely, which meer Man cannot doe without danger. Thou mighteſt touch the leproſie, and not be legally unclean, becauſe thou touchedſt it to heal it, didſt not touch it with poſſibility of infection. So mighteſt thou, who, by reaſon of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of thy Divine nature, wert uncapable of any ſtain by the interlocution with Satan, ſafely confer with him, whom corrupt Man, prediſpoſed to the danger of ſuch a parly, may not meddle with without ſin, becauſe not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out peril. It is for none but God to hold diſcourſe with Satan. Our ſureſt way is, to have as little to doe with that Evil one as we may; and if he ſhall offer to maintain conference with us by his ſecret temptations, to turn our ſpeech unto our God, with the Archangel, <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:47750:71"/>It was the preſuppoſition of him that knew it, that not onely men but Spirits have names. This then he asks, not out of an ignorance, or curioſity; nothing could be hid from him who <hi>calleth the Stars</hi> and all the hoaſts of Heaven <hi>by their names:</hi> but out of a juſt reſpect to the glory of the Miracle he was working, whereto the notice of the name would not a little avail. For if without inquiry, or confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, our Saviour had ejected this evil Spirit, it had paſſed for the ſingle diſpoſſeſſion of one onely Devil: whereas now it appears there was a combination and helliſh champarty in theſe powers of darkneſs, which were all forced to vail unto that almighty command.</p>
            <p>Before the Devil had ſpoken ſingularly of himſelf, <hi>What have I to doe with thee?</hi> and, <hi>I beſeech thee, torment me not:</hi> yet our Saviour, knowing that there was a multitude of Devils lurking in that breaſt, who diſſembled their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, wreſts it out of the Spirit by this interrogation, <hi>What is thy name?</hi> Now can thoſe wicked ones no longer hide themſelves. He that asked the queſtion, forced the anſwer: <hi>My name is Legion.</hi> The authour of diſcord hath borrowed a name of war: from that military order of diſcipline by which the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſubdued doth the Devil fetch his denomination. They were many, yet they ſay, <hi>My name,</hi> not, <hi>Our name:</hi> though many, they ſpeak as one, they act as one, in this poſſeſſion. There is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous accordance even betwixt evil Spirits: That King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not divided, for then it could not ſtand. I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not that wicked men do ſo conſpire in evil, that there is ſuch unanimity in the broachers and abetters of errours, when I ſee thoſe Devils which are many in ſubſtance are one in name, action, habitation. Who can too much brag of unity, when it is incident unto wicked Spirits? All the praiſe of concord is in the ſubject: if that be holy, the conſent is Angelical; if ſinfull, devilliſh.</p>
            <p>What a fearfull advantage have our ſpiritual enemies againſt us? If armed troups come againſt ſingle ſtragglers,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47750:72"/>
what hope is there of life, of victory? How much doth it concern us to band our hearts together in a communion of Saints? Our enemies come upon us like a torrent: O let us not run aſunder like drops in the duſt. All our united forces will be little enough to make head againſt this league of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Legion</hi> imports Order, Number, Conflict. Order, in that there is a diſtinction of regiment, a ſubordination of Officers. Though in Hell there be confuſion of faces, yet not confuſion of degrees.</p>
            <p>Number: Thoſe that have reckoned a Legion at the loweſt, have counted it ſix thouſand; others have more then doubled it: though here it is not ſtrict, but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet the letter of it implies multitude. How fearfull is the conſideration of the number of Apoſtate Angels? And if a Legion can attend one man, how many muſt we needs think are they who, all the world over, are at hand to the puniſhment of the wicked, the exerciſe of the good, the temptation of both? It cannot be hoped there can be any place or time wherein we may be ſecure from the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets of theſe enemies. Be ſure, ye lewd men, ye ſhall want no furtherance to evil, no torment for evil: Be ſure, ye godly, ye ſhall not want combatants to try your ſtrength and skill: Awaken your courages to reſiſt, and ſtir up your hearts, make ſure the means of your ſafety. There are more with us then againſt us. The God of heaven is with us, if we be with him; and our <hi>Angels behold the face of God.</hi> If every Devil were a Legion, we are ſafe: <hi>Though</hi> we <hi>walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> we <hi>ſhall fear no evil. Thou,</hi> O Lord, <hi>ſhalt ſtretch forth thine hand againſt the wrath of</hi> our <hi>enemies, and thy right hand ſhall ſave</hi> us.</p>
            <p>Conflict: All this Number is not for ſight, for reſt; but for motion, for action: Neither was there ever hour ſince the firſt blow given to our firſt Parents, wherein there was ſo much as a truce betwixt theſe adverſaries. As
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47750:72"/>
therefore ſtrong Frontier-towns, when there is a Peace concluded on both parts, break up their garriſon, open their gates, neglect their Bulwarks; but when they hear of the enemy muſtering his forces in great and unequal numbers, then they double their guard, keep ſentinel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair their Sconces: ſo muſt we, upon the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our numerous and deadly enemies in continual array againſt us, addreſs our ſelves always to a wary and ſtrong reſiſtence. I do not obſerve the moſt to think of this ghoſtly hoſtility. Either they do not find there are Temptations, or thoſe Temptations hurtfull; they ſee no worſe then themſelves; and if they feel motions of evil ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in them, they impute it to fancy, or unreaſonable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, to no power but Nature's; and thoſe motions they follow, without ſenſible hurt; neither ſee they what harm it is to ſin. Is it any marvel that carnal eyes cannot diſcern ſpiritual objects? that the World, who is the friend, the vaſſal of Satan, is in no war with him? <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, when his eyes were opened, ſaw troups of ſpiritual ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which before he diſcerned not. If the eyes of our Souls be once enlightned by ſupernatural knowledge, and the clear beams of Faith, we ſhall as plainly deſcry the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible powers of wickedneſs, as now our bodily eyes ſee Heaven and Earth. They are, though we ſee them not: we cannot be ſa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> from them, if we do not acknowledge, not oppoſe them.</p>
            <p>The Devils are now become great ſuitours to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; that he would not command them into the deep, that he would permit their entrance into the Swine. What is this deep but Hell, both for the utter ſeparation from the face of God, and for the impoſſibility of paſſage to the region of reſt and glory? The very evil Spirits then fear, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a farther degree of torment; they know themſelves <hi>reſerved in</hi> thoſe <hi>chains of darkneſs for the judgment of the great day.</hi> There is the ſame wages due to their ſins, and to ours; neither are the wages paid till the work be done.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47750:73"/>
They tempting men to ſin muſt needs ſin grievouſly in tempting, as with us men thoſe that miſlead into ſin offend more then the actours: not till the upſhot therefore of their wickedneſs ſhall they receive the full meaſure of their condemnation. This Day, this Deep they tremble at: what ſhall I ſay of thoſe men that fear it not? It is hard for men to believe their own Unbelief. If they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of this fiery dungeon, this bottomleſs deep, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every ſin ſhall receive an horrible portion with the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, durſt they ſtretch forth their hands to wickedneſs? No man will put his hand into a fiery crucible to fetch gold thence, becauſe he knows it will burn him. Did we as truly believe the everlaſting burning of that infernal fire, we durſt not offer to fetch pleaſures or profits out of the midſt of thoſe flames.</p>
            <p>This degree of torment they grant in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s power to command. They knew his power unreſiſtible: had he therefore but ſaid, <hi>Back to Hell whence ye came,</hi> they could no more have ſtaid upon earth, then they can now climb into heaven. O the wonderfull diſpenſation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who, though he could command all the evil Spirits down to their dungeons in an inſtant, ſo as they ſhould have no more opportunity of temptation, yet thinks fit to retain them upon earth! It is not out of weakneſs or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence of that Divine hand, that wicked Spirits tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize here upon earth, but out of the moſt wiſe and moſt holy ordination of God, who knows how to turn evil into good, how to fetch good out of evil, and by the worſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to bring about his moſt juſt decrees. Oh that we could adore that awfull and infinite power, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully caſt our ſelves upon that Providence which keeps the Keys even of Hell it ſelf, and either lets out, or returns the Devils to their places.</p>
            <p>Their other ſuit hath ſome marvel in moving it, more in the grant; that they might be <hi>ſuffered to enter into the Herd of ſwine.</hi> It was their ambition of ſome miſchief that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47750:73"/>
brought forth this deſire; that ſince they might not vex the Body of man, they might yet afflict men in their Goods. The malice of theſe envious Spirits reacheth from us to ours: It is ſore againſt their wills, if we be not every way miſerable. If the Swine were legally unclean for the uſe of the table, yet they were naturally good. Had not Satan known them uſefull for man, he had never deſired their ruine. But as Fencers will ſeem to fetch a blow at the leg, when they intend it at the head; ſo doeth this Devil, whilſt he drives at the Swine, he aims at the Souls of theſe <hi>Gadarens.</hi> By this means he hoped well (and his hope was not vain) to work in theſe <hi>Gergeſens</hi> a diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Chriſt,</hi> an unwillingneſs to entertain him, a deſire of his abſence: he meant to turn them into Swine, by the loſs of their Swine. It was not the rafters or ſtones of the houſe of <hi>Job</hi>'s children that he bore the grudge to, but to the owners; nor to the lives of the Children ſo much as the Soul of their Father. There is no affliction wherein he doth not ſtrike at the Heart; which whilſt it holds free, all other dammages are light: but <hi>a wounded ſpirit</hi> (whether with ſin or ſorrow) <hi>who can bear?</hi> Whatever becomes of goods or lims, happy are we if (like wiſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) we guard the vital parts. Whilſt the Soul is kept ſound from impatience, from diſtruſt, our Enemy may afflict us, he cannot hurt us.</p>
            <p>They ſue for a ſufferance; not daring other then to grant, that, without the permiſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they could not hurt a very Swine. If it be fearfull to think how great things evil Spirits can doe with permiſſion; it is comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to think how nothing they can doe without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. We know they want not malice to deſtroy the whole frame of God's work; but of all, Man; of all men, Chriſtians. But if without leave they cannot ſet upon an Hog, what can they doe to the living Images of their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour? They cannot offer us ſo much as a ſuggeſtion, without the permiſſion of our Saviour: And can he, that
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:47750:74"/>
would give his own moſt precious bloud for us, to ſave us from evil, wilfully give us over to evil?</p>
            <p>It is no news, that wicked ſpirits wiſh to doe miſchief; it is news, that they are allowed it. If the Owner of all things ſhould ſtand upon his abſolute command, who can challenge him for what he thinks fit to doe with his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? The firſt Fole of the Aſs is commanded, under the Law, to have his neck broken: what is that to us? The creatures doe that they were made for, if they may ſerve any way to the glory of their Maker. But ſeldome ever doth God leave his actions unfurniſhed with ſuch reaſons as our weakneſs may reach unto. There were Sects amongſt theſe <hi>Jews</hi> that denied Spirits; they could not be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, more powerfully convinced then by this event. Now ſhall the <hi>Gadarens</hi> ſee from what a multitude of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils they were delivered; and how eaſie it had been for the ſame power to have allowed theſe Spirits to ſeize upon their Perſons, as well as on their Swine. Neither did God this without a juſt purpoſe of their caſtigation: His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are righteous, where they are moſt ſecret. Though we cannot accuſe theſe inhabitants of ought, yet he could, and thought good thus to mulct them. And if they had not wanted grace to acknowledge it, it was no ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, that he would puniſh them in their Swine, for that which he might have avenged upon their Bodies and Souls. Our Goods are fartheſt off us: If but in theſe we ſmart, we muſt confeſs we find mercy.</p>
            <p>Sometimes it pleaſeth God to grant the ſuits of wicked men and ſpirits, in no favour to the ſuitours. He grants an ill ſuit, and withholds a good: He grants an ill ſuit in judgment, and holds back a good one in mercy. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ask meat; he gives Quails to their mouths, and <hi>leanneſs to their ſouls.</hi> The choſen Veſſel wiſhes Satan taken off, and hears onely, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> We may not evermore meaſure favours by condeſcent. Theſe Devils doubtleſs receive more puniſhment for that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:47750:74"/>
harmfull act wherein they are heard. If we ask what is either unfit to receive, or unlawfull to beg, it is a great favour of our God to be denied.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Spirits which would go into the Swine by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, go out of the Man by command; they had ſtayed long, and are ejected ſuddenly. The immediate works of God are perfect in an inſtant, and do not require the aid of time for their maturation.</p>
            <p>No ſooner are they caſt out of the Man, then they are in the Swine: They will loſe no time, but paſs without intermiſſion from one miſchief to another. If they hold it a pain not to be doing evil, why is it not our delight to be ever doing good? The impetuouſneſs was no leſs then the ſpeed. <hi>The Herd was carried with violence from a ſteep-down place into the lake, and was choaked.</hi> It is no ſmall force that could doe this; but if the Swine had been ſo many mountains, theſe Spirits, upon God's permiſſion, had thus tranſported them. How eaſily can they carry thoſe Souls which are under their power to deſtruction? Unclean beaſts that wallow in the mire of ſenſuality, brutiſh drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards transforming themſelves by exceſs, even they are the Swine whom the Legion carries headlong to the pit of perdition.</p>
            <p>The wicked Spirits have their wiſh; the Swine are choaked in the waves: What eaſe is this to them? Good God, that there ſhould be any creature that ſeeks content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in deſtroying, in tormenting the good creatures of his Maker! This is the diet of Hell: Thoſe Fiends feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpight towards Man, ſo much more as he doth more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble his Creatour; towards all other living ſubſtances, ſo much more as they may be more uſefull to man. The Swine ran down violently; what marvell is it if their Keepers fled? That miraculous work, which ſhould have drawn them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> drives them from him. They run with the news; the country comes in with clamour: <hi>The whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the country about beſought him to depart.</hi> The
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:47750:75"/>
multitude is a beaſt of many heads; every head hath a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral mouth, and every mouth a ſeveral tongue, and every tongue a ſeveral accent: every head hath a ſeveral brain, and every brain thoughts of their own. So as it is hard to find a multitude without ſome diviſion at leaſt. Seldome ever hath a good motion found a perfect accordance: it is not ſo infrequent for a multitude to conſpire in evil. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of aſſent is no warrant for any act. Common er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour carries away many, who inquire not into the reaſon of ought, but the practice. The way to Hell is a beaten road through the many feet that tread it. When Vice grows into faſhion, Singularity is a Vertue.</p>
            <p>There was not a <hi>Gadaren</hi> found that either dehorted their fellows, or oppoſed the motion. It is a ſign of people given up to judgment, when no man makes head againſt projects of evil. Alas! what can one ſtrong man doe againſt a whole throng of wickedneſs? Yet this good comes of an unprevailing reſiſtence, that God forbears to plague where he finds but a ſprinkling of Faith. Happy are they who (like unto the celeſtial bodies, which being carried about with the ſway of the higheſt ſphere, yet creep on their own ways) keep on the courſes of their own holineſs, againſt the ſwindge of common corruptions: They ſhall both deliver their own ſouls, and help to withhold judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from others.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gadarens</hi> ſue to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his departure. It is too much favour to attribute this to their modeſty, as if they held themſelves unworthy of ſo Divine a gueſt. Why then did they fall upon this ſuit in a time of their loſs? Why did they not tax themſelves, and intimate a ſecret deſire of that which they durſt not beg? It is too much rigour to attribute it to the love of their Hogs, and an anger at their loſs; then, they had not intreated, but expelled him. It was their fear that moved this harſh ſuit; a ſervile fear of danger to their perſons, to their goods; leſt he, that could ſo abſolutely command the Devils, ſhould have ſet
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:47750:75"/>
theſe tormentours upon them; leſt their other Demoniacks ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed with like loſs. I cannot blame theſe <hi>Gadarens</hi> that they feared: this power was worthy of trembling at. Their fear was unjuſt. They ſhould have argued, <hi>This man hath power over men, beaſts, devils; it is good having him to our friend; his preſence is our ſafety and protection:</hi> Now they contrarily miſ-inferre, <hi>Thus powerfull is he, it is good he were farther off.</hi> What miſerable and pernicious miſconſtructions do men make of God, of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine attributes and actions! God is omnipotent, able to take infinite vengeance of ſin; Oh that he were not: He is provident; I may be careleſs: He is mercifull; I may ſin: He is holy; let him depart from me, for I am a ſinfull man. How witty ſophiſters are natural men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their own ſouls, to rob themſelves of a God? O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, how worthy are they to want thee that wiſh to be rid of thee? Thou haſt juſt cauſe to be weary of us, even whilſt we ſue to hold thee: but when once our wretched unthankfulneſs grows weary of thee, who can pity us to be puniſhed with thy departure? Who can ſay it is other then righteous, that thou ſhouldſt retort one day upon us, <hi>Depart from me, ye wicked?</hi>

            <p>IT was our Saviour's trade to doe good; therefore he came down from heaven to earth, therefore he changed one ſtation of earth for another. Nothing more commends goodneſs then generality and diffuſion; whereas reſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cloſe-handed reſtraint blemiſh the glory of it. The
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47750:76"/>
Sun ſtands not ſtill in one point of heaven, but walks his daily round, that all the inferiour world may ſhare of his influences both in heat and light. Thy bounty, O Saviour, did not affect the praiſe of fixedneſs, but motion. One while I find thee at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> then at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> ſoon after in the utmoſt verge of <hi>Galilee</hi>; never but doing good.</p>
            <p>But as the Sun, though he daily compaſs the world, yet never walks from under his line, never goes beyond the turning points of the longeſt and ſhorteſt day: ſo neither didſt thou, O Saviour, paſs the bounds of thine own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people; thou wouldſt move, but not wildly, not out of thine own ſphear. Wherein thy glorified eſtate exceeds thine humbled, as far as Heaven is above Earth. Now thou art <hi>lift up,</hi> thou <hi>draweſt all men unto thee:</hi> there are now no liſts, no limits of thy gracious viſitations; but as the whole Earth is equidiſtant from Heaven, ſo all the nations of the world lie equally open to thy bounty.</p>
            <p>Neither yet didſt thou want outward occaſions of thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall: Perhaps the very importunity of the Scribes and Phariſees, in obtruding their Traditions, drave thee thence; perhaps their unjuſt offence at thy Doctrine. There is no readier way to loſe <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then to clog him with humane Ordinances, then to ſpurn at his heavenly Inſtructions. He doth not always ſubduce his Spirit with his viſible preſence; but his very outward withdrawing is worthy of our ſighs, worthy of our tears. Many a one may ſay, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my</hi> Soul <hi>had not died.</hi> Thou art now with us, O Saviour, thou art with us in a free and plentifull faſhion; how long, thou knoweſt; we know our deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and fear. O teach us how happy we are in ſuch a Gueſt, and give us grace to keep thee. Hadſt thou walked within the <hi>Phoenician</hi> borders, we could have told how to have made glad conſtructions of thy mercy in turning to the Gentiles; thou that couldſt touch the Lepers without uncleanneſs, couldſt not be defiled with aliens: but we
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47750:76"/>
know the partition-wall was not yet broken down; and thou that didſt charge thy Diſciples <hi>not</hi> to <hi>walk into the way of the Gentiles,</hi> wouldſt not tranſgreſs thine own rule. Once, we are ſure, thou cameſt to the utmoſt point of the bounds of <hi>Galilee</hi>; as not ever confined to the heart of <hi>Jewry,</hi> thou wouldſt ſometimes bleſs the outer skirts with thy preſence. No angle is too obſcure for the Goſpel: <hi>The land of Zabulon and the land of Napthali, by the way of the Sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles, the people which ſate in darkneſs ſaw great light.</hi> The Sun is not ſcornfull, but looks with the ſame face upon every plot of earth: not onely the ſtately palaces and pleaſant gardens are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his beams, but mean cottages, but neglected bogs and moors. God's Word is like himſelf, <hi>no accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>; the wild Kern, the rude <hi>Scythian,</hi> the ſavage <hi>Indian</hi> are alike to it. The mercy of God will be ſure to find out thoſe that belong to his election in the moſt ſecret corners of the world, like as his judgments will fetch his enemies from under the hills and rocks. The good Shepherd walks the wilderneſs to ſeek one ſheep ſtrayed from many. If there be but one <hi>Syrophoenician</hi> Soul to be gained to the Church, <hi>Chriſt</hi> goes to the coaſts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> to fetch her. Why are we weary to doe good, when our Saviour underwent this perpetual toil in healing Bodies, and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Souls? There is no life happy but that which is ſpent in a continual drudging for edification.</p>
            <p>It is long ſince we heard of the name or nation of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites</hi>; all the country was once ſo ſtyled; that people was now forgotten: yet becauſe this woman was of the bloud of thoſe <hi>Phoenicians</hi> which were anciently ejected out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that title is revived to her. God keeps account of pedigrees after our oblivion; that he may magnifie his mercies, by continuing them to thouſands of the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the juſt, and by renewing favours upon the unjuſt. No nation carried ſuch brands and ſcars of a Curſe as <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> To the ſhame of thoſe careleſs <hi>Jews,</hi> even a faithfull
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47750:77"/>
               <hi>Canaanite</hi> is a ſuppliant to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whilſt they neglect ſo great ſalvation. She doth not ſpeak, but cry; need and deſire have raiſed her voice to an importunate clamour. The God of mercy is light of hearing, yet he loves a loud and vehement ſolicitation; not to make himſelf inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to grant, but to make us capable to receive bleſſings. They are words, and not prayers, which fall from careleſs lips. If we felt our want, or wanted not deſire, we could ſpeak to God in no tune but cries. If we would prevail with God, we muſt wraſtle, and if we would wraſtle happily with God, we muſt wraſtle firſt with our own dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Nothing but cries can pierce Heaven. Neither doth her vehemence ſo much argue her Faith, as doth her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, <hi>O Lord, thou Son of David.</hi> What Proſelyte, what Diſciple could have ſaid more? O bleſſed <hi>Syro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoenician,</hi> who taught thee this abſtract of Divinity? What can we Chriſtians confeſs more then the Deity, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>ſhip of our glorious Saviour? his Deity, as <hi>Lord</hi>; his Humanity, as a <hi>Son</hi>; his <hi>Meſſiah</hi>ſhip, as the <hi>Son of David</hi>? Of all the famous progenitours of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> two are ſingled out by an eminence, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>; a King, a Patriarch: And though the Patriarch were firſt in time, yet the King is firſt in place; not ſo much for the dignity of the perſon, as the excellence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which as it was both later and freſher in memory, ſo more honourable. To <hi>Abraham</hi> was promiſed multitude and bleſſing of ſeed: to <hi>David</hi> perpetuity of dominion. So as when God promiſeth not to deſtroy his people, it is for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſake; when, not to extinguiſh the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it is for <hi>David</hi>'s ſake. Had ſhe ſaid, the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhe had not come home to this acknowledgment. <hi>Abraham</hi> is the father of the faithfull, <hi>David</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>: There are many faithfull, there is but one King. So as in this title ſhe doth proclaim him the perpetual King of his Church, the Rod or Flower which ſhould come from the root of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> the true and onely
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:47750:77"/>
Saviour of the world. Whoſo would come unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> to purpoſe, muſt come in the right ſtyle; apprehending a true God, a true Man, a true God and Man: any of theſe ſevered from other makes <hi>Chriſt</hi> an Idol, and our prayers ſin. Being thus acknowledged, what ſuit is ſo fit for him as mercy: <hi>Have mercy on me.</hi> It was her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was tormented, yet ſhe ſays, <hi>Have mercy on me.</hi> Perhaps her poſſeſſed child was ſenſeleſs of her miſery; the parent feels both her ſorrow, and her own. As ſhe was a good woman, ſo a good mother. Grace and good nature have taught her to appropriate the afflictions of this divided part of her own fleſh. It is not in the power of another skin, to ſever the intereſt of our own loins or womb. We find ſome Fowls that burn themſelves, whilſt they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to blow out the fire from their young: And even Serpents can receive their brood into their mouth, to ſhield them from danger. No creature is ſo unnatural, as the reaſonable that hath put off affection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>On me,</hi> therefore, in mine: <hi>for my daughter is grievouſly vexed with a Devil.</hi> It was this that ſent her to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> It was this that muſt incline <hi>Chriſt</hi> to her. I doubt whether ſhe had inquired after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if ſhe had not been vexed with her Daughter's ſpirit. Our afflictions are as <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>'s beſt counſellours, that ſent him with a cord about his neck to the mercifull King of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Theſe are the files and whetſtones that ſet an edge on our Devotions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they grow dull and ineffectual. Neither are they ſtronger motives to our ſuit, then to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mercy. We cannot have a better ſpokeſman unto God then our own miſery; that alone ſues and pleads and importunes for us. This which ſets off men, whoſe compaſſion is finite, attracts God to us. Who can plead diſcouragements in his acceſs to the throne of grace, when our wants are our forcible advocates? All our worthineſs is in a capable miſery.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not example the faith of this <hi>Canaanite</hi>;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:47750:78"/>
yet ſhe was thus tormented in her Daughter. It is not the truth or ſtrength of our Faith that can ſecure us from the outward and bodily vexations of Satan: againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and ſpiritual that can and will prevail. It is no more antidote againſt the other, then againſt fevers and dropſies. How ſhould it, when as it may fall out that theſe ſufferings may be profitable? and why ſhould we expect that the love of our God ſhall yield to fore-lay any benefit to the Soul? He is an ill patient that cannot diſtinguiſh betwixt an affliction, and the evil of affliction. When the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan buffets us, it is enough that God hath ſaid, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Millions were in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> whoſe perſons, whoſe children were untouched with that tormenting hand: I hear none but this faithfull Woman ſay, <hi>My daughter is grievouſly vexed of the Devil.</hi> The worſt of bodily afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are an inſufficient proof of Divine diſpleaſure. She that hath moſt grace complains of moſt diſcomfort.</p>
            <p>Who would now expect any other then a kind anſwer to ſo pious and faithfull a petition? And behold, <hi>he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her not a word.</hi> O Holy Saviour, we have oft found cauſe to wonder at thy words, never till now at thy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. A miſerable ſuppliant cries and ſues, whilſt the God of mercies is ſpeechleſs. He that comforts the afflicted, adds affliction to the comfortleſs by a willing diſreſpect. What ſhall we ſay then? is the fountain of mercy dried up? O Saviour, couldſt thou but hear? She did not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur, not whiſper, but cry out: couldſt thou but pity, but regard her that was as good as ſhe was miſerable? If thy ears were open, could thy bowels be ſhut? Certainly it was thou that didſt put it into the heart, into the mouth of this woman to ask, and to ask thus of thy ſelf: She could never have ſaid, <hi>O Lord, thou Son of David,</hi> but from thee, but by thee: <hi>None calleth Jeſus the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Much more therefore didſt thou hear the words of thine own making; and well wert thou pleaſed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:47750:78"/>
to hear what thou thoughteſt good to forbear to anſwer. It was thine own grace that ſealed up thy lips. Whether for the trial of her patience and perſeverance: for ſilence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a ſemblance of neglect; and a willing neglect lays ſtrong ſiege to the beſt fort of the Soul. Even calm tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, when they have been ſtirred, have bewrayed impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs of paſſion. If there be any dregs in the bottom of the glaſs, when the water is ſhaken, they will be ſoon ſeen. Or whether for the more ſharpning of her deſires, and raiſing of her zealous importunity. Our holy longings are increaſed with delays: It whets our appetite to be held faſting. Or whether for the more ſweetning of the bleſſing by the difficulty or ſtay of obtaining. The benefit that comes with eaſe is eaſily contemned: Long and eager pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit endears any favour. Or whether for the ingaging of his Diſciples in ſo charitable a ſuit. Or whether for the wiſe avoidance of exception from the captious <hi>Jews.</hi> Or, laſtly, for the drawing on of an holy and imitable pattern of faithfull perſeverance; and to teach us not to meaſure God's hearing of our ſuit by his preſent anſwer, or his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent anſwer by our own ſenſe. Whilſt our weakneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects thy words, thy wiſedom reſolves upon thy ſilence. Never wert thou better pleaſed to hear the acclamation of Angels, then to hear this woman ſay, <hi>O Lord, thou Son of David:</hi> yet ſilence is thy anſwer. When we have made our prayers, it is an happy thing to hear the report of them back from Heaven: but if we always do not ſo, it is not for us to be dejected, and to accuſe either our infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, or thy neglect; ſince we find here a faithfull ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour met with a gracious Saviour, and yet <hi>he anſwered her not a word.</hi> If we be poor in ſpirit, God is rich in mercy; he cannot ſend us away empty: yet he will not always let us feel his condeſcent; croſſing us in our will, that he may advance our benefit.</p>
            <p>It was no ſmall fruit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſilence, that the Diſciples were hereupon moved to pray for her. Not for a meer
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47750:79"/>
diſmiſſion: It had been no favour to have required this, but a puniſhment: for, if to be held in ſuſpenſe be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, to be ſent away with a repulſe is more. But for a mercifull grant. They ſaw much paſſion in the woman, much cauſe of paſſion: they ſaw great diſcouragement on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s part, great conſtancy on hers. Upon all theſe they feel her miſery, and become ſuitours for her, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted. It is our duty, in caſe of neceſſity, to intercede for each other; and by how much more familiar we are with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo much more to improve our intereſt for the relief of the diſtreſſed. We are bidden to ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> not, <hi>mine.</hi> Yea, being members of one body, we pray for our ſelves in others. If the Foot be prickt, the Back bends, the Head bows down, the Eyes look, the Hands ſtir, the Tongue calls for aid; the whole man is in pain, and labours for redreſs. He cannot pray or be heard for himſelf, that is no man's friend but his own. No Prayer without Faith, no Faith without Charity, no Charity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mutual Interceſſion.</p>
            <p>That which urged them to ſpeak for her, is urged to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by them for her obtaining; <hi>She cries after us.</hi> Prayer is as an Arrow: if it be drawn up but a little, it goes not far; but if it be pull'd up to the head, it flies ſtrongly, and pierces deep. If it be but dribbled forth of careleſs lips, it falls down at our foot: the ſtrength of our ejaculation ſends it up into Heaven, and fetches down a bleſſing. The child hath eſcaped many a ſtripe by his loud crying; and the very unjuſt Judge cannot endure the widow's clamour. Heartleſs motions do but teach us to deny; fervent ſuits offer violence both to earth and heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> would not anſwer the Woman, but doth anſwer the Diſciples. Thoſe that have a familiarity with God ſhall receive anſwers, when ſtrangers ſhall ſtand out. Yea even of domeſticks ſome are more intire. He that lay in <hi>Jeſus</hi> his boſome could receive that intelligence which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the reſt. But who can tell whether that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

or this anſwer be more grievous? <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> What is this anſwer but a defence of that ſilence and ſeeming neglect? Whilſt he ſaid nothing, his forbearance might have been ſuppoſed to proceed from the neceſſity of ſome greater thoughts: but now his anſwer profeſſeth that ſilence to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a willing reſolution not to anſwer: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth not vouchſafe ſo much as to give to her the anſwer, but to her ſolicitours; that they might return his denial from him to her, who had undertaken to derive her ſuit to him. <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Like a faithfull Embaſſadour, <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath an eye to his commiſſion: that may not be violated, though to an apparent advantage: whither he is not ſent, he may not go. As he, ſo all his have their fixed marks ſet; at theſe they aim, and think it not ſafe to ſhoot at rovers. In matter of morality it is not for us to ſtand onely upon inhibitions, avoiding what is forbidden, but upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, endeavouring onely what is injoyned. We need no other rule of our life, then the intention of our ſeveral ſtations. And if he that was God would take no farther ſcope to himſelf then the limits of his commiſſion, how much doth it concern us frail men to keep within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs? or what ſhall become of our lawleſneſs, that live in a direct contrariety to the will of him that ſent us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s name, from him derived to his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; till the diviſion of the Tribes under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> all that nation was <hi>Iſrael:</hi> then the Father's name went to the moſt, which were ten Tribes; the name of the Son <hi>Juda</hi> to the beſt, which were two. <hi>Chriſt</hi> takes no notice of this unhappy diviſion; he remembers the ancient name which he gave to that faithfull wraſtler. It was this <hi>Chriſt</hi> with whom <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtrove; it was he that wrencht his hip, and changed his name, and diſmiſt him with a bleſſing: and now he cannot forget his old mercy to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; to that onely doth he profeſs himſelf ſent. Their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:47750:80"/>
firſt brood were Shepherds, now they are Sheep; and thoſe not guarded; not empaſtured, but ſtrayed and loſt. O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we ſee thy charge; the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not of <hi>Eſau</hi>; ſheep, not goats, not wolves; loſt ſheep, not ſecurely impaled in the confidence of their ſafe condition. Woe were to us if thou wert not ſent to us. <hi>He is not a Jew which is one without.</hi> Every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> is not a true one. We are not of thy fold, if we be not ſheep: thou wilt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to thy fold, if we be not loſt in our own appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. O Lord, thou haſt put a fleece upon our backs, we have loſt our ſelves enough: make us ſo ſenſible of our own wandrings, that we may find thee ſent unto us, and may be happily found of thee.</p>
            <p>Hath not this poor woman yet done? Can neither the ſilence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> nor his denial ſilence her? Is it poſſible ſhe ſhould have any glimps of hope after ſo reſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes? Yet ſtill, as if ſhe ſaw no argument of diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhe comes, and worſhips, and cries, <hi>Lord, help me.</hi> She which could not in the houſe get a word of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhe that ſaw her ſolicitours (though <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Diſciples) repelled, yet ſhe comes. Before ſhe followed, now ſhe overtakes him: before ſhe ſued aloof, now ſhe comes cloſe to him: no contempt can caſt her off. Faith is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted grace; it hath a ſtrong heart, and a bold forehead. Even very denials cannot diſmay it, much leſs delays. She came not to face, not to expoſtulate, but to proſtrate her ſelf at his feet. Her tongue worſhipt him before, now her knee. The eye of her Faith ſaw that Divinity in <hi>Chriſt</hi> which bowed her to his earth. There cannot be a fitter geſture of man to God then Adoration.</p>
            <p>Her firſt ſuit was for mercy, now for help. There is no uſe of mercy but in helpfulneſs. To be pitied without aid, is but an addition to miſery. Who can blame us, if we care not for an unprofitable compaſſion?</p>
            <p>The very ſuit was gracious. She ſaith not, <hi>Lord, if thou canſt, help me,</hi> as the father of the Lunatick; but profeſſes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:47750:80"/>
the power whilſt ſhe begs the act, and gives glory where ſhe would have relief.</p>
            <p>Who now can expect other then a fair and yielding an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſo humble, ſo faithfull, ſo patient a ſuppliant? What can ſpeed well, if a prayer of faith from the knees of humility ſucceed not? And yet, behold, the farther ſhe goes, the worſe ſhe fares: her diſcouragement is doubled with her ſuit. <hi>It is not good to take the childrens bread, and to caſt it to dogs.</hi> Firſt, his ſilence implied a contempt; then, his anſwer defended his ſilence; now, his ſpeech expreſſes and defends his contempt. Lo, he hath turned her from a woman to a dog, and (as it were) ſpurns her from his feet with an harſh repulſe. What ſhall we ſay? is the Lamb of God turned Lion? doth that clear fountain of mercy run bloud? O Saviour, did ever ſo hard a word fall from thoſe mild lips? Thou calledſt <hi>Herod Fox,</hi> moſt worthily; he was crafty and wicked: the Scribes and Phariſees a <hi>generation of vipers</hi>; they were venomous and cruel: <hi>Judas a Devil</hi>; he was both covetous and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. But here was a Woman in diſtreſs, and diſtreſs chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges mercy: a good woman, a faithfull ſuppliant, a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh</hi> diſciple, a Chriſtian <hi>Canaanite</hi>; yet rated, and whipt out for a dog, by thee who wert all goodneſs and mercy. How different are thy ways from ours? Even thy ſeverity argues favour. The trial had not been ſo ſharp, if thou hadſt not found the faith ſo ſtrong, if thou hadſt not meant the iſſue ſo happy. Thou hadſt not driven her away as a Dog, if thou hadſt not intended to admit her for a Saint; and to advance her ſo much for a pattern of Faith, as thou depreſſedſt her for a ſpectacle of contempt.</p>
            <p>The time was when the <hi>Jews</hi> were Children, and the Gentiles Dogs: now the caſe is happily altered; the <hi>Jews</hi> are the Dogs, (ſo their dear and Divine countryman calls the Conciſion,) we Gentiles are the Children. What certainty is there in an external profeſſion, that gives us onely to ſeem, not to be? at leaſt the being that it gives
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:47750:81"/>
is doubtfull and temporary: we may be Children to day, and Dogs to morrow. The true aſſurance of our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in the Decree and Covenant of God, on his part; in our Faith and Obedience, on ours. How they of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren became Dogs, it is not hard to ſay; their preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, their unbelief transformed them; and (to perfect their brutiſhneſs) they ſet their fangs upon the Lord of life. How we of Dogs become Children, I know no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but, <hi>Oh the depth</hi>! That which at the firſt ſingled them out from the nations of the world, hath at laſt ſingled us out from the world and them. <hi>It is not in him that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that hath mercy.</hi> Lord, how ſhould we bleſs thy goodneſs, that we of Dogs are Children? how ſhould we fear thy juſtice, ſince they of Children are Dogs? O let <hi>not</hi> us <hi>be high-minded, but tremble.</hi> If they were cut off who crucified thee in thine humbled eſtate, what may we expect who crucifie thee daily in thy glory?</p>
            <p>Now what ordinary patience would not have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with ſo contemptuous a repulſe? How few but would have faln into intemperate paſſions, into paſſionate expoſtulations? Art thou the Prophet of God, that ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully entertaineſt poor ſuppliants? Is this the comfort that thou dealeſt to the diſtreſſed? Is this the fruit of my humble adoration, of my faithfull profeſſion? Did I ſnarl or bark at thee, when I called thee the Son of <hi>David</hi>? Did I fly upon thee otherwiſe then with my prayers and tears? And if this term were fit for my vileneſs, yet doth it become thy lips? Is it not ſorrow enough to me that I am afflicted with my Daughter's miſery, but that thou (of whom I hoped for relief) muſt adde to mine affliction in an unkind reproach? But here is none of all this: Contrarily, her humility grants all, her patience overcomes all, and ſhe meekly anſwers, <hi>Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crums which fall from their maſter's table.</hi> The reply is not more witty then faithfull. O Lord, thou art Truth it ſelf,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:47750:81"/>
thy words can be no other then truth; thou haſt call'd me a Dog, and a Dog I am: give me therefore the favour and privilege of a Dog, that I may gather up ſome crums of mercy from under that table whereat thy Children ſit. This bleſſing (though great to me, yet) to the infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy power and mercy is but as a crum to a feaſt. I preſume not to preſs to the board, but to creep under it: deny me not thoſe ſmall offalls which elſe would be ſwept away in the duſt. After this ſtripe, give me but a crum, and I ſhall fawn upon thee, and depart ſatisfied. O woman, (ſay I) great is thine humility, great is thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: but, <hi>O woman,</hi> (ſaith my Saviour) <hi>great is thy faith.</hi> He ſees the root, we the ſtock. Nothing but Faith could thus temper the heart, thus ſtrengthen the ſoul, thus charm the tongue. O precious Faith! O acceptable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance! It is no marvell if that chiding end in favour: <hi>Be it to thee even as thou wilt.</hi> Never did ſuch grace go away uncrowned. The beneficence had been ſtreight, if thou hadſt not carried away more then thou ſuedſt for. Lo, thou that cameſt a Dog, goeſt away a Child: thou that wouldſt but creep under the Childrens feet, art ſet at their elbow: thou that wouldſt have taken up with a crum, art feaſted with full diſhes. The way to ſpeed well at God's hand is, to be humbled in his eyes, and in our own. It is quite otherwiſe with God, and with men. With men, we are ſo accounted of as we account of our ſelves: he ſhall be ſure to be vile in the ſight of others, which is vile in his own. With God, nothing is got by vain oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nothing is loſt by abaſement. O God, when we look down to our own weakneſs, and caſt up our eyes to thine infiniteneſs, thine omnipotence, what poor things we are? but when we look down upon our ſins and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, how ſhall we expreſs our ſhame? None of all thy creatures (except Devils) are capable of ſo foul a quality. As we have thus made our ſelves worſe then beaſts, ſo let us, in a ſincere humbleneſs of mind acknowledge it to thee,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47750:82"/>
who canſt pity, forgive, redreſs it. So ſetting our ſelves down at the lower end of the table of thy creatures, thou, the great Maſter of the Feaſt, maiſt be pleaſed to advance us to the height of glory.</p>

            <head>XIX. The Deaf and Dumb man cured.</head>
            <p>OUR Saviour's entrance into the coaſts of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon</hi> was not without a Miracle, neither was his regreſs; as the Sun neither riſes nor ſets without light. In his entrance, he delivers the Daughter of the faithfull <hi>Syrophoenician:</hi> in his egreſs, he cures the Deaf and Dumb. He can no more want work, then that work can want ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. Whether the Patient were naturally deaf, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly dumb, or imperfectly dumb, and accidentally deaf, I labour not. Sure I am that he was ſo deaf that he could not hear of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo dumb that he could not ſpeak for himſelf: good neighbours ſupply his ears, his tongue; they bring him to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Behold a Miracle led in by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, acted by power, led out by modeſty.</p>
            <p>It was a true office of love, to ſpeak thus in the cauſe of the dumb, to lend ſenſes to him that wanted. Poor man! he had nothing to intreat for him but his impotence; here was neither ear to inform, nor tongue to crave: his friends are ſenſible of his infirmity, and unasked bring him to cure. This ſpiritual ſervice we owe to each other. It is true, we ſhould be quick of hearing to the things of God and of our peace, quick of tongue to call for our helps: but, alas! we are naturally deaf and dumb to good, we have ear and tongue enough for the world; if that do but whiſper,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47750:82"/>
we hear it; if that do but draw back, we cry after it: we have neither for God. Ever ſince our ear was lent to the Serpent in Paradiſe, it hath been ſpiritually deaf; ever ſince we ſet our tooth in the forbidden fruit, our tongue hath been ſpeechleſs to God: and that which was faulty in the root, is worſe in the branches. Every ſoul is more deafned and bedumbed by increaſing corruptions, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſins. Some ears the infinite mercy of God hath bored, ſome tongues he hath untied by the power of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: theſe are wanting to their holy faculties, if they do not improve themſelves in bringing the deaf and dumb unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome deaf and dumb upon neceſſity, ſome others upon affectation. Thoſe, ſuch as live either out of the pale of the Church, or under a ſpiritual tyranny within the Church: we have no help for them but our prayers, our pity can reach farther then our aid. Theſe, ſuch as may hear of a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſue to him, but will not; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſo much more fearfull, as it is more voluntary. This kind is full of wofull variety, whilſt ſome are deaf by an outward obturation, whether by the prejudice of the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or by ſecular occaſions and diſtractions; others, by the inwardly apoſtemating tumours of pride, by the ill va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of carnal affections, of froward reſolutions: all of them like the deaf adder have their ears ſhut to the Divine char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. O miſerable condition of fooliſh men, ſo peeviſhly averſe from their own ſalvation; ſo much more worthy of our commiſeration, as it is more incapable of their own! Theſe are the men whoſe cure we muſt labour, whom we muſt bring to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by admonitions, by threats, by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and (if need be) by wholſome compulſions.</p>
            <p>They do not onely lend their hand to the deaf and dumb, but their tongue alſo; they ſay for him that which he could not wiſh to ſay for himſelf. Doubtleſs they had made ſigns to him of what they intended, and finding him forward in his deſires, now they ſpeak to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:47750:83"/>
Every man lightly hath a tongue to ſpeak for himſelf; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he that keeps a tongue for other men. We are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not with ſupplications onely, but with interceſſions. Herein is both the largeſt improvement of our love, and moſt effectual. No diſtance can hinder this fruit of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion; thus we may oblige thoſe that we ſhall never ſee, thoſe that can never thank us. This beneficence can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impoveriſh us; the more we give, we have ſtill the more; it is a ſafe and happy ſtore that cannot be impaired by our bounty. What was their ſuit, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would put his hand upon the Patient? Not that they would preſcribe the means, or imply a neceſſity of his touch; but for that they ſaw this was the ordinary courſe both of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Diſciples, by touching to heal. Our prayers muſt be directed to the uſual proceedings of God: his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be the rule of our prayers, our prayers may not preſcribe his actions.</p>
            <p>That gracious Saviour, who is wont to exceed our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, does more then they ſue for. Not onely doth he touch the party, but takes him by the hand, and leads him from the multitude.</p>
            <p>He that would be healed of his ſpiritual Infirmities muſt be ſequeſtred from the throng of the world. There is a good uſe, in due times, of ſolitarineſs. That ſoul can never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God that is not ſometimes retired: the modeſt Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom of the Church will not impart himſelf to his Spouſe before company. Or perhaps this ſeceſſion was for our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of a willing and carefull avoidance of vain-glory in our actions: whence alſo it is that our Saviour gives an after-charge of ſecrecy. He that could ſay, <hi>He that doeth evil hateth the light,</hi> eſchueth the light even in good. To ſeek our own glory is not glory. Although beſides this baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſire of obſcurity, here is a meet regard of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the carriage of our actions. The envy of the Scribes and Phariſees might trouble the paſſage of his Divine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; their exaſperation is wiſely declined by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:47750:83"/>
He in whoſe hands time is, knows how to make his beſt choice of ſeaſons. Neither was it our Saviour's meaning to have this Miracle buried, but hid. Wiſedom hath no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter improvement then in diſtinguiſhing times, and diſcreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marſhalling the circumſtances of our actions; which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever neglects, ſhall be ſure to ſhame his work, and marre his hopes.</p>
            <p>Is there a ſpirituall Patient to be cured? aſide with him: to undertake him before the face of the multitude, is to wound, not to heal him.</p>
            <p>Reproof and good counſel muſt be like our Alms, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſo as (if poſſible) one ear or hand might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to the other. As in ſome caſes Confeſſion, ſo our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion muſt be auricular. The diſcreet Chirurgion that would cure a modeſt patient, whoſe ſecret complaint hath in it more ſhame then pain, ſhuts out all eyes ſave his own. It is enough for the God of Juſtice to ſay, <hi>Thou didſt it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, but I will doe it before all Iſrael, and before this Sun.</hi> Our limited and imperfect wiſedom muſt teach us to apply private redreſſes to private maladies. It is the beſt remedy that is leaſt ſeen, and moſt felt.</p>
            <p>What means this variety of Ceremony? O Saviour, how many parts of thee are here active? Thy finger is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ear, thy ſpittle toucheth the tongue, thine eyes look up, thy lungs ſigh, thy lips move to an <hi>Epphatha.</hi> Thy word alone, thy beck alone, thy wiſh alone, yea the leaſt act of velleity from thee might have wrought this cure: why wouldſt thou imploy ſo much of thy ſelf in this work? Was it to ſhew thy liberty in not always equally exerciſing the power of thy Deity? in that one while thine onely command ſhall raiſe the dead, and eject Devils; another while thou wouldſt accommodate thy ſelf to the mean and homely faſhions of natural Agents, and, conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to our ſenſes and cuſtoms, take thoſe ways which may carry ſome more near reſpect to the cure intended. Or was it to teach us how well thou likeſt that there ſhould be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:47750:84"/>
a ceremonious carriage of thy ſolemn actions, which thou pleaſeſt to produce cloathed with ſuch circumſtantial forms?</p>
            <p>It did not content thee to put one finger into one ear, but into either ear wouldſt thou put a finger: both ears equally needed cure, thou wouldſt apply the means of cure to both. The Spirit of God is the finger of God: then doſt thou, O Saviour, put thy finger into our ear, when thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inables us to hear effectually. If we thruſt our own fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into our ears, uſing ſuch humane perſwaſions to our ſelves as ariſe from worldly grounds, we labour in vain; yea, theſe ſtoppells muſts needs hinder our hearing the voice of God. Hence, the great Philoſophers of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent world, the learned Rabbins of the Synagogue, the great Doctours of a falſe faith, are deaf to ſpiritual things. It is onely that finger of thy Spirit, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> that can open our ears, and make paſſage through our ears into our hearts. Let that finger of thine be put into our ears, ſo ſhall our deafneſs be removed, and we ſhall hear, not the loud thunders of the Law, but the gentle whiſperings of thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious motions to our ſouls.</p>
            <p>We hear for our ſelves, but we ſpeak for others. Our Saviour was not content to open the ears onely, but to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the tongue. With the ear we hear, with the mouth we confeſs. The ſame hand is applied to the tongue, not with a dry touch, but with ſpittle; in alluſion doubtleſs to the removall of the naturall impediment of ſpeech: moiſture, we know, glibs the tongue, and makes it apt to motion; how much more from that ſacred mouth?</p>
            <p>There are thoſe whoſe ears are open, but their mouths are ſtill ſhut to God; they underſtand, but do not utter the wonderfull things of God: there is but half a cure wrought upon theſe men; their ear is but open to hear their own judgement, except their mouth be open to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their Maker and Redeemer. O God, do thou ſo moiſten my tongue with th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the pen of a ready writer) to the praiſe of thy name. Whilſt the finger of our Saviour was on the tongue, in the ear of the Patient, his eye was in Heaven. Never man had ſo much cauſe to look up to Heaven as he; there was his home, there was his throne; he onely was <hi>from heaven, heavenly.</hi> Each of us hath a good mind homeward, though we meet with better ſights abroad; how much more when our home is ſo glorious above the region of our peregrination? but thou, O Saviour, hadſt not onely thy dwelling there, but thy ſeat of majeſty; there the greateſt Angels adored thee: it is a wonder that thine eye could be ever any-where but there. What doeth thine eye in this, but teach ours where to be fixed? Every good gift and every perfect giving come down from above: how can we look off from that place whence we receive all good? Thou didſt not teach us to ſay, O infinite God, which art every-where; but, O <hi>our Father, which art in heaven:</hi> there let us look up to thee. O let not our eyes or hearts grovell upon this earth, but let us faſten them above the hills whence cometh our ſalvation; thence let us acknowledge all the good we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; thence let us expect all the good we want.</p>
            <p>Why our Saviour look'd up to Heaven (though he had Heaven in himſelf) we can ſee reaſon enough: but why did he ſigh? Surely not for need; the leaſt motion of a thought was in him impetratory. How could he chuſe but be heard of his Father, who was one with the Father? Not for any fear of diſtruſt. But partly for compaſſion, partly for example. For compaſſion of thoſe manifold infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities into which ſin had plunged mankind; a pitifull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was here preſented unto him. For example, to fetch ſighs from us for the miſeries of others; ſighs of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for them, ſighs of deſire for their redreſs. This is not the firſt time that our Saviour ſpent ſighs, yea tears, upon humane diſtreſſes. We are not bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, if we ſo feel not the ſmart of our brethren, that the fire of our paſſion break forth into the ſmoke
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:47750:85"/>
of ſighs. <hi>Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not ſilent whilſt he cured the Dumb; his <hi>Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatha</hi> gave life to all theſe his other actions. His ſighing, his ſpitting, his looking up to heaven, were the acts of a man: but his command of the ear and mouth to open was the act of God. He could not command that which he made not. His word is imperative, ours ſupplicatory. He doeth what he will with us, we doe by him what he thinks good to impart. In this mouth the word cannot be ſevered from the ſucceſs: our Saviour's lips are no ſooner opened in his <hi>Epphatha,</hi> then the mouth of the Dumb and the ears of the Deaf are opened at once. Behold here celerity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Naturall agents work by leiſure, by degrees; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is done in an inſtant; by many ſteps is every thing carried from the entrance to the conſummation: Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency knows no rules; no imperfect work can proceed from a cauſe abſolutely perfect. The man hears now more lightly then if he had never been deaf, and ſpeaks more plainly then if he had never been tongue-ty'd. And can we blame him if he beſtowed the handſel of his ſpeech upon the power that reſtored it? if the firſt improvement of his tongue were the praiſe of the giver, of the maker of it? Or can we expect other then that our Saviour ſhould ſay, Thy tongue is free, uſe it to the praiſe of him that made it ſo; thy ears are open, hear him that bids thee proclaim thy cure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the houſe-top? But now behold, contrarily, he that opens this man's mouth by his powerfull word, by the ſame word ſhuts it again; charging ſilence by the ſame breath wherewith he gave ſpeech: <hi>Tell no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe tongues which interceded for his Cure, are charmed for the concealment of it. O Saviour, thou knoweſt the grounds of thine own commands; it is not for us to enquire, but to obey: we may not honour thee with a forbidden celebration. Good meanings have oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proved injurious. Thoſe men whoſe charity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:47750:85"/>
their tongues to ſpeak for the dumb man, do now imploy the ſame tongues to ſpeak of his cure, when they ſhould have been dumb. This charge (they imagine) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an humble modeſty in <hi>Chriſt</hi>; which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his honour bids them violate. I know not how we itch after thoſe forbidden acts, which if left to our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty we willingly neglect. This prohibition increaſeth the rumour; every tongue is buſied about this one. What can we make of this but a well-meant diſobedience? O God, I ſhould more gladly publiſh thy Name at thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. I know thou canſt not bid me to diſhonour thee; there is no danger of ſuch an injunction: but if thou ſhouldſt bid me to hide the profeſſion of thy Name and wondrous works, I ſhould fulfill thy words, and not examine thine intentions. Thou knoweſt how to win more honour by our ſilence, then by our promulgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A forbidden good differs little from evil. What makes our actions to be ſin but thy prohibitions? our judgement avails nothing. If thou forbid us that which we think good, it becomes as faulty to thee-ward as that which is originally evil. Take thou charge of thy glory, give me grace to take charge of thy precepts.</p>

            <head>XX. Zacchaeus.</head>
            <p>NOW was our Saviour walking towards his Paſſion: his laſt journey had moſt wonders. <hi>Jericho</hi> was in his way from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> he balks it not, though it were outwardly curſed; but, as the firſt <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaved a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> there, ſo there the ſecond ſaves a <hi>Zacchaeus</hi>; that an
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:47750:86"/>
Harlot, this a Publican. The traveller was wounded as he was going from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho:</hi> this man was taken from his <hi>Jericho</hi> to the true <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and was healed. Not as a paſſenger did <hi>Chriſt</hi> walk this way, but as a viſiter; not to puniſh, but to heal. With us, the ſick man is glad to ſend far for the Phyſician; here the Phyſician comes to ſeek Patients, and calls at our door for work. Had not this good Shepherd left the ninety nine, and ſearched the deſart, the loſt ſheep had never recovered the fold: had not his gracious frugality ſought the loſt groat, it had been ſwept up with the ruſhes, and thrown out in the duſt. Still, O Saviour, doſt thou walk through our <hi>Jericho:</hi> what would become of us, if thou ſhouldſt ſtay till we ſeek thee alone? Even when thou haſt found us, how hardly do we follow thee? The work muſt be all thine: we ſhall not ſeek thee, if thou find us not; we ſhall not follow thee, if thou draw us not.</p>
            <p>Never didſt thou, O Saviour, ſet one ſtep in vain; whereſoever thou art walking, there is ſome <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> to be wone: as in a drought, when we ſee ſome weighty cloud hovering over us, we ſay there is rain for ſome grounds, whereſoever it falls. The Ordinances of God bode good to ſome Souls, and happy are they on whom it lights.</p>
            <p>How juſtly is <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> brought in with a note of wonder? It is both great and good news to hear of a Convert. To ſee men perverted from God to the world, from truth to hereſie, from piety to prophaneneſs, is as common, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable; every night ſuch ſtars fall: but to ſee a ſinner come home to God, is both happy, and wondrous to men and Angels. I cannot blame that Philoſopher who, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to write of the hidden miracles of nature, ſpends moſt of his diſcourſe upon the generation and formation of Man; ſurely we are <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made:</hi> but how much greater is the miracle of our ſpirituall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; that a ſon of wrath, a child of Satan ſhould be transformed into the ſon and heir of the ever-living God?
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:47750:86"/>
O God, thou workeſt both: but in the one our ſpirit ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates us, in the other thine own.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome things which have wonder in them for their worth, loſe it for their frequence; this hath no leſs rarity in it then excellence. How many painfull <hi>Peter's</hi> have complained to fiſh all night, and catch nothing? Many Profeſſours and few Converts hath been ever the lot of the Goſpel. God's houſe, as the ſtreets of <hi>Jericho,</hi> may be thronged, and yet but one <hi>Zacchaeus.</hi> As therefore in the Lottery, when the great prize comes, the trumpet ſounds before it; ſo the news of a Convert is proclaimed with, <hi>Behold Zacchaeus.</hi> Any Penitent had been worthy of a ſhout, but this man by an eminence; a Publican, a chief of the Publicans, rich.</p>
            <p>No name under heaven was ſo odious as this of a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican, eſpecially to this Nation, that ſtood ſo high upon their freedom, that every impeachment of it ſeemed no leſs then damnable: inſomuch as they ask not, Is it fit, or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but, <hi>Is it lawfull, to pay tribute unto Caeſar?</hi> Any office of exaction muſt needs be hainous to a people ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the yoke. And yet, not ſo much the trade, as the extortion drew hatred upon this profeſſion; out of both they are deeply infamous: one while they are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with Heathens, another while with Harlots, always with Sinners. <hi>And behold, Zacchaeus a Publican.</hi> We are all naturally ſtrangers from God, the beſt is indiſpoſed to grace: yet ſome there are whoſe very calling gives them better advantages. But this catch-poleſhip of <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried extortion in the face, and in a ſort bad defiance to his converſion: yet behold, from this Toll-booth is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> to be a Diſciple, and <hi>Matthew</hi> to be an Apoſtle. We are in the hand of a cunning work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that of the knottieſt and crookedſt timber can make rafts and cieling for his own houſe; that can ſquare the marble, or flint, as well as the freeſt ſtone. Who can now plead the diſadvantage of his place, when he ſees a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:47750:87"/>
come to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> No calling can prejudice God's gracious election.</p>
            <p>To excell in evil muſt needs be worſe: if to be a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blican be ill, ſurely to be an Arch-publican is more. What talk we of the chief of Publicans, when he that profeſſed himſelf the chief of ſinners is now among the chief of Saints? Who can deſpair of mercy, when he ſees one <hi>Jericho</hi> ſend both an Harlot and a Publican to Heaven?</p>
            <p>The trade of <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> was not a greater rub in his way, then his wealth. He that ſent word to <hi>John</hi> for great news, that <hi>the poor receive the Goſpel,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>How hard is it for a rich man to enter into heaven?</hi> This bunch of the Camel keeps him from paſſing the needle's eye; although not by any malignity that is in the creature it ſelf, (Riches are the gift of God,) but by reaſon of thoſe three perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hang-byes, Cares, Pleaſures, Pride, which too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly attend upon wealth. Separate theſe, Riches are a bleſſing: If we can ſo poſſeſs them, that they poſſeſs not us, there can be no danger, much benefit in abundance. All the good or ill of wealth, or poverty, is in the mind, in the uſe. He that hath a free and lowly heart in riches, is poor; he that hath a proud heart under rags, is rich. If the rich man doe good and diſtribute, and the poor man ſteal, the rich hath put off his woe to the poor. <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> had never been ſo famous a Convert, if he had been poor; nor ſo liberal a Convert, if he had not been rich. If more difficulty, yet more glory was in the converſion of rich <hi>Zacchaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is well that wealthy <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> was deſirous to ſee <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Little do too many rich men care too ſee that ſight: the face of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in their coin is more pleaſing. This man leaves his bags, to bleſs his eyes with this proſpect. Yet can I not praiſe him for this too much; it was not (I fear) out of Faith, but Curioſity. He that had heard great fame of the man, of his Miracles, would gladly ſee his face: even an <hi>Herod</hi> long'd for this, and was never the better.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47750:87"/>
Onely this I find, that this curioſity of the eye, through the mercy of God, gave occaſion to the belief of the heart. He that deſires to ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> is in the way to injoy him: there is not ſo much as a remote poſſibility in the man that cares not to behold him. The eye were ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, if it were onely to betray our Souls: there are no leſs beneficial glaunces of it. We are not worthy of this uſefull caſement of the heart, if we do not thence ſend forth beams of holy deſires, and thereby re-convey pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and ſaving objects.</p>
            <p>I cannot marvell if <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> were deſirous to ſee <hi>Jeſus:</hi> all the world was not worth this ſight. Old <hi>Simeon</hi> thought it beſt to have his eyes cloſed up with this ſpectacle, as if he held it pity and diſparagement to ſee ought after it. The father of the faithfull rejoyced to ſee him, though at nineteen hundred years diſtance: and the great Doctour of the Gentiles ſtands upon this as his higheſt ſtair, <hi>Have I not ſeen the Lord Jeſus?</hi> And yet, O Saviour, many a one ſaw thee here, that ſhall never ſee thy face above; yea, that ſhall call to the hills to hide them from thy ſight. And if we had once <hi>known</hi> thee <hi>according to the fleſh, henceforth know</hi> we thee ſo <hi>no more.</hi> What an happineſs ſhall it be, ſo to ſee thee glorious, that in ſeeing thee we ſhall partake of thy glory? O bleſſed viſion, to which all others are but penal and deſpicable! Let me go into the Mint-houſe, and ſee heaps of gold, I am never the richer: let me go to the Picturers, I ſee goodly faces, and am never the fairer: let me go to the Court, I ſee ſtate and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and am never the greater. But, O Saviour, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee thee, and not be bleſſed. I can ſee thee here, though in a glaſs: If the eye of my Faith be dim, yet it is ſure. O let me be unquiet till I do now ſee thee through the veil of Heaven, ere I ſhall ſee thee as I am ſeen.</p>
            <p>Fain would <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> ſee <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but he could not. It were ſtrange if a man ſhould not find ſome lett in good
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47750:88"/>
deſires; ſomewhat will be ſtill in the way betwixt us and <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Here are two hinderances met, the one internal, the other external; the ſtature of the man, the preſs of the multitude; the greatneſs of the preſs, the ſmalneſs of the ſtature. There was great thronging in the ſtreets of <hi>Jericho</hi> to ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi>; the doors, the windows the bulks were all full: Here are many beholders, few diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. If gazing, if profeſſion were godlineſs, <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not want clients: now amongſt all theſe wonderers there is but one <hi>Zacchaeus.</hi> In vain ſhould we boaſt of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs to ſee and hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our ſtreets, if we receive him not into our hearts.</p>
            <p>This croud hides <hi>Chriſt</hi> from <hi>Zacchaeus.</hi> Alas! how com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a thing is it, by the interpoſition of the throng of the world to be kept from the ſight of our <hi>Jeſus</hi>? Here, a carnal Faſhioniſt ſays, Away with this auſtere ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs, let me doe as the moſt. The throng keeps this man from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> There, a ſuperſtitious Miſ-believer ſays, What tell you me of an handfull of reformed. The whole world is ours. This man is kept from <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the throng. The covetous Mammoniſt ſays, Let them that have leiſure be devout, my imployments are many, my affairs great. This man cannot ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the throng. There is no perfect view of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but in an holy ſeceſſion. The Spouſe found not her Beloved till ſhe was paſt the company, then ſhe found him whom her ſoul loved. Whoſo never ſeeks <hi>Chriſt</hi> but in the croud, ſhall never find comfort in finding him: the benefit of our publick view muſt be enjoyed in retiredneſs. If in a preſs we ſee a man's face, that is all; when we have him alone, every lim may be viewed. O Saviour, I would be loth not to ſee thee in thine Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but I would be more loth not to ſee thee in my Cloſet. Yet had <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> been but of the common pitch, he might perhaps have ſeen <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s face over his fellows ſhoulders: now, his ſtature adds to the diſadvantage; his body did not anſwer to his mind; his deſires were high,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47750:88"/>
whilſt his body was low. The beſt is, however ſmalneſs of ſtature was diſadvantageous in a level, yet it is not ſo at height. A little man, if his eye be clear, may look as high (though not as far) as the talleſt. The leaſt Pigmy may from the loweſt valley ſee the Sun or Stars as fully as a Giant upon the higheſt mountain. O Saviour, thou art now in Heaven, the ſmalneſs of our perſon or of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot lett us from beholding thee. The Soul hath no ſtature, neither is Heaven to be had with reaching: Onely clear thou the eyes of my Faith, and I am high enough.</p>
            <p>I regard not the Body, the Soul is the man: It is to ſmall purpoſe that the Body is a Giant, if the Soul be a Dwarf. We have to doe with a God that meaſures us by our deſires, and not by our ſtatures. All the ſtreets of <hi>Jericho</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſeemed to the eye) had not ſo tall a man as <hi>Zacchaeus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The witty Publican eaſily finds both his hinderances, and the ways of their redreſs. His remedy for the preſs, is to run before the multitude; his remedy for his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to climb up into the Sycomore: he imploys his feet in the one, his hands and feet in the other. In vain ſhall he hope to ſee <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that doth not out-goe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon throng of the world. The multitude is cluſtred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and moves too cloſe to move faſt: we muſt be nimbler then they, if ever we deſire or expect to ſee <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is the charge of God, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to doe evil:</hi> we doe evil if we lag in good. It is held com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly both wit and ſtate for a man to keep his pace: and that man eſcapes not cenſure, who would be forwarder then his fellows. Indeed for a man to run alone in ways of indifferency, or to ſet an hypocritical face of out-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all others in a zealous profeſſion, when the heart lingers behind, both theſe are juſtly hatefull: but in an holy emulation to ſtrive truly and really to out-ſtrip others in degrees of Grace, and a conſcionable care of obedience,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47750:89"/>
this is truly Chriſtian, and worthy of him that would hope to be bleſſed with the ſight of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Tell me, ye faſhionable Chriſtians, that ſtand upon terms of equality, and will not go a foot before your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours in holy zeal and aidfull charity, in conſcionable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; tell me, who hath made other mens progreſs a meaſure for yours? Which of you ſays, I will be no richer, no greater, no fairer, no wiſer, no happier then my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? Why ſhould you then ſay, I will be no holier? Our life is but a Race; every good End that a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to himſelf is a ſeveral Goal. Did ever any man that ran for a prize ſay, I will keep up with the reſt? Doth he not know that if he be not foremoſt, he loſeth? We had as good to have ſate ſtill, as not <hi>ſo</hi> to <hi>run that</hi> we <hi>may obtain.</hi> We obtain not, if we out-run not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>So far did <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> over-run the ſtream of the people, that he might have ſpace to climb the Sycomore ere <hi>Jeſus</hi> could paſs by. I examine not the kind, the nature, the quality of this Plant: what Tree ſoever it had been, <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> would have tried to ſcale it, for the advantage of this proſpect. He hath found out this help for his ſtature, and takes pains to uſe it. It is the beſt improvement of our wit, to ſeek out the apteſt furtherances for our Souls. Do you ſee a weak and ſtudious Chriſtian, that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to inform himſelf in the matters of God, goes to the cabinet of Heaven, <hi>the Prieſts lips,</hi> which <hi>ſhall preſerve knowledge?</hi> there is <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> in the Sycomore. It is the trueſt wiſedom that helps forward our Salvation. How witty we are to ſupply all the deficiencies of Nature? If we be low, we can adde cubits to our ſtature; if ill-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured, we can borrow complexion; if hairleſs, perukes; if dim-ſighted, glaſſes; if lame, crutches: and ſhall we be conſcious of our ſpiritual wants, and be wilfully regardleſs of the remedy? Surely, had <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> ſtood ſtill on the ground, he had never ſeen <hi>Chriſt</hi>; had he not climbed the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47750:89"/>
Sycomore, he had never climbed into Heaven. O Saviour, I have not height enough of my own to ſee thee: give me what Sycomore thou wilt; give me grace to uſe it, give me an happy uſe of that grace.</p>
            <p>The more I look at the mercy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the more cauſe I ſee of aſtoniſhment. <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> climbes up into the Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to ſee <hi>Jeſus: Jeſus</hi> firſt ſees him, preventing his eyes with a former view. Little did <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> look that <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have caſt up his eyes to him. Well might he think the boys in the ſtreet would ſpy him out, and ſhout at his ſtature, trade, ambition: but that <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſhould throw up his eyes into the Sycomore, and take notice of that ſmall deſpiſed morſell of fleſh, ere <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> could find ſpace to diſtinguiſh His face from the reſt, was utterly beyond his thought or expectation. All his hope is to ſee; and now he is ſeen. To be ſeen and acknowledged is much more then to ſee. Upon any ſolemn occaſion many thouſands ſee the Prince, whom he ſees not; and if he pleaſe to ſingle out any one, whether by his eye or by his tongue, amongſt the preſs, it paſſes for an high favour. <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> would have thought it too much boldneſs to have asked what was given him. As <hi>Jonathan</hi> did to <hi>David,</hi> ſo doeth God to us, he ſhoots beyond us. Did he not prevent us with mercy, we might climbe into the Sycomore in vain. If he give Grace to him that doeth his beſt, it is the praiſe of the giver, not the earning of the receiver. How can we doe or will without him? If he ſees us firſt, we live; and if we deſire to ſee him, we ſhall be ſeen of him. Who ever took pains to climbe the Sycomore, and came down diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed? O Lord, what was there in <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> that thou ſhouldſt look up at him? a Publican, a Sinner, an Arch-extortioner; a Dwarf in ſtature, but a Giant in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; a little man, but a great Sycophant; if rich in coin, more rich in ſins and treaſures of wrath. Yet it is enough that he deſires to ſee thee: all theſe diſadvantages cannot hide him from thee. Be we never ſo ſinfull, if our
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:47750:90"/>
deſires towards thee be hearty and fervent, all the broad leaves of the Sycomore cannot keep off thine eye from us. If we look at thee with the eye of Faith, thou wilt look at us with the eye of mercy. <hi>The eye of the Lord is upon the juſt</hi>; and he is juſt that would be ſo; if not in himſelf, yet in thee. O Saviour, when <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> was above, and thou wert below, thou didſt look up at him: now thou art above, and we below, thou lookeſt down upon us: thy mercy turns thine eyes every way towards our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. Look down upon us, that are not worthy to look up unto thee; and find us out, that we may ſeek thee.</p>
            <p>It was much to note <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> it was more to name him. Methinks I ſee how <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> ſtartled at this, to hear the ſound of his own name from the mouth of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> neither can he but think, Doth <hi>Jeſus</hi> know me? Is it his voice, or ſome other's in the throng? Lo, this is the firſt blink that ever I had of him. I have heard the fame of his wonderfull works, and held it happineſs enough for me to have ſeen his face; and doth he take notice of my perſon, of my name? Surely the more that <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> knew himſelf, the more doth he wonder that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould know him. It was ſlander enough for a man to be a friend to a Publican; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives this friendly compellation to the chief of Publicans, and honours him with this argument of a ſudden intireneſs. The favour is great, but not ſingular: Every elect of God is thus graced. The Father knows the child's name: as he calls the ſtars of heaven by their names, ſo doth he his Saints, the ſtars on earth; and it is his own rule to his <hi>Iſrael, I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</hi> As God's children do not content themſelves with a confuſed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, but aſpire to a particular appprehenſion and ſenſible application; ſo doeth God again to them: it is not enough that he knows them as in the croud, wherein we ſee many perſons, none diſtinctly; but he takes ſingle and ſeverall knowledge of their qualities, conditions, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47750:90"/>
events. What care we that our names are obſcure or contemned amongſt men, whilſt they are regarded by God? that they are raked up in the duſt of Earth, whilſt they are recorded in Heaven?</p>
            <p>Had our Saviour ſaid no more but, <hi>Zacchaeus, come down,</hi> the poor man would have thought himſelf taxed for his boldneſs and curioſity: it were better to be unknown, then noted for miſcarriage. But now the next words comfort him; <hi>For I muſt this day abide at thine houſe.</hi> What a ſweet familiarity was here? as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been many years acquainted with <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> whom he now firſt ſaw. Beſides our uſe, the Hoſt is invited by the Gueſt, and called to an unexpected entertainment. Well did our Saviour hear <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> his heart inviting him, though his mouth did not. Deſires are the language of the Soul; thoſe are heard by him that is the God of ſpirits.</p>
            <p>We dare not doe thus to each other, ſave where we have eaten much ſalt; we ſcarce go where we are invited: though the face be friendly, and the entertainment great, yet the heart may be hollow. But here, he that ſaw the heart, and foreknew his welcome, can boldly ſay, <hi>I muſt this day abide at thine houſe.</hi> What a pleaſant kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire familiarity there is betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and a good heart? <hi>If any man open, I will come in, and ſup with him.</hi> It is much for the King of Glory to come into a cottage, and ſup there: yet thus he may doe, and take ſome ſtate upon him in ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alone. No, <hi>I will</hi> ſo <hi>ſup with him,</hi> that <hi>he ſhall ſup with me.</hi> Earthly ſtate conſiſts in ſtrangeneſs, and affects a ſtern kind of majeſty aloof. Betwixt God and us, though there be infinite more diſtance, yet there is a gracious affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and familiar intireneſs of converſation. O Saviour, what doeſt thou elſe every day but invite thy ſelf to us in thy Word, in thy Sacraments? who are we that we ſhould entertain thee, or thou us, dwarfs in grace, great in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but unworthineſs? Thy praiſe is worthy to be ſo much the more, as our worth is leſs. Thou that biddeſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47750:91"/>
thy ſelf to us, bid us be fit to receive thee, and in receiving thee, happy.</p>
            <p>How graciouſly doth <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtill prevent the Publican, as in his ſight, notice, compellation, ſo in his invitation too? That other Publican, <hi>Levi,</hi> bade <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his houſe, but it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Chriſt</hi> had bidden him to his Diſcipleſhip: <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never been called to his feaſt, if <hi>Levi</hi> had not been called into his family. He loved us firſt, he muſt firſt call us; for he calls us out of love. As in the generall calling of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, if he did not ſay, <hi>Seek ye my face,</hi> we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſay, <hi>Thy face, Lord, will I ſeek:</hi> ſo in the ſpecialties of our main benefits or imployments, <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt begin to us. If we invite our ſelves to him before he invite himſelf to us, the undertaking is preſumptuous, the ſucceſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Nathanael,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> named him, and gave him the memorial-token of his being under the fig-tree, could ſay, <hi>Thou art the Son of God</hi>; how could <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> doe leſs in hearing himſelf upon this wild fig-tree named by the ſame lips? How muſt he needs think, If he knew not all things, he could not know me; and if he knew not the hearts of men, he could not have known my ſecret deſires to entertain him: He is a God that knows me, and a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull God that invites himſelf to me? No marvel therefore, if upon this thought <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> come down in haſte. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid not, Take thy leiſure, <hi>Zacchaeus</hi>; but, <hi>I will abide at thine houſe to day.</hi> Neither did <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation ſit ſtill and ſay, When the preſs is over, when I have done ſome errands of my office; but he haſts down to receive <hi>Jeſus.</hi> The notice of ſuch a Gueſt would have quickned his ſpeed without a command. God loves not ſlack and lazy executions. The Angels of God are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed with wings: and we pray to doe his will with their forwardneſs. Yea even to <hi>Judas Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>What thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> O Saviour, there is no day wherein thou doſt not call us by the voice of thy Goſpel: what doe we
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47750:91"/>
ſtill lingering in the Sycomore? How unkindly muſt thou needs take the delays of our Converſion? Certainly, had <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> ſtaid ſtill in the Tree, thou hadſt balked his houſe as unworthy of thee. What conſtruction canſt thou make of our wilfull dilations, but as a ſtubborn contempt? How canſt thou but come to us in vengeance, if we come not down to entertain thee in a thankfull obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience?</p>
            <p>Yet do I not hear thee ſay, <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> caſt thy ſelf down for haſte; this was the counſell of the Tempter to thee; but, <hi>Come down in haſte.</hi> And he did accordingly. There muſt be no more haſte then good ſpeed in our perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances: we may offend as well in our heady acceleration, as in our delay. <hi>Moſes</hi> ran ſo faſt down the hill that he ſtumbled ſpiritually, and brake the Tables of God. We may ſo faſt follow after Juſtice, that we out-run Charity. It is an unſafe obedience that is not diſcreetly and leiſurely ſpeedfull.</p>
            <p>The ſpeed of his deſcent was not more then the ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity of his entertainment. <hi>He made haſte, and came down, and received him joyfully.</hi> The life of hoſpitality is chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Let our chear be never ſo great, if we do not reade our welcome in our friend's face as well as in his diſhes, we take no pleaſure in it.</p>
            <p>Can we marvell that <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> received <hi>Chriſt</hi> joyfully? Who would not have been glad to have his houſe, yea him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made happy with ſuch a Gueſt? Had we been in the ſtead of this Publican, how would our hearts have leapt within us for joy of ſuch a preſence? How many thouſand miles are meaſured by ſome devout Chriſtians, onely to ſee the place where his feet ſtood? How much happier muſt he needs think himſelf that owns the roof that receives him? But O the incomparable happineſs then of that man whoſe heart receives him, not for a day, not for years of days, not for millions of years, but for eternity! This may be our condition, if we be not ſtreightned in our own bowels.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47750:92"/>
O Saviour, do thou welcome thy ſelf to theſe houſes of clay, that we may receive a joyfull welcome to thee in thoſe everlaſting habitations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> was not more glad of <hi>Chriſt</hi> then the <hi>Jews</hi> were diſcontented. Four vices met here at once, Envy, Scrupulouſneſs, Ignorance, Pride. Their eye was evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s was good. I do not hear any of them invite <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his home; yet they ſnarl at the honour of this unworthy Hoſt: they thought it too much happineſs for a Sinner, which themſelves willingly neglected to ſue for. Wretched men! they cannot ſee the Mercy of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for being bleared with the Happineſs of <hi>Zacchaeus:</hi> yea, that very Mercy which they ſee, torments them. If that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be the deadlieſt which feeds the ſweeteſt, how poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous muſt this diſpoſition needs be that feeds upon Grace?</p>
            <p>What a contrariety there is betwixt good Angels and evil Men? The Angels rejoyce at that whereat men pout and ſtomach: Men are ready to cry and burſt for anger at that which makes muſick in Heaven. O wicked and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh elder brother, that feeds on hunger and his own heart without doors, becauſe his younger brother is feaſting on the fat calf within!</p>
            <p>Beſides Envy they ſtand ſcrupulouſly upon the terms of Traditions. Theſe ſons of the earth might not be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with; their threſhold was unclean; <hi>Touch me not, for I am holier then thou.</hi> That he therefore, who went for a Prophet, ſhould go to the houſe of a Publican and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, muſt needs be a great eye-ſore. They that might not go in to a Sinner, cared not what ſins entred into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: the true couſins of thoſe Hypocrites, who held it a pollution to go into the Judgment-hall, no pollution to murther the Lord of life. There cannot be a greater argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a falſe heart, then to ſtumble at theſe ſtraws, and to leap over the blocks of groſs impiety. Well did our Saviour know how hainouſly offenſive it would be to turn
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47750:92"/>
in to this Publican: he knows, and regards it not. A Soul is to be wone, what cares he for idle miſconſtruction? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good actions muſt not be ſuſpended upon danger of cauſeleſs ſcandal. In things indifferent and arbitrary, it is fit to be over-ruled by fear of offence: but if men will ſtumble in the plain ground of good, let them fall without our regard, not without their own perill. I know not if it were not <hi>David</hi>'s weakneſs to <hi>abſtain from good words, whilſt the wicked were in place.</hi> Let Juſtice be done in ſpite of the world; and in ſpite of Hell, Mercy.</p>
            <p>Ignorance was in part guilty of theſe ſcruples: they thought <hi>Chriſt</hi> either too holy to go to a Sinner, or in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made unholy. Fooliſh men! to whom came he? to you righteous? Let himſelf ſpeak: <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> Whither ſhould the Phyſician go but to the ſick? <hi>the whole need</hi> him <hi>not.</hi> Love is the beſt attractive of us; and <hi>he to whom much is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, loves much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Saviour, the glittering palaces of proud Juſticiaries are not for thee; thou loveſt the lowly and ragged cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a contrite heart. Neither could here be any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of thy pollution. Thy Sun could caſt his beams upon the impureſt dunghill, and not be tainted. It was free and ſafe for the Leper and Bloudy-fluxed to touch thee; thou couldſt heal them, they could not infect thee. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it otherwiſe in this moral contagion. We who are obnoxious to evil, may be inſenſibly defiled: thy Purity was enough to remedy that which might marre a world. Thou canſt help us; we cannot hurt thee. O let thy preſence ever bleſs us; and let us ever bleſs thee for thy preſence.</p>
            <p>Pride was an attendent of this Ignorance: ſo did they note <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> for a Sinner, as if themſelves had been none. His ſins were written in his forehead, theirs in their breaſt. The preſumption of their ſecrecy makes them inſult upon his notoriouſneſs. The ſmoke of pride flies ſtill upward,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:47750:93"/>
and in the mounting vaniſheth; Contrition beats it down, and fetcheth tears from the tender eyes. There are ſtage-ſins, and there are cloſet ſins. Theſe may not upbraid the other: they may be more hainous, though leſs manifeſt. It is a dangerous vanity to look outward at other mens ſins with ſcorn, when we have more need to caſt our eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſee our own with humiliation.</p>
            <p>Thus they ſtumbled and fell; but <hi>Zacchaeus ſtood.</hi> All their malicious murmur could not diſhearten his Piety and joy in the entertaining of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Before <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> lay down as a Sinner, now he ſtands up as a Convert: ſinning is falling, continuance in ſin is lying down, Repentance is riſing and ſtanding up. Yet perhaps this ſtanding was not ſo much the ſite of his conſtancy or of his Converſion, as of his reverence. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s affability hath not made him unmannerly: <hi>Zacchaeus ſtood.</hi> And what if the deſire of more audibleneſs raiſed him to his feet? In that ſmalneſs of ſtature it was not fit he ſhould loſe ought of his height. It was meet ſo noble a proclamation ſhould want no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of hearing. Never was our Saviour better wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed. The penitent Publican makes his Will, and makes <hi>Chriſt</hi> his ſuperviſor. His Will conſiſts of Legacies given, of Debts paid: gifts to the poor, payments to the injured. There is Liberality in the former, in the latter Juſtice; in both the proportions are large: <hi>Half to the poor; fourfold to the wronged.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This hand ſowed not ſparingly. Here muſt needs be much of his own that was well gotten, whether left by patrimony, or ſaved by parſimony, or gained by honeſt improvement. For when he had reſtored fourfold to every one whom he had oppreſſed, yet there remained a whole half for pious uſes: and this he ſo diſtributes, that every word commends his bounty. <hi>I give</hi>; and what is more free then gift? In Alms we may neither ſell, nor return, nor caſt away. We ſell, if we part with them for importunity, for vain-glory, for retribution: we return them, if we
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:47750:93"/>
give with reſpect to former offices; this is to pay, not to beſtow: we caſt away, if in our beneficence we neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard order nor diſcretion. <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> did neither caſt away, nor return, nor ſell, but give. <hi>I do give</hi>; not, I will. The prorogation of good makes it thankleſs. The alms that ſmell of the hand loſe the praiſe. It is twice given that is given quickly. Thoſe that defer their gifts till their death-bed doe as good as ſay, Lord, I will give thee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when I can keep it no longer. Happy is the man that is his own executor. <hi>I give my goods</hi>; not another's. It is a thankleſs vanity to be liberal of another man's purſe. Whoſo gives of that which he hath taken away from the owner, doeth more wrong in giving then in ſtealing. God expects our gifts, not our ſpoils. I fear there is too many a School and Hoſpital, every ſtone whereof may be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged. Had <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> meant to give of his extortions, he had not been ſo carefull of his reſtitution: now he reſtores to others, that he may give of his own; <hi>I give half my goods.</hi> The Publican's heart was as large as his eſtate; he was not more rich in goods then in bounty. Were this example binding, who ſhould be rich to give? who ſhould be poor to receive? In the ſtreight beginnings of the Church thoſe beneficences were requiſite, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the larger elbow-room thereof would have cauſed much confuſion. If the firſt Chriſtians laid down all at the Apoſtles feet, yet ere long it was enough for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Corinthians,</hi> every firſt day of the week to lay aſide ſome pittance for charitable purpoſes. We are no Diſciples, if we do not imitate <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> ſo far as to give liberally, according to the proportion of our eſtate.</p>
            <p>Giving is ſowing: the larger ſeeding, the greater crop. Giving to the poor is foeneration to God: the greater bank, the more intereſt. Who can fear to be too weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy? Time was when men faulted in exceſs: Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were fain to reſtrain the <hi>Jews</hi>; Statutes were fain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain our Anceſtours. Now there needs none of this: Men
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47750:94"/>
know how to ſhut their hands alone. Charity is in more danger of freezing then of burning. How happy were it for the Church, if men were onely cloſe-handed to hold, and not lime-fingered to take.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the poor</hi>; not to rich heirs. God gives to him that hath; we to him that wants. Some want becauſe they would, whether out of prodigality or idleneſs; ſome want becauſe they muſt: theſe are the fit Subjects of our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, not thoſe other. A poverty of our own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king deſerves no pity. He that ſuſtains the lewd, feeds not his belly, but his vice. So then this living Legacy of <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> is free, <hi>I give</hi>; preſent, <hi>I do give</hi>; juſt, <hi>my goods</hi>; large, <hi>half my goods</hi>; fit, <hi>to the poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is he more bountifull in his gift, then juſt in his reſtitution: <hi>If I have taken ought from any man by falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, I reſtore it four-fold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was proper for a Publican to pill and pole the ſubject, by deviſing complaints, and raiſing cauſeleſs vexations, that his mouth might be ſtopt with fees, either for ſilence or compoſition. This had <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> often done. Neither is this [<hi>If</hi>] a note of doubt, but of aſſertion. He is ſure of the fact, he is not ſure of the perſons: their challenge muſt help to further his juſtice. The true penitence of this holy Convert expreſſes it ſelf in Confeſſion, in Satisfaction. His Confeſſion is free, full, open. What cares he to ſhame himſelf, that he may give glory to God? Woe be to that baſhfulneſs that ends in confuſion of face. O God, let me bluſh before men, rather then be confounded before Thee, thy Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>His Satisfaction is no leſs liberal then his gift. Had not <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> been carefull to pay the debts of his fraud, all had gone to the poor. He would have done that volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, which the Young man in the Goſpel was bidden to doe, and refuſing went away ſorrowfull. Now he knew that his miſgotten gain was not for God's Corban; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpares half, not to keep, but to reſtore. This was
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47750:94"/>
the beſt diſh in <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> his good chear. In vain had he feaſted <hi>Chriſt,</hi> given to the poor, confeſſed his extortions, if he had not made reſtitution. Woe is me for the paucity of true Converts. There is much ſtoln goods; little brought home. Mens hands are like the fiſher's Flue, yea like Hell it ſelf, which admits of no return. O God, we can never ſatisfie thee; our ſcore is too great, our abilities too little: but if we make not even with men, in vain ſhall we look for mercy from thee. To each his own had been well; but four for one was munificent. In our tranſactions of commerce, we doe well to beat the bargain to the loweſt; but in caſes of moral or ſpiritual payments to God or men, now there muſt be a meaſure, preſſed, ſhaken, running over. In good offices and due retributions we may not be pinching and niggardly. It argues an earthly and ignoble mind, where we have apparently wronged, to higgle and dodge in the amends.</p>
            <p>O mercy and juſtice well repaid! <hi>This day is ſalvation come to thine houſe.</hi> Lo, <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> that which thou giveſt to the poor, is nothing to that which thy Saviour gives to thee. If thou reſtoreſt four for one, here is more then thouſands of millions for nothing: were every of thy pence a world, they could hold no compariſon with this bounty. It is but droſs that thou giveſt, it is Salvation that thou receiveſt. Thou gaveſt in preſent, thou doſt not receive in hope; but, <hi>This day is Salvation come to thine houſe.</hi> Thine ill-gotten metalls were a ſtrong bar to bolt Heaven-gates againſt thee: now that they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by a ſeaſonable beneficence and reſtitution, thoſe gates of glory fly open to thy Soul. Where is that man that can challenge God to be in his debt? Who can ever ſay, Lord, this favour I did to the leaſt of thine unrequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Thrice happy Publican, that haſt climbed from thy Sycomore to Heaven; and by a few worthleſs bags of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Mammon, haſt purchaſed to thy ſelf <hi>a Kingdom uncorruptible, undefi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <head>XXI. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> beheaded.</head>
            <p>THree of the Evangeliſts have (with one pen) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded the death of the great Harbinger of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as moſt remarkable and uſefull. He was the Fore-runner of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as into the world, ſo out of it: yea, he that made way for <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the world, made way for the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the Court of <hi>Herod.</hi> This <hi>Herod Antipas</hi> was ſon to that <hi>Herod</hi> who was, and is ever infamous for the maſſacre at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> Cruelty runs in a bloud. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of <hi>John,</hi> the fore-runner of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is well deſcended of him who would have murthered <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and, for his ſake, murthered the Infants. It was late ere this <hi>Herod</hi> heard the fame of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; not till he had taken off the head of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> The father of this <hi>Herod</hi> inquired for <hi>Chriſt</hi> too ſoon; this too late. Great men ſhould have the beſt intelligence. If they improve it to all other uſes of either frivolous or civil affairs, with neglect of ſpiritual, their judgment ſhall be ſo much more as their helps and means were greater. Whether this <hi>Herod</hi> were taken up with his <hi>Arabian</hi> wars againſt <hi>Arethas</hi> his father in law, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were imployed in his journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> I inquire not: but if he were at home, I muſt wonder how he could be ſo long without the noiſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Certainly, it was a ſign he had a very irreligious Court, that none of his Followers did ſo much as report to him the Miracles of our Saviour; who doubtleſs told him many a vain tale the while. One tells him of his brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; another relates the news of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court; another, the angry threats of <hi>Arethas</hi>; another flatters him with the admiration of his new Miſtreſs, and diſparagement
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47750:95"/>
of the old: no man ſo much as ſays, Sir, there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in your Kingdom that doeth wonders. There was not a man in his countrey that had not been aſtoniſhed with the ſame of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; yea all <hi>Syria</hi> and the adjoyning regions rung of it: onely <hi>Herod</hi>'s Court hears nothing. Miſerable is that Greatneſs which keeps men from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> How plain is it from hence, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour kept aloof from the Court? The auſtere and eremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Harbinger of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it ſeems, preacht there oft, and was heard gladly; though, at laſt, to his coſt: whilſt our Saviour, who was more ſociable, came not there. He ſent a meſſage to that Fox, whoſe den he would not approach. Whether it were that he purpoſely forbore, leſt he ſhould give that Tyrant occaſion to revive and purſue his father's ſuſpicion; or whether for that he would not ſo much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a place ſo infamouſly graceleſs and diſorder'd; or whether by his example to teach us the avoidance of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pomp and glory. Surely <hi>Herod</hi> ſaw him not till his death; heard not of him till the death of <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> And now his un-intelligence was not more ſtrange then his miſconſtruction; <hi>This is John Baptiſt, whom I beheaded.</hi> Firſt, he doubted, then he reſolved: he doubted upon others ſuggeſtions; upon his own apprehenſions he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved thus. And though he thought good to ſet a face on it to ſtrangers, unto whom it was not ſafe to bewray his fear; yet to his domeſticks he freely diſcovered his thoughts; <hi>This is John Baptiſt.</hi> The troubled Conſcience will many a time open that to familiars, which it hides from the eyes of others. Shame and fear meet together in guiltineſs. How could he imagine this to be <hi>John?</hi> That common conceit of Tranſanimation could have no place here; there could be no tranſmigration of Souls into a grown and well-ſtatur'd body. That received fancy of the <hi>Jews</hi> held onely in the caſe of conception and birth, not of full age. What need we ſcan this point, when <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf profeſſes, <hi>He is riſen from the dead?</hi> He that was a
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47750:96"/>
               <hi>Jew</hi> by profeſſion, and knew the ſtory of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s bones, of the <hi>Sareptan</hi>'s and <hi>Shunamite</hi>'s ſons, and in all likelihood had now heard of our Saviour's miraculous reſuſcitation of others, might think this power reflected upon himſelf. Even <hi>Herod,</hi> as bad as he was, believed a Reſurrection. Lewdneſs of life and practice may ſtand with orthodoxy in ſome main points of Religion. Who can doubt of this, when <hi>the Devils believe and tremble?</hi> Where ſhall thoſe men appear, whoſe faces are Chriſtian, but their hearts Sadducees?</p>
            <p>Oh the terrours and tortures of a guilty heart! <hi>Herod</hi>'s Conſcience told him he had offered an unjuſt and cruel violence to an innocent; and now he thinks that <hi>John</hi>'s ghoſt haunts him. Had it not been for this guilt of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, why might he not as well have thought that the ſame God, whoſe hand is not ſhortned, had conferred this power of Miracles upon ſome other? Now, it could be no body but <hi>John</hi> that doeth theſe wonders: and how can it be (thinks he) but that this revived Prophet, who doeth theſe ſtrange things, will be revenged on me for his head? He that could give himſelf life, can more eaſily take mine: how can I eſcape the hands of a now-immortal and impaſſible avenger?</p>
            <p>A wicked man needs no other tormentour (eſpecially for the ſins of bloud) then his own heart. Revell, O <hi>Herod,</hi> and feaſt, and frolick; and pleaſe thy ſelf with dances, and triumphs, and paſtimes: thy ſin ſhall be as ſome Fury that ſhall inviſibly follow thee, and ſcourge thy guilty heart with ſecret laſhes, and upon all occaſions ſhall begin thine Hell within thee. He wanted not other ſins, that yet cried, <hi>Deliver me from bloud-guiltineſs, O God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an honour was done to <hi>John</hi> in this miſpriſion? While that man lived, the world was apt to think that <hi>John</hi> was the <hi>Chriſt:</hi> now that <hi>John</hi> is dead, <hi>Herod</hi> thinks <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>John.</hi> God gives to his poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable ſervants a kind of reverence and high reſpect,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47750:96"/>
even from thoſe men that malign them moſt; ſo as they cannot but venerate whom they hate. Contrarily, no wit or power can ſhield a leud man from contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> did no Miracle in his life, yet now <hi>Herod</hi> thinks he did miracles in his Reſurrection; as ſuppoſing that a new ſupernatural life brought with it a ſupernatural power. Who can but wonder at the ſtupid partiality of <hi>Herod</hi> and theſe <hi>Jews?</hi> They can imagine and yield <hi>John</hi> riſen from the dead, that never did miracle, and aroſe not; whereas <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who did infinite miracles, and aroſe from the dead by his almighty power, is not yielded by them to have riſen. Their over-bountifull miſconceit of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, is not ſo injurious as their niggardly infidelity to the Maſter. Both of them ſhall convince and confound them before the face of God. But, O yet more blockiſh <hi>Herod</hi>! Thy Conſcience affrights thee with <hi>John</hi>'s reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and flies in thy face for the cruel murther of ſo great a Saint; yet where is thy repentance for ſo foul a fact? Who would not have expected that thou ſhouldſt hereupon have humbled thy ſelf for thy ſin, and have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to make thy peace with God and him? The greater the fame and power was of him whom thou ſuppoſedſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from thy ſlaughter, the more ſhould have been thy penitence. Impiety is wont to beſot men, and turn them ſenſeleſs of their own ſafety and welfare. One would have thought that our firſt Grand-ſire <hi>Adam,</hi> when he found his heart to ſtrike him for his diſobedience, ſhould have run to meet God upon his knees, and have ſued for pardon of his offence: In ſtead of that, he runs to hide his head among the buſhes. The caſe is ſtill ours; we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit both his ſin and his ſenſeleſneſs. Beſides the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſpleaſure of God, wickedneſs makes the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Grace, and impregnable to the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</p>
            <p>Even the very firſt act of <hi>Herod</hi>'s cruelty was hainous. He was foul enough with other ſins; <hi>he added this above
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47750:97"/>
all, that he ſhut up John in priſon.</hi> The violence offered to God's meſſengers is branded for notorious. The Sanctity and auſtere carriage of the man wone him honour juſtly from the multitude, and aggravated the ſin: but whatever his perſon had been, his miſſion was ſacred, (<hi>He ſhall ſend his meſſenger</hi>;) the wrong redounds to the God that ſent him. It is the charge of God, <hi>Touch not mine anointed, nor doe my Prophets any harm.</hi> The precept is perhaps one, for even Prophets were anointed; but at leaſt next to viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Majeſty, is the wrong to a Prophet. But what? do I not hear the Evangeliſt ſay that <hi>Herod heard John glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?</hi> How is it then? Did <hi>John</hi> take the ear and heart of <hi>Herod,</hi> and doth <hi>Herod</hi> bind the hands and feet of <hi>John?</hi> Doth he wilfully impriſon whom he gladly heard? How inconſtant is a carnall heart to good reſolutions? How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle truſt is to be given to the good motions of unregenerate perſons? We have known when even mad dogs have faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon their maſter, yet he hath been too wiſe to truſt them but in chains. As a true friend loves always, ſo a gracious heart always affects good: neither can be altered with change of occurrences. But the carnal man, like an hollow Paraſite or a fawning Spaniel, flatters onely for his own turn; if that be once either ſerved or croſſed, like a churliſh curre, he is ready to ſnatch us by the fingers. Is there a worldly-minded man that lives in ſome known ſin, yet makes much of the Preacher, frequents the Church, talks godly, looks demurely, carries fair? truſt him not; he will prove, after his pious fits, like ſome reſty horſe, which goes on ſome paces readily and eagerly, but anon either ſtands ſtill, or falls to flinging and plunging, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves till he have caſt his rider.</p>
            <p>What then might be the cauſe of <hi>John</hi>'s bonds, and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s diſpleaſure? <hi>For Herodias ſake his brother Philip's wife.</hi> That woman was the ſubject of <hi>Herod</hi>'s luſt, and the exciter of his revenge. This light huſwife ran away with her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's brother; and now doting upon her inceſtuous lover,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47750:97"/>
and finding <hi>John</hi> to be a rub in the way of her licentious adultery, is impatient of his liberty, and will not reſt till his reſtraint. Reſolved ſinners are mad upon their leud courſes, and run furiouſly upon their gainſayers. A Bear robbed of her whelps is leſs impetuous. Indeed, thoſe that have determined to love their ſins more then their Souls, whom can they care for? Though <hi>Herod</hi> was wicked enough, yet had it not been upon <hi>Herodias</hi>'s inſtigation, he had never impriſoned <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Importunity of leud ſolicitours may be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and many times draws Greatneſs into thoſe ways which it either would not have thought of, or abhorred. In the remotion of the wicked is the eſtabliſhment of the throne.</p>
            <p>Yet ſtill is this Dame called the wife of <hi>Philip.</hi> She had utterly left his bed, and was ſolemnly coupled to <hi>Herod</hi>; but all the ritual Ceremonies of her new Nuptials cannot make her other then <hi>Philip</hi>'s wife. It is a ſure rule, That which is originally faulty can never be rectified. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Marriage is one for one; <hi>They twain ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> There cannot be two heads to one body, nor two bodies to one head. <hi>Herod</hi> was her Adulterer, he was not her Huſband; ſhe was <hi>Herod</hi>'s Harlot, <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wife. Yet how doth <hi>Herod</hi> dote on her, that for her ſake he loads <hi>John</hi> with irons? Whether will not the fury of inordinate Luſt tranſport a man? Certainly <hi>John</hi> was of late in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s favour. That rough-hewn Preacher was for a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not for a Court: <hi>Herod</hi>'s invitation drew him thither, his reverence and reſpects incouraged him there. Now the love of his Luſt hath carried him into an hate of God's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger. That man can have no hold of himſelf or care of others, who hath given the reins to his unruly Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence. He that hath once fixed his heart upon the face of an Harlot, and hath beſlaved himſelf to a bewitching Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, caſts off at once all fear of God, reſpect to Laws, ſhame of the world, regard of his eſtate, care of wife, children,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:47750:98"/>
friends, reputation, patrimony, body, Soul. So violent is this beaſtly paſſion where it takes; neither ever leaves till it hath hurried him into the chambers of death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herodias</hi> her ſelf had firſt plotted to kill the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>; her murtherers were ſuborned, her ambuſhes laid. The ſucceſs failed, and now ſhe works with <hi>Herod</hi> for his durance. O marvellous hand of the Almighty! <hi>John</hi> was a mean man for eſtate, ſolitary, guardleſs, unarmed, impotent: <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> a Queen, ſo great that ſhe ſwayed <hi>Herod</hi> himſelf; and not more great then ſubtle; and not more great or ſubtle then malicious: yet <hi>Herodias</hi> laid to kill <hi>John,</hi> and could not. What an inviſible, and yet ſure, guard there is about the poor ſervants of God, that ſeem helpleſs and deſpicable in themſelves? There is over them an hand of Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, which can be no more oppoſed then ſeen. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is not ſo ſtrong in the hand, as in the heart. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is ſtronger then a world of men, a legion of Devils ſtronger then fewer ſpirits; yet a legion of Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt one Swine without a permiſſion. What can bands of enemies or gates of Hell doe againſt God's ſecret ones? <hi>It is better to truſt in the Lord, then to truſt in Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not more clear who was the Authour, then what was the motive of this impriſonment, the free reproof of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Inceſt; <hi>It is not lawfull,</hi> &amp;c. Both the offenders were net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled with this bold reprehenſion. <hi>Herod</hi> knew the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>John</hi> carried; his Conſcience could not but ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt the foulneſs of his own fact: neither could he but ſee how odious it would ſeem to perſecute a Prophet for ſo juſt a reproof. For the colour therefore of ſo tyrannical an act, he brands <hi>John</hi> with Sedition: theſe preſumptuous taxations are a diſgrace and diſparagement to Authority. It is no news with wicked Tyrants, to cloak their Cruelty with pretences of Juſtice. Never was it other then the lot of God's faithfull ſervants, to be loaded with unjuſt reproaches in the conſcionable performance of their duties. They
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:47750:98"/>
ſhould ſpeed too well in the opinion of men, if they might but appear in their true ſhape.</p>
            <p>The fact of <hi>Herod</hi> was horrible and prodigious; to rob his own Brother of the partner of his bed; to tear away part of his fleſh, yea his body from his head. So as here was at once in one act, Adultery, Inceſt, Violence. Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, that he took another's wife: Inceſt, that he took his Brother's: Violence, that he thus took her, in ſpite of her Huſband. Juſtly therefore might <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>It is not lawfull for thee.</hi> He balked not one of <hi>Herod</hi>'s ſins, but reproved him of <hi>all the evils that he had done</hi>; though more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently of this, as that which more filled the eye of the world. It was not the Crown or awfull Scepter of <hi>Herod</hi> that could daunt the homely, but faithfull, meſſenger of God: as one that came in the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> he fears no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſpares no wickedneſs. There muſt meet in God's miniſters Courage and Impartiality. Impartiality, not to make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of perſons; Courage, not to make ſpare of the ſins of the greateſt. It is an hard condition that the neceſſity of our Calling caſts upon us, in ſome caſes to run upon the pikes of diſpleaſure. Prophecies were no Burthens, if they did not expoſe us to theſe dangers. We muſt connive at no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: Every ſin unreproved becomes ours.</p>
            <p>Hatred is the daughter of Truth. <hi>Herod</hi> is inwardly vexed with ſo peremptory a reprehenſion: and now he ſeeks to kill the authour. And why did he not? <hi>He feared the people.</hi> The time was when he feared <hi>John</hi> no leſs then now he hates him: he once reverenced him as a juſt and holy man, whom now he heart-burns as an enemy; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it any counterfeit reſpect, ſure the man was then in earneſt. What ſhall we ſay then? was it that his inconſtant heart was now fetcht off by <hi>Herodias,</hi> and wrought to a diſaffection? or was it with <hi>Herod</hi> as with <hi>Salomon</hi>'s Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that at once would and would not? His thoughts are diſtracted with a mixt voluntary contradiction of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: as an holy man and honoured of the people, he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:47750:99"/>
would not kill <hi>John</hi>; he would kill him, as an enemy to his Luſt. The worſe part prevaileth; Appetite overſways Reaſon and Conſcience: and now, were it not for fear of the people, <hi>John</hi> ſhould be murthered. What a ſelf-conflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and prodigious creature is a wicked man left over to his own thoughts? whilſt on the one ſide he is urged by his Conſcience, on the other by his luſtfull deſires and by the importunity of Satan. <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked:</hi> and after all his inward broils, he falls upon the worſt; ſo as his yieldance is worſe then his fight. When God ſees fit, <hi>Herod</hi>'s tyranny ſhall effect that which the wiſe Providence of the Almighty hath decreed for his Servant's glory. In the mean while, rubs ſhall be caſt in his way; and this for one, <hi>He feared the people.</hi> What an abſurd and ſottiſh thing is Hypocriſy? <hi>Herod</hi> fears the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he fears not God. Tell me then, <hi>Herod,</hi> what could the people doe at the worſt? Perhaps, mutiny againſt thee, raiſe arms and tumults, diſturb the Government, it may be, ſhake it off.</p>
            <p>What could God doe? yea, what not? ſtir up all his creatures to plague thee, and when he hath done, tumble thee down to Hell, and there torment thee everlaſtingly. O fond <hi>Herod,</hi> that feareſt where no fear was, and feareſt not where there is nothing but terrour!</p>
            <p>How God fits lewd men with reſtraints? If they be ſo godleſs as to regard his creature above himſelf, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall buggs to affright them withall; if baſhfull, he hath ſhame; if covetous, loſſes; if proud, diſgrace: and by this means the moſt wiſe Providence keeps the world in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. We cannot better judge of our hearts, then by what we moſt fear.</p>
            <p>No man is ſo great as to be utterly exempted from fear. The <hi>Jews</hi> feared <hi>Herod; Herod</hi> feared the <hi>Jews:</hi> the healthfull fear ſickneſs; the free, ſervitude: the people fear a Tyrant's oppreſſion and cruelty; the Tyrant fears the people's mutiny and inſurrection. If there have been ſome
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47750:99"/>
ſo great as to be above the reach of the power and machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of inferiours, yet never any that have been free from their fears and ſuſpicions. Happy is he that fears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what he ſhould, God.</p>
            <p>Why did <hi>Herod</hi> fear the people? <hi>They held John for a Prophet.</hi> And this opinion was both common and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant: even the Scribes and Phariſees durſt not ſay, his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was from men. It is the wiſedom and goodneſs of God, ever to give his children favour ſomewhere. If <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel</hi> hate <hi>Elias, Ahab</hi> ſhall for the time honour him: and if <hi>Herod</hi> hate the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and would kill him, yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reverence him. <hi>Herod</hi>'s malice would make him away; the people's reputation keeps him alive. As wiſe Princes have been content to maintain a faction in their Court or State for their own purpoſes; ſo here did the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven contrive and order differences of judgment and affection betwixt <hi>Herod</hi> and his Subjects for his own holy ends. Elſe certainly, if all wicked men ſhould conſpire in evil, there could be no being upon earth; as contrarily, if evil ſpirits did not accord, Hell could not ſtand. Oh the unjuſt and fond partiality of this people! They all generally applaud <hi>John</hi> for a Prophet, yet they receive not his meſſage. Whoſe Prophet was <hi>John,</hi> but of the Higheſt? what was his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand, but to be the way-maker unto <hi>Chriſt?</hi> what was he but the Voice of that Eternal Word of his Father? what was the ſound of that Voice but, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God: He that comes after me is greater then I, whoſe ſhoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloſe?</hi> Yet they honour the Servant, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Maſter: they contemn that Prince whoſe Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour they reverence. How could they but argue, <hi>John</hi> is a Prophet; he ſpeaks from God; his words muſt be true; he tells us this is the Lamb of God, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> that ſhould come to redeem the World: this muſt then needs be he; we will look for no other? Yet this perverſe people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>John,</hi> and rejects <hi>Jeſus.</hi> There is ever an abſurdity in unbelief, whilſt it ſeparates thoſe relations and reſpects
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47750:100"/>
which can never in nature be disjoyned. Thus it readily apprehends God as mercifull in pardoning, not as juſt in puniſhing; <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Saviour, not as a Judge. Thus we ordinarily (in a contrariety to theſe <hi>Jews)</hi> profeſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Maſter, and contemn the Servants: whilſt he hath ſaid that will make it good, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which <hi>Herod</hi> in policy durſt not, in wine he dares doe: And that which God had reſtrained till his own time, now in his own time he permits to be done. The day was, as one of the Evangeliſts ſtyles it, <hi>convenient:</hi> if for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Herodias,</hi> I am ſure for God's; who, having deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to glorify himſelf by <hi>John</hi>'s martyrdome, will caſt it upon a time when it may be moſt notified, <hi>Herod's birth-day.</hi> All the Peers of the Country, perhaps of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations, are now aſſembled. <hi>Herodias</hi> could not have found out a time more fit to blazon her own ſhame and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty then in ſuch a confluence. The wiſe Providence of God many times pays us with our own choice; ſo as when we think to have brought about our own Ends to our beſt content, we bring about his purpoſes to our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi>'s Birth-day is kept; and ſo was <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s: both of them with bloud. Theſe perſonal ſtains cannot make the practice unlawfull. Where the man is good, the Birth is memorable.</p>
            <p>What bleſſing have we, if Life be none? and if our life be a bleſſing, why ſhould it not be celebrated? Exceſs and diſorder may blemiſh any Solemnity; but that cleaves to the act, not to the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi>'s birth-day was kept with a Feaſt, and this Feaſt was a Supper. It was fit to be a night-work: this Feſtivity was ſpent in works of darkneſs, not of the light; it was a child of darkneſs that was then born, not of the day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe that are drunken, are drunk in the night.</hi> There is a kind of ſhame in Sin, even where it is committed with the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47750:100"/>
ſtiffeſt reſolution: at leaſt there was wont to be: if now Sin be grown impudent, and Juſtice grown baſhfull, wo be to us.</p>
            <p>That there might be perfect revells at <hi>Herod</hi>'s Birth-day, beſides the Feaſt, there is muſick and dancing, and that by <hi>Salome</hi> the daughter of <hi>Herodias.</hi> A meet Daughter for ſuch a Mother, bred according to the diſpoſition of ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt a Parent. Dancing in it ſelf, as it is a ſet, regular, harmonious motion of the body, cannot be unlawfull, more then walking or running; Circumſtances may make it ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. The wanton geſticulations of a Virgin in a wild aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Gallants warmed with Wine, could be no other then riggiſh and unmaidenly. It is not ſo frequently ſeen that the Child follows the good qualities of the Parent; it is ſeldome ſeen that it follows not the evil. Nature is the ſoil; good and ill Qualities are the herbs and weeds: the ſoil bears the weeds naturally, the herbs not without cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. What with traduction, what with education, it were ſtrange if we ſhould miſs any of our Parents miſ-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herodias</hi> and <hi>Salome</hi> have what they deſired. The dance pleaſed <hi>Herod</hi> well: thoſe indecent motions that would have diſpleaſed any modeſt eye, (though what ſhould a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt eye doe at <hi>Herod</hi>'s Feaſt?) over-pleaſed <hi>Herod.</hi> Well did <hi>Herodias</hi> know how to fit the tooth of her Paramour, and had therefore purpoſely ſo compoſed the carriage and geſture of her Daughter, as it might take beſt: although doubtleſs the ſame action could not have ſo pleaſed from another. <hi>Herod</hi> ſaw in <hi>Salome</hi>'s face and faſhion the image of her whom he doated on; ſo did ſhe look, ſo did ſhe move: beſides that his laviſh cups had prediſpoſed him to wantonneſs: and now he cannot but like well that which ſo pleaſingly ſuted his inordinate deſire. All humours love to be fed; eſpecially the vicious, ſo much more, as they are more eager and ſtirring. There cannot be a better glaſs wherein to diſcern the face of our hearts, then our
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47750:101"/>
pleaſures: ſuch as they are, ſuch are we, whether vain, or holy.</p>
            <p>What a ſtrange tranſportation was this? <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt ask:</hi> half a Kingdom for a dance? <hi>Herod,</hi> this paſtime is over-pay'd for; there is no proportion in this remunera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: this is not bounty, it is prodigence. Neither doth this paſs under a bare Promiſe onely, but under an Oath, and that ſolemn and (as it might be in wine) ſerious. How largely do ſenſual men both profer and give for a little momentany and vain contentment? How many cenſure <hi>Herod</hi>'s groſs impotence, and yet ſecond it with a worſe, giving away their precious Souls for a ſhort pleaſure of ſin? What is half a Kingdom, yea a whole World, to a Soul? So much therefore is their madneſs greater, as their loſs is more.</p>
            <p>So large a boon was worthy of a deliberation. <hi>Salome</hi> conſults with her Mother upon ſo ample and ratified a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Yet ſo much good nature and filial reſpect was in this wanton Damſel, that ſhe would not carve her ſelf of her option, but takes her Mother with her. If <hi>Herodias</hi> were infamouſly leud, yet ſhe was her Parent, and muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her choice. Children ſhould have no will of their own; as their fleſh is their Parents, ſo ſhould their will be. They do juſtly unchild themſelves, that in main elections diſpoſe of themſelves without the conſent of thoſe which gave them being. It is both unmannerly and unnatural in the Child to run before, without, againſt the will of the Parent.</p>
            <p>Oh that we could be ſo officious to our good and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, as ſhe was to an earthly and wicked Mother; not to ask, not to undertake ought without his allowance, without his directions: that when the world ſhall offer us whatſoever our heart deſires, we could run to the Oracles of God for our reſolution; not daring to accept what he doth not both licenſe and warrant.</p>
            <p>Oh the wonderfull ſtrength of malice! <hi>Salome</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47750:101"/>
no leſs then half the Kingdome of <hi>Herod,</hi> yet chuſes to ask the head of a poor Preacher. Nothing is ſo ſweet to a corrupt heart as revenge; eſpecially when it may bring with it a full ſcope to a dear ſin. All worldlings are of this diet: they had rather ſin freely for a while and die, then refrain and live happily, eternally.</p>
            <p>What a ſuit was this, <hi>Give me here in a Charger the head of John Baptiſt?</hi> It is not enough for her to ſay, Let <hi>John</hi>'s head be cut off; but, <hi>Give me it in a Charger.</hi> What a ſervice was here to be brought into a Feaſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to a Woman? a dead man's head ſwimming in bloud. How cruel is a wicked heart, that can take pleaſure in thoſe things which have moſt horrour?</p>
            <p>Oh the importunity of a galled conſcience! <hi>Herodias</hi> could never think her ſelf ſafe till <hi>John</hi> was dead; ſhe could never think him dead till his head were off; ſhe could not think his head was off till ſhe had it brought her in a platter: a guilty heart never thinks it hath made ſure enough. Yea, even after the head was thus brought, they thought him alive again. Guiltineſs and Security could never lodge together in one boſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Herod</hi> was ſorry, and no doubt in earneſt, in the midſt of his cups and pleaſance. I ſhould rather think his jollity counterfeited then his grief. It is true, <hi>Herod</hi> was a Fox; but that ſubtle beaſt diſſembles not always: when he runs away from the dogs, he means as he does. And if he were formerly willing to have killed <hi>John,</hi> yet he was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly willing; and ſo far as he was unwilling to kill him as a Prophet, as a juſt man, ſo far was he ſorry that he muſt be killed. Had <hi>Herod</hi> been wiſe, he had not been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. Had he been ſo wiſe as to have ingaged himſelf lawfully and within due limits, he had not now been ſo intangled as to have needed ſorrow. The folly of Sinners is guilty of their pain, and draws upon them a late and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable repentance.</p>
            <p>But here the act was not paſt, though the word were
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:47750:102"/>
paſt. It was his miſconceived intanglement that cauſed this ſorrow; which might have been remedied by flying off. A threefold cord tied him to the performance; the conſcience of his Oath, the reſpect to his Gueſts, a loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to diſcontent <hi>Herodias</hi> and her daughter. <hi>Herod</hi> had ſo much religion as to make ſcruple of an Oath; not ſo much as to make ſcruple of a Murther. No man caſts off all juſtice and piety at once; but whilſt he gives himſelf over to ſome ſins, he ſticks at others. It is no thank to leud men that they are not univerſally vicious. All God's ſeveral Laws cannot be violated at once: there are Sins contrary to each other; there are Sins diſagreeing from the leudeſt diſpoſitions. There are Oppreſſours that hate Drunkenneſs; there are Unclean perſons which abhor Murther; there are Drunkards which hate Cruelty. One ſin is enough to damn the Soul, one leak to drown the Veſſel.</p>
            <p>But, O fond <hi>Herod,</hi> what needed this unjuſt ſcrupulouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Well and ſafely mighteſt thou have ſhifted the bond of thine Oath with a double evaſion. One, That this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of thy promiſe was onely to be conſtrued of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acts and motions: That onely can we doe, which we can juſtly doe; Unlawfulneſs is in the nature of Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The other, That had this ingagement been ſo meant, yet might it be as lawfully reſcinded as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully made. A ſinfull Promiſe is ill made, worſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Thus thou mighteſt, thou ſhouldſt have come off fair; where now, holding thy ſelf by an irreligious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion tied to thy fooliſh and wicked Oath, thou onely goeſt away with this mitigation, that thou art a ſcrupulous Murtherer.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, if an <hi>Herod</hi> made ſuch conſcience of keeping an unlawfull Oath, how ſhall he in the day of judgement condemn thoſe Chriſtians which make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of Oaths lawfull, juſt, neceſſary? Woe is me, one ſells an Oath for a bribe, another lends an Oath for favour,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47750:102"/>
another caſts it away for malice. I fear to think it may be a queſtion whether there be more Oaths broken, or kept. O God, I marvell not, if being implored as a witneſs, as an avenger of falſhood, thou hold him not guiltleſs that thus dares take thy Name in vain.</p>
            <p>Next to his Oath is the reſpect to his Honour. His Gueſts heard his deep engagement, and now he cannot fall off with reputation. It would argue levity and raſhneſs to ſay and not to doe, and what would the world ſay? The miſconceits of the points of Honour have coſt millions of Souls. As many a one doeth good onely to be ſeen of men, ſo many a one doeth evil onely to ſatisfie the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and opinion of others. It is a damnable plauſibility ſo to regard the vain approbation or cenſure of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as in the mean time to neglect the allowance or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. But how ill gueſts were theſe? how well worthy of an <hi>Herod</hi>'s table? Had they had but common civility, finding <hi>Herod</hi> perplexed, they had acquitted him by their diſſwaſions, and would have diſclaimed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſo bloudy a performance: but they rather (to gratifie <hi>Herodias)</hi> make way for ſo ſlight and eaſie a condeſcent. Even godly Princes have complained of the <hi>iniquity of</hi> their <hi>heels:</hi> how much more muſt they needs be ill attended, that give incouragements and examples of leudneſs?</p>
            <p>Neither was it the leaſt motive, that he was loth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe his Miſtreſs. The Damſell had pleaſed him in her dance; he would not diſcontent her in breaking his word. He ſaw <hi>Herodias</hi> in <hi>Salome:</hi> the ſuit, he knew, was the mother's, though in the daughter's lips: both would be diſpleaſed in falling off; both would be gratified in yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. O vain and wicked <hi>Herod!</hi> He cares not to offend God, to offend his Conſcience; he cares to offend a wanton Miſtreſs. This is one means to fill Hell, lothneſs to diſpleaſe.</p>
            <p>A good heart will rather fall out with all the world then with God, then with his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:47750:103"/>The miſ-grounded ſorrow of worldly hearts doth not withhold them from their intended ſins. It is enough to vex, not enough to reſtrain them. <hi>Herod</hi> was ſorry, but he ſends the Executioner for <hi>John</hi>'s head. One act hath made <hi>Herod</hi> a Tyrant, and <hi>John</hi> a Martyr. <hi>Herod</hi> a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, in that without all legall proceedings, without ſo much as falſe witneſſes, he takes off the head of a man, of a Prophet. It was Luſt that carried <hi>Herod</hi> into Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The proceedings of ſin are more hardly avoided then the entrance. Whoſo gives himſelf leave to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, knows not where he ſhall ſtay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> a Martyr, in dying for bearing witneſs to the Truth; Truth in life, in judgment, in doctrine. It was the holy purpoſe of God, that he which had baptized with water ſhould now be baptized with bloud. Never did God mean that his beſt children ſhould dwell always upon earth: ſhould they ſtay here, wherefore hath he provided Glory above? Now would God have <hi>John</hi> delivered from a double priſon; of his own, of <hi>Herod</hi>'s; and placed in the glorious liberty of his ſons. His head ſhall be taken off, that it may be crowned with glory. <hi>Precious in the ſight of the Lord is the death of his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O happy birth-day (not of <hi>Herod,</hi> but) of the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi>! Now doth <hi>John</hi> enter into his joy; and in his name is this day ever celebrated of the Church. This bleſſed Fore-runner of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I muſt decreaſe.</hi> He is decreaſed indeed, and now grown ſhorter by the head; but he is not ſo much decreaſed in ſtature, as increaſed in glory. For one minute's pain he is poſſeſſed of endleſs joy; and as he came before his Saviour into the world, ſo is he gone before him into Heaven.</p>
            <p>The Head is brought in a Charger. What a diſh was here for a Feaſt? How prodigiouſly inſatiable is the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a wicked heart! O bleſſed ſervice fit for the table of Heaven! It is not for thee, O wicked <hi>Herod,</hi> nor for thee, malicious and wanton <hi>Herodias</hi>; it is a diſh precious
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47750:103"/>
and pleaſing to the God of Heaven, to the bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who look'd upon that Head with more delight in his conſtant fidelity, then the beholders ſaw it with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>Herodias</hi> with contentment of revenge.</p>
            <p>It is brought to <hi>Salome</hi> as the reward of her dance; ſhe preſents it to her Mother as the dainty ſhe had longed for. Methinks I ſee how that chaſt and holy countenance was toſſed by impure and filthy hands; that true and faithfull tongue, thoſe ſacred lips, thoſe pure eyes, thoſe mortified cheeks are now inſultingly handled by an inceſtuous Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and made a ſcorn to the drunken eyes of <hi>Herod</hi>'s gueſts.</p>
            <p>Oh the wondrous judgments and incomprehenſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the holy, wiſe, Almighty God! He that was ſanctified in the womb, born and conceived with ſo much note and miracle, <hi>(What manner of child ſhall this be?)</hi> lived with ſo much reverence and obſervation, is now, at midnight, obſcurely murthered in a cloſe priſon, and his head brought forth to the inſultation and irriſion of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots and Ruffians. O God, thou knoweſt what thou haſt to doe with thine own. Thus thou ſuffereſt thine to be miſuſed and ſlaughtered here below, that thou mayeſt crown them above.

            <head>XXII. The five Loaves and two Fiſhes.</head>
            <p>WHat flocking there was after <hi>Chriſt</hi> which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he went? How did the Kingdom of Heaven ſuffer an holy violence in theſe his followers? Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity drave him from the land to the ſea. When he was upon the ſea of <hi>Tiberias,</hi> they followed him with their eyes; and when they ſaw which way he bent, they followed him ſo faſt on foot that they prevented his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Whether it were that our Saviour ſtaid ſome while upon the water, (as that which yielded him more quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and freedom of reſpiration,) or whether the foot-paſſage (as it oft falls out) were the ſhorter cut, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the compaſſes of the water and the many elbows of the land, I inquire not: ſure I am, the wind did not ſo ſwiftly drive on the ſhip, as deſire and zeal drave on theſe eager clients. Well did <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſee them all the way; well did he know their ſteps, and guided them: and now he purpoſely goes to meet them, whom he ſeemed to fly. Nothing can pleaſe God more then our importunity in ſeeking him: when he withdraws himſelf, it is that he may be more earneſtly inquired for. Now then he comes to find them whom he made ſhew to decline: and ſeeing a great multitude, he paſſes from the ſhip to the ſhore. That which brought him from Heaven to earth, brought him alſo from the ſea to land; his compaſſion on their Souls, that he might teach them; compaſſion on their Bodies, that he might heal and feed them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judaea</hi> was not large, but populous: it could not be but there muſt be amongſt ſo many men many diſeaſed: it is no marvel if the report of ſo miraculous and univerſal
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47750:104"/>
ſanations drew cuſtomers. They found three advantages of cure above the power and performance of any earthly Phyſician, Certainty, Bounty, Eaſe. Certainty, in that all comers were cured without fail: Bounty, in that they were cured without charge: Eaſe, in that they were cured without pain. Far be it from us, O Saviour, to think that thy Glory hath abated of thy Mercy: ſtill and ever thou art our aſſured, bountifull, and perfect Phyſician, who healeſt all our diſeaſes, and takeſt away all our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. O that we could have our faithfull recourſe to thee in all our ſpiritual maladies: it were as impoſſible we ſhould want help, as that thou ſhouldſt want power and mercy.</p>
            <p>That our Saviour might approve himſelf every way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent, he that had filled the Souls of his Auditours with ſpiritual repaſt, will now fill their Bodies with temporal: and he that had approved himſelf the univerſal Phyſician of his Church, will now be known to be the great houſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the world, by whoſe liberal proviſion mankind is maintained. He did not more miraculouſly heal, then he feeds miraculouſly.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples having well noted the diligent and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune attendence of the multitude, now towards evening come to their Maſter in a care of their repaſt and diſcharge. <hi>This is a deſart place, and the time is now paſt: Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and buy themſelves victuals.</hi> How well it becomes even ſpiritual guides to regard the bodily neceſſities of God's people? This is not directly in our charge, neither may we leave our ſacred miniſtration to ſerve Tables. But yet, as the bodily father muſt take care for the Soul of his child; ſo muſt the ſpiritual have reſpect to the Body. This is all that the world commonly looks after, meaſuring their Paſtours more by their diſhes then by their doctrine or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; as if they had the charge of their Bellies, not of their Souls: if they have open Cellars, it matters not
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47750:105"/>
whether their Mouths be open. If they be ſociable in their carriage, favourable and indulgent to their recreations, full in their chear, how eaſily doth the world diſpenſe with either their negligence or enormities? As if the Souls of theſe men lay in their weaſand, in their gut. But ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have reaſon to expect from their Teachers a due proportion of Hoſpitality. An unmeet parſimony is here not more odious then it is ſinfull: And where ability wants, yet care may not be wanting. Thoſe Preachers which are ſo intent upon their ſpiritual work, that in the mean time they over-ſtrain the weakneſſes of their people, holding them in their Devotions longer then humane frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will permit, forget not themſelves more then their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern; and muſt be ſent to ſchool to theſe compaſſionate Diſciples, who, when evening was come, ſue to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the people's diſmiſſion.</p>
            <p>The place was deſart; the time, evening. Doubtleſs our Saviour made choice of both theſe, that there might be both more uſe and more note of his Miracle. Had it been in the morning, their ſtomack had not been up, their feeding had been unneceſſary. Had it been in the Village, proviſion either might have been made, or at leaſt would have ſeemed made by themſelves. But now that it was both deſart and evening, there was good ground for the Diſciples to move, and for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to work their ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then onely may we expect and crave help from God, when we find our need. Superfluous aid can neither be heartily deſired, nor earneſtly lookt for, nor thankfully received from the hands of mercy. <hi>Caſt thy burthen upon the Lord, and he ſhall ſuſtain thee.</hi> If it be not a burthen, it is no caſting it upon God. Hence it is that Divine aid comes ever in the very upſhot and exigence of our trialls; when we have been exerciſed, and almoſt tired with long hopes, yea with deſpairs of ſucceſs: that it may be both more longed for ere it come, and when it comes more welcome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:47750:105"/>Oh the Faith and Zeal of theſe clients of <hi>Chriſt</hi>! They not onely follow him from the City into the Deſart, from delicacy to want, from frequence to ſolitude; but forget their Bodies in purſuit of the food of their Souls.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more hard for an healthfull man to forget then his belly; within few hours this will be ſure to ſolicit him, and will take no denials. Yet ſuch ſweetneſs did theſe hearers find in the ſpiritual repaſt, that they thought not on the bodily: the Diſciples pitied them, they had no mercy on themſelves. By how much more a man's mind is taken up with Heavenly things, ſo much leſs ſhall he care for earthly. What ſhall Earth be to us, when we are all Spirit? And in the mean time, according to the degrees of our intellectual elevations, ſhall be our neglect of bodily contentments.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples think they move well: <hi>Send them away that they may buy victuals.</hi> Here was a ſtrong Charity, but a weak Faith. A ſtrong Charity, in that they would have the people relieved; a weak Faith, in that they ſuppoſed they could not otherwiſe be ſo well relieved. As a man when he ſees many ways lie before him, takes that which he thinks both faireſt and neareſt; ſo do they: this way of relief lay openeſt to their view, and promiſed moſt. Well might they have thought, It is as eaſie for our Maſter to feed them as to heal them; there is an equal facility in all things to a ſupernatural power: yet they ſay, <hi>Send them away.</hi> In all our projects and ſuits we are ſtill ready to move for that which is moſt obvious, moſt likely, when ſometimes that is leſs agreeable to the will of God.</p>
            <p>The All-wiſe and Almighty Arbiter of all things hath a thouſand ſecret means to honour himſelf in his proceedings with us. It is not for us to carve boldly for our ſelves; but we muſt humbly depend on the diſpoſal of his Wiſedom and Mercy.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour's anſwer gives a ſtrange check to their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>They need not depart.</hi> Not need? They had no vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47750:106"/>
they muſt have; there was none to be had. What more need could be? He knew the ſupply which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, though they knew it not. His command was therefore more ſtrange then his aſſertion, <hi>Give ye them to eat.</hi> Nothing gives what it hath not. Had they had vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, they had not called for a diſmiſſion; and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, how ſhould they give? It was thy wiſedom, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, thus to prepare thy Diſciples for the intended Miracle: Thou wouldſt not doe it abruptly, without an intimation both of the purpoſe of it and the neceſſity. And how modeſtly doſt thou undertake it, without noiſe, without oſtentation? I hear thee not ſay, I will give them to eat; no, but, <hi>Give ye:</hi> as if it ſhould be their act, not thine. Thus ſometimes it pleaſeth thee to require of us what we are not able to perform; either that thou mayeſt ſhew us what we cannot doe, and ſo humble us; or that thou mayeſt erect us to a dependence upon thee, which canſt doe it for us. As when the Mother bids the Infant come to her, which hath not yet the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy uſe of his legs, it is that he may cling the faſter to her hand or coat for ſupportation.</p>
            <p>Thou bidſt us, impotent wretches, to keep thy royal Law. Alas! what can we Sinners doe? there is not one letter of thoſe thy Ten words that we are able to keep. This charge of thine intends to ſhew us not our ſtrength, but our weakneſs. Thus thou wouldſt turn our eyes both back to what we might have done, to what we could have done; and upwards to thee in whom we have done it, in whom we can doe it. He wrongs thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice that miſconſtrues theſe thy commands, as if they were of the ſame nature with thoſe of the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> task-maſters, requiring the brick, and not giving the ſtraw. But in bidding us doe what we cannot, thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt us to doe what the <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

the Diſciples to give to the multitude, thou meanteſt to ſupply unto them what thou commandedſt to give.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour hath what he would, an acknowledgement of their inſufficiency: <hi>We have here but five loaves and two fiſhes.</hi> A poor proviſion for the family of the Lord of the whole earth: Five loaves, and thoſe barley; two fiſhes, and thoſe little ones. We well know, O Saviour, that the beaſts were thine on a thouſand mountains, all the corn thine that covered the whole ſurface of the earth, all the fowls of the air thine; it was thou that providedſt thoſe drifts of Quails that fell among the tents of thy rebellious <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that rainedſt down thoſe ſhowrs of Manna round about their camp: and doſt thou take up (for thy ſelf and thy meiny) with <hi>five barley loaves, and two little fiſhes?</hi> Certainly this was thy will, not thy need: to teach us, that this body muſt be fed, not pampered. Our <hi>belly</hi> may not be our maſter, much leſs our <hi>God</hi>; or if it be, the next word is, <hi>whoſe glory is their ſhame, whoſe end damnation.</hi> It is noted as the crime of the rich glutton, that <hi>he fared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly every day.</hi> I never find that <hi>Chriſt</hi> entertained any gueſts but twice; and that was onely with loaves and fiſhes. I find him ſometimes feaſted by others more liberally. But his domeſticall fare how ſimple, how homely it is? The end of food is to ſuſtain Nature. Meat was ordained for the belly, the belly for the body, the body for the Soul, the Soul for God: we muſt ſtill look through the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ends to the higheſt. To reſt in the pleaſure of the meat, is for thoſe creatures which have no Souls. Oh the extreme delicacy of theſe times! What conquiſition is here of all ſorts of curious diſhes from the fartheſt ſeas and lands, to make up one hour's meal? what broken cookery? what deviſed mixtures? what nice ſauces? what feaſting not of the taſt onely, but of the ſent? Are we the Diſciples of him that took up with the loaves and fiſhes; or the ſcholars of a <hi>Philoxenus,</hi> or an <hi>Apitius,</hi> or <hi>Vitellius,</hi> or thoſe other monſters of the palate? the true ſons of thoſe firſt Parents that killed themſelves with their teeth?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:47750:107"/>Neither was the quality of theſe victuals more courſe, then the quantity ſmall. They make a <hi>But</hi> of five loaves and two fiſhes; and well they might, in reſpect of ſo many thouſand mouths. A little food to an hungry ſtomack doth rather ſtir up appetite then ſatisfy it: as a little rain upon a droughty ſoil doth rather help to ſcorch then refreſh it. When we look with the eye of Senſe or Reaſon upon any Object, we ſhall ſee an impoſſibility of thoſe effects which Faith can eaſily apprehend, and Divine power more eaſily produce. Carnall minds are ready to meaſure all our hopes by humane poſſibilities; and when they fail, to deſpair of ſucceſs: where true Faith meaſures them by Divine power, and therefore can never be diſheartned. This Grace is for things not ſeen, and whether beyond hope, or againſt it.</p>
            <p>The virtue is not in the means, but in the agent. <hi>Bring them hither to me.</hi> How much more eaſie had it been for our Saviour to fetch the loaves to him, then to multiply them? The hands of the Diſciples ſhall bring them, that they might more fully witneſs both the Authour and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the inſtant Miracle. Had the loaves and fiſhes been multiplied without this bringing, perhaps they might have ſeemed to have come by the ſecret proviſion of the gueſts: now there can be no queſtion either of the act, or of the agent. As God takes pleaſure in doing wonders for men, ſo he loves to be acknowledged in the great works that he doeth. He hath no reaſon to part with his own glory; that is too precious for him to loſe, or for his creature to embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zell. And how juſtly didſt thou, O Saviour, in this mean to teach thy Diſciples, that it was thou onely who feedeſt the world; and upon whom both themſelves and all their fellow-creatures muſt depend for their nouriſhment and proviſion; and that if it came not through thy hands, it could not come to theirs?</p>
            <p>There need no more words. I do not hear the Diſciples ſtand upon the terms of their own neceſſity; Alas! Sir, it is too little for our ſelves; whence ſhall we then relieve our

own hunger? Give leave to our Charity to begin at home. But they willingly yield to the command of their Maſter, and put themſelves upon his Providence for the ſequel. When we have a charge from God, it is not for us to ſtand upon ſelf-reſpects; in this caſe there is no ſuch ſure liberty as in a ſelf-contempt. O God, when thou calleſt to us for our five loaves, we muſt forget our own intereſt: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if we be more thrifty then obedient, our good turns evil; and much better had it been for us to have wanted that which we withhold from the owner.</p>
            <p>He that is the Maſter of the Feaſt marſhals the gueſts; <hi>He commanded the multitude to ſit down on the graſs.</hi> They obey, and expect. O marvellous Faith! So many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſit down, and addreſs themſelves to a meal, when they ſaw nothing but five poor barly loaves and two ſmall fiſhes. None of them ſay, Sit down? to what? Here are the mouths, but where is the meat? We can ſoon be ſet, but whence ſhall we be ſerved? Ere we draw our knives, let us ſee our chear. But they meekly and obediently diſpoſe themſelves to their places, and look up to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous purveyance. It is for all that would be <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to lead the life of Faith; and, even where means appear not, to wait upon that mercifull hand. Nothing is more eaſy then to truſt God when our barns and coffers are full; and to ſay, <hi>Give us our daily bread,</hi> when we have it in our cupboard. But when we have nothing, when we know not how or whence to get any thing, then to depend upon an inviſible bounty, this is a true and noble act of Faith. To caſt away our own, that we may immediately live upon Divine Providence, I know no warrant. But when the neceſſity is of God's making, we ſee our refuge; and happy are we if our confidence can fly to it, and reſt in it. Yea fulneſs ſhould be a Curſe, if it ſhould debar us from this dependence: at our beſt we muſt look up to this great houſholder of the world, and cannot but need his proviſion. If we have meat, perhaps not appetite; if appetite, it may
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47750:108"/>
be not digeſtion; or if that, not health, and freedom from pain; or if that, perhaps (from other occurrents) not life.</p>
            <p>The gueſts are ſet full of expectation. He that could have multiplied the bread in abſence, in ſilence takes it and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it; that he might at once ſhew them the Authour and the means of this increaſe. It is thy bleſſing, O God, that maketh rich. What a difference do we ſee in mens eſtates? Some languiſh under great means, and injoy not either their ſubſtance or themſelves; others are chearfull and happy in a little. Second cauſes may not be denied their work; but the over-ruling power is above. The ſubordinateneſs of the Creature doth not take away from the right, from the thank of the Firſt Mover.</p>
            <p>He could as well have multiplied the loaves whole; why would he rather doe it in the breaking? Was it to teach us that in the diſtribution of our goods we ſhould expect his bleſſing, not in their intireneſs and reſervation? <hi>There is that ſcattereth, and yet increaſeth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon:</hi> Yea, there is no man but increaſeth by ſcattering. It is the grain thrown into the ſeveral furrows of the earth which yields the rich intereſt unto the Huſbandman: that which is tied up in his ſack, or heaped in his granary, decreaſeth by keeping. <hi>He that ſoweth liberally ſhall reap liberally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Away with our weak diſtruſt. If Wealth came by us, giving were the way to want: now that God gives to the giver, nothing can ſo ſure inrich us as our beneficence. He multiplied the bread not to keep, but to give; <hi>He gave it to the Diſciples.</hi> And why not rather by his own hand to the multitude, that ſo the Miracle and thank might have been more immediate? Wherefore was this, O Saviour, but that thou mighteſt win reſpect to thy Diſciples from the people? As great Princes, when they would ingratiate a Favourite, paſs no ſuits but through his hands. What an honour was this to thy ſervants, that as thou wert Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt thy Father and Man, ſo thou wouldſt have
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:47750:108"/>
them in ſome beneficiall occaſion mediate betwixt men and thee? How fit a type is this of thy ſpirituall proviſion, that thou who couldſt have fed the world by thine immediate word, wouldſt by the hands of thy Miniſters divide the bread of life to all hearers? Like as it was with the Law: well did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſee and hear that thou couldſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that dreadfull meſſage with thine own mouth; yet in favour of their weakneſs thou wouldſt treat with them by a <hi>Moſes.</hi> Uſe of means derogates nothing from the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the principal Agent, yea adds to it. It is a ſtrange weakneſs of our ſpirituall eyes, if we can look but to the next hand. How abſurd had theſe gueſts been, if they had termined the thanks in the ſervitours, and had ſaid, We have it from you, whence ye had it is no part of our care: we owe this favour to you; if you owe it to your Maſter, acknowledge your obligations to him, as we do unto you? But ſince they well knew that the Diſciples might have handled this bread long enough ere any ſuch effect could have followed, they eaſily find to whom they are beholden. Our Chriſtian wiſedom muſt teach us, whoſoever be the means, to reſerve our main thanks for the Authour of our good.</p>
            <p>He gave the bread then to his Diſciples, not to eat, not to keep, but to diſtribute. It was not their particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit he regarded in this gift, but the good of many.</p>
            <p>In every Feaſt each ſervitour takes up his diſh, not to carry it aſide into a corner for his own private repaſt; but to ſet it before the gueſts, for the honour of his Maſter: when they have done, his chear begins. What ſhall we ſay to thoſe injurious waiters, who fatten themſelves with thoſe concealed meſſes which are meant to others? Their table is made their ſnare; and theſe ſtoln morſels cannot but end in bitterneſs.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Diſciples ſet this fare before the gueſts. I do not ſee ſo much as <hi>Judas</hi> reſerve a ſhare to himſelf, whether out of hunger or diſtruſt. Had not our Saviour
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47750:109"/>
commanded ſo free a diſtribution, their ſelf-love would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have taught them where to begin. Nature ſays, Firſt thy ſelf, then thy friends: either extremity or particular charge gives Grace occaſion to alter the caſe. Far be it from us to think we have any claim in that which the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gives us meerly to beſtow.</p>
            <p>I know not now whether more to wonder at the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous eating, or the miraculous leaving. Here were a whole hoaſt of gueſts, five thouſand men; and in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood no fewer women and children. Perhaps ſome of theſe onely look'd on. Nay, <hi>they did all eat.</hi> Perhaps eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man a crum, or a bit. Nay, they did eat to ſatiety; <hi>all were ſatisfied.</hi> So many muſt needs make clean work; of ſo little there could be left nothing. Yea, there were <hi>fragments</hi> remaining. Perhaps ſome crums or cruſts, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be diſcerned, much leſs gathered. Nay, <hi>twelve ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skets full:</hi> more remained then was firſt ſet down. Had they eaten nothing, it was a juſt Miracle that ſo much ſhould be left; had nothing remained, it was no leſs Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that ſo many had eaten, and ſo many ſatisfied: but now that ſo many bellies and ſo many baskets were filled, the Miracle was doubled. O work of a boundleſs Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency! Whether this were done by creation or by conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, uſes to be queſtioned, but needs not. Whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> multiplies the bread, it is not for us to multiply his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. To make ought of nothing, is more then to adde much unto ſomething. It was therefore rather by turning of a former matter into theſe ſubſtances, then by making theſe ſubſtances of nothing.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, here is a marvellous proviſion made, a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous bounty of that proviſion, a no leſs marvellous extent of that bounty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that depend upon God, and buſy themſelves in his work, ſhall not want a due purveyance in the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart. Our ſtreight and confined beneficence reaches ſo far as to provide for our own; thoſe of our Domeſticks which
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:47750:109"/>
labour in our ſervice do but juſtly expect and challenge their diet; whereas day-labourers are oft-times at their own finding. How much more will that God, who is infinite in mercy and power, take order for the livelihood of thoſe that attend him? We ſee the birds of the air provided for by him; how rarely have we found any of them dead of hunger? yet what doe they but what they are carried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by natural inſtinct? How much more where, beſides propriety, there is a rational and willing ſervice? Shall the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> be fed with Manna, <hi>Eliah</hi> by the Ravens, the Widow by her multiplied meal and oyl, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s clients in the wilderneſs with loaves and fiſhes? O God, whilſt thou doſt thus promerit us by thy Providence, let not us wrong thee by diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>God's undertakings cannot but be exquiſite: thoſe whom he profeſſes to feed, muſt needs have enough. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his bounty cannot but run over. Doth he take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to prepare a table for his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the deſart? the bread ſhall be the food of Angels, the fleſh ſhall be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates of Princes, Manna and Quails. Doth he take upon him to make wine for the marriage-feaſt of <hi>Cana?</hi> there ſhall be both ſtore and choice; the vintage yields poor ſtuff to this. Will he feaſt his Auditours in the wilderneſs? if they have not dainties, they ſhall have plenty; <hi>They were all ſatisfied.</hi> Neither yet, O Saviour, is thy hand cloſed. What abundance of heavenly doctrine doſt thou ſet before us? how are we feaſted, yea pampered with thy celeſtiall delicacies? Not according to our meanneſs, but according to thy ſtate, are we fed. Thrifty and niggardly collations are not for Princes. We are full of thy goodneſs; O let our hearts run over with thanks.</p>
            <p>I do gladly wonder at this Miracle of thine, O Saviour; yet ſo as that I forget not mine own condition. Whence is it that we have our continuall proviſion? One and the ſame munificent hand doeth all. If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were fed with Manna in the deſart, and with corn in <hi>Canaan,</hi> both
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47750:110"/>
were done by the ſame power and bounty. If the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were fed by the loaves multiplied, and we by the grain multiplied, both are the act of one Omnipotence. What is this but a perpetuall Miracle, O God, which thou wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt for our preſervation? Without thee, there is no more power in the grain to multiply then in the loaf: it is thou that <hi>giveſt it a body at thy pleaſure, even to every ſeed his own body</hi>; it is thou that <hi>giveſt fulneſs of bread and cleanneſs of teeth.</hi> It is no reaſon thy goodneſs ſhould be leſs magnified becauſe it is univerſall.</p>
            <p>One or two baskets could have held the five loaves and two fiſhes; not leſs then twelve can hold the remainders. The Divine munificence provides not for our neceſſity one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but for our abundance, yea ſuperfluity. Envy and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, whilſt they make God the authour of enough, are ready to impute the ſurpluſage to another cauſe; as we commonly ſay of Wine, that the liquour is God's, the exceſs Satan's.</p>
            <p>Thy Table, O Saviour, convinces them, which had more taken away then ſet on: thy Bleſſing makes an eſtate not competent onely, but rich. I hear of barns full of plenty, and preſſes burſting out with new wine, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of thoſe that honour thee with their ſubſtance. I hear of heads anointed with oyl, and cups running over. O God, as thou haſt a free hand to give, ſo let us have a free heart to return thee the praiſe of thy Bounty.</p>
            <p>Thoſe fragments were left behind. I do not ſee the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they had filled their bellies, cramming their pockets, or ſtuffing their wallets; yet the place was deſart, and ſome of them doubtleſs had far home.</p>
            <p>It becomes true Diſciples to be content with the preſent, not too ſolicitous for the future. O Saviour, thou didſt not bid us beg bread for to morrow, but for to day: not that we ſhould refuſe thy bounty when thou pleaſeſt to give; but that we ſhould not diſtruſt thy Providence for the need we may have.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:47750:110"/>Even theſe fragments (though but of barley loaves and fiſh-bones) may not be left in the deſart, for the compoſt of that earth whereon they were increaſed; but by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's holy and juſt command are gathered up. The libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall houſekeeper of the world will not allow the loſs of his orts: the childrens bread may not be given to dogs: and if the crums fall to their ſhare, it is becauſe their ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs admits not of a collection. If thoſe who out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or due thrift have thought to gather up crums, have found them pearls, I wonder not: Surely both are alike, the good creatures of the ſame Maker; and both of them may prove equally coſtly to us in their wilfull mis-ſpending. But oh, what ſhall we ſay, that not cruſts and crums, not loaves and diſhes and cups, but whole patrimonies are idly laviſht away; not merely loſt, (this were more eaſy) but ill ſpent in a wicked riot upon dice, drabs, drunkards? Oh the fearfull account of theſe unthrifty Bailifs, which ſhall once be given in to our great Lord and Maſter, when he ſhall call us to a ſtrict reckoning of all our talents! He was condemned that increaſed not the ſumme concredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him: what ſhall become of him that lawleſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs it?</p>
            <p>Who gathered up theſe fragments but the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, every one his basket-full? They were the ſervitours that ſet on this banquet at the command of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they waited on the Tables, they took away.</p>
            <p>It was our Saviour's juſt care that thoſe offalls ſhould not periſh: but he well knew that a greater loſs depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ſcraps; a loſs of glory to the omnipotent Worker of that Miracle. The feeding of the multitude was but the one half of the work, the other half was in the remnant. Of all other it moſt concerns the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles to take care that the marvellous works of their God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may be improved to the beſt; they may not ſuffer a cruſt or crum to be loſt that may yield any glory to that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Agent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:47750:111"/>Here was not any morſel or bone that was not worthy to be a relique, every the leaſt parcel whereof was no other then miraculous. All the ancient monuments of God's ſupernatural power and mercy were in the keeping of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons. There is no Servant in the Family but ſhould be thriftily carefull for his Maſter's profit; but moſt of all the Steward, who is particularly charged with this overſight. Wo be to us if we care onely to gather up our own ſcraps, with neglect of the precious morſels of our Maker and Redeemer.</p>

            <head>XXIII. The Walk upon the Waters.</head>
            <p>ALL Elements are alike to their Maker. He that had well approved his power on the Land, will now ſhew it in the Air and the Waters; he that had preſerved the multitude from the peril of hunger in the Deſart, will now preſerve his Diſciples from the peril of the tempeſt in the Sea.</p>
            <p>Where do we ever elſe find any compulſion offered by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Diſciples? He was like the good Centurion; he <hi>ſaid to one, Go, and he goeth.</hi> When he did but call them from their nets they came; and when he ſent them by pairs into the Cities and Country of <hi>Judaea</hi> to preach the Goſpel, they went. There was never errand whereon they went unwillingly: onely now <hi>he conſtrained them to depart.</hi> We may eaſily conceive how loth they were to leave him; whether out of love, or of common civility. <hi>Peter</hi>'s tongue did but (when it was) ſpeak the heart of the reſt; <hi>Maſter, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> Who
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:47750:111"/>
could chuſe but be in love with ſuch a Maſter? And who can willingly part from what he loves? But had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects been onely common and ordinary, how unfit might it ſeem to leave a Maſter now towards night, in a wild place, amongſt ſtrangers, unprovided of the means of his paſſage? Where otherwiſe therefore he needed but to bid, now he conſtrains. O Saviour, it was ever thy manner to call all men unto thee; <hi>Come to me, all that labour and are heavy laden.</hi> When didſt thou ever drive any one from thee? Neither had it been ſo now, but to draw them clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer unto thee, whom thou ſeemedſt for the time to abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. In the mean while, I know not whether more to excuſe their unwillingneſs, or to applaud their obedience. As it ſhall be fully above, ſo it was proportionally here below; <hi>In thy preſence</hi> (O Saviour) <hi>is the fulneſs of joy.</hi> Once, when thou askedſt theſe thy Domeſticks whether they alſo would depart, it was anſwered thee by one tongue for all, <hi>Maſter, whither ſhould we go from thee? thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> What a death was it then to them to be compelled to leave thee? Sometimes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Divine goodneſs to lay upon his ſervants ſuch commands as ſavour of harſhneſs and diſcomfort; which yet both in his intention and in the event are no other then gracious and ſoveraign. The more difficulty was in the charge, the more praiſe was in the obedience. I do not hear them ſtand upon the terms of capitulation with their Maſter, nor pleading importunately for their ſtay; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly upon the command they yield and go. We are never perfect Diſciples, till we can depart from our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, from our will; yea, O Saviour, when thou biddeſt us, from thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>Neither will the multitude be gone without a diſmiſſion. They had followed him whilſt they were hungry, they will not leave him now they are fed. Fain would they put that honour upon him, which to avoid he is fain to avoid them: gladly would they pay a Kingdom to him as
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47750:112"/>
their ſhot for their late banquet; he ſhuns both it and them. O Saviour, when the hour of thy Paſſion was now come, thou couldſt offer thy ſelf readily to thine apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and now when the glory of the world preſſes upon thee, thou runneſt away from a crown. Was it to teach us that there is leſs danger in ſuffering then in outward proſperity? What do we dote upon that worldly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which thou heldſt worthy of avoidance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt?</p>
            <p>Beſides this reſervedneſs, it was devotion that drew <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> aſide. He went alone up to the mountain to pray. Lo, thou, to whom the greateſt throng was a ſolitude in reſpect of the fruition of thy Father, thou who wert un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of diſtraction from him with whom thou wert one, wouldſt yet ſo much act man as to retire for the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of prayer: to teach us, who are nothing but wild thoughts and giddy diſtractedneſs, to go aſide when we would ſpeak with God. How happy is it for us that thou prayedſt? O Saviour, thou prayedſt for us, who have not grace enough to pray for our ſelves, nor worth enough to be accepted when we do pray. Thy prayers, which were moſt perfect and impetrative, are they by which our weak and unworthy prayers receive both life and favour. And now how aſſiduous ſhould we be in our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who are empty of grace, full of wants; when thou, who wert a God of all power, praiedſt for that which thou couldſt command? Therefore do we pray, becauſe thou praiedſt: therefore do we expect to be graciouſly anſwered in our prayers, becauſe thou didſt pray for us here on earth, and now intercedeſt for us in Heaven.</p>
            <p>The evening was come; the Diſciples look'd long for their Maſter, and loth they were to have ſtirred without him: but his command is more then the ſtrongeſt wind to fill their ſails, and they are now gone. Their expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation made not the evening ſeem ſo long as our Saviour's devotion made it ſeem ſhort to him. He is on the mount,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47750:112"/>
they on the ſea: yet whilſt he was in the mount praying, and lifting up his eyes to his Father, he fails not to caſt them about upon his Diſciples toſſed on the waves. Thoſe all-ſeeing eyes admit of no limits. At once he ſees the higheſt Heavens, and the midſt of the Sea; the glory of his Father, and the miſery of his Diſciples. Whatever proſpects preſent themſelves to his view, the diſtreſs of his Followers is ever moſt noted.</p>
            <p>How much more doſt thou now, O Saviour, from the height of thy glorious advancement behold us thy wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſervants toſſed on the unquiet ſea of this World, and beaten with the troubleſome and threatning billows of Affliction? Thou foreſaweſt their toil and danger ere thou diſmiſſedſt them, and purpoſedly ſendeſt them away that they might be toſſed. Thou that couldſt prevent our ſufferings by thy power, wilt permit them in thy wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that thou mayeſt glorifie thy mercy in our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and confirm our Faith by the iſſue of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>How do all things now ſeem to conſpire to the vexing of the poor Diſciples? The night was ſullen and dark, their Maſter was abſent, the ſea was boiſtrous, the winds were high and contrary. Had their Maſter been with them, howſoever the elements had raged, they had been ſecure. Had their Maſter been away, yet if the ſea had been quiet or the winds fair, the paſſage might have been endured. Now both ſeaſon, and ſea, and wind, and their Maſter's deſertion had agreed to render them perfectly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. Sometimes the Providence of God hath thought good ſo to order it, that to his beſt ſervants there appeareth no glimpſe of comfort; but ſo abſolute vexation, as if Heaven and earth had plotted their full affliction. Yea, O Saviour, what a dead night, what a fearfull tempeſt, what an aſtoniſhing dereliction was that, wherein thou thy ſelf criedſt out in the bitterneſs of thine anguiſhed Soul, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Yet in all
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47750:113"/>
theſe extremities of miſery, our gracious God intends no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his greater glory and ours; the triumph of our Faith, the crown of our Victory.</p>
            <p>All that loneſome and tempeſtuous night muſt the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples wear out in danger and horrour, as given over to the winds and waves; but in the fourth watch of the night, when they were wearied out with toils and fears, comes deliverance.</p>
            <p>At their entrance into the ſhip, at the ariſing of the tempeſt, at the ſhutting in of the evening, there was no news of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but when they have been all the night long beaten, not ſo much with ſtorms and waves as with their own thoughts, now in the fourth watch (which was near to the morning) <hi>Jeſus</hi> came unto them, and purpoſely not till then; that he might exerciſe their patience; that he might inure them to wait upon Divine Providence in caſes of extremity; that their Devotions might be more whetted by delay; that they might give gladder welcome to their deliverance. O God, thus thou thinkeſt fit to doe ſtill. We are by turns in our ſea, the winds bluſter, the billows ſwell, the night and thy abſence heighten our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort: thy time and ours is ſet; as yet it is but midnight with us; can we but hold out patiently till the fourth watch, thou wilt ſurely come and reſcue us. Oh let us not faint under our ſorrows, but wear out our three wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of tribulation with undaunted patience and holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, our extremities are the ſeaſons of thine aid. Thou cameſt at laſt; but yet ſo, as that there was more dread then joy in thy preſence. Thy coming was both miraculous and frightfull.</p>
            <p>Thou God of Elements paſſedſt through the air, walkedſt upon the waters. Whether thou meanteſt to terminate this Miracle in thy Body, or in the waves which thou trodeſt upon, whether ſo lightning the one, that it ſhould make no impreſſion in the liquid waters, or whether ſo
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47750:113"/>
conſolidating the other, that the pavemented waves yielded a firm cauſey to thy ſacred feet to walk on, I neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine nor inquire; thy ſilence ruleth mine: thy power was in either miraculous; neither know I in whether to adore it more. But withall give me leave to wonder more at thy paſſage then at thy coming. Wherefore cameſt thou but to comfort them? and wherefore then wouldſt thou paſs by them, as if thou hadſt intended nothing but their diſmay? Thine abſence could not be ſo grievous as thy preterition: that might ſeem juſtly occaſioned, this could not but ſeem willingly neglective. Our laſt conflicts have wont ever to be the foreſt: as when after ſome dripping rain it pours down moſt vehemently, we think the weather is changing to ſerenity.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, we may not always meaſure thy meaning by thy ſemblance: ſometimes what thou moſt intendeſt, thou ſheweſt leaſt. In our Afflictions thou turneſt thy back upon us, and hideſt thy face from us, when thou moſt mindeſt our diſtreſſes. So <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſhot the arrows beyond <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> when he meant them to him. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> calls for <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> into bonds, when his heart was bound to him in the ſtrongeſt affection. So the tender mother makes as if ſhe would give away her crying child, whom ſhe hugs ſo much cloſer in her boſome.</p>
            <p>If thou paſs by us whilſt we are ſtruggling with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, we know it is not for want of mercy. Thou canſt not neglect us; O let not us diſtruſt thee.</p>
            <p>What Object ſhould have been ſo pleaſing to the eyes of the Diſciples as their Maſter; and ſo much the more as he ſhewed his Divine power in this miraculous walk? But lo, contrarily, <hi>they are troubled</hi>; not with his preſence, but with this form of preſence.</p>
            <p>The ſupernatural works of God, when we look upon them with our own eyes, are ſubject to a dangerous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion. The very Sun-beams to whom we are beholden for our ſight, if we eye them directly, blind us. Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47750:114"/>
men! we are ready to ſuſpect Truths, to run away from our ſafety, to be afraid of our comforts, to miſ-know our beſt friends.</p>
            <p>And why are they thus troubled? <hi>They had thought they had ſeen a Spirit.</hi> That there have been ſuch apparitions of Spirits, both good and evil, hath ever been a Truth undoubtedly received of Pagans, <hi>Jews,</hi> Chriſtians; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the blind times of Superſtition there was much colluſion mixed with ſome verities: Crafty men and lying ſpirits agreed to abuſe the credulous world. But even where there was not Truth, yet there was Horrour. The very Good Angels were not ſeen without much fear; their ſight was conſtrued to bode Death: how much more the Evil, which in their very nature are harmfull and pernicious? We ſee not a Snake or a Toad without ſome recoiling of bloud and ſenſible reluctation, although thoſe creatures run away from us: how much more muſt our hairs ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and our ſenſes boggle at the ſight of a Spirit, whoſe both nature and will is contrary to ours, and profeſſedly bent to our hurt?</p>
            <p>But ſay it had been what they miſtook it for, a Spirit; why ſhould they fear? Had they well conſidered, they had ſoon found that evil ſpirits are never the leſs preſent, when they are not ſeen; and never the leſs harmfull or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, when they are preſent unſeen. Viſibility adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their ſpite or miſchief. And could their eyes have been opened, they had, with <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, ſeen <hi>more with</hi> them <hi>then againſt</hi> them; a ſure, though inviſible, guard of more powerfull Spirits, and themſelves under the protection of the God of Spirits: ſo as they might have bidden a bold defiance to all the powers of darkneſs. But, partly their Faith was yet but in the bud; and partly the preſentation of this dreadfull Object was ſudden, and without the reſpite of a recollection and ſettlement of their thoughts.</p>
            <p>Oh the weakneſs of our frail Nature, who, in the want
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:47750:114"/>
of Faith, are affrighted with the viſible appearance of thoſe adverſaries whom we profeſs daily to reſiſt and vanquiſh, and with whom we know the Decree of God hath matched us in an everlaſting conflict! Are not theſe they that ejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Devils by their command? Are not theſe of them that could ſay, <hi>Maſter, the evil ſpirits are ſubdued to us?</hi> Yet now when they ſee but an imagined Spirit, they fear. What power there is in the eye to betray the heart!</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Goliah</hi> was mingled with the reſt of the <hi>Philiſtin</hi> hoaſt, <hi>Iſrael</hi> camped boldly againſt them; but when that Giant ſtalks out ſingle between the two armies, and fills and amazes their eyes with his hideous ſtature, now they run away for fear. Behold, we are committed with Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Evil ſpirits, and complain not: Let but one of them give us ſome viſible token of his preſence, we ſhreek and tremble, and are not our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Neither is our weakneſs more conſpicuous then thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O God, in reſtraining theſe ſpiritual enemies from theſe dreadfull and ghaſtly repreſentations of themſelves to our eyes. Might thoſe infernal Spirits have liberty to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how and when and to whom they would, certainly not many would be left in their wits, or in their lives. It is thy power and goodneſs to frail mankind that they are kept in their chains, and reſerved in the darkneſs of their own ſpiritual being, that we may both oppugn and ſubdue them unſeen.</p>
            <p>But oh the deplorable condition of reprobate ſouls! If but the imagined ſight of one of theſe ſpirits of darkneſs can ſo daunt the heart of thoſe which are free from their power, what a terrour ſhall it be to live perpetually in the ſight, yea under the torture, of thouſands, of legions, of millions of Devils? Oh the madneſs of wilfull ſinners, that will needs run themſelves headily into ſo dreadfull a damnation!</p>
            <p>It was high time for our Saviour to ſpeak: What with the Tempeſt, what with the Apparition, the Diſciples were
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:47750:115"/>
almoſt loſt with fear. How ſeaſonable are his gracious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes? Till they were thus affrighted, he would not ſpeak; when they were thus affrighted, he would not hold his peace. If his preſence were fearfull, yet his word was comfortable; <hi>Be of good chear, it is I:</hi> yea it is his word onely which muſt make his preſence both known and comfortable. He was preſent before; they miſtook him, and feared: there needs no other erection of their drooping hearts but, <hi>It is I.</hi> It is cordial enough to us in the worſt of our afflictions, to be aſſured of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with us. Say but, <hi>It is I,</hi> O Saviour, and let evils doe their worſt; thou needeſt not ſay any more. Thy voice was evidence enough; ſo well were the Diſciples ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the tongue of thee their Maſter, that, <hi>It is I,</hi> was as much as an hundred names. Thou art the good Shepherd; we are not of thy Flock, if we know thee not by thy voice from a thouſand. Even this one is a great word, yea an ample ſtyle, <hi>It is I.</hi> The ſame tongue that ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I am hath ſent thee,</hi> ſaith now to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>It is I</hi>; I your Lord and Maſter, I the Commander of winds and waters, I the ſoveraign Lord of Heaven and earth, I the God of Spirits. Let Heaven be but as one ſcroll, and let it be written all over with titles, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expreſs more then, <hi>It is I.</hi> Oh ſweet and ſeaſonable word of a gracious Saviour, able to calm all tempeſts, able to revive all hearts! Say but ſo to my Soul, and, in ſpight of Hell, I am ſafe.</p>
            <p>No ſooner hath <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>I,</hi> then <hi>Peter</hi> anſwers, <hi>Maſter.</hi> He can inſtantly name him that did not name himſelf. Every little hint is enough to Faith. The Church ſees her Beloved as well through the Lattice, as through the open Window. Which of all the Followers of <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave ſo pregnant teſtimonies upon all occaſions of his Faith, of his Love to his Maſter, as <hi>Peter?</hi> The reſt were ſilent, whilſt he both owned his Maſter, and craved acceſs to him in that liquid way. Yet what a ſenſible mixture
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47750:115"/>
is here of Faith and Diſtruſt? It is Faith that ſaid, <hi>Maſter</hi>; it was Diſtruſt (as ſome have conſtrued it) that ſaid, <hi>If it be thou.</hi> It was Faith that ſaid, <hi>Bid me come to thee</hi>; (implying that his word could as well enable as command;) it was Faith that durſt ſtep down upon that watery pavement: it was Diſtruſt that upon the ſight of a mighty wind feared. It was Faith, that he walked; it was Diſtruſt, that he ſunk; it was Faith that ſaid, <hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi> Oh the imperfect compoſition of the beſt Saint upon earth; as far from pure Faith, as from meer Infidelity! If there be pure earth in the center, all upward is mixed with the other ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: contrarily, pure Grace is above in the glorified Spirits; all below is mixed with infirmity, with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Our beſt is but as the Air; which never was, never can be at once fully enlightned: neither is there in the ſame Region one conſtant ſtate of light. It ſhall once be noon with us, when we ſhall have nothing but bright beams of Glory; now it is but the dawning, wherein it is hard to ſay whether there be more light then darkneſs. We are now fair as the Moon, which hath ſome ſpots in her greateſt beauty; we ſhall be pure as the Sun, whoſe face is all bright and glorious. Ever ſince the time that <hi>Adam</hi> ſet his tooth in the Apple, till our mouth be full of mould, it never was, it never can be other with us. Far be it from us to ſettle willingly upon the dregs of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity; far be it from us to be diſheartned with the ſenſe of our defects and imperfections: <hi>We believe; Lord, help our unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt I find ſome diſputing the lawfulneſs of <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſuit; others quarrelling his, <hi>If it be thou:</hi> let me be taken up with the wonder at the Faith, the fervour, the Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call valour of this prime Apoſtle, that durſt ſay, <hi>Bid me come to thee upon the waters.</hi> He might have ſuſpected that the Voice of his Maſter might have been as eaſily imitated by that imagined Spirit as his Perſon; he might have feared the bluſtering tempeſt, the threatning billows, the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47750:116"/>
yielding nature of that devouring element: but, as deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing all theſe thoughts of miſdoubt, ſuch is his deſire to be near his Maſter, that he ſays, <hi>Bid me come to thee upon the waters.</hi> He ſays not, <hi>Come thou to me:</hi> this had been <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s act, and not his. Neither doth he ſay, <hi>Let me come to thee:</hi> this had been his act, and not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s. Neither doth he ſay, <hi>Pray that I may come to thee,</hi> as if this act had been out of the power of either. But, <hi>Bid me come to thee.</hi> I know thou canſt command both the waves and me: me to be ſo light that I ſhall not bruiſe the moiſt ſurface of the waves; the waves to be ſo ſolid that they ſhall not yield to my weight. All things obey thee: <hi>Bid me come to thee upon the waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was a bold ſpirit that could wiſh it, more bold that could act it. No ſooner hath our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Come,</hi> then he ſets his foot upon the unquiet Sea; not fearing either the ſoftneſs or the roughneſs of that uncouth paſſage. We are wont to wonder at the courage of that daring man who firſt committed himſelf to the Sea in a frail Bark, though he had the ſtrength of an oaken planck to ſecure him: how valiant muſt we needs grant him to be, that durſt ſet his foot upon the bare ſea and ſhift his paces? Well did <hi>Peter</hi> know that he who bade him could uphold him; and therefore he both ſues to be bidden, and ventures to be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden. True Faith tasks it ſelf with difficulties; neither can it be diſmaied with the conceits of ordinary impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. It is not the ſcattering of ſtraws, or caſting of mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, whereby the virtue of it is deſcribed, but removing of mountains. Like ſome courageous Leader, it deſires the honour of a danger, and ſues for the firſt onſet: whereas the worldly heart freezes in a lazy or cowardly fear, and onely caſts for ſafety and eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> ſues, <hi>Jeſus</hi> bids. Rather will he work Miracles, then diſappoint the ſuit of a faithfull man. How eaſily might our Saviour have turned over this ſtrange requeſt of his bold Diſciple, and have ſaid, What my Omnipotence can
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:47750:116"/>
doe is no rule for thy Weakneſs: It is no leſs then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in a meer man, to hope to imitate the miraculous works of God and man. Stay thou in the ſhip, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; contenting thy ſelf in this, that thou haſt a Maſter to whom the land and water is alike. Yet I hear not a Check, but a Call; <hi>Come.</hi> The ſuit of Ambition is ſuddenly quaſhed in the Mother of the <hi>Zebedees.</hi> The ſuits of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge prove no better in the mouth of the two fiery Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples. But a ſuit of Faith, though high and ſeemingly unfit for us, he hath no power to deny. How much leſs, O Saviour, wilt thou ſtick at thoſe things which lie in the very road of our Chriſtianity? Never man ſaid, Bid me to come to thee in the way of thy commandments, whom thou didſt not both bid and inable to come.</p>
            <p>True Faith reſts not in great and good deſires, but acts and executes accordingly. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not wiſh to go, and yet ſtand ſtill: but his foot anſwers his tongue, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly chops down upon the waters. To ſit ſtill and wiſh, is for ſluggiſh and cowardly ſpirits.</p>
            <p>Formal volitions, yea velleities of good, whilſt we will not ſo much as ſtep out of the ſhip of our Nature to walk unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are but the faint motions of vain Hypocriſie. It will be long enough ere the gale of good wiſhes can carry us to our Heaven. <hi>Eaſe ſlayeth the fooliſh.</hi> O Saviour, we have thy command to come to thee out of the ſhip of our natural corruption: Let no Sea affray us, let no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of Temptation withhold us. No way can be but ſafe, when thou art the End.</p>
            <p>Lo, <hi>Peter</hi> is walking upon the waves: two hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him; the hand of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Power, the hand of his own Faith; neither of them would doe it alone. The hand of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Power laid hold on him; the hand of his Faith laid hold on the power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanding. Had not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s hand been powerfull, that Faith had been in vain: Had not that Faith of his ſtrongly fixed upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Power had not been effectual to his preſervation. Whilſt we
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47750:117"/>
are here in the world, we walk upon the waters; ſtill the ſame hands bear us up. If he let goe his hold of us, we drown; if we let goe our hold of him, we ſink and ſhreek as <hi>Peter</hi> did here, who, when he ſaw the wind boiſtrous, was afraid, and, <hi>beginning to ſink, cried, ſaying, Lord, ſave me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When he wiſht to be bidden to walk unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he thought of the waters; <hi>Bid me to come to thee on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:</hi> he thought not on the winds which raged on thoſe waters; or if he thought of a ſtiff gale, yet that tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſudden guſt was out of his account and expectation. Thoſe evils that we are prepared for, have not ſuch power over us as thoſe that ſurpriſe us. A good water-man ſees a dangerous billow coming towards him, and cuts it, and mounts over it with eaſe; the unheedy is overwhelmed. O Saviour, let my haſte to thee be zealous, but not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; ere I ſet my foot out of the ſhip, let me foreſee the Tempeſt: when I have caſt the worſt, I cannot either miſcarry or complain.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as he began to fear, he began to ſink: whilſt he believed, the Sea was braſs; when once he began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt, thoſe waves were water. He cannot ſink, whilſt he truſts the power of his Maſter; he cannot but ſink when he miſdoubts it. Our Faith gives us, as courage and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo ſucceſs too: our Infidelity lays us open to all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to all miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Peter</hi>'s improvidence not to foreſee; it was his weakneſs to fear; it was the effect of his fear to ſink: it was his Faith that recollects it ſelf, and breaks through his Infidelity, and in ſinking could ſay, <hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi> His foot could not be ſo ſwift in ſinking, as his heart in implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: he knew who could uphold him from ſinking, and being ſunk deliver him; and therefore he ſays, <hi>Lord, ſave me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a notable both ſign and effect of true Faith, in ſudden extremities to ejaculate holy deſires; and with the wings of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:47750:117"/>
our firſt thoughts to fly up inſtantly to the throne of Grace for preſent ſuccour. Upon deliberation it is poſſible for a man that hath been careleſs and profane, by good means to be drawn to holy diſpoſitions: but on the ſudden a man will appear as he is; what-ever is moſt rife in the heart will come forth at the mouth. It is good to obſerve how our ſurpriſals find us: the reſt is but forced; this is natural. <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, no evil can be ſwifter then my thought: my thought ſhall be upon thee, ere I can be ſeized upon by the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt miſchief: at leaſt, if I over-run not evils, I ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Lord whom <hi>Peter</hi> had offended in diſtruſting; it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> his Lord to whom he ſues for deliverance. His weakneſs doth not diſcourage him from his refuge. O God, when we have diſpleaſed thee, when we have ſunk in thy diſpleaſure, whither ſhould we fly for aid but to thee whom we have provoked? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee onely is our ſin; in thee onely is our help. In vain ſhall all the powers of Heaven and Earth conſpire to relieve us, if thou withhold from our ſuccour. As we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thy Juſtice daily by our ſins, ſo let us continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon thy Mercy by the ſtrength of our Faith. <hi>Lord, ſave us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The mercy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is at once ſought and found; <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Jeſus ſtretched forth his hand, and caught him.</hi> He doth not ſay, Hadſt thou truſted me, I would have ſafely preſerved thee; but ſince thou wilt needs wrong my power and care with a cowardly diffidence, ſink and drown: but rather, as pitying the infirmity of his fearfull Diſciple, he puts out the hand for his relief. That hand hath been ſtretch'd forth for the aid of many a one that hath never ask'd it; never any ask'd it, to whoſe ſuccour it hath not been ſtretched. With what ſpeed, with what confidence ſhould we fly to that ſovereign bounty, from which never any ſuitour was ſent away empty?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:47750:118"/>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> gave <hi>Peter</hi> his hand; but withall he gave him a check: <hi>O thou of little faith, why doubtedſt thou?</hi> As <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith was not pure, but mixed with ſome diſtruſt; ſo our Saviour's help was not clear and abſolute, but mixed with ſome reproof. A reproof, wherein there was both a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and an expoſtulation; a cenſure of his Faith, an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation for his Doubt: both of them ſore and heavy.</p>
            <p>By how much more excellent and uſefull a grace Faith is, by ſo much more ſhamefull is the defect of it; and by how much more reaſon here was of confidence, by ſo much more blame-worthy was the Doubt. Now <hi>Peter</hi> had a double reaſon of his confidence; the command of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the one in bidding him to come; the other in ſuſtaining him whilſt he came. To miſdoubt him whoſe will he knew, whoſe power he felt, was well worth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
            <p>When I ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> ſtepping forth upon the waters, I could not but wonder at his great Faith; yet behold, ere he can have meaſured many paces, the Judge of hearts taxes him for little Faith. Our mountains are but moats to God. Would my heart have ſerved me to dare the doing of this that <hi>Peter</hi> did? Durſt I have ſet my foot where he did? O Saviour, if thou foundeſt cauſe to cenſure the weakneſs and poverty of his Faith, what mayeſt thou well ſay to mine? They miſtake that think thou wilt take up with any thing. Thou lookeſt for firmitude and vigour in thoſe Graces which thou wilt allow in thy beſt Diſciples, no leſs then truth.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſteps were confident, there was fear in the next. Oh the ſudden alteration of our affections, of our diſpoſitions! One pace varies our ſpiritual condition. What hold is there of ſo fickle creatures, if we be left never ſo little to our ſelves? As this lower world wherein we are is the region of mutability; ſo are we (the living pieces of it) ſubject to a perpetual change. It is for the bleſſed Saints and Angels above to be fixed in good: Whilſt we
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:47750:118"/>
are here, there can be no conſtancy expected from us, but in variableneſs.</p>
            <p>As well as our Saviour loves <hi>Peter,</hi> yet he chides him. It is the fruit of his favour and mercy that we eſcape judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not that we eſcape reproof. Had not <hi>Peter</hi> found grace with his Maſter, he had been ſuffered to ſink in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; now he is ſaved with a check. There may be more love in frowns then in ſmiles: <hi>Whom he loves he chaſtiſes.</hi> What is chiding but a verbal caſtigation? and what is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement but a real chiding? <hi>Correct me, O Lord,</hi> yet <hi>in thy judgment, not in thy fury. O let the righteous</hi> God <hi>ſmite me</hi> (when I offend) with his gracious reproofs; theſe <hi>ſhall be a precious oyl that ſhall not break my head.</hi>

his hope lived; her death diſheartned it. It was a great work that thou meanteſt to doe for him; it was a great word that thou ſaidſt to him, <hi>Fear not; believe, and ſhe ſhall be made whole.</hi> To make this good, by the touch of the verge of thy garment thou revivedſt one from the verge of death. How muſt <hi>Jairus</hi> needs now think, He who by the virtue of his garment can pull this woman out of the paws of death which hath been twelve years dying, can as well by the power of his word pull my daughter (who hath been twelve years living) out of the jaws of death which hath newly ſeized on her? It was fit the good Ruler ſhould be raiſed up with this handſell of thy Divine power, whom he came to ſolicit.</p>
            <p>That thou mighteſt loſe no time, thou curedſt in thy paſſage. The Sun ſtands not ſtill to give his influences, but diffuſes them in his ordinary motion.

            <p>The Patient laboured of an Iſſue of bloud; a Diſeaſe that had not more pain then ſhame, nor more natural infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity then Legal impurity. Time added to her grief; twelve long years had ſhe languiſhed under this wofull complaint. Beſides the tediouſneſs, diſeaſes muſt needs get head by continuance; and ſo much more both weaken Nature and ſtrengthen themſelves, by how much longer they afflict us. So it is in the Soul, ſo in the State; Vices, which are the Sickneſſes of both, when they grow inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, have a ſtrong plea for their abode and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lableneſs.</p>

            <p>Yet had the coſt and pain been never ſo great, could ſhe have hereby purchaſed health, the match had been happy; all the world were no price for this commodity: but alas! her eſtate was the worſe, her body not the better; her money was waſted, not her diſeaſe. Art could give her neither cure nor hope. It were injurious to blame that noble Science, for that it always ſpeeds not. Notwithſtanding all thoſe ſovereign remedies, men muſt (in their times) ſicken and die. Even the miraculous Gifts of healing could not preſerve the owners from diſeaſe and diſſolution.</p>
            <p>It were pity but that this woman ſhould have been thus ſick; the nature, the durableneſs, coſt, pain, incurableneſs of her diſeaſe both ſent her to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and moved <hi>Chriſt</hi> to her cure. Our extremities drive us to our Saviour; his love draws him to be moſt preſent and helpfull to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities. When we are forſaken of all ſuccours and hopes, we are fitteſt for his redreſs. Never are we nearer to help, then when we deſpair of help. There is no fear, no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but in our own inſenſibleneſs.</p>
            <p>This woman was a ſtranger to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; it ſeems ſhe had never ſeen him. The report of his Miracles had lifted her up to ſuch a confidence of his power and mercy, as that ſhe ſaid in her ſelf, <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I ſhall be whole.</hi> The ſhame of her Diſeaſe ſtopt her mouth from any verbal ſuit. Had ſhe been acknown of her infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſhe had been ſhunned and abhorred, and diſdainfully put
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:47750:120"/>
back of all the beholders, (as doubtleſs where ſhe was known, the Law forced her to live apart.) Now ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals both her grief, and her deſire, and her Faith; and onely ſpeaks (where ſhe may be bold) within her ſelf: <hi>If I may but touch the hem of his garment, I ſhall be whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſeek not myſteries in the virtue of the hem rather then of the garment. Indeed, it was God's command to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they ſhould be marked, not onely in their skin, but in their cloaths too: thoſe fringes and ribbands upon the borders of their garments were for holy memorials of their duty, and God's Law. But that hence ſhe ſuppoſed to find more virtue and ſanctity in the touch of the hem then of the coat, I neither diſpute nor believe. It was the ſite, not the ſignification, that ſhe intimated; not as of the beſt part, but the utmoſt. In all likelihood, if there could have been virtue in the garment, the nearer to the body, the more. Here was then the praiſe of this woman's Faith, that ſhe promiſeth her ſelf cure by the touch of the utmoſt hem. Whoſoever would look to receive any benefit from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt come in Faith: It is that onely which makes us capable of any favour. Satan, the common ape of the Almighty, imitates him alſo in this point: All his charms and ſpells are ineffectual without the Faith of the uſer, of the receiver.</p>
            <p>Yea the endeavour and iſſue of all, both humane and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, things depends upon our Faith. Who would commit a plant or a ſeed to the earth, if he did not believe to have it nurſed in that kindly boſome? What Merchant would put himſelf upon the guard of an inch-board in a furious Sea, if he did not truſt to the faithfull cuſtody of that planck? Who would trade, or travell, or war, or marry, if he did not therein ſurely truſt he ſhould ſpeed well? What bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit can we look to carry from a Divine exhortation, if we do not believe it will edify us? from a Sacramental ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, (the food of Angels) if we do not believe it will nouriſh our Souls? from our beſt Devotions, if we do
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47750:120"/>
not perſwade our ſelves they will fetch down bleſſings? Oh our vain and heartleſs ſervices, if we do not ſay, May I drink but one drop of that heavenly Nectar, may I taſt but one crum of that Bread of life, may I hear but one word from the mouth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may I ſend up but one hearty ſigh or ejaculation of an holy deſire to my God, I ſhall be whole!</p>
            <p>According to her reſolution is her practice. She tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but <hi>ſhe came behind</hi> to <hi>touch</hi>; whether for humility, or her ſecrecy rather, as deſiring to ſteal a cure unſeen, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted. She was a <hi>Jeweſs,</hi> and therefore well knew that her touch was (in this caſe) no better then a pollution; as hers, perhaps, but not of him. For on the one ſide, Neceſſity is under no poſitive law; on the other, the Son of God was not capable of impurity. Thoſe may be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a touch that cannot heal with a touch: he that was above Law is not compriſed in the Law. Be we never ſo unclean, he may heal us; we cannot infect him. O Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, my Soul is ſick and foul enough with the Spirituall impurities of ſin: let me by the hand of Faith lay hold but upon the hem of thy garment, (thy Righteouſneſs is thy garment) it ſhall be both clean and whole.</p>
            <p>Who would not think but a man might lade up a diſh of water out of the Sea unmiſſed? Yet that water (though much) is finite; thoſe drops are within number: that Art which hath reckoned how many corns of ſand would make up a World, could more eaſily compute how many drops of water would make up an Ocean. Whereas the mercies of God are abſolutely infinite, and beyond all poſſibility of proportion: And yet this baſhfull ſoul cannot ſteal one drop of mercy from this endleſs, boundleſs, bottomleſs Sea of Divine bounty, but it is felt and queſtioned. <hi>And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid, Who touched me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who can now ſay that he is a poor man that reckons his ſtore, when that God, who is rich in mercy, doth ſo? He knows all his own Bleſſings, and keeps juſt tallies of our
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:47750:121"/>
receits; delivered ſo much Honour to this man, to that ſo much Wealth; ſo much Knowledge to one, to another ſo much Strength. How carefully frugal ſhould we be in the notice, account, uſage of God's ſeveral favours, ſince his bounty ſets all his gifts upon the file? Even the worſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in the Goſpel confeſt his Talents, though he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them not. We are worſe then the worſt, if either we misknow, or diſſemble, or forget them.</p>
            <p>Who now can forbear the Diſciples reply? Who touched thee, O Lord? the multitude. Doſt thou ask of one; when thou art preſſed by many? In the midſt of a throng, doſt thou ask, <hi>Who touched me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea but yet <hi>ſome one touched me:</hi> All thronged me; but one touched me. How riddle-like ſoever it may ſeem to ſound, they that thronged me touched me not; ſhe onely touched me that thronged me not, yea that touched me not. Even ſo, O Saviour, others touched thy body with theirs; ſhe touched thy hem with her hand, thy Divine power with her Soul.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two parts whereof we conſiſt (the bodily, the ſpiritual) do in a ſort partake of each other. The Soul is the Man, and hath thoſe parts, ſenſes, actions which are challenged as proper to the Body. This ſpiritual part hath both an hand, and a touch; it is by the hand of Faith that the Soul toucheth: yea this alone both is, and acts all the ſpiritual ſenſes of that immaterial and Divine part; this ſees, hears, taſteth, toucheth God; and without this the Soul doeth none of theſe. All the multitude then preſſed <hi>Chriſt:</hi> he took not that for a touch, ſince Faith was away; onely ſhe touched him that believed to receive virtue by his touch. Outward faſhionableneſs comes into no account with God; that is onely done which the Soul doeth. It is no hoping that virtue ſhould go forth from <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us, when no hearty deſires go forth from us to him. He that is a Spirit, looks to the deportment of that part which reſembleth himſelf: as without it the body is dead,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:47750:121"/>
ſo without the actions thereof bodily Devotions are but carkaſſes.</p>
            <p>What reaſon had our Saviour to challenge this touch? <hi>Some body touch'd me.</hi> The multitude (in one extreme) denied any touch at all: <hi>Peter</hi> (in another extreme) affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an over-touching of the multitude. Betwixt both, he who felt it can ſay, <hi>Some body touched me.</hi> Not <hi>all,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi>; not <hi>none,</hi> as the multitude; but <hi>ſome body.</hi> How then, O Saviour, how doth it appear that ſome body touch'd thee? <hi>For I perceive virtue is gone out from me.</hi> The effect proves the act; virtue gone out evinces the touch. Theſe two are in thee convertible: virtue cannot go out of thee but by a touch; and no touch can be of thee without virtue going out from thee. That which is a Rule in Nature, That every Agent works by a contact, holds ſpiritually too: Then doſt thou, O God, work upon our Souls, when thou toucheſt our hearts by thy Spirit; then do we re-act upon thee, when we touch thee by the hand of our Faith and confidence in thee: and in both theſe virtue goes out from thee to us. Yet goes not ſo out, as that there is leſs in thee. In all bodily emanations, whoſe powers are but finite, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that the more is ſent forth, the leſs is reſerved: but as it is in the Sun, which gives us light, yet loſeth none ever the more, (the luminoſity of it being no whit impaired by that perpetual emiſſion of lightſome beams;) ſo much more is it in thee, the Father of lights. Virtue could not go out of thee without thy knowledge, without thy ſending. Neither was it in a diſlike, or in a grudging exprobration, that thou ſaidſt, <hi>Virtue is gone out from me.</hi> Nothing could pleaſe thee better, then to feel virtue fetch'd out from thee by the Faith of the receiver. It is the nature and praiſe of good to be communicative: none of us would be other then liberal of our little, if we did not fear it would be leſſened by imparting. Thou that knoweſt thy ſtore ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, that participation doth onely glorifie and not diminiſh it, canſt not but be more willing to give then we to receive.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:47750:122"/>
If we take but one drop of water from the Sea, or one corn of ſand from the ſhore, there is ſo much (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly) leſs: but were we capable of Worlds of virtue and benediction from that munificent hand, our inriching could no whit impoveriſh thee. Thou which wert wont to hold it much <hi>better to give then to receive,</hi> canſt not but give gladly. Fear not, O my Soul, to lade plentifully at this Well, this Ocean of Mercy, which, the more thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, overflows the more.</p>
            <p>But why then, O Saviour, why didſt thou thus inquire, thus expoſtulate? Was it for thy own ſake; that the glory of the Miracle might thus come to light, which otherwiſe had been ſmothered in ſilence? Was it for <hi>Jairus</hi> his ſake; that his depreſſed heart might be raiſed to a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in thee, whoſe mighty Power he ſaw proved by this Cure, whoſe Omniſcience he ſaw proved by the knowledge of the Cure? Or was it chiefly for the Woman's ſake; for the praiſe of her Faith, for the ſecuring of her Conſcience?</p>
            <p>It was within her ſelf that ſhe ſaid, <hi>If I may but touch:</hi> none could hear this voice of the heart, but he that made it. It was within her ſelf that the Cure was wrought: none of the beholders knew her complaint, much leſs her reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; none noted her touch, none knew the occaſion of her touch. What a pattern of powerfull Faith had we loſt, if our Saviour had not called this act to triall? As her modeſty hid her diſeaſe, ſo it would have hid her vertue. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will not ſuffer this ſecrecy. Oh the marvellous, but free, diſpenſation of <hi>Chriſt!</hi> One while he injoyns a ſilence to his cured Patients, and is troubled with their divulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his favour; another while (as here) he will not loſe the honour of a ſecret mercy, but fetches it out by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, by his profeſſion; <hi>Who hath touched me? for I perceive virtue is gone out from me.</hi> As we ſee in the great work of his Creation, he hath placed ſome Stars in the midſt of Heaven, where they may be moſt conſpicuous; others he hath ſet in the Southern obſcurity, obvious to but few eyes:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47750:122"/>
in the Earth, he hath planted ſome flowers and trees in the famous gardens of the World; others, no leſs beautifull, in untracked Woods or wild Deſarts, where they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not ſeen, or not regarded.</p>
            <p>O God, if thou have intended to glorifie thy ſelf by thy Graces in us, thou wilt find means to fetch them forth into the notice of the World; otherwiſe our very privacy ſhall content us, and praiſe thee.</p>
            <p>Yet even this great Faith wanted not ſome weakneſs. It was a poor conceit in this Woman, that ſhe thought ſhe might receive ſo ſovereign a remedy from <hi>Chriſt</hi> without his heed, without his knowledge. Now that ſhe might ſee ſhe had truſted to a power which was not more bountifull then ſenſible, and whoſe goodneſs did not exceed his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, but one that knew what he parted with, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly parted with that which he knew beneficial to ſo faithfull a receiver, he can ſay, <hi>Some body hath touched me, for I perceive virtue is gone out from me.</hi> As there was an errour in her thought, ſo in our Saviour's words there was a correction. His mercy will not let her run away with that ſecret offence. It is a great favour of God to take us in the manner, and to ſhame our cloſeneſs. We ſcour off the ruſt from a Weapon that we eſteem, and prune the Vine we care for. O God, do thou ever find me out in my Sin; and do not paſs over my leaſt infirmities without a feeling controlment.</p>
            <p>Neither doubt I but that herein, O Saviour, thou didſt graciouſly forecaſt the ſecuring of the Conſcience of this faithfull (though over-ſeen) Patient; which might well have afterwards raiſed ſome juſt ſcruples, for the filching of a Cure, for Unthahkfulneſs to the Authour of her Cure; the continuance whereof ſhe might have good reaſon to miſdoubt, being ſurreptitiouſly gotten, ingratefully concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. For prevention of all theſe dangers, and the full quieting of her troubled heart, how fitly, how mercifully didſt thou bring forth this cloſe buſineſs to the light, and clear it to the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:47750:123"/>
bottom? It is thy great mercy to foreſee our perils, and to remove them ere we can apprehend the fear of them: as ſome skilfull Phyſician, who perceiving a Fever or Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy coming, which the diſtempered Patient little miſdoubts, by ſeaſonable applications anticipates that grievous malady; ſo as the ſick man knows his ſafety ere he can ſuſpect his danger.</p>
            <p>Well might the Woman think, He who can thus cure, and thus know his cure, can as well know my name, and deſcry my perſon, and ſhame and puniſh my ingratitude. With a pale face therefore and a trembling foot ſhe comes, and falls down before him, and humbly acknowledges what ſhe had done, what ſhe had obtained. <hi>But the Woman, finding ſhe was not hid,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Could ſhe have perceived that ſhe might have ſlily gone away with the Cure, ſhe had not confeſſed it: So had ſhe made God a loſer of Glory, and her ſelf an unthankfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of ſo great a Benefit.</p>
            <p>Might we have our own wills, we ſhould be injurious both to God and our ſelves. Nature lays ſuch plots as would be ſure to befool us; and is witty in nothing but deceiving her ſelf. The onely way to bring us home, is to find we are found, and to be convinced of the diſcovery of all our evaſions: As ſome unskilfull Thief, that finds the owner's eye was upon him in his pilfering, laies down his ſtoln commodity with ſhame. Contrarily, when a man is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a conceit of ſecrecy and cleanly eſcape, he is emboldened in his leudneſs. The Adulterer chuſes the twilight, and ſays, <hi>No eye ſhall ſee me</hi>; and joys in the ſweetneſs of his ſtoln waters. O God, in the deepeſt dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in my moſt inward retiredneſs, when none ſees me, when I ſee not my ſelf, yet let me then ſee thine all-ſeeing eye upon me: and if ever mine eyes ſhall be ſhut, or held with a prevailing Temptation, check me with a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, that, with this abaſhed Patient, I may come in, and confeſs my errour, and implore thy mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:47750:123"/>It is no unuſual thing for kindneſs to look ſternly for the time, that it may indear it ſelf more when it liſts to be diſcovered. With a ſevere countenance did our Saviour look about him, and ask, <hi>Who touched me?</hi> When the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comes in trembling, and confeſſing both her act and ſucceſs, he clears up his brows, and ſpeaks comfortably to her; <hi>Daughter, be of good chear, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.</hi> O ſweet and ſeaſonable word, fit for thoſe mercifull and Divine lips; able to ſecure any heart, to diſpell any fears! Still, O Saviour, thou doeſt thus to us: when we fall down before thee in an awfull dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs, thou reareſt us up with a chearfull and compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate incouragement; when thou findeſt us bold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, thou loveſt to take us down; when humbled, it is enough to have proſtrated us. Like as that Lion of <hi>Bethel</hi> worries the diſobedient Prophet, guards the poor Aſs that ſtood quaking before him: Or like ſome mighty wind, that bears over a tall Elme or Cedar with the ſame breath that it raiſeth a ſtooping Reed: Or like ſome good Phyſician, who, finding the body obſtructed and ſurchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ill humours, evacuates it, and when it is ſufficiently pulled down, raiſes it up with ſovereign Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials.</p>
            <p>And ſtill doe thou ſo to my Soul; if at any time thou perceiveſt me ſtiff and rebellious, ready to face out my ſin againſt thee, ſpare me not; let me ſmart, till I relent. But <hi>a broken and contrite heart thou wilt not, O Lord,</hi> O Lord, do not <hi>reject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is onely thy Word which gives what it requires, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and confidence. Had any other ſhaken her by the ſhoulder, and cheared her up againſt thoſe oppreſſive paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, it had been but waſte wind. No voice but his who hath power to remit ſin can ſecure the heart from the conſcience of ſin, from the pangs of Conſcience. <hi>In the midſt of the ſorrows of my heart, thy comforts, O Lord,</hi> thy comforts onely have power to <hi>refreſh my ſoul.</hi> Her cure was
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:47750:124"/>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s act, yet he gives the praiſe of it to her; <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi> He had ſaid before, <hi>Virtue is gone out from me</hi>; now he acknowledges a virtue inherent in her. It was his virtue that cured her, yet he graciouſly caſts this work upon her Faith. Not that her Faith did it by way of merit, by way of efficiency, but by way of impetration. So much did our Saviour regard that Faith which he had wrought in her, that he will honour it with the ſucceſs of her Cure. Such and the ſame is ſtill the remedy of our ſpiritual diſeaſes, our ſins. <hi>By faith we are juſtified, by faith we are ſaved.</hi> Thou onely, O Saviour, canſt heal us; thou wilt not heal us but by our Faith: not as it iſſues from us, but as it appropriates thee. The ſickneſs is ours, the remedy is ours: the ſickneſs is our own by nature, the remedy ours by thy grace both working and accepting it. Our Faith is no leſs from thee then thy Cure is from our Faith.</p>
            <p>O happy diſmiſſion, <hi>Go in peace!</hi> How unquiet had this poor Soul formerly been? She had no outward peace with her Neighbours; they ſhunned and abhorred her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in this condition; yea they muſt doe ſo. She had no peace in Body; that was pained and vexed with ſo long and foul a diſeaſe. Much leſs had ſhe peace in her Mind, which was grievouſly diſquieted with ſorrow for her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with anger and diſcontentment at her torturing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, with fear of the continuance of ſo bad a gueſt. Her Soul (for the preſent) had no peace, from the ſenſe of her guiltineſs in the carriage of this buſineſs; from the conceived diſpleaſure of him to whom ſhe came for comfort and redreſs. At once now doth our Saviour calm all theſe ſtorms; and in one word and act reſtores to her peace with her Neighbours, peace in her Self; peace in Body, in Mind, in Soul. <hi>Goe in peace.</hi> Even ſo, Lord, it was for thee one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who art the Prince of Peace, to beſtow thy peace where thou pleaſeſt. Our body, mind, Soul, eſtate is thine, whether to afflict, or eaſe. It is a wonder if all of us do not ail ſomewhat. In vain ſhall we ſpeak peace to our

            <p>HOW troubleſome did the people's importunity ſeem to <hi>Jairus?</hi> That great man came to ſue unto <hi>Jeſus</hi> for his dying Daughter; the throng of the multitude in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted him. Every man is moſt ſenſible of his own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. It is no ſtraining courteſy in the challenge of our intereſt in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> there is no unmannerlineſs in our ſtrife for the greateſt ſhare in his preſence and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>That onely Child of this Ruler lay a dying when he came to ſolicit <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s aid, and was dead whilſt he ſolicited it. There was hope in her ſickneſs; in her extremity there was fear; in her death deſpair and impoſſibility (as they thought) of help. <hi>Thy daughter is dead, trouble not the Maſter.</hi> When we have to doe with a mere finite power, this word were but juſt. He was a Prophet no leſs then a King that ſaid, <hi>Whilſt the child was yet alive, I faſted and wept; for I ſaid, Who can tell whether God will be gracious to me that the child may live? But now he is dead, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould I faſt? Can I bring him back again? I ſhall goe to him, but he ſhall not return to me.</hi> But ſince thou haſt to doe with an omnipotent agent, know now, O thou faithleſs meſſenger, that death can be no bar to his power. How well would it have become thee to have ſaid, <hi>Thy daughter is dead</hi>; but who can tell whether thy
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47750:125"/>
God and Saviour will not be gracious to thee that the child may revive? Cannot he, in whoſe hands are the iſſues of death, bring her back again?</p>
            <p>Here were more Manners then Faith; <hi>Trouble not the Maſter.</hi> Infidelity is all for eaſe, and thinks every good work tedious. That which Nature accounts troubleſome, is pleaſing and delightfull to Grace. Is it any pain for an hungry man to eat? O Saviour, it was thy <hi>meat and drink to doe</hi> thy <hi>Father's will</hi>; and his will was that thou ſhouldſt bear our griefs and take away our ſorrows. It cannot be thy trouble which is our happineſs, that we may ſtill ſue to thee.</p>
            <p>The meſſenger could not ſo whiſper his ill news, but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> heard it. <hi>Jairus</hi> hears that he feared, and was now heartleſs with ſo ſad tidings. He that reſolved not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Maſter, meant to take ſo much more trouble to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and would now yield to a hopeleſs ſorrow. He whoſe work it is to comfort the afflicted, rouzeth up the dejected heart of that penſive father; <hi>Fear not, believe onely, and ſhe ſhall be made whole.</hi> The word was not more chearfull then difficult. <hi>Fear not?</hi> Who can be inſenſible of ſo great an evil? Where death hath once ſeized, who can but doubt he will keep his hold? No leſs hard was it not to grieve for the loſs of an onely Child, then not to fear the continuance of the cauſe of that grief.</p>
            <p>In a perfect Faith there is no Fear: by how much more we fear, by ſo much leſs we believe. Well are theſe two then coupled, <hi>Fear not, believe onely.</hi> O Saviour, if thou didſt not command us ſomewhat beyond Nature, it were no thank to us to obey thee. While the Child was alive, to believe that it might recover, it was no hard task; but now that ſhe was fully dead, to believe ſhe ſhould live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, was a work not eaſy for <hi>Jairus</hi> to apprehend, though eaſy for thee to effect: yet muſt that be believed, elſe there is no capacity of ſo great a Mercy. As <hi>Love,</hi> ſo Faith <hi>is ſtronger then death</hi>; making thoſe bonds no other

then (as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did his withes) like threds of tow. How much natural impoſſibility is there in the return of theſe Bodies from the duſt of their Earth, into which through many degrees of corruption they are at the laſt mouldred? Fear not, O my Soul; believe onely: it muſt, it ſhall be done.</p>
            <p>The ſum of <hi>Jairus</hi> his firſt ſuit was for the Health, not for the Reſuſcitation of his Daughter: now that ſhe was dead, he would, if he durſt, have been glad to have asked her Life. And now, behold, our Saviour bids him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect both her Life and her Health; <hi>Thy daughter ſhall be made whole:</hi> alive from her death, whole from her diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Thou didſt not, O <hi>Jairus,</hi> thou daredſt not ask ſo much as thou receiveſt. How glad wouldſt thou have been, ſince this laſt news, to have had thy Daughter alive, though weak and ſickly? Now thou ſhalt receive her not living onely, but ſound and vigorous. Thou doſt not, O Saviour, meaſure thy gifts by our petitions, but by our wants and thine own mercies.</p>
            <p>This work might have been as eaſily done by an abſent command; the Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was there whilſt himſelf was away: but he will go perſonally to the place, that he might be confeſſed the Authour of ſo great a Miracle. O Saviour, thou loveſt to go to the houſe of mourning; thy chief pleaſure is the comfort of the afflicted. What a confuſion there is in worldly ſorrow? The mother ſhreeks, the ſervants cry out, the people make lamentation, the minſtrells howl and ſtrike dolefully, ſo as the ear might queſtion whether the Ditty or the Inſtrument were more heavy. If ever expreſſions of ſorrow ſound well, it is when Death leads the quire. Soon doth our Saviour charm this noiſe, and turns theſe unſeaſonable mourners (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formal or ſerious) out of doors. Not that he diſlikes Muſick, whether to condole or comfort; but that he had life in his eye, and would have them know that he held
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:47750:126"/>
theſe Funeral ceremonies to be too early and long before their time. <hi>Give place, for the maid is not dead, but ſleepeth.</hi> Had ſhe been dead, ſhe had but ſlept; now ſhe was not dead, but aſleep, becauſe he meant this nap of death ſhould be ſo ſhort, and her awakening ſo ſpeedy. Death and Sleep are alike to him, who can caſt whom he will into the ſleep of Death, and awake when and whom he pleaſeth out of that deadly ſleep.</p>
            <p>Before the people and domeſticks of <hi>Jairus</hi> held <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> for a Prophet; now they took him for a Dreamer. <hi>Not dead, but aſleep?</hi> They that came to mourn can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now forbear to laugh. Have we piped at ſo many Funerals, and ſeen and lamented ſo many Corpſes, and cannot we diſtinguiſh betwixt Sleep and Death? The eyes are ſet, the breath is gone, the lims are ſtiff and cold. Who ever died, if ſhe do but ſleep? How ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily may our Reaſon or Senſe befool us in Divine mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Thoſe that are competent Judges in natural things, are ready to laugh God to ſcorn when he ſpeaks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their compaſs; and are by him juſtly laughed to ſcorn for their unbelief. Vain and faithleſs men! as if that unlimited power of the Almighty could not make good his own word; and turn either Sleep into Death, or Death into Sleep, at pleaſure. Ere many minutes they ſhall be aſhamed of their errour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity.</p>
            <p>There were witneſſes enough of her death, there ſhall not be many of her reſtoring. Three choice Diſciples and the two Parents are onely admitted to the view and teſtimony of this miraculous work. The eyes of thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous ſcoffers were not worthy of this honour. Our infidelity makes us incapable of the ſecret favours and the higheſt counſels of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>What did theſe ſcorners think and ſay, when they ſaw him putting the minſtrels and people out of doors? Doubtleſs the maid is but aſleep; the man fears leſt the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:47750:126"/>
noiſe ſhall awake her; we muſt ſpeak and tread ſoftly that we diſquiet her not: What will he and his Diſciples doe the while? Is it not to be feared they will ſtartle her out of her reſt? Thoſe that are ſhut out from the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of God's counſells, think all his words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects no better then fooliſhneſs. But art thou, O Saviour, ever the more diſcouraged by the deriſion and cenſure of theſe ſcornfull unbelievers? Becauſe fools jear thee, doſt thou forbear thy work? Surely I do not perceive that thou heedeſt them, ſave for contempt; or careſt more for their words then their ſilence. It is enough that thine act ſhall ſoon honour thee, and convince them. <hi>He took her by the hand, and called, ſaying, Maid, ariſe; and her ſpirit came again, and ſhe aroſe ſtraightway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How could that touch, that Call be other then effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual? He who made that hand, touched it; and he who ſhall once ſay, <hi>Ariſe, ye dead,</hi> ſaid now, <hi>Maid, ariſe.</hi> Death cannot but obey him who is the Lord of life. The Soul is ever equally in his hand who is the God of Spirits: it cannot but go and come at his command. When he ſays, <hi>Maid, ariſe,</hi> the now-diſſolved ſpirit knows his office, his place, and inſtantly re-aſſumes that room which by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment it had left.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, if thou do but bid my Soul to ariſe from the death of Sin, it cannot lie ſtill; if thou bid my Body to ariſe from the grave, my Soul cannot but glance down from her Heaven, and animate it. In vain ſhall my ſin or my grave offer to withhold me from thee.</p>
            <p>The Maid revives: not now to languiſh for a time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her ſick-bed, and by ſome faint degrees to gather an inſenſible ſtrength; but at once ſhe ariſes from her death and from her couch; at once ſhe puts off her fever with her diſſolution; ſhe finds her life and her feet at once; at once ſhe finds her feet and her ſtomack. <hi>He commanded to give her meat.</hi> Omnipotency doth not uſe to go the pace of Nature. All God's immediate works are (like
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47750:127"/>
himſelf) perfect. He that raiſed her ſupernaturally, could have ſo fed her. It was never the purpoſe of his Power, to put ordinary Means out of office.</p>

            <head>XXVI. The Motion of the two fiery Diſciples repelled.</head>
            <p>THE time drew now on wherein <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up. He muſt take death in his way. <hi>Calvary</hi> is in his paſſage to mount <hi>Olivet.</hi> He muſt be lift up to the Croſs, thence to climb into his Heaven. Yet this comes not into mention; as if all the thought of <hi>Death</hi> were <hi>ſwallowed up in</hi> this <hi>Victory</hi> over Death. Neither, O Saviour, is it otherwiſe with us, the weak members of thy myſtical body: We muſt die, we ſhall be glorified. What if Death ſtand before us? we look beyond him at that tranſcendent Glory. How ſhould we be diſmay'd with that pain which is attended with a bleſſed Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality?</p>
            <p>The ſtrongeſt receit againſt Death is the happy eſtate that follows it; next to that is the fore-expectation of it and reſolution againſt it. <hi>He ſtedfaſtly ſet his face to go to Jeruſalem: Jeruſalem</hi> the neſt of his enemies, the Amphitheater of his conflicts, the fatall place of his death. Well did he know the plots and ambuſhes that were there laid for him, and the bloudy iſſue of thoſe deſigns: yet he will go, and goes reſolved for the worſt. It is a ſure and wiſe way to ſend our thoughts before us, to grapple with thoſe evils which we
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:47750:127"/>
know muſt be incountred. The enemy is half over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that is well prepared for. The ſtrongeſt miſchief may be outfaced with a ſeaſonable fore-reſolution.</p>
            <p>There can be no greater diſadvantage then the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſurpriſall. O God, what I have not the power to avoid, let me have the wiſedom to expect.</p>
            <p>The way from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Judaea</hi> lay through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Samaria,</hi> if not through the City. <hi>Chriſt</hi> now towards the end of his Preaching could not but be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a multitude of followers: It was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary there ſhould be purveyours and harbingers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure lodgings and proviſion for ſo large a troup. Some of his own retinue are addreſſed to this ſervice: they ſeek not for palaces and delicates, but for houſe-room and victuals. It was He whoſe the earth was and the fulneſs thereof, whoſe the Heavens are and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions therein; yet He, who could have commanded Angels, ſues to <hi>Samaritans:</hi> He that filled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Heaven, ſendeth for ſhelter in a <hi>Samaritan</hi> Cottage. It was thy choice, O Saviour, to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee the ſhape, not of a Prince, but of a Servant. How can we either neglect means, or deſpiſe homeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when thou the God of all the World wouldſt ſtoop to the ſuit of ſo poor a proviſion?</p>
            <p>We know well in what terms the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſtood with the <hi>Jews</hi>; ſo much more hoſtile as they did more ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize in matter of Religion: no Nations were mutually ſo hatefull to each other. A <hi>Samaritan</hi>'s bread was no better then Swines-fleſh; their very fire and water was not more grudged then infectious. The looking towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was here cauſe enough of repulſe. No en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity is ſo deſperate as that which ariſes from matter of Religion. Agreement in ſome points, when there are differences in the main, doth but advance hatred the more.</p>
            <p>It is not more ſtrange to hear the Son of God ſue
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47750:128"/>
for a lodging, then to hear him repelled. Upon ſo churliſh a deniall, the two angry Diſciples return to their Maſter on a fiery errand; <hi>Lord, wilt thou that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand fire to come down from Heaven and conſume them, as Elias did?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sons of Thunder</hi> would be <hi>lightning</hi> ſtraight; their zeal, whether as kinſmen or Diſciples, could not brook ſo harſh a refuſal. As they were naturally more hot then their fellows, ſo now they thought their Piety bade them be impatient.</p>
            <p>Yet they dare not but begin with leave, <hi>Maſter, wilt thou?</hi> His will muſt lead theirs; their choler can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not drive their wills before his: all their motion is from him onely. True Diſciples are like thoſe artificiall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines which goe no otherwiſe then they are ſet; or like little Children, that ſpeak nothing but what they are taught. O Saviour, if we have wills of our own, we are not thine. Do thou ſet me as thou wouldſt have me goe; do thou teach me what thou wouldſt have me ſay or doe.</p>
            <p>A mannerly preface leads in a faulty ſuit; <hi>Maſter, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from Heaven and conſume them?</hi> Faulty, both in preſumption, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of private revenge. I do not hear them ſay, Maſter, will it pleaſe thee, who art the ſole Lord of the Heavens and the Elements, to command fire from Heaven upon theſe men? but, <hi>Wilt thou that we command?</hi> As if, becauſe they had power given them over diſeaſes and unclean ſpirits, therefore Heaven and Earth were in their managing. How eaſily might they be miſtaken? Their large commiſſion had the juſt limits. Subjects that have munificent grants from their Princes can challenge nothing beyond the words of their Patent. And if the fetching down fire from Heaven were leſs then the diſpoſſeſſing of Devils, (ſince the Devil ſhall inable the Beaſt to doe thus much,) yet how poſſible is it to doe the greater and ſtick at the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47750:128"/>
leſs, where both depend upon a delegated power? The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians of <hi>Aegypt</hi> could bring forth Frogs and Bloud; they could not bring Lice: ordinary Corruption can doe that which they could not.</p>
            <p>It is the faſhion of our bold Nature, upon an inch given, to challenge an ell; and where we find our ſelves graced with ſome abilities, to flatter our ſelves with the faculty of more.</p>
            <p>I grant, Faith hath done as great things as ever Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption undertook; but there is great difference in the enterpriſes of both. The one hath a warrant, either by inſtinct, or expreſs command; the other none at all. Indeed, had theſe two Diſciples either meant, or ſaid, Maſter, if it be thy pleaſure to command us to call down fire from Heaven, we know thy word ſhall ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us to doe what thou requireſt; if the words be ours, the power ſhall be thine; this had been but holy, modeſt, faithfull: but if they ſuppoſed there needed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſave a leave onely, and that (might they be but let looſe) they could go alone, they preſumed, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
            <p>Yet had they thus overſhot themſelves in ſome pious and charitable motion, the fault had been the leſs: now the act had in it both cruelty, and private revenge. Their zeal was not worthy of more praiſe, then their fury of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. That fire ſhould fall down from Heaven upon men, is a fearfull thing to think of, and that which hath not been often done. It was done in the caſe of <hi>Sodome,</hi> when thoſe five unclean Cities burned with the unnatural fire of hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Luſt: it was done two ſeverall times at the ſuit of <hi>Elijah:</hi> it was done (in an height of triall) to that great pattern of Patience. I find it no more, and tremble at theſe I find.</p>
            <p>But beſides the dreadfulneſs of the judgment it ſelf, who can but quake at the thought of the ſuddenneſs of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which ſweeps away both Body and Soul in a ſtate
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47750:129"/>
of unpreparation, of unrepentance; ſo as this fire ſhould but begin a worſe, this Heavenly flame ſhould but kindle that of Hell?</p>
            <p>Thus unconceivably heavy was the revenge: but what was the offence? We have learned not to think any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity light that is offered to the Son of God; but we know theſe ſpiritual affronts are capable of degrees. Had theſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> reviled <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his train, had they vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently aſſaulted him, had they followed him with ſtones in their hands and blaſphemies in their mouths, it had been a juſt provocation of ſo horrible a vengeance: Now the wrong was onely negative, <hi>they received him not:</hi> And that, not out of any particular quarrel or diſlike of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but of his Nation onely; the men had been wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, had not their Country diſtaſted. All the charge that I hear our Saviour give to his Diſciples in caſe of their rejection is, <hi>If they receive you not, ſhake off the duſt of your feet.</hi> Yet this was amongſt their own, and when they went on that ſacred errand of publiſhing the Goſpel of Peace. Theſe were ſtrangers from the commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This meaſure was not to Preachers, but to Travellers; onely a meer inhoſpitality to miſliked gueſts. Yet no leſs revenge will ſerve them then fire from Heaven.</p>
            <p>I dare ſay for you, ye holy ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> it was not your ſpleen, but your zeal, that was guilty of ſo bloudy a ſuggeſtion: your indignation could not but be ſtirred to ſee the great Prophet and Saviour of the world ſo unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repelled: yet all this will not excuſe you from a raſh Cruelty, from an inordinate Rage.</p>
            <p>Even the beſt heart may eaſily be miſcarried with a well-meant Zeal. No affection is either more neceſſary, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accepted. Love to any Object cannot be ſevered from hatred of the contrary: whence it is that all creatures which have the concupiſcible part, have alſo the iraſcible adjoyned unto it. Anger and diſpleaſure is not ſo much
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:47750:129"/>
an enemy, as a guardian and champion of Love. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore is rightly affected to his Saviour, cannot but find much regret at his wrongs. O gracious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Zeal, the kindly warmth and vital temper of Piety, whither haſt thou withdrawn thy ſelf from the cold hearts of men? Or is this according to the juſt conſtitution of the old and decrepit age of the world, into which we are fallen? How many are there that think there is no wiſedom but in a dull indifferency; and chuſe rather to freeze then burn? How quick and apprehenſive are men in caſes of their own indignities? how inſenſible of their Saviour's?</p>
            <p>But there is nothing ſo ill as the corruption of the beſt. Rectified zeal is not more commendable and uſefull, then inordinate and miſguided is hatefull and dangerous. Fire is a neceſſary and beneficial element; but if it be once miſplaced, and have caught upon the beams of our houſes or ſtacks of our corn, nothing can be more direfull.</p>
            <p>Thus ſometimes Zeal turns Murther, <hi>(They that kill you ſhall think they doe God ſervice,)</hi> ſometimes Phrenſie, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rude Indiſcretion. Wholſome and bleſſed is that Zeal that is well grounded and well governed: grounded upon the word of Truth, not upon unſtable fancies; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Wiſedom and Charity: Wiſedom, to avoid raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and exceſs; Charity, to avoid juſt offence.</p>
            <p>No motion can want a pretence. <hi>Elias</hi> did ſo; why not we? He was an holy Prophet: the occaſion, the place abludes not much: there wrong was offered to a ſervant, here to his Maſter; there to a man, here to a God and man. If <hi>Elias</hi> then did it, why not we? There is nothing more perillous then to draw all the actions of Holy men into examples: For as the beſt men have their weakneſſes, ſo they are not privileged from letting fall unjuſtifiable actions. Beſides that, they may have had perhaps peculiar warrants ſigned from Heaven, whether by inſtinct, or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial command, which we ſhall expect in vain. There muſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:47750:130"/>
be much caution uſed in our imitation of the beſt patterns, (whether in reſpect of the perſons, or things;) elſe we ſhall make our ſelves Apes, and our acts ſinfull abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
            <p>It is a rare thing for our Saviour to find fault with the errours of zeal, even where have appeared ſenſible weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. If <hi>Moſes</hi> in a ſacred rage and indignation brake the Tables written with God's own hand, I find him not checked. Here our meek Saviour turns back, and frowns upon his furious ſuitours, and takes them up roundly; <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are.</hi> The faults of unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs cannot be ſwallowed up in zeal. If there were any colour to hide the blemiſhes of this miſdiſpoſition, it ſhould be this crimſon die. But he that needs not our Lie, will let us know he needs not our Injury; and hates to have a good cauſe ſupported by the violation of our Charity. We have no reaſon to diſclaim our Paſſions: Even the Son of God chides ſometimes, yea where he loves. It offends not that our Affections are moved, but that they are inordinate.</p>
            <p>It was a ſharp word, <hi>Ye know not of what ſpirit ye are.</hi> Another man would not perhaps have felt it; a Diſciple doth. Tender hearts are galled with that which the carnal mind ſlighteth. The ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> was that which they meant to aſſume and imitate: they ſhall now know their mark was miſtaken. How would they have hated to think that any other but God's Spirit had ſtirred them up to this paſſionate motion? now they ſhall know it was wrought by that ill ſpirit whom they profeſſed to hate.</p>
            <p>It is far from the good Spirit of God to ſtir up any man to private revenge or thirſt of bloud. Not an Eagle, but a Dove, was the ſhape wherein he choſe to appear. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wouldſt thou, O God, be in the whirlwind, or in the fire, but in the ſoft voice. O Saviour, what do we ſeek for any precedent but thine, whoſe name we challenge?
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47750:130"/>
Thou <hi>cameſt to</hi> thine <hi>own,</hi> thine <hi>own received</hi> thee <hi>not.</hi> Didſt thou call for fire from Heaven upon them? didſt thou not rather ſend down water from thy compaſſionate eyes, and weep for them by whom thou muſt bleed? Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had it been for us never to have had any ſpirit, then any but thine. We can be no other then wicked, if our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies be cruelty.</p>
            <p>But is it the name of <hi>Elias</hi> (O ye Zelots) which ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a colour of your impotent deſire? Ye do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the difference betwixt his Spirit and yours. His was extraordinary and heroical, beſides the inſtinct or ſecret command of God for this act of his; far otherwiſe is it with you, who by a carnal diſtemper are moved to this furious ſuggeſtion. Thoſe that would imitate God's Saints in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular actions muſt ſee they go upon the ſame grounds. Without the ſame Spirit and the ſame warrant it is either a mockery or a ſin to make them our Copies. <hi>Elias</hi> is no fit pattern for Diſciples, but their Maſter. <hi>The Son of man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then are our actions and intentions warrantable and praiſe-worthy, when they accord with his. O Saviour, when we look into thoſe ſacred Acts and monuments of thine, we find many a life which thou preſervedſt from periſhing, ſome that had periſhed by thee recalled; never any by thee deſtroyed. Onely one poor fig-tree (as the reall Emblem of thy ſeverity to the unfruitfull) was blaſted and withered by thy curſe. But to man, how ever fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and indulgent wert thou? So repelled as thou wert, ſo reviled, ſo perſecuted, laid for, ſold, betrayed, apprehended, arraigned, condemned, crucified; yet what one man didſt thou ſtrike dead for theſe hainous indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities? Yea, when one of thine enemies loſt but an ear in that ill quarrel, thou gaveſt that ear to him who came to take life from thee. I find ſome whom thou didſt ſcourge and correct, as the ſacrilegious money-changers; none whom thou killedſt. Not that thou either loveſt not, or
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:47750:131"/>
requireſt not the duly ſevere execution of juſtice. Whoſe ſword is it that Princes bear but thine? Offenders muſt ſmart and bleed. This is a juſt ſequel, but not the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy coming; thy will, not thy drift.</p>
            <p>Good Princes make wholſome Laws for the well-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of their people: there is no authority without due coercion. The violation of theſe good Laws is followed with death, whoſe end was preſervation, life, order: and this not ſo much for revenge of an offence paſt, as for prevention of future miſchief.</p>
            <p>How can we then enough love and praiſe thy mercy, <hi>O thou preſerver of men?</hi> How ſhould we imitate thy ſaving and beneficent diſpoſition towards mankind, as knowing, the more we can help to ſave, the nearer we come to thee that cameſt to ſave all; and the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive we are, the more we reſemble him who is <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> a murtherer from the beginning?</p>

            <head>XXVII. The Ten Lepers.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Samaritans</hi> were tainted, not with Schiſm, but Hereſie, but Paganiſm; our Saviour yet balks them not, but makes uſe of the way as it lies, and beſtows upon them the courteſie of ſome Miracles. Some kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is lawfull even with thoſe without. Terms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſs and leagues of inward amity are here unfit, unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable, dangerous; but civil reſpects, and wiſe uſes of them for our convenience or neceſſity, need not, muſt not be forborn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:47750:131"/>Ten Lepers are here met: thoſe that are excluded from all other ſociety ſeek the company of each other. Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is that we all naturally affect, though even in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſy. Ever Lepers will flock to their fellows: where ſhall we find one ſpiritual Leper alone? Drunkards, Profane perſons, Hereticks will be ſure to conſort with their matches. Why ſhould not God's Saints delight in an holy communion? Why is it not our chief joy to aſſemble in good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi> could not abide one another, yet here in Leproſy they accord; here was one <hi>Samaritan</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with the <hi>Jewiſh:</hi> community of paſſion hath made them friends, whom even Religion disjoyned. What vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there is in miſery, that can unite even the moſt eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged hearts?</p>
            <p>I ſeek not myſtery in the number. Theſe Ten are met together, and all meet <hi>Chriſt:</hi> not caſually, but upon due deliberation; they purpoſely waited for this opportunity. No marvel if they thought no attendence long to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from ſo loathſome and miſerable a diſeaſe. Great <hi>Naaman</hi> could be glad to come from <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Judaea,</hi> in hope of leaving that hatefull gueſt behind him. We are all ſenſible enough of our bodily infirmities. Oh that we could be equally weary of the ſickneſſes and deformities of our better part. Surely our ſpiritual maladies are no leſs then mortal, if they be not healed; neither can they heal alone. Theſe men had died Lepers if they had not met with <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Saviour, give us grace to ſeek thee, and patience to wait for thee; and then we know thou wilt find us, and we remedy.</p>
            <p>Where do theſe Lepers attend for <hi>Chriſt</hi> but in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage: and that, not in the ſtreet of it, but in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, in the paſſage to it? The Cities, the Towns were not for them; the Law of God had ſhut them out from all frequence, from all converſation. Care of ſafety
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:47750:132"/>
and fear of infection was motive enough to make their neighbours obſervant of this piece of the Law. It is not the body onely that is herein reſpected by the God of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Thoſe that are ſpiritually contagious muſt be ſtill and ever avoided; they muſt be ſeparated from us, we muſt be ſeparated from them: they from us, by juſt cenſures; or (if that be neglected) we from them, by a voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of their familiar converſation. Beſides the benefit of our ſafety, wickedneſs would ſoon be aſhamed of it ſelf, if it were not for the incouragement of companions. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſs is the fitteſt antidote for ſpiritual infection. It were happy for the wicked man, if he could be ſeparated from himſelf.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lepers that came to ſeek <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet finding him, they ſtand afar off; whether for reverence, or for ſecurity. God had enacted this diſtance. It was their charge, if they were occaſioned to paſs through the ſtreets, to cry out, <hi>I am unclean.</hi> It was no leſs then their duty to proclaim their own infectiouſneſs: there was not danger onely, but ſin in their approach.</p>
            <p>How happy were it, if in thoſe wherein there is more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, there were more remoteneſs, leſs ſilence? O God, we are all Lepers to thee, overſpred with the loathſome ſcurf of our own corruptions: It becomes us well, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of our ſhame and vileneſs, to ſtand afar off. We cannot be too awfull of thee, too much aſhamed of our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Yet theſe men, though they be far off in the diſtance of place, yet they are near in reſpect of the acceptance of their Prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord is near unto all that call upon him in truth.</hi> O Saviour, whilſt we are far off from thee, thou art near unto us. Never doſt thou come ſo cloſe to us, as when in an holy baſhfulneſs we ſtand fartheſt off. Juſtly doſt thou expect we ſhould be at once bold and baſhfull. How bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould we come to the throne of Grace, in reſpect of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:47750:132"/>
grace of that throne? how fearfully, in reſpect of the awfulneſs of the Majeſty of that throne, and that unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs which we bring with us into that dreadfull pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence?</p>
            <p>He that ſtands near may whiſper; but he that ſtands afar off muſt cry aloud: ſo did theſe Lepers. Yet not ſo much diſtance as paſſion ſtrained their throats. That which can give voice to the Dumb, can much more give loudneſs to the Vocall.</p>
            <p>All cried together: theſe ten voices were united in one ſound, that their conjoyned forces might expugn that Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ear. Had every man ſpoken ſingly for himſelf, this had made no noiſe, neither yet any ſhew of a fervent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: Now, as they were all affected with one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſeaſe, ſo they all ſet out their throats together, and (though <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Samaritans</hi>) agree in one joynt ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Even where there are ten tongues, the word is but one; that the condeſcent may be univerſal. When we would obtain common favours, we may not content our ſelves with private and ſolitary Devotions, but muſt joyn our ſpiritual forces together, and ſet upon God by troups. <hi>Two are better then one; becauſe they have a good reward for their labour.</hi> No faithfull Prayer goes away unrecompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but where many good hearts meet, the retribution muſt be needs anſwerable to the number of the petitioners. O holy and happy violence that is thus offered to Heaven! How can we want Bleſſings, when ſo many cords draw them down upon our heads?</p>
            <p>It was not the ſound, but the matter, that carried it with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> if the ſound were ſhrill, the matter was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; <hi>Jeſu Maſter, have mercy upon us.</hi> No word can better become the mouth of the miſerable. I ſee not where we can meet with fitter patterns. Surely, they were not verier Lepers then we: why do we not imitate them in their actions, who are too like them in our condition? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we ſeek but to our <hi>Jeſus?</hi> How ſhould we
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47750:133"/>
ſtand aloof in regard of our own wretchedneſs? how ſhould we lift up our voice in the fervour of our ſupplications? what ſhould we rather ſue for then mercy? <hi>Jeſu Maſter, have mercy upon us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O gracious prevention of mercy, both had and given ere it can be asked! <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when he ſaw them, ſaid, <hi>Go ſhew your ſelves to the Prieſts.</hi> Their diſeaſe is cured ere it can be complained of; their ſhewing to the Prieſt preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them whole; whole in his grant, though not in their own apprehenſion. That ſingle Leper that came to <hi>Chriſt</hi> before (<hi>Matt.</hi> 8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.) was firſt cured in his own ſenſe; and then was bid to goe to the Prieſt for approbation of the Cure. It was not ſo with theſe, who are ſent to the Judges of Leproſy, with an intention they ſhall in the way find themſelves healed. There was a different purpoſe in both theſe: In the one, that the perfection of the Cure might be convinced, and ſeconded with a due ſacrifice; in the other, that the Faith of the Patients might be tried in the way; which if it had not held as ſtrong in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of their ſuit as in the beginning, had (I doubt) failed of the effect.
How eaſily might theſe Lepers think,<q> Alas! to what purpoſe is this? Shew our ſelves to the Prieſts? What can their eyes doe? They can judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be cured, (which we ſee yet it is not) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cure it. This is not now to doe: We have been ſeen enough, and loathed. What can their eyes ſee more then our own? We had well hoped that <hi>Jeſus</hi> would have vouchſafed to call us to him, and to lay his hands upon us, and to have healed us.</q>
Theſe thoughts had kept them Lepers ſtill. Now ſhall their Faith and Obedience be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their ſubmiſſion both to this ſudden command, and that Divine ordination.</p>
            <p>That former Leper was charged to ſhew himſelf to the chief Prieſt, theſe to the Prieſts; either would ſerve: the original command runs, either to <hi>Aaron,</hi> or to one of his Sons. But why to them? Leproſy was a bodily ſickneſs;
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:47750:133"/>
what is this to ſpiritual perſons? Wherefore ſerve Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, if the Prieſts muſt meddle with diſeaſes? We never ſhall find thoſe Sacred perſons to paſs their judgement upon Fevers, Dropſies, Palſies, or any other bodily diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: neither ſhould they on this, were it not that this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the body is joyned with a Legall uncleanneſs. Not as a ſickneſs, but as an impurity muſt it come under their cogniſance: neither this, without a farther implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Who but the ſucceſſours of the Legall Prieſthood are proper to judge of the uncleanneſſes of the Soul? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an act be ſinfull, or in what degree it is ſuch; what grounds are ſufficient for the comfortable aſſurance of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, of forgiveneſs; what courſes are fitteſt to avoid the danger of relapſes, who is ſo like to know, ſo meet to judge, as our Teachers? Would we in theſe caſes conſult ofter with our ſpiritual Guides, and depend upon their faithfull advices and well-grounded abſolutions, it were ſafer, it were happier for us. Oh the dangerous extremity of our wiſedome! Our hood-wink'd Progenitours would have no eyes but in the heads of their ghoſtly Fathers: We think our ſelves ſo quick-ſighted, that we pity the blindneſs of our able Teachers; none but our ſelves are fit to judge of our own Leproſie.</p>
            <p>Neither was it onely the peculiar judgement of the Prieſt that was here intended, but the thankfulneſs of the Patient: that by the ſacrifice which he ſhould bring with him, he might give God the glory of his ſanation. O God, whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou cureſt of this ſpiritual Leproſie, it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he ſhould preſent thee with the true Evangelical ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, not of his praiſes onely, but of himſelf, which are <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>living.</hi> We are ſtill leprous if we do not firſt ſee our ſelves foul, and then find our ſelves thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>The Lepers did not, would not go of themſelves, but are ſent by <hi>Chriſt: Goe and ſhew your ſelves.</hi> And why ſent by him? Was it in obedience to the Law? was it out
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47750:134"/>
of reſpect to the Prieſthood? was it for prevention of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills? was it for conviction of gain-ſayers? or was it for confirmation of the Miracle? <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was above the Law would not tranſgreſs it; he knew this was his charge by <hi>Moſes.</hi> How juſtly might he have diſpenſed with his own? but he will not: though the Law doth not bind the Maker, he will voluntarily bind himſelf. He was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ken of his <hi>Conſummatum eſt</hi>; yet would not antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate that approaching end, but holds the Law on foot till his laſt pace. This was but a branch of the Ceremonial; yet would he not ſlight it, but in his own perſon gives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a ſtudious obſervation.</p>
            <p>How carefully ſhould we ſubmit our ſelves to the Royall laws of our Creatour, to the wholſome laws of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, whilſt the Son of God would not but be ſo punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual in a Ceremony?</p>
            <p>Whilſt I look to the Perſons of thoſe Prieſts, I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but corruption, nothing but profeſſed hoſtility to the true <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> All this cannot make thee, O Saviour, to remit any point of the obſervance due to their places. Their Function was ſacred, whatever their Perſons were: though they have not the grace to give thee thy due, thou wilt not fail to give them theirs. How juſtly doſt thou expect all due regard to thine Evangelicall Prieſthood, who gaveſt ſo curious reſpect to the Legall? It were ſhame the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ſhould be above the Church; or that Prieſthood which thou meanteſt ſpeedily to abrogate, ſhould have more honour then that which thou meanteſt to eſtabliſh and perpetuate.</p>
            <p>Had this duty been neglected, what clamours had been raiſed by his emulous adverſaries? what ſcandalls? though the fault had been the Patient's, not the Phyſician's. But they that watched <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo narrowly, and were apt to take ſo poor exceptions at his Sabbath-cures, at the unwaſhen hands of his Diſciples, how much more would they have calumniated him if by his neglect the Law of Leproſie had
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47750:134"/>
been palpably tranſgreſſed? Not onely evil muſt be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but offence; and that not on our parts, but on others. That offence is ours, which we might have remedied.</p>
            <p>What a noble and irrefragable teſtimony was this to the power, to the truth of the <hi>Meſſiah?</hi> How can theſe <hi>Jews</hi> but either believe, or be made inexcuſable in not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving? When they ſhall ſee ſo many Lepers come at once to the Temple, all cured by a ſecret will, without word or touch, how can they chuſe but ſay, This work is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural; no limited power could doe this? How is he not God, if his power be infinite? Their own eyes ſhall be witneſſes and judges of their own conviction.</p>
            <p>The Cure is done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> more exquiſitely then by Art or Nature; yet it is not publickly aſſured and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, till according to the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> Law certain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent rites be performed. There is no admittance into the Congregation, but by ſprinkling of bloud. O Saviour, we can never be aſcertained of our cleanſing from that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Leproſie wherewith our Souls are tainted, but by the ſprinkling of thy moſt precious bloud: <hi>waſh us</hi> with that, <hi>and we ſhall be whiter then ſnow.</hi> This act of ſhewing to the Prieſt was not more required by the Law then pre-required of thoſe Lepers by our Saviour, for the triall of their Obedience. Had they now ſtood upon terms with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſaid, We will firſt ſee what cauſe there will be to ſhew our ſelves to the Prieſts; they need not ſee our Leprie, we ſhall be glad they ſhould ſee our Cure: do thou work that which we ſhall ſhew, and bid us ſhew what thou haſt wrought: till then excuſe us: it is our grief and ſhame to be ſeen too much; they had been ſtill Lepers.</p>
            <p>It hath been ever God's wont by ſmall Precepts to prove mens diſpoſitions. Obedience is as well tried in a trifle, as in the moſt important charge; yea ſo much more, as the thing required is leſs: for oft-times thoſe who would be carefull in main affairs, think they may neglect the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47750:135"/>
What command ſoever we receive from God or our Superiours, we muſt not ſcan the weight of the thing, but the authority of the commander. Either difficulty or ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are vain pretences for Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lepers are wiſer; they obeyed, and went. What was the iſſue? <hi>As they went, they were healed.</hi> Lo, had they ſtood ſtill, they had been Lepers; now they went, they are whole. What haſte the Bleſſing makes to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take their Obedience? This walk was required by the very Law, if they ſhould have found themſelves healed: what was it to prevent the time a little, and to doe that ſooner upon hopes which upon ſenſe they muſt doe after? The horrour of the Diſeaſe adds to the grace of the Cure; and that is ſo much more gracious as the task is eaſier: It ſhall coſt them but a walk. It is the bounty of that God whom we ſerve, to reward our worthleſs endeavours with infinite requitals. He would not have any proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt our acts and his remunerations.</p>
            <p>Yet beſides this recompence of Obedience, O Saviour, thou wouldſt herein have reſpect to thine own juſt Glory. Had not theſe Lepers been cured in the way, but in the end of their walk, upon their ſhewing to the Prieſts, the Miracle had loſt much light: perhaps the Prieſts would have challenged it to themſelves, and have attributed it to their prayers; perhaps the Lepers might have thought it was thy purpoſe to honour the Prieſts as the inſtruments of that marvellous Cure. Now there can be no colour of any others participation, ſince the Leproſie vaniſhes in the way. As thy Power, ſo thy Praiſe admits of no partners.</p>
            <p>And now, methinks, I ſee what an amazed joy there was amongſt theſe Lepers, when they ſaw themſelves thus ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly cured: each tells other what a change he feels in himſelf; each comforts other with the aſſurance of his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward clearneſs; each congratulates other's happineſs, and thinks, and ſays how joyfull this news will be to their
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47750:135"/>
friends and families. Their ſociety now ſerves them well to applaud and heighten their new felicity.</p>
            <p>The Miracle, indifferently wrought upon all, is different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken. All went forward (according to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) toward the Prieſts, all were obedient; one onely was thankfull. All were cured, all ſaw themſelves cured: their ſenſe was alike, their hearts were not alike. What could make the difference but Grace? and who could make the difference of Grace but he that gave it? He that wrought the Cure in all, wrought the Grace not in all, but in one. The ſame act, the ſame motives, are not equally powerfull to all: where the Oxe finds graſs, the Viper poiſon. We all pray, all hear; one goes away bettered, another cavils. Will makes the difference; but who makes the difference of wills but he that made them? He that creates the new Heart, leaves a ſtone in one boſome, puts fleſh into another. <hi>It is not in him that willeth nor in him that runneth, but in God that hath mercy.</hi> O God, if we look not up to thee, we may come and not be healed; we may be healed, and not be thankfull.</p>
            <p>This one man breaks away from his fellows to ſeek <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Whilſt he was a Leper, he conſorted with Lepers; now that he is healed, he will be free. He ſaith not, I came with theſe men, with them I will goe; if they will return, I will accompany them; if not, what ſhould I goe alone? As I am not wiſer then they, ſo I have no more reaſon to be more thankfull. There are caſes wherein Singularity is not lawfull onely, but laudable. <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to doe evil. I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord.</hi> It is a baſe and unworthy thing for a man ſo to ſubject himſelf to others examples, as not ſometimes to reſolve to be an example to others. When either evil is to be done, or good neglected, how much better is it to goe the right way alone, then to erre with company?</p>
            <p>O noble pattern of Thankfulneſs! what ſpeed of retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is here? No ſooner doth he ſee his Cure, then he haſts
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47750:136"/>
to acknowledge it: the Benefit ſhall not die, not ſleep in his hand. Late profeſſions of our obligations ſavour of dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ingratitude. What a laborious and diligent offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is here? He ſtands not ſtill, but puts himſelf to the pains of a return. What an hearty recognition of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing? His voice was not more loud in his ſuit then in his thanks. What an humble reverence of his Benefactour? He falls down at his feet, as acknowledging at once bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and unworthineſs. It were happy for all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if they could but learn of this <hi>Samaritan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This man is ſent with the reſt to the Prieſts. He well knew this duty a branch of the Law of Ceremonies, which he meant not to neglect: but his heart told him there was a Moral duty of profeſſing thankfulneſs to his Benefactour, which called for his firſt attendence. Firſt therefore he turns back, ere he will ſtir forward. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon taught this <hi>Samaritan</hi> (and us in him) that cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony muſt yield to ſubſtance, and that main points of Obedience ought to take place of all Rituall comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>It is not for nothing that note is made of the Countrey of this thankfull Leper; <hi>He was a Samaritan:</hi> The place is known and branded with the infamy of a Paganiſh miſ-religion. Outward diſadvantage of place or parentage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not block up the way of God's Grace and free election; as contrarily the privileges of birth and nature avail us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in ſpirituall occaſions.</p>
            <p>How ſenſible wert thou, O Saviour, of thine own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence? <hi>Were there not ten cleanſed? but where are the nine?</hi> The trouping of theſe Lepers together did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy reckoning. It is both juſtice and wiſedom in thee to keep a ſtrict account of thy favours. There is an whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and uſefull art of forgetfulneſs in us men, both of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits done, and of Wrongs offered. It is not ſo with God. Our injuries indeed he ſoon puts over, making it no ſmall part of his ſtyle, that he <hi>forgives iniquities:</hi> but
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47750:136"/>
for his mercies, there is no reaſon he ſhould forget them; they are worthy of more then our memory. His favours are univerſal over all his works; there is no creature that taſts not of his bounty; his Sun and Rain are for others beſides his friends: but none of his good turns eſcapes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his knowledge or record. Why ſhould not we (O God) keep a book of our receits from thee, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with thine may declare thee bounteous, and us thankfull?</p>
            <p>Our Saviour doth not ask this by way of doubt, but of exprobration. Full well did he count the ſteps of thoſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Lepers; he knew where they were; he upbraids their ingratitude, that they were not where they ſhould have been. It was thy juſt quarrel, O Saviour, that whilſt one <hi>Samaritan</hi> returned, nine <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were healed and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not. Had they been all <hi>Samaritans,</hi> this had been faulty; but now they were <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> their Ingratitude was more foul then their Leproſy. The more we are bound to God, the more ſhamefull is our unthankfulneſs. There is ſcarce one in ten that is carefull to give God his own: this neglect is not more general then diſpleaſing. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had never miſſed their preſence, if their abſence had not been hatefull and injurious.</p>

            <p>OTherwhere ye may look long, and ſee no Miracle; but here behold two Miracles in one view: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, of the Angel curing Diſeaſes; the latter, of the God of Angels, viz. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> preventing the Angel in his
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:47750:137"/>
Cure. Even the firſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought by the Angel; the ſecond immediately by himſelf. The firſt is incomparable, for, (as <hi>Montanus</hi> truly obſerves) there is no one <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum perpetuum</hi> but this one, in the whole Book of God. Be content to ſpend this hour with me in the Porches of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda,</hi> and conſider with me the Topography, the Aitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, the Chronography of this Miracle. Theſe three li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſpeech and your patient attention. The Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy (which is firſt in place and time) offers us two heads: 1. a Feaſt of the <hi>Jews</hi>; 2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> going up to the Feaſt. The <hi>Jews</hi> were full of Holy-days, both of God's inſtitution and the Churche's. Of God's, both weekly, monthly, anniverſary. Weekly, that one of ſeven, which I would to God we had learned of them to keep better. In this regard it was that <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid, the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>Septi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam aetatis partem perdere, loſe the ſeventh part of their life.</hi> Monthly, the New moons, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. Anniverſary, Eaſter, Pentecoſt, and the September-feaſts. The Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che's, both the <hi>Purim</hi> by <hi>Mardochaeus</hi>; and the <hi>Encaenia</hi> by <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> which yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> honoured by his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization, <hi>John</hi> 10. Surely God did this for the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his people in his ſervice: hence the Church hath laudably imitated this example. To have no Feaſts, is ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: to have too many, is Paganiſh and Superſtitious. Neither would God have caſt the Chriſtian Eaſter upon the juſt time of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſch, and their Whitſontide upon the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Pentecoſt, if he would not have had theſe Feaſts continued. And why ſhould the Chriſtian Church have leſs power then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue? Here was not a mere Feriation, but a Feaſting; they muſt appear before God <hi>cum muneribus with gifts.</hi> The tenth part of their increaſe muſt be ſpent upon the three ſolemn Feaſts, beſides their former tithes to <hi>Levi, Deut.</hi> 14.23. There was no Holy-day wherein they feaſted above ſix hours; and in ſome of them Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion urged them to their quantities of drink: And <hi>David,</hi>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:47750:137"/>

The true <hi>Purims</hi> of this Iſland are thoſe two Feaſts of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>November.</hi> He is no true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> that keeps them not, as the days which the Lord hath made. When are joy and triumphs ſeaſonable if not at Feaſts? but not exceſs. Pardon me, I know not how Feaſts are kept at the Court: but, as <hi>Job,</hi> when he thought of the banquets of his Sons, ſays, <hi>It may be they have ſinned</hi>; ſo let me ſpeak at peradventures, If ſenſuall immoderation ſhould have ſet her foot into theſe Chriſtian Feaſts, let me at leaſt ſay with indulgent <hi>Eli, Non eſt bona fama, filii, It is no good report, my ſons.</hi> Do ye think that S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s rule, <hi>Non in comeſſationibus &amp; ebrietate, not in ſurfeiting and drunkenneſs,</hi> was for work-days onely? The <hi>Jews</hi> had a conceit, that on their Sabbath and Feaſt-days the Devils fled from their Cities <hi>ad montes umbroſos, to the ſhady mountains.</hi> Let it not be ſaid, that on our Chriſtian Feaſts they ſhould <hi>è montibus aulam petere:</hi> and that he ſeeks, and finds not, <hi>loca arida,</hi> but <hi>madida.</hi> God forbid that Chriſtians ſhould ſacrifice to <hi>Bacchus</hi> in ſtead of the ever-living God: and that on the day when you ſhould have been blown up by treacherous fire from earth to Heaven, you ſhould fetch down the fire of God's anger from Heaven upon you by ſwilling and ſurfeits: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid. God's ſervice is <hi>unum neceſſarium, one thing neceſſary,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt. Homo ebrius, ſuperflua creatura, A drunken man is a ſuperfluous creature,</hi> ſaith <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> How ill do thoſe two agree together? This I have been bold to ſay out of caution, not of reproof.</p>
            <p>Thus much, that there was a Feaſt of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Now, what Feaſt it was, is queſtionable: whether the Paſch, as <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> with him, thinks, upon the warrant of <hi>John</hi> 4.35. where our Saviour had ſaid, <hi>Yet four months,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47750:138"/>
and then comes harveſt:</hi> or whether Pentecoſt, which was fifty days from the ſhaking of the ſheaf, (that was Eaſter Sunday) as <hi>Cyrill, Chryſoſtome, Theophylact, Euthymius,</hi> and ſome later: or whether one of the <hi>September</hi> Feaſts, as ſome others. The excellency of the Feaſt makes for Eaſter, the Feaſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the number of Interpreters for Pentecoſt; the number of Feaſts for <hi>September.</hi> For as God delighted in the number of Seven, the ſeventh day was holy, the ſeventh year, the ſeventh ſeventh year: ſo he ſhewed it in the ſeventh month, which reſerves his number ſtill, <hi>September</hi>; the firſt day whereof was the Sabbath of Trumpets, the tenth <hi>dies expiationum,</hi> and on the fifteenth began the Feaſt of Tabernacles for ſeven days. It is an idleneſs to ſeek that which we are never the better when we have found. What if Eaſter? what if Tabernacles? what if Pentecoſt? what loſs, what gain is this? <hi>Magnâ nos moleſtiâ Joannes liberâſſet, ſi unum adjeciſſet verbum; John had eaſed us of much trouble, if he had added but one word,</hi> ſaith <hi>Maldonat.</hi> But for us, God give them ſorrow which love it: this is one of Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

They vent an unprofitable skill,</hi> as he ſaid. Let us be content with the learned ignorance of what God hath concealed; and know, that what he hath concealed, will not avail us to know.</p>
            <p>Rather let us inquire why <hi>Chriſt</hi> would go up to the Feaſt. I find two ſilken cords that drew him up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 1. His Obedience. 2. His deſire of manifeſting his Glory.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It was a generall Law, All males muſt appear thrice a year before the Lord. Behold, he was the God whom they went up to worſhip at the Feaſt; yet he goes up to worſhip. He began his life in Obedience, when he came into his Mother's belly to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> at the taxation of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and ſo he continues it. He knew his due. <hi>Of whom do the Kings of the earth receive tribute? of their own, or of ſtrangers? Then their Sons are free.</hi> Yet he that would pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> will alſo pay this tribute of Obedience to his Father. He that was above the Law, yields to the Law: <hi>Legi ſatisfacere voluit, etſi non ſub Lege, He would ſatisfie the Law, though he were not under the Law.</hi> The Spirit of God ſays, <hi>He learned obedience in that he ſuffered.</hi> Surely alſo he taught Obedience in that he did. This was his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>John Baptiſt, It becomes us to fulfill all righteouſneſs.</hi> He will not abate his Father one Ceremony. It was dangerous to go up to that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which he had left before, for their malice: yet now he will up again. His Obedience drew him up to that bloudy Feaſt, wherein himſelf was ſacrificed; how much more now, that he might ſacrifice? What can we plead to have learned of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if not his firſt Leſſon, Obedience? The ſame proclamation that <hi>Gedeon</hi> made to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he makes ſtill to us, <hi>As ye ſee me doe, ſo doe ye.</hi> Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore God injoyns us, either immediately by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or mediately by his Deputies, if we will be Chriſtians, we muſt ſo obſerve, as thoſe that know themſelves bound to tread in his ſteps that ſaid, <hi>In the volume of thy book it is
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47750:139"/>
written of me, I deſired to doe thy will, O God,</hi> Pſal. 40.6. <hi>I will have obedience,</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and not ſacrifice.</hi> But where Sacrifice is Obedience, he will have Obedience in ſacrificing. Therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> went up to the Feaſt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond motive was the manifeſtation of his Glory. If we be <hi>the light of the world,</hi> who are ſo much ſnuffe, what is he that is <hi>the Father of lights?</hi> It was not for him to be ſet under the buſhell of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but upon the table of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Thither and then was the confluence of all the Tribes. Many a time had <hi>Chriſt</hi> paſſed by this man before, when the ſtreets were empty; for there he lay many years; yet heals him not till now. He that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times modeſtly ſteals a Miracle with a <hi>Vide nè cui dixeris, See thou tell no man,</hi> that no man might know it; at other times does wonders upon the Scaffold of the World, that no man might be ignorant, and bids proclaim it on the houſe tops. It was fit the world ſhould be thus publickly convinced, and either wone by belief, or loſt by inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableneſs. Good, the more common it is, the better. <hi>I will praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, in Eccleſia magna, in the great Congregation.</hi> Glory is not got in corners. <hi>No man</hi> (ſay the envious kinſmen of <hi>Chriſt) keeps cloſe, and would be famous:</hi> No, nor that would have God celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The beſt opportunities muſt be taken in glorifying him. He that would be Crucified at the feaſt, that his Death and Reſurrection might be more famous; will at the Feaſt doe Miracles, that his Divine power might be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved openly. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Flos campi, non horti, the flour of the field,</hi> and <hi>not of the garden,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide to have his Graces ſmothered in us. <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſs within my heart,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> when he would be <hi>inſignitè improbus, notoriouſly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,</hi> does his villany publickly in the eyes of the Sun, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no curtain but Heaven. He that would doe notable ſervice to God, muſt doe it conſpicuouſly. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> gain'd well by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> got nothing by him, ſo
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47750:139"/>
long as, like to a night-bird, he never came to him but with owls and bats. Then he began to be a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſciple, when he durſt oppoſe the Phariſees in their condemnation of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> though indefinitely: but moſt, when in the night of his death the light of his Faith brought him openly to take down the Sacred Corps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the gazing multitude, and to embalm it. When we confeſs God's name, with the Pſalmiſt, before Kings; when Kings, defenders of the Faith, profeſs their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in publick and everlaſting monuments to all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to all times; this is glorious to God, and in God to them. It is no matter how cloſe evils be, nor how pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick good is.</p>
            <p>This is enough for the Chronography; the Topography follows. I will not here ſtand to ſhew you the ignorance of the Vulgar tranſlation, in joyning <hi>probatica</hi> and <hi>piſcina</hi> together, againſt their own fair <hi>Vatican</hi> copy, with other ancient: nor ſpend time to diſcuſs whether <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47750:140"/>
we might eaſily wear out as many hours in this Pool as this poor impotent man did years. But it is Edification that we affect, and not curioſity. This Pool had <hi>five Porches.</hi> Neither will I run here with S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> into Allegories; that this Pool was the people of the <hi>Jews, Aquae multae, populus multus,</hi> and theſe five Porches the Law in the five books of <hi>Moſes:</hi> nor ſtand to confute <hi>Adrichomius,</hi> who out of <hi>Joſephus</hi> would perſuade us that theſe five Porches were built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that this was <hi>ſtagnum Solomonis,</hi> for the uſe of the Temple. The following words ſhew the uſe of the Porches; for the receit of <hi>impotent, ſick, blind, halt, withered, that waited for the moving of the water.</hi> It ſhould ſeem it was walled about to keep it from Cattel, and theſe five vaulted entrances were made by ſome Benefactours for the more convenience of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence. Here was the Mercy of God ſeconded by the Charity of men: If God will give Cure, they will give Harbour. Surely it is a good matter to put our hand to God's; and to further good works with convenience of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was grown a City of bloud, to the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophets, to a wilfull deſpight of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to her peace, to a profanation of God's Temple, to a mere formality in God's ſervices: and yet here were publick works of Charity in the midſt of her ſtreets. We may not always judge of the truth of Piety by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table actions. <hi>Judas</hi> diſburſed the money for <hi>Chriſt</hi>; there was no Traitour but he. The poor traveller that was robb'd and wounded betwixt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Jericho,</hi> was paſſed over firſt by the Prieſt, then the Levite; at laſt the <hi>Samaritan</hi> came and relieved him: His Religion was naught, yet his act was good; the Prieſt's and Levite's Religion good, their Uncharity ill. <hi>Novatus</hi> himſelf was a Martyr, yet a Schiſmatick. Faith is the ſoul, and good works are the breath, ſaith S. <hi>James:</hi> but as you ſee in a pair of bellows there is a forced breath without life;
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47750:140"/>
ſo in thoſe that are puffed up with the wind of oſtentation, there may be charitable works without Faith. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> unto her four famous Orders of <hi>Jacobins, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcans, Auguſtines,</hi> and <hi>Carmelites,</hi> hath added a fifth of <hi>Jeſuites</hi>; and, like another <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for thoſe five Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous and lazarly Orders hath built five Porches; that if the water of any State be ſtirred, they may put in for a ſhare. How many Cells and Convents hath ſhe raiſed for theſe miſerable Cripples? and now ſhe thinks (though ſhe exalt her ſelf above all that is called God, though ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe with and againſt God, though ſhe fall down before every block and wafer, though ſhe kill Kings and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with Magiſtrates,) ſhe is the onely City of God. <hi>Digna eſt, nam ſtruxit Synagogam, She is worthy, for ſhe hath built a Synagogue.</hi> Are we more orthodox, and ſhall not we be as charitable? I am aſhamed to think of rich Noblemen and Merchants that die and give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our five Porches of <hi>Betheſda.</hi> What ſhall we ſay? Have they made their Mammon their God, in ſtead of making friends with their Mammon to God? Even when they die will they not (like <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s good Uſurers) part with that which they cannot hold, that they may get that which they cannot loſe? Can they begin their will, <hi>In Dei nomine, Amen</hi>; and give nothing to God? Is he onely a Witneſs, and not a Legatee? Can we bequeath our Souls to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven, and give nothing to his Lims on earth? And if they will not give, yet will they not lend to God? He that gives to the poor, <hi>foeneratur Deo, lends to God.</hi> Will they put out to any but God? and then, when, in ſtead of giving ſecurity, he receives with one hand and pays with another, receives our bequeſt and gives us glory? Oh damnable niggardlineſs of vain men, that ſhames the Goſpel, and loſes Heaven! Let me ſhew you a <hi>Betheſda</hi> that wants Porches. What truer houſe of effuſion then the Church of God, which ſheds forth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of comfort, yea of life? Behold ſome of the Porches
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47750:141"/>
of this <hi>Betheſda</hi> ſo far from building, that they are pulled down. It is a wonder if the demoliſhed ſtones of God's Houſe have not built ſome of yours, and if ſome of you have not your rich Suits garded with Souls. There were wont to be reckoned three wonders of <hi>England, Eccleſia, Foemina, Lana, The Churches, the Women, the Wool. Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina</hi> may paſs ſtill; who may juſtly challenge wonder for their Vanity, if not their Perſon. As for <hi>Lana,</hi> if it be wonderfull alone, I am ſure it is ill joyned with <hi>Eccleſia:</hi> The Church is fleeced, and hath nothing but a bare pelt left upon her back. And as for <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> either men have ſaid with the <hi>Babylonians, Down with it, down with it even to the ground</hi>; or elſe in reſpect of the Maintenance, with <hi>Judas, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t quid perditio haec? Why was this waſte?</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remorſefull ſouls have ſent back, with <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſons, their money in their Sacks mouths? How many great Teſtators have in their laſt Will returned the anathematized <hi>peculium</hi> of Impropriations to the Church, chuſing rather to impair their heir then to burthen their Souls? <hi>Dum times nè pro te patrimonium tuum perdas, ipſe pro patrimonio tuo peris,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cyprian; Whilſt thou feareſt to loſe thy patrimony for thy own good, thou periſheſt with thy patrimony.</hi> Ye great men, ſpend not all your time in building Caſtles in the air, or houſes on the ſand; but ſet your hands and purſes to the building of the Porches of <hi>Betheſda.</hi> It is a ſhame for a rich Chriſtian to be like a Chriſtmas-box, that receives all, and nothing can be got out till it be broken in pieces; or like unto a drown'd man's hand, that holds whatſoever it gets. <hi>To doe good and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, forget not; for with ſuch Sacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Place: what was the Uſe of it? All ſorts of Patients were at the bank of <hi>Betheſda:</hi> where ſhould Cripples be but at the Spittle? <hi>The ſick, blind, lame, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered,</hi> all that did either <hi>morbo laborare</hi> or <hi>vitio corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> complain either of ſickneſs or impotency, were there.

In natural courſe, one receit heals not all diſeaſes, no nor one Agent; one is an Oculiſt, another a Bone-ſetter, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Chirurgeon: But all diſeaſes are alike to the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> though the Prince of Phyſicians, yet ſwears by <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> he will never meddle with cutting of the Stone. There is no Diſeaſe that Art will not meddle with: there are many that it cannot cure. The poor <hi>Haemorrhoïſſa</hi> was eighteen years in the Phyſicians hands, and had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away both her body and her ſubſtance. Yea ſome it kills in ſtead of healing: whence one Hebrew word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies both <hi>Phyſicians</hi> and <hi>dead men.</hi> But behold here all Sickneſſes cured by one hand, and by one water. O all ye that are ſpiritually ſick and diſeaſed, come to the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> the Bloud of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Do ye complain of the Blindneſs of your Ignorance? here ye ſhall receive clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sight: of the diſtemper of Paſſions? here Eaſe: of the ſuperfluity of your ſinfull Humours? here Evacuation: of the impotency of your Obedience? here Integrity: of the dead witheredneſs of good Affections? here Life and Vigour. Whatſoever your infirmity be, come to the Pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and be healed.</p>
            <p>All theſe may be cured; yet ſhall be cured at leiſure: all muſt wait, all muſt hope in waiting. Methinks I ſee how enviouſly theſe Cripples look one upon another, each thinking other a lett, each watching to prevent other, each hoping to be next; like emulous Courtiers, that gape and vie for the next preferment, and think it a pain to hope, and a torment to be prevented. But <hi>Betheſda</hi> muſt be waited on. He is worthy of his Crutches that will not ſtay God's leiſure for his Cure. There is no virtue, no ſucceſs without patience. Waiting is a familiar leſſon with Courtiers: and here we have all need of it. One is ſick of an overflowing of the Gall, another of a Tumour of Pride, another of the Tentigo of Luſt, another of the Vertigo of Inconſtancy, another of the choaking Squinancy

of Curſes and Blaſphemies; one of the Boulimy of Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, another of the Pleuritical ſtitches of Envy; one of the contracting Cramp of Covetouſneſs, another of the Atrophie of Unproficiency: one is hide-bound with Pride, another is conſumed with Emulation, another rotten with Corrupt deſires: and we are ſo much the ſicker, if we feel not theſe diſtempers. Oh that we could wait at the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſda</hi> of God, attend diligently upon his Ordinances: we could no more fail of cure, then now we can hope for cure. We wait hard, and endure much for the Body. <hi>Quantis laboribus agitur ut longiore tempore laboretur! Multi cruciatus ſuſcipiuntur certi, ut pauci dies adjiciantur incerti.

            <head>XXIX. The Transfiguration of <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere is not in all Divinity an higher ſpeculation then this of <hi>Chriſt</hi> transfigured. Suffer me therefore to lead you up by the hand into mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> (for nearer to Heaven ye cannot come while ye are upon earth,) that you may ſee him glorious upon Earth, the Region of his ſhame and abaſement, who is now glorious in Heaven, the Throne of his Majeſty. He that would not have his transfiguration ſpoken of till he were raiſed, would have it ſpoken of all the world over now that he is raiſed and aſcended, that by this momentany glory we may judge of the eternall. The Circumſtances ſhall be to us as the skirts of the Hill, which we will climbe up lightly; the Time, Place, Attendents, Company. The Time, <hi>after ſix days</hi>; the Place, <hi>an high hill apart</hi>; the Attendents, <hi>Peter, James, John</hi>; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> which when we have paſſed, on the top of the hill ſhall appear to us that ſight which ſhall once make us glorious, and in the mean time make us happy.</p>
            <p>All three Evangeliſts accord in the <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> that it was immediately after thoſe words, <hi>There be ſome of them that ſtand here which ſhall not taſt of death till they have ſeen the Son of Man come in his Kingdom.</hi> Wherein, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, the act comments upon the words. <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were theſe <hi>ſome:</hi> they taſted not of death, till they ſaw this Heavenly image of the Royalty of <hi>Chriſt</hi> glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. But the <hi>Terminus quò</hi> diſagrees a little. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſay, <hi>after ſix; Luke, poſt ferè octo:</hi> which as they are eaſily reconciled by the uſuall diſtinction of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſivè</hi> and <hi>excluſivè,</hi> neceſſary for all computations, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:47750:143"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi>'s <hi>about eight</hi>; ſo, methinks, ſeems to intimate God's ſeventh day, the Sabbath: why ſhould there be elſe ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe mention of <hi>ſix days after,</hi> and <hi>about eight,</hi> but to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that day which was betwixt the ſixth and eighth? God's day was fitteſt for ſo Divine a work: and well might that day which imported God's reſt and man's glory, be uſed for the clear repreſentation of the reſt and glory of God and man. But in this conjecture (for ought I know) I goe alone: I dare not be too reſolute. Certainly it was the ſeventh, whether it were that ſeventh; the ſeventh after the promiſe of the glory of his Kingdom exhibited: and this perhaps not without a myſtery. <hi>God teacheth both by words and acts,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hilary, that after ſix Ages of the world ſhould be</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s glorious appearance, and our transfiguration with him.</hi> But I know what our Saviour's farewell was, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>it is not for</hi> us <hi>to know.</hi> But if we may not know, we may conjecture; yet not <hi>above that we ought,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> we may not <hi>ſuper ſapere,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s phraſe is.</p>
            <p>For the Place, tradition hath taken it ſtill for <hi>Tabor.</hi> I liſt not to croſs it without warrant. This was an high Hill indeed: <hi>thirty furlongs high,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſephus; mirâ ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunditate ſublimis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome:</hi> and ſo ſteep, that ſome of our Engliſh travellers, that have deſired to climbe it of late, have been glad to give it up in the mid-way, and to meaſure the reſt with their eyes. Doubtleſs this Hill was a Symbol of Heaven, being near it, as in ſituation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance. Heaven is expreſſed uſually by the name of <hi>God's hill:</hi> and Nature or this appellation taught the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens to figure it by their <hi>Olympus.</hi> All Divine affairs of any magnificence were done on Hills. On the hill of <hi>Sinai</hi> was the Law delivered: on the hill of <hi>Moriah</hi> was <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be ſacrificed; whence <hi>Abraham</hi>'s poſie is, <gap reason="foreign">

in the valley: on the hills of <hi>Ebal</hi> and <hi>Gerizim</hi> were the Bleſſings and Curſes: on <hi>Carmel</hi> was <hi>Eliah</hi>'s ſacrifice: the <hi>Phrontiſteria,</hi> Schools or Univerſities of the Prophets were ſtill <hi>Ramah</hi> and <hi>Gibeah, Excelſa,</hi> High places: who knows not that on the hill of <hi>Sion</hi> ſtood the Temple? <hi>I have looked up to the hills,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. And Idolatry, in imitation, had its hill-altars. On the mount of Olives was <hi>Chriſt</hi> wont to ſend up his Prayers, and ſent up himſelf. And here <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, he went up to an high hill to pray; not for that God makes difference of places, to whoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity Heaven it ſelf is a valley. It was an heatheniſh conceit of thoſe <hi>Aramites,</hi> that God is <hi>Deus montium, the God of the mountains.</hi> But becauſe we are commonly more diſpoſed to good by either the freedome of our ſcope to Heaven, or the awfulneſs or ſolitary ſilence of places, which (as one ſaith) ſtrikes a kind of adoration into us, or by our locall removall from this attractive body of the earth; howſoever, when the body ſees it ſelf above the earth, the eye of the Mind is more eaſily raiſed to her Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. It is good to take all advantage of place (ſetting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſuperſtition) to further our Devotion. <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi> were in the mountain with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and held up his hands. <hi>Aaron</hi> (ſay ſome Allegoriſts) is mountainous; <hi>Hur,</hi> fiery: Heavenly meditation and the fire of Charity muſt lift up our prayers to God. As Satan carried up <hi>Chriſt</hi> to an high hill to tempt him, ſo he carries up himſelf to be freed from temptation and diſtraction. If ever we would be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in our diſpoſitions, we muſt leave the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and abandon all worldly thoughts. <hi>Venite, aſcenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; O come, let us climbe up to the hill, where God ſees, or is ſeen,</hi> ſaith devout <hi>Bernard.

            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:47750:144"/>Wherefore then did <hi>Chriſt</hi> climbe up this high hill? Not to look about him, but, ſaith S. <hi>Luke, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to pray</hi>; not for proſpect, but for devotion; that his thoughts might climbe up yet nearer to Heaven. Behold how <hi>Chriſt</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon all his great works with Prayers in his mouth. When he was to enter into that great work of his Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Paſſion, he went into the garden to pray: when he is to enter into this great work of his Exaltation in his Transfiguring, he went up into the mountain to pray: he was taken up from his knees to both. O noble example of Piety and Devotion to us! He was God that prayed: the God that he prayed to, he might have commanded; yet he prayed, that we men might learn of him to pray to him. What ſhould we men dare to doe without prayers, when he that was God would doe nothing without them? The very heathen Poet could ſay, <hi>A Jove principium:</hi> and which of thoſe verſe-mongers ever durſt write a ballad without imploring of ſome Deity? which of the heathens durſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any great enterpriſe, <hi>inſalutato numine,</hi> without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation and ſacrifice? <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf would play the Prieſt, and offer a burnt-offering to the Lord, rather then the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> ſhould fight with him unſupplicated; as thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any devotion better then none; and thinking it more ſafe to ſacrifice without a Prieſt, then to fight without Prayers. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngirt, unbleſt,</hi> was the old word; as not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy till they were girded, ſo not till they had prayed. And how dare we ruſh into the affairs of God or the State; how dare we thruſt our ſelves into actions either perillous or important, without ever lifting up our eyes and hearts unto the God of Heaven? Except we would ſay, (as the devilliſh malice of <hi>Surius</hi> ſlanders that zealous <hi>Luther,) Nec propter Deum haec res coepta eſt, nec propter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um finietur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This buſineſs was neither begun for God, nor ſhall be ended for him.</hi> How can God bleſs us, if we implore him not? how can we proſper, if he bleſs us not? How can we hope ever to be transfigured from a lump of corrupt

fleſh, if we do not aſcend and pray? As the <hi>Samaritan</hi> woman ſaid weakly, we may ſeriouſly, <hi>The well</hi> of mercies <hi>is deep:</hi> if thou haſt <hi>nothing to draw with,</hi> never look to taſt of the waters of life. I fear the worſt of men, <hi>Turks,</hi> and the worſt <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Moors,</hi> ſhall riſe up in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt many Chriſtians, with whom it is a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt any witneſs by their Law, that he hath not prayed ſix times in each naturall day. Before the day break, they pray for day; when it is day, they give God thanks for day; at noon they thank God for half the day paſt; after that they pray for a good Sun-ſet; after that they thank God for the day paſſed; and laſtly, pray for a good night after their day. And we Chriſtians ſuffer ſo many Suns and Moons to riſe and ſet upon our heads, and never lift up our hearts to their Creatour and ours, either to ask his bleſſing, or to acknowledge it. Of all men under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, none had ſo much need to pray as Courtiers. That which was done but once to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is always done to them. They are ſet upon the hill, and ſee the glory of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of earth: but I fear it is ſeen of them as it is with ſome of the Mariners, The more need, the leſs devotion.</p>
            <p>Ye have ſeen the Place, ſee the Attendents. He would not have many, becauſe he would not have it yet known to all: hence was his intermination, and ſealing up their mouths with a <hi>Nemini dicite, Tell no man.</hi> Not none, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not have it altogether unknown; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards would have it known to all. Three were a legall number; <hi>in ore duorum aut trium, in the mouth of two or three witneſſes.</hi> He had eternally poſſeſſed the glory of his Father without any witneſſes: in time the Angels were bleſſed with that ſight; and after that two bodily, yet Heavenly, witneſſes were allowed, <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> Now in his humanity he was inveſted with glory, he takes but three witneſſes, and thoſe earthly and weak, <hi>Peter, James, John.</hi> And why theſe? We may be too curious. <hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe the eldeſt; <hi>John,</hi> becauſe the deareſt; <hi>James,</hi> becauſe next <hi>Peter</hi>

I had rather to have no reaſon but, <hi>quia complacuit, becauſe it ſo pleaſed him.</hi> Why may we not as well ask why he choſe theſe twelve from others, as why he choſe theſe three out of the twelve? If any <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will raiſe from hence any privilege to <hi>Peter,</hi> (which we could be well content to yield, if that would make them ever the honeſter men,) they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they muſt take company with them; which theſe <hi>Pompeian</hi> ſpirits cannot abide. As good no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege as any partners. And withall, they muſt ſee him more taxed for his errour in this act, then honoured by his preſence at the act: whereas the Beloved Diſciple ſaw and erred not. Theſe ſame three which were witneſſes of his Transfiguration in the mount, were witneſſes of his Agony in the garden; all three, and theſe three alone, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at both: but both times ſleeping. Theſe were <hi>arietes gregis, the Bell-weathers of the flock,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls them. Oh weak devotion of three great Diſciples!

The other was in the night, more tolerable; this by day, yea in a light above day. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> would fain excuſe it to be an amazedneſs, not a ſleep; not conſidering that they ſlept both at that Glory, and after in the Agony. To ſee that Maſter praying, one would have thought ſhould have fetcht them on their knees: eſpecially to ſee thoſe Heavenly affections look out at his Eyes; to ſee his Soul lifted up in his Hands in that tranſported faſhion to Heaven. But now the hill hath wearied their lims, their body clogs their Soul, and they fall aſleep. Whilſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaw Divine viſions, they dreamed dreams; whilſt he was in another world, raviſhed with the ſight of his Father's Glory, yea of his own, they were in another world, a world

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſo gracious an example, their own neceſſity (<hi>quia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſanter pecco, becauſe I continually ſin, Bernard</hi>'s reaſon) might have moved them to pray rather then their Maſter: and behold, in ſtead of fixing their eyes upon Heaven, they ſhut them; in ſtead of lifting up their hearts, their heads fall down upon their ſhoulders; and ſhortly, here was ſnorting in ſtead of ſighs and prayers. This was not <hi>Abraham</hi>'s or <hi>Elihu</hi>'s ecſtatical ſleep, <hi>Job</hi> 33. not the ſleep of the Church, a waking ſleep; but the plain ſleep of the eyes: and that not <gap reason="foreign">

How prone are we to it, when we ſhould mind Divine things? <hi>Adam</hi> ſlept in Paradiſe, and loſt a Rib: but this ſleep was of God's giving, and this rib was of God's taking. The good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſlept, and found tares. <hi>Eutychus</hi> ſlept, and fell. Whilſt Satan lulls us aſleep, (as he doth always rock the cradle when we ſleep in our devotions,) he ever takes ſome good from us, or puts ſome evil in us, or indangers us a deadly fall. Away with this ſpiritual Lethargy. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> had wont to ſay, that thoſe which ſleep are dead to men, thoſe that are dead are aſleep to God. But I ſay, thoſe that ſleep at Church are dead to God: ſo we preach their Funeral Sermons in ſtead of hortatory. And as he was wont to ſay, he loſt no time ſo much as that wherein he ſlept; ſo let me adde, there is no loſs of time ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as of holy time. Think that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to thee at every Sermon as he did to <hi>Peter, Etiam, Petre, dormis?

Of <hi>Eliah</hi> there may ſeem leſs doubt, ſince we know that his body was aſſumed to Heaven, and might as well come down for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s glory as go up for his own; although ſome grave Authours, as <hi>Calvin, Oecolampadius, Bale, Fulk,</hi> have held his body with <hi>Enoch</hi>'s reſolved into their elements: <hi>ſed ego non credulus illis. Enoch tranſlatus eſt in carne, &amp; Elias carneus raptus eſt in coelum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Enoch was tranſlated in the fleſh, and Elias being yet in the fleſh was taken into Heaven,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Pammachium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Moſes</hi>; though it be rare and ſingular, and <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes much ſcruple of it; yet why might not he after death return in his body to the glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, as well as afterwards many of the Saints did to the glory of his Reſurrection? I cannot therefore with the Gloſs think, there is any reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould take another, a borrowed body, rather then his own. Heaven could not give two fitter companions, more admirable to the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Miracles, more gracious with God for their Faith and Holineſs: Both of them admitted to the conference with God in <hi>Horeb</hi>; both of them Types of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; both of them faſted forty days; both of them for the glory of God ſuffered many perils; both divided the waters; both the meſſengers of God to Kings; both of them marvellous, as in their life, ſo in their end. A chariot of Angels took away <hi>Elias</hi>; he was ſought by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and not found: <hi>Michael</hi> ſtrove with the Devil for the body of <hi>Moſes</hi>; he was ſought for by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and not found: and now both of them are found here together on <hi>Tabor.</hi> This <hi>Elias</hi> ſhews himſelf to the Royall Prophet of his Church; this <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhews himſelf to the true <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael.

to God? And if <hi>Moſes</hi> his face ſo ſhone before, when he ſpoke to him without a body in mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> in the midſt of the flames and clouds; how did it ſhine now, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf glorified, ſpeaks to him a man, in <hi>Tabor,</hi> in light and majeſty? <hi>Elias</hi> hid his face before with a mantle when he paſſed by him in the Rock: now with open face he beholds him preſent, and in his own glory adores his. Let that impudent <hi>Marcion,</hi> who aſcribes the Law and Prophets to another God, and deviſes an hoſtility betwixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and them, be aſhamed to ſee <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> not onely <hi>in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquio,</hi> but <hi>in conſortio claritatis,</hi> not onely <hi>in conference,</hi> but <hi>in a partnerſhip of brightneſs</hi> (as <hi>Tertull.</hi> ſpeaks) with <hi>Chriſt</hi>; whom if he had miſliked, he had his choice of all the Quire of Heaven; and now chuſing them, why were they not <hi>in ſordibus &amp; tenebris, in rags and darkneſs? Sic inalienos demonſtrat illos, dum ſecum habet; ſic relinquendos docet, quos ſibi jungit; ſic deſtruit, quos de radiis ſuis exſtruit: So doth he ſhew them far from ſtrangeneſs to him, whom he hath with him; ſo doth he teach them to be forſaken, whom he joyns with himſelf; ſo doth he deſtroy thoſe, whom he graces with his beams of glory,</hi> ſaith that Father. His act verifies his word. <hi>Think not that I come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfill them,</hi> Matt. 5.17. Oh what conſolation, what confirmation was this to the Diſciples, to ſee ſuch examples of their future Glory, ſuch witneſſes and adorers of the eternal Deity of their Maſter? They ſaw in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> what they themſelves ſhould be. How could they ever fear to be miſerable, that ſaw ſuch precedents of their inſuing glory? how could they fear to die, that ſaw in others the happineſs of their own change? The rich Glutton pleads with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>if one came to them from the dead, they will amend: Abraham</hi> anſwers, <hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them.</hi> Behold, here is both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; and theſe too come from the dead: how can we now but be perſuaded of the happy
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47750:148"/>
ſtate of another world, unleſs we will make our ſelves worſe then the damned? See and conſider that the Saints of God are not loſt, but departed; gone into a far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with their Maſter, to return again richer and better then they went. Leſt we ſhould think this the condition of <hi>Elias</hi> onely, that was rapt into Heaven, ſee here <hi>Moſes</hi> matched with him, that died and was buried. And is this the ſtate of theſe two Saints alone? Shall none be ſeen with him in the <hi>Tabor</hi> of Heaven but thoſe which have ſeen him in <hi>Horeb</hi> and <hi>Carmel?</hi> O thou weak Chriſtian, was onely one or two lims of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s body glorious in the Transfiguration, or the whole? He is the Head, we are the Members. If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were more excellent parts, Tongue, or Hand; let us be but Heels or Toes, his body is not perfect in glory without ours. <hi>When Chriſt, which is our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall we alſo appear with him in glory,</hi> Coloſ. 3.4. How truly may we ſay to death, <hi>Rejoyce not, mine enemy; though I fall, yet ſhall I riſe</hi>; yea I ſhall riſe in falling? <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, we ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to his <hi>Theſſalonians. Elias</hi> was changed, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlept; both appeared: to teach us, that neither our ſleep nor change can keep us from appearing with him. When therefore thou ſhalt receive the ſentence of death on mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> or when the fiery chariot ſhall come and ſweep thee from this vale of mortality, remember thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious re-apparition with thy Saviour, and thou canſt not but be comforted, and chearfully triumph over that laſt Enemy, outfacing thoſe terrours with the aſſurance of a bleſſed Reſurrection to Glory.

            <p>IT falls out with this Diſcourſe as with Mount <hi>Tabor</hi> it ſelf, that it is more eaſily climbed with the eye, then with the foot. If we may not rather ſay of it, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> did of <hi>Sinai,</hi> that it doth not onely <hi>aſcenſus hominum,</hi> but <hi>aſpectus fatigare, weary</hi> not onely <hi>the ſteps</hi> but <hi>the</hi> very <hi>ſight of men.</hi> We had thought not to ſpend many breaths in the skirts of the hill, the Circumſtances; and it hath coſt us one hour's journey already: and we were glad to reſt us, ere we can have left them below us. One pauſe more (I hope) will overcome them, and ſet us on the top. No Circumſtance remains undiſcuſſed but this one, What <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> did with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their apparition. For they were not, as ſome ſleepy attendents, (like the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in the beginning,) to be there and ſee nothing; nor, as ſome ſilent ſpectatours, mute witneſſes, to ſee and ſay nothing: but (as if their Glory had no whit changed their profeſſion) they are Prophets ſtill, and <hi>foretold his departure,</hi> as S. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us. Foretold, not to him who knew it before, yea who told it them; they could not have known it but from him; he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>the Word</hi> of his Father: they told but that which he before had told his Diſciples; and now theſe Heavenly witneſſes tell it over again, for confirmation. Like as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> knew <hi>Chriſt</hi> before; he was <hi>Vox clamantis, the Voice of a crier,</hi> the other <hi>Verbum Patris, the Word of his Father</hi>; there is great affinity betwixt <hi>vox</hi> and <hi>verbum</hi>; yea this voice had uttered it ſelf clearly, <hi>Ecce Agnus Dei, Behold the Lamb of God:</hi> yet he ſends his Diſciples with an <hi>Art thou he?</hi>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:47750:149"/>
that he might confirm to them by him that which he both knew and had ſaid of him. So our Saviour follows his Fore-runner in this, that what he knew and had told his Diſciples, the other <hi>Elias,</hi> the typicall <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt make good to their belief.</p>

               <hi>a word</hi> both <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>harſh</hi>; hard to believe, and harſh in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The Diſciples thought of nothing but a Kingdome; a Kingdome reſtored magnificently, interminably: and two of theſe three witneſſes had ſo ſwallowed this hope, that they had put in for places in the State, to be his chief Peers. How could they think of a parting? The throne of <hi>David</hi> did ſo fill their eyes, that they could not ſee his Croſs: and if they muſt let down this Pill, how bitter muſt it needs be? His preſence was their joy and life; it was their death to think of his loſs. Now therefore that they might ſee that his Sufferings and Death were not of any ſudden im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, but predetermined in Heaven, and revealed to the Saints, two of the moſt noted Saints in Heaven ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the news of his departure, and that in the midſt of his Transfiguration: that they could not chuſe but think, He that can be thus happy, needs not be miſerable; that Paſſion which he will undergoe, is not out of weakneſs, but out of Love. It is wittily noted by that ſweet <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> never lightly ſpake of his Paſſion, but immediately before and after he did ſome great Miracle: And here anſwerably, in the midſt of his miraculous Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, the two Saints ſpeak of his Paſſion. A ſtrange opportunity: In his higheſt Exaltation to ſpeak of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; to talk of <hi>Calvary</hi> in <hi>Tabor</hi>; when his Head ſhone with glory, to tell him how it muſt bleed with thorns; when his Face ſhone like the Sun, to tell him it muſt be blubbered and ſpat upon; when his Garments gliſtered with that celeſtial brightneſs, to tell him they muſt be ſtripped and divided; when he was adored by the Saints of Heaven, to tell him how he muſt be ſcorned by the baſeſt of men;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47750:149"/>
when he was ſeen between two Saints, to tell him how he muſt be ſeen between two Malefactours: in a word, in the midſt of his Divine Majeſty, to tell him of his ſhame; and whilſt he was Transfigured in the Mount, to tell him how he muſt be disfigured upon the Croſs. Yet theſe two Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Prophets found this the fitteſt time for this diſcourſe: rather chuſing to ſpeak of his Sufferings in the height of his Glory, then of his Glory after his Sufferings. It is moſt ſeaſonable in our beſt to think of our worſt eſtate: for both that thought will be beſt digeſted when we are well; and that change will be beſt prepared for when we are the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from it. You would perhaps think it unſeaſonable for me, in the midſt of all your Court-jollity to tell you of the days of mourning, and, with that great King, to ſerve in a Death's head amongſt your Royall diſhes, to ſhew your Coffins in the midſt of your Triumphs: yet theſe precedents above exception ſhew me that no time is ſo fit as this. Let me therefore ſay to you, with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are Gods:</hi> if ye were Transfigured in <hi>Tabor,</hi> could ye be more? <hi>but ye ſhall die like men:</hi> there is your <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. It was a worthy and witty note of <hi>Hierome,</hi> that amongſt all trees, the Cedars are bidden to praiſe God, which are the talleſt: and yet <hi>Dies Domini ſuper omnes Cedros Libani,</hi> Eſa. 2. Ye Gallants, whom a little yellow earth and the webs of that curious worm have made gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous without, and perhaps proud within, remember that ere long, as one worm decks you without, ſo another worm ſhall conſume you within; and that both the earth that you pranck up, and that earth wherewith you pranck it, is running back into duſt. Let not your high eſtate hide from you your fatall humiliation: let not not your Purples hide from you your Winding-ſheet: But even on the top of <hi>Tabor</hi> think of the depth of the Grave: think of your departure from men, while ye are advanced above men.</p>
            <p>We are now aſcended to the top of the Hill. Let us therefore ſtand, and ſee, and wonder at this great ſight: as
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47750:150"/>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſee the <hi>buſh flaming, and not conſumed</hi>; ſo we, to ſee the Humanity continuing it ſelf in the midſt of theſe beams of Glory. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>formam ſervi accipiens.</hi> There is no danger in this ambiguity. Not the ſubſtantiall form, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal faſhion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was changed: he having three forms, (as <hi>Bernard</hi> diſtinguiſhes) <hi>contemptam, ſplendidam, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> changeth here the firſt into the ſecond. This is one of the rareſt occurrences that ever befell the Saviour of the World. I am wont to reckon up theſe four principall won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of his life, Incarnation, Temptation, Transfiguration, and Agony: the firſt in the womb of the Virgin, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the Wilderneſs, the third in the Mount, the fourth in the Garden: the firſt, that God ſhould become Man; the ſecond, that God and Man ſhould be tempted and tranſported by Satan; the third, that Man ſhould be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified upon earth; the laſt, that he which was Man and God ſhould ſweat bloud under the ſenſe of God's wrath for man. And all theſe either had the Angels for witneſſes, or the immediate voice of God. The firſt had Angels ſinging, the ſecond Angels miniſtring, the third the voice of God thundring, the fourth the Angels comforting: that it may be no wonder, the Earth marvels at thoſe things whereat the Angels of Heaven ſtand amazed. <hi>Bernard</hi> makes three kinds of wonderfull changes: <hi>Sublimitas in Humilitatem, Height to lowlineſs,</hi> when the Word took fleſh; <hi>Contemptibilitas in Majeſtatem,</hi> when <hi>Chriſt</hi> transformed himſelf before his Diſciples; <hi>Mutabilitas in Aeternitatem,</hi> when he roſe again, and aſcended to Heaven to reign for ever. Ye ſee this is one of them: and as <hi>Tabor</hi> did riſe
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47750:150"/>
out of the valley of <hi>Galilee,</hi> ſo this Exaltation did riſe out of the midſt of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Humiliation. Other marvels do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his dejection, this onely makes for his Glory; and the glory of this is matchable with the humiliation of all the reſt. That Face wherein before (ſaith <hi>Eſay) there was no form, nor beauty,</hi> now ſhines as the Sun: That Face which men hid their faces from in contempt, now ſhines ſo, that mortall eyes could not chuſe but hide themſelves from the luſter of it, and immortall receive their beams from it. He had ever <hi>in vultu ſidereum quiddam,</hi> as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>a certain heavenly</hi> Majeſty and port <hi>in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> which made his Diſciples follow him at firſt ſight; but now here was the perfection of ſuperceleſtiall bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It was a Miracle in the Three Children, that they ſo were delivered from the flames, that their very garments ſmelt not of the fire: it is no leſs Miracle in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that his very garments were dyed Celeſtiall, and did ſavour of his Glory: like as <hi>Aaron</hi> was ſo anointed on his head and beard, that his skirts were all perfumed. His cloaths there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhined as ſnow, yea (that were but a wateriſh white) as the Light it ſelf, ſaith S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and <hi>Matthew,</hi> in the moſt Greek Copies. That ſeamleſs Coat, as it had no welt, ſo it had no ſpot. The King's Son is all fair, even without. O excellent Glory of his Humanity! The beſt Diamond or Carbuncle is hid with a caſe: but this brightneſs pierceth through all his garments, and makes them lightſome in him, which uſe to conceal light in others. <hi>Herod</hi> put him on in mockage <gap reason="foreign">

Thine head is as fine gold, thy mouth is as ſweet things, and thou art wholly delectable. Come forth, ye daughters of Sion, and behold King Solomon with the Crown wherewith his Father crowned him, in the day of the

gladneſs of his heart.</hi> O Saviour, if thou wert ſuch in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> what art thou in Heaven? if this were the glory of thy Humanity, what is the preſence of thy Godhead? Let no man yet wrong himſelf ſo much as to magnifie this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as another's, and to put himſelf out of the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this glory. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our head, we are his members. As we all were in the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> both innocent and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; ſo are we in the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> both ſhining in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> and bleeding ſweat in the Garden. And as we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready happy in him, ſo ſhall we be once in our ſelves by and through him. <hi>He ſhall change our vile bodies, that they may be like his glorious body.</hi> Behold our pattern, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; <hi>like his glorious body.</hi> Theſe very bodies, that are now cloddy like the earth, ſhall once be bright as the Sun: and we, that now ſee clay in one anothers faces, ſhall then ſee nothing but Heaven in our countenances: and we, that now ſet forth our bodies with cloaths, ſhall then be cloathed upon with Immortality, out of the wardrobe of Heaven. And if ever any painted face ſhould be admitted to the ſight of this Glory, (as I much fear it; yea I am ſure God will have none but true faces in Heaven;) they would be aſhamed to think that ever they had faces to daub with theſe beaſtly pigments, in compariſon of this Heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. Let us therefore look upon this fleſh, not ſo much with contempt of what it was and is, as with a joyfull hope of what it ſhall be. And when our courage is aſſaulted with the change of theſe bodies from healthfull to weak, from living to dead; let us comfort our ſelves with the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of this change from duſt to incorruption. We are not ſo ſure of death, as of transfiguration. <hi>All the days of</hi> our <hi>appointed time</hi> we <hi>will therefore wait, till</hi> our <hi>changing ſhall come.</hi>

All ſlept, and now all waked; onely <hi>Peter</hi> ſlept waking, and I know not whether more erred in his ſpeech or in his ſleep. It was a ſhame for a man to ſleep in <hi>Tabor</hi>; but it is more a ſhame for a man to dream with his eyes open. Thus did <hi>Peter; Maſter, it is good for us to be here.

God would never have recorded that which it ſhould be uncharitable for us to obſerve. It was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious kindneſs of <hi>Marcion</hi> in honour of <hi>Peter,</hi> to leave out the ſtory of <hi>Malchus,</hi> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> notes: It ſhall be our blame, if we do not ſo note, that we benefit our ſelves even by his imperfections. S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel is ſaid to be <hi>Peter</hi>'s. O bleſſed Apoſtle, can it be any wrong to ſay of thee that which thou haſt written of thy ſelf, not for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, not for exprobration? God forbid but that men may be aſhamed to give that to him which he hath denied to himſelf. Let me therefore not doubt to ſay, (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to ſo great a Saint) that as he ſpake moſt, ſo he is noted to have erred moſt. Not to meddle with his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, ſtriking, Judaizing; one while we find him carnally inſinuating, another while carnally preſuming; one while weakly denying, another while raſhly miſconſtruing.

Beſides aſtoniſhment, here was a fervour of ſpirit; a love to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s glory, and a delight in it: a fire, but miſplaced, on the top of the chimney, not on the hearth: <hi>praematura devotio,</hi> as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>a devotion,</hi> but <hi>raſh</hi> and heady. And if it had not been ſo, yet it is not in the power of a good intention to make a ſpeech good. In this the matter failed: For what ſhould ſuch Saints doe in earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, in Tabernacles of his making? And if he could be content to live there without a tent, (for he would have but three made,) why did he not much more conceive ſo of thoſe Heavenly gueſts? And if he ſpoke this to retain them, how weak was it to think their abſence would be for want of houſe-room? Or how could that at once be which <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> had told him, and that which he wiſhed? For how ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> both depart at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſtay in the Mount?

there, to avoid the ſufferings at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> how did he yet again ſing over that ſong for which he had heard before, <hi>Come behind me, Satan?</hi> Or if it had been fit for <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have ſtaied there, how weakly doth he (which <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> obſerves) equalize the Servant with the Maſter, the Saints with God?

Ye delicateſt Courtiers, tell me, if Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it ſelf have not an unpleaſant tediouſneſs hanging upon it, and more ſting then honey. And whereas all happineſs (even here below) is in the viſion of God; how is our ſpirituall eye hindered, as the body is from his Object, by darkneſs, by falſe light, by averſion? Darkneſs; he that doeth ſin is in darkneſs: Falſe light; whilſt we meaſure eternal things by temporary: Averſion; whilſt, as weak eyes hate the light, we turn our eyes from the true and immutable good, to the fickle and uncertain. We are not on the hill, but in the valley; where we have tabernacles, not of our own making, but of clay; and ſuch as wherein we are witneſſes of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not transfigured in glory, but blemiſhed with diſhonour, diſhonoured with oaths and blaſphemies, re-crucified with our ſins; witneſſes of God's Saints, not ſhining in <hi>Tabor,</hi> but mourning in darkneſs, and, in ſtead of that Heavenly brightneſs, cloathed with ſackcloath and aſhes. Then and there we ſhall have <hi>taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles not made with hands, eternall in the heavens,</hi> where we ſhall ſee how ſweet the Lord is; we ſhall ſee the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we ſhall hear and ſing the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of Saints. <hi>Quae nunc nos angit veſania vitiorum, ſitire abſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thium,</hi> &amp;c? ſaith that devout Father.

There ſhall be no ſorrow, no pain, no complaint, no fear, no death. There is no malice to riſe againſt us, no miſery to afflict us, no hunger, thirſt,

What ſtick we at, my beloved? Is there a Heaven? or is there none? have we a Saviour there? or have we none? We know there is a Heaven, as ſure as that there is an earth below us; we know we have a Saviour there, as ſure as there are men that we converſe with upon earth; we know there is happineſs, as ſure as we know there is miſery and mutability upon earth. Oh our miſerable ſottiſhneſs and infidelity, if we do not contemn the beſt offers of the world, and, lifting up our eyes and hearts to Heaven, ſay, <hi>Bonum eſt eſſe hîc!</hi>

            <head>XXXI. The Proſecution of the Transfiguration.</head>
            <p>BEfore, the Diſciples eyes were dazzled with Glory; now, the brightneſs of that Glory is ſhaded with a <hi>Cloud.</hi> Frail and feeble eyes of mortality cannot look upon an Heavenly luſter. That Cloud imports both Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and obſcuration. Majeſty; for it was the teſtimony of God's preſence of old: the Cloud covered the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the Tabernacle, the Oracle. He that makes the clouds his chariot, was in a cloud carried up into Heaven. Where have we mention of any Divine repreſentation, but a Cloud is one part of it? What comes nearer to Heaven, either in place or reſemblance? Obſcuration: for as it ſhew'd there was a Majeſty, and that Divine; ſo it ſhew'd them that the view of that Majeſty was not for bodily eyes. Like as when ſome great Prince walks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Canopy, that veil ſhews there is a Great perſon under it, but withall reſtrains the eye from a free ſight of his perſon. And if the cloud were clear, yet it ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them. Why then was this cloud interpoſed betwixt that glorious Viſion and them, but for a check of their bold eyes?</p>
            <p>Had they too long gazed upon this reſplendent ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as their eyes had been blinded, ſo their hearts had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps grown to an over-bold familiarity with that Heavenly Object: How ſeaſonably doth the cloud intercept it? The wiſe God knows our need of theſe viciſſitudes and allays. If we have a light, we muſt have a cloud; if a light to chear us, we muſt have a cloud to humble us. It was ſo in <hi>Sinai,</hi> it was ſo in <hi>Sion,</hi> it was ſo in <hi>Olivet</hi>; it ſhall never
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:47750:156"/>
be but ſo. The naturall day and night do not more duely interchange then this light and cloud. Above we ſhall have the light without the cloud, a clear viſion and fruition of God without all dim and ſad interpoſitions: below we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free from theſe miſts and clouds of ſorrow and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>But this was a <hi>bright cloud.</hi> There is difference betwixt the cloud in <hi>Tabor,</hi> and that in <hi>Sinai:</hi> This was clear, that darkſome. There is darkneſs in the Law, there is light in the grace of the Goſpel. <hi>Moſes</hi> was there ſpoken to in darkneſs; here he was ſpoken with in light. In that dark cloud there was terrour; in this there was comfort. Though it were a Cloud then, yet it was bright; and though it were bright, yet it was a Cloud. With much light there was ſome ſhade. God would not ſpeak to them concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi> out of darkneſs: neither yet would he manifeſt himſelf to them in an abſolute brightneſs. All his appearances have this mixture. What need I other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance then in theſe two Saints? <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake oft to God mouth to mouth: yet not ſo immediately, but that there was ever ſomewhat drawn as a curtain betwixt God and him; either fire in <hi>Horeb,</hi> or ſmoak in <hi>Sinai:</hi> ſo as his face was not more veiled from the people, then God's from him. <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall be ſpoken to by God, but in the rock, and under a mantle. In vain ſhall we hope for any revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God, but in a cloud. Worldly hearts are in ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter darkneſs, they ſee not ſo much as the leaſt glimpſe of theſe Divine beams, not a beam of that inacceſſible light: The beſt of his Saints ſee him here but in a cloud, or in a glaſs. Happy are we, if God have honoured us with theſe Divine repreſentations of himſelf. Once, <hi>in his light we ſhall ſee light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can eaſily think with what amazedneſs theſe three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples ſtood compaſſed in that bright Cloud, expecting ſome miraculous event of ſo Heavenly a Viſion; when ſuddenly they might hear a voice ſounding out of that
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:47750:156"/>
Cloud ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed; hear him.</hi> They need not be told whoſe that voice was; the place, the matter evinced it. No Angel in Heaven could, or durſt have ſaid ſo. How gladly doth <hi>Peter</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards recount it? <hi>For he received from God the Father ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, when there came ſuch a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It was onely the ear that was here taught, not the eye. As of <hi>Horeb,</hi> ſo of <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſo of <hi>Tabor</hi> might God ſay, <hi>Ye ſaw no ſhape nor image in that day that the Lord ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> He that knows our proneneſs to idolatry, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids thoſe occaſions which we might take to abuſe our own fancies.</p>
            <p>Twice hath God ſpoken theſe words to his own Son from Heaven; once in his Baptiſm, and now again in his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration. Here not without ſome oppoſitive compariſon; Not <hi>Moſes,</hi> not <hi>Elias,</hi> but <hi>This. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were Servants; this a <hi>Son. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were ſons, but of grace and choice; this is <hi>that Son,</hi> the Son by nature. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſons are <hi>beloved</hi> as of favour, and free election; this is <hi>The Beloved,</hi> as in the unity of his eſſence. Others are ſo beloved, that he is pleaſed with themſelves; this ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that <hi>in</hi> and for <hi>him</hi> he is <hi>pleaſed</hi> with mankind. As the relation betwixt the Father and the Son is infinite, ſo is the Love. We meaſure the intenſion of Love by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion: The love that reſts in the perſon affected alone, is but ſtreight; true Love deſcends (like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) from the head to the skirts, to children, friends, allies. O incomprehenſibly-large love of God the Father to the Son, that for his ſake he is pleaſed with the world! O perfect and happy complacence! Out of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there is nothing but enmity betwixt God and the Soul; in him there can be nothing but peace. When the beams are met in one center, they do not onely heat, but burn. Our weak love is diffuſed to many; God hath ſome, the world more; and therein wives, children, friends:
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:47750:157"/>
but this infinite love of God hath all the beams of it united in one onely Object, the Son of his Love. Neither doth he love any thing but in the participation of his Love, in the derivation from it. O God, let me be found in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and how canſt thou but be pleaſed with me?</p>
            <p>This one voice proclaims <hi>Chriſt</hi> at once the Son of God, the Reconciler of the world, the Doctour and Law-giver of his Church. As the Son of God, he is eſſentially intereſſed in his Love: as he is the Reconciler of the world in whom God is well pleaſed, he doth moſt juſtly challenge our love and adherence: as he is the Doctour and Law-giver, he doth juſtly challenge our audience, our obedience. Even ſo, Lord, teach us to hear and obey thee as our Teacher; to love thee and believe in thee as our Reconciler; and as the eternall Son of thy Father to adore thee.</p>
            <p>The light cauſed wonder in the Diſciples; but the voice aſtoniſhment: They are all fallen down upon their faces. Who can blame a mortall man to be thus affected with the voice of his Maker? Yet this word was but plauſible and hortatory. O God, how ſhall fleſh and bloud be other then ſwallowed up with the horrour of thy dreadfull ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death? <hi>The Lion ſhall roar, who ſhall not be afraid?</hi> How ſhall thoſe who have ſlighted the ſweet voice of thine invitations, call to the rocks to hide them from the terrour of thy Judgments?</p>
            <p>The God of mercies pities our infirmities. I do not hear our Saviour ſay, Ye lay ſleeping one while upon the earth; now ye lie aſtoniſhed: Ye could neither wake to ſee, nor ſtand to hear; now lie ſtill and tremble. But he graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly touches and comforts them; <hi>Ariſe, fear not.</hi> That voice which ſhall once raiſe them up out of the earth, might well raiſe them up from it. That hand which by the leaſt touch reſtored ſight, lims, life, might well reſtore the ſpirits of the diſmaied. O Saviour, let that ſovereign hand of thine touch us when we lie in the trances of our griefs, in the bed of our ſecurities, in the grave of our ſins, and we ſhall ariſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:47750:157"/>
               <hi>They looking up ſaw no man ſave Jeſus alone:</hi> and that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in his wonted form. All was now gone, <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> the Cloud, the Voice, the Glory: <hi>Tabor</hi> it ſelf cannot be long bleſſed with that Divine light and thoſe ſhining gueſts. Heaven will not allow to earth any long continuance of Glory. Onely above is conſtant Happineſs to be look'd for and injoyed, where we ſhall ever ſee our Saviour in his unchangeable brightneſs, where the light ſhall never be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clouded or varied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> are gone, onely <hi>Chriſt</hi> is left. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Law and the Prophets was but temporary, yea momentany; that onely <hi>Chriſt</hi> may remain to us intire and conſpicuous. They came but to give teſtimony to <hi>Chriſt</hi>; when that is done, they are vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>Neither could theſe raiſed Diſciples find any miſs of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> when they had <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtill with them. Had <hi>Jeſus</hi> been gone, and left either <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Elias,</hi> or both, in the Mount with his Diſciples, that preſence (though glorious) could not have comforted them. Now that they are gone, and he is left, they cannot be capable of diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. O Saviour, it matters not who is away, whilſt thou art with us. Thou art God all-ſufficient; what can we want when we want not thee? Thy preſence ſhall make <hi>Tabor</hi> it ſelf an Heaven: yea, Hell it ſelf cannot make us miſerable with the fruition of thee.</p>

Perhaps, the man, knowing his danger, made uſe of his ſtrength to ſhift away, and violently brake from his apprehenders. Or was it out of cunning? in that they hoped for more likely matter to accuſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the caſe of the woman, then of the man: for that they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his mercifull diſpoſition might more probably incline to compaſſionate her weakneſs, rather then the ſtronger veſſell.</p>
            <p>Or was it rather out of partiality? Was it not then, as now, that the weakeſt ſooneſt ſuffers; and impotency lays
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47750:158"/>
us open to the malice of an enemy? Small flies hang in the webs, whilſt waſps break through without controll. The wand and the ſheet are for poor offenders; the great either out-face or out-buy their ſhame. A beggarly drunkard is haled to the Stocks, whilſt the rich is chambered up to ſleep out his ſurfeit.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe grounds is the woman brought to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Not to the mount of Olives, not to the way, not to his private lodging; but to the Temple: and that not to ſome obſcure angle; but into the face of the aſſembly.</p>
            <p>They pleaded for her death; the puniſhment which they would onwards inflict was her ſhame: which muſt needs be ſo much more, as there were more eyes to be witneſſes of her guiltineſs. All the brood of ſin affects darkneſs and ſecrecy, but this more properly; the twilight, the night is for the adulterer. It cannot be better fitted then to be dragged out into the light of the Sun, and to be proclaimed with hootings and baſins. Oh the impudence of thoſe men who can make merry profeſſions of their own beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and boaſt of the ſhamefull trophees of their Luſt!</p>
            <p>Methinks I ſee this miſerable Adultereſs how ſhe ſtands confounded amidſt that gazing and diſdainfull multitude; how ſhe hides her head, how ſhe wipes her blubbered face and weeping eyes. In the mean time it is no dumb ſhow that is here acted by theſe Scribes and Phariſees; they ſtep forth boldly to her accuſation. <hi>Maſter, this Woman was taken in adultery in the very act.</hi> How plauſibly do they begin? Had I ſtood by and heard them, ſhould I not have ſaid, What holy, honeſt, conſcionable men are theſe? what devout clients of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> with what reverence they come to him? with what zeal of juſtice? When he that made and ranſacks their boſom tells me, <hi>All this is done but to tempt him.</hi> Even the falſeſt hearts will have the plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt mouths: like to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Curtizan, <hi>their lips drop as an hony-comb, and their mouth is ſmoother then oyl; but their end is bitter as wormwood.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:47750:159"/>Falſe and hollow Phariſees, he is your Maſter whom ye ſerve, not he whom ye tempt: onely in this ſhall he be approved your Maſter, that he ſhall pay your wages, and give you your portion with hypocrites.</p>
            <p>The act of Adultery was her crime: to be taken in the very act, was no part of her ſin, but the proof of her juſt conviction: yet her deprehenſion is made an aggravation of her ſhame. Such is the corrupt judgement of the world: To doe ill troubles not men, but to be taken in doing it: unknown filthineſs paſſeth away with eaſe; it is the notice that perplexes them, not the guilt. But, O fooliſh ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, all your packing and ſecrecy cannot ſo contrive it, but that ye ſhall be taken in the manner; your Conſcience takes you ſo; the God of Heaven takes you ſo: and ye ſhall once find that your Conſcience is more then a thouſand witneſſes, and God more then a thouſand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
            <p>They that complain of the act, urge the puniſhment; <hi>Now Moſes in the Law commanded us that ſuch ſhould be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> Where did <hi>Moſes</hi> bid ſo? Surely the particularity of this execution was without the book. Tradition and cuſtome enacted it, not the Law.</p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded death to both the offenders, not the manner of death to either: By analogy it holds thus. It is flatly commanded in the caſe of a Damſell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed to an Huſband, and found not to be a Virgin; in the caſe of a Damſell betrothed, who, being defiled in the city, cried not; Tradition and cuſtome made up the reſt; obtaining, out of this ground, that all Adulterers ſhould be executed by lapidation. The ancienter puniſhment was burning; death always, though in divers forms. I ſhame to think that Chriſtians ſhould ſlight that ſin which both <hi>Jews</hi> and Pagans held ever deadly.</p>
            <p>What a miſ-citation is this? <hi>Moſes commanded.</hi> The Law, was God's, not <hi>Moſes</hi>'s. If <hi>Moſes</hi> were imployed to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate betwixt God and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Law is never the more
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47750:159"/>
his: He was the hand of God to reach the Law to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the hand of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to take it from God. We do not name the water from the pipes, but from the ſpring. It is not for a true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to reſt in the ſecond means, but to mount up to the ſupreme originall of juſtice. How reverent ſoever an opinion was had of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he cannot be thus named without a ſhamefull undervaluing of the royall Law of his Maker. There is no mortall man whoſe authority may not grow into contempt: that of the ever-living God cannot but be ever ſacred and inviolable. It is now with the Goſpel, as it was then with the Law: the word is no other then <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s, though delivered by our weakneſs; whoſoever be the Crier, the Proclamation is the King's of Heaven. Whilſt it goes for ours, it is no marvell if it lie open to deſpight.</p>
            <p>How captious a word is this? <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid thus, <hi>what ſaieſt thou?</hi> If they be not ſure that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid ſo, why do they affirm it? and if they be ſure, why do they queſtion that which they know decided? They would not have deſired a better advantage, then a contradiction to that received Law-giver. It is their profeſſion, <hi>We are Moſes's diſciples</hi>; and, <hi>We know that God ſpake to Moſes.</hi> It had been quarrel enough to oppoſe ſo known a Prophet. Still I find it the drift of the enemies of truth, to ſet <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> together by the ears; in the matter of the Sabbath, of Circumciſion, of Marriage and Divorce, of the uſe of the Law, of Juſtification by the Law, of the ſenſe and extent of the Law, and where not? But they ſhall never be able to effect it: they two are faſt and indiſſoluble friends on both parts for ever; each ſpeaks for other, each eſtabliſhes other; they are ſubordinate, they cannot be oppoſite; <hi>Moſes</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as a ſervant, <hi>Chriſt</hi> as a Son. A faithfull ſervant cannot but be officious to the Son. The true uſe we make of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> is, to be our Schoolmaſter to teach us, to whip us unto <hi>Chriſt</hi>; the true uſe we make of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, to ſupply <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. By him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which they could not be juſtified by the law of Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:47750:160"/>Thus muſt we hold in with both, if we will have our part in either: So ſhall <hi>Moſes</hi> bring us to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> to glory.</p>
            <p>Had theſe Phariſees out of ſimplicity, and deſire of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a caſe of doubt, moved this queſtion to our Saviour, it had been no leſs commendable then now it is blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, whither ſhould we have recourſe but to thine Oracle? Thou art the Word of the Father, the Doctour of the Church. Whilſt we hear from others, What ſay Fathers? what ſay Councils? let them hear from us, <hi>What ſayeſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here it was far otherwiſe: they came not to learn, but to tempt; and to tempt that they might accuſe. Like their Father the Devil, who ſolicits to ſin, that he may plead againſt us for yieldance. Fain would theſe collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing adverſaries draw <hi>Chriſt</hi> to contradict <hi>Moſes,</hi> that they might take advantage of his contradiction.</p>
            <p>On the one ſide, they ſaw his readineſs to tax the falſe gloſſes which their preſumptuous Doctours had put upon the Law, with an <hi>I ſay unto you:</hi> on the other, they ſaw his inclination to mercy and commiſeration in all his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſo far as to neglect even ſome circumſtances of the Law; as, to touch the Leper, to heal on the Sabbath, to eat with known ſinners, to diſmiſs an infamous (but penitent) of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, to ſelect and countenance two noted Publicans: and hereupon they might perhaps think that his compaſſion might draw him to croſs this Moſaical inſtitution.</p>
            <p>What a crafty bait is here laid for our Saviour? Such as he cannot bite at, and not be taken. It ſeems to them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould avoid a deep prejudice either to his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or mercy. For thus they imagine; Either <hi>Chriſt</hi> will ſecond <hi>Moſes</hi> in ſentencing this woman to death, or elſe he will croſs <hi>Moſes</hi> in diſmiſſing her unpuniſhed. If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand her to be ſtoned, he loſes the honour of his clemency and Mercy; if he appoint her diſmiſſion, he loſes the honour of his Juſtice. Indeed, ſtrip him of either of theſe, and he can be no Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:47750:160"/>O the cunning folly of vain men, that hope to beguile Wiſedom it ſelf!</p>
            <p>Silence and neglect ſhall firſt confound thoſe men, whom after his anſwer will ſend away convicted. In ſtead of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his mouth, our Saviour bows his body; and in ſtead of returning words from his lips, writes characters on the ground with his finger. O Saviour, I had rather ſilently wonder at thy geſture, then inquire curiouſly into the words thou wroteſt, or the myſteries of thus writing: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly herein I ſee thou meanteſt to ſhew a diſregard to theſe malicious and buſy cavillers. Sometimes taciturnity and contempt are the beſt anſwers. Thou that haſt bidden us <hi>Be wiſe as ſerpents,</hi> giveſt us this noble example of thy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. It was moſt ſafe that theſe tempters ſhould be thus kept faſting with a ſilent diſreſpect, that their eagerneſs might juſtly draw upon them an inſuing ſhame.</p>
            <p>The more unwillingneſs they ſaw in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to give his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, the more preſſive and importunate they were to draw it from him. Now, as forced by their ſo zealous irritation, our Saviour rouzeth up himſelf, and gives it them home, with a reprehenſory and ſtinging ſatisfaction; <hi>He that is without ſin among you, let him firſt caſt a ſtone at her.</hi> As if his very action had ſaid,
<q>I was loth to have ſhamed you; and therefore could have been willing not to have heard your ill-meant motion: but ſince you will needs have it, and by your vehemence force my juſtice, I muſt tell you, there is not one of you but is as faulty as ſhe whom ye accuſe; there is no difference, but that your ſin is ſmothered in ſecrecy, hers is brought forth into the light. Ye had more need to make your own peace by an humble repentance, then to urge ſeverity againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I deny not but <hi>Moſes</hi> hath juſtly from God impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the penalty of death upon ſuch hainous offences: but what then would become of you? If death be her due, yet not by thoſe your unclean hands: your hearts know you are not honeſt enough to accuſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:47750:161"/>Lo, not the bird, but the fouler is taken. He ſays not, Let her be ſtoned; this had been againſt the courſe of his Mercy: he ſays not, Let her not be ſtoned; this had been againſt the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Now he ſo anſwers, that both his Juſtice and Mercy are entire; ſhe diſmiſſed, they ſhamed.</p>
            <p>It was the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in thoſe hainous crimes that were puniſhed with Lapidation, that the witneſſes and accuſers ſhould be the firſt that ſhould lay hands upon the guilty: well doth our Saviour therefore choak theſe accuſers with the conſcience of their ſo foul incompetency. With what face, with what heart could they ſtone their own ſin in another perſon?</p>
            <p>Honeſty is too mean a term. Theſe Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees were noted for extraordinary and admired Holineſs: the outſide of their lives was not onely inoffenſive, but Saint-like and exemplary. Yet that all-ſeeing eye of the Son of God, which <hi>found folly in the Angels,</hi> hath much more found wickedneſs in theſe glorious Profeſſours. It is not for nothing that <hi>his eyes are like a flame of fire.</hi> What ſecret is there which he ſearches not? Retire your ſelves, O ye fooliſh ſinners, into your inmoſt cloſets, yea (if ye can) into the center of the earth; his eye follows you, and obſerves all your carriages: no bolt, no bar, no dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs can keep him out. No thief was ever ſo impudent as to ſteal in the very face of the Judge. O God, let me ſee my ſelf ſeen by thee, and I ſhall not dare to offend.</p>
            <p>Beſides notice, here is exprobration. Theſe mens ſins, as they had been ſecret, ſo they were forgotten. It is long ſince they were done; neither did they think to have heard any more news of them. And now when time and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had quite worn them out of thought, he that ſhall once be their Judge, calls them to a back-reckoning.</p>
            <p>One time or other ſhall that juſt God lay our ſins in our diſh, and make us poſſeſs the ſins of our youth. <hi>Theſe things thou didſt, and I kept ſilence; and thou thoughteſt I was like unto thy ſelf: but I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:47750:161"/>
thee.</hi> The penitent man's ſin lies before him for his humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; the impenitent's, for his ſhame and confuſion.</p>
            <p>The act of ſin is tranſient, not ſo the guilt; that will ſtick by us, and return upon us, either in the height of our ſecurity, or the depth of our miſery, when we ſhall be leaſt able to bear it. How juſt may it be with God to take us at advantages, and then to lay his arreſt upon us when we are laid up upon a former ſuit?</p>
            <p>It is but juſt there ſhould be a requiſition of innocence in them that proſecute the vices of others. The offender is worthy of ſtoning, but who ſhall caſt them? How ill would they become hands as guilty as her own? What doe they but ſmite themſelves, who puniſh their own offences in other men? Nothing is more unjuſt or abſurd, then for the beam to cenſure the moat, the oven to upbraid the kiln. It is a falſe and vagrant zeal that begins not firſt at home.</p>
            <p>Well did our Saviour know how bitter and ſtrong a pill he had given to theſe falſe Juſticiaries; and now he will take leiſure to ſee how it wrought: whilſt therefore he gives time to them to ſwallow it, and put it over, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his old geſture of a ſeeming inadvertency. How ſped the receit?</p>
            <p>I do not ſee any one of them ſtand out with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and plead his own innocency; and yet theſe men (which is very remarkable) placed the fulfilling or violation of the Law onely in the outward act. Their hearts miſgave them, that if they ſhould have ſtood out in conteſtation with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he would have utterly ſhamed them, by diſplaying their old and ſecret ſins; and have ſo convinced them by undeniable circumſtances, that they ſhould never have clawed off the reproach: <hi>And</hi> therefore <hi>when they heard it, being convicted by their own conſcience, they went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt, even unto the laſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There might ſeem to be ſome kind of mannerly order in this guilty departure. Not all at once; leſt they ſhould
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47750:162"/>
ſeem violently chaſed away by this charge of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> now their ſlinking away <hi>one by one</hi> may ſeem to carry a ſhew of a deliberate and voluntary diſceſſion. <hi>The eldeſt</hi> firſt. The ancienter is fitter to give then take example; and the younger could think it no ſhame to follow the ſteps of a grave fore-man.</p>
            <p>O wonderfull power of conſcience! Man can no more ſtand out againſt it, then it can ſtand out againſt God. The Almighty, whoſe ſubſtitute is ſet in our boſome, ſets it on work to accuſe. It is no denying, when that ſays we are guilty; when that condemns us, in vain are we acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the world. With what bravery did theſe Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites come to ſet upon <hi>Chriſt?</hi> with what triumph did they inſult upon that guilty Soul? Now they are thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck with their own Conſcience, and drop away con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; and well is he that can run away fartheſt from his own ſhame. No wicked man needs to ſeek out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a Judge, Accuſer, Witneſs, Tormentour.</p>
            <p>No ſooner do theſe Hypocrites hear of their ſins from the mouth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then they are gone. Had they been ſincerely touched with a true remorſe, they would have rather come to him upon their knees, and have ſaid,
<q>Lord, we know and find that thou knoweſt our ſecret ſins; this argues thy Divine Omniſcience. Thou that art able to know our ſins, art able to remit them. O par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the iniquities of thy ſervants. Thou that accuſeſt us, do thou alſo acquit us.</q>
But now in ſtead hereof, they turn their back upon their Saviour, and haſte away.</p>
            <p>An impenitent man cares not how little he hath either of the preſence of God, or of the mention of his ſins. O fools! if ye could run away from God, it were ſomewhat; but whilſt ye move in him, what doe ye? whither go ye? Ye may run from his Mercy, ye cannot but run upon his Judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>left alone.</hi> Alone in reſpect of theſe complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants; not alone in reſpect of the multitude: there yet ſtands the mournfull Adultereſs. She might have gone forth
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:47750:162"/>
with them; no body conſtrained her ſtay: but that which ſent them away, ſtayed her, Conſcience. She knew her guiltineſs was publickly accuſed, and durſt not be by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf denied: as one that was therefore faſtened there by her own guilty heart, ſhe ſtirs not till ſhe may receive a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour was not ſo buſie in writing, but that he read the while the guilt and abſence of thoſe accuſers; he that knew what they had done, knew no leſs what they did, what they would doe. Yet, as if the matter had been ſtrange to him, <hi>he lifts up himſelf, and ſays, Woman, where are thy accuſers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How well was this ſinner to be left there? Could ſhe be in a ſafer place then before the Tribunall of a Saviour? Might ſhe have choſen her refuge, whither ſhould ſhe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have fled? O happy we, if when we are convinced in our ſelves of our ſins, we can ſet our ſelves before that Judge who is our Surety, our Advocate, our Redeemer, our ranſome, our peace!</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs, ſhe ſtood doubtfull betwixt hope and fear; Hope, in that ſhe ſaw her accuſers gone; Fear, in that ſhe knew what ſhe had deſerved: and now whilſt ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in expectation of a ſentence, ſhe hears, <hi>Woman, where are thy accuſers?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein our Saviour intends the ſatisfaction of all the hearers, of all the beholders: that they might apprehend the guiltineſs, and therefore the unfitneſs, of the accuſers; and might well ſee there was no warrantable ground of his farther proceeding againſt her.</p>
            <p>Two things are neceſſary for the execution of a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, Evidence, Sentence; the one from Witneſſes, the other from the Judge. Our Saviour asks for both. The accuſation and proof muſt draw on the ſentence; the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence muſt proceed upon the evidence of the proof. <hi>Where are thy accuſers? hath no man condemned thee?</hi> Had ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed legally upon the Adultereſs, doubtleſs our
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47750:163"/>
Saviour would not have acquitted her: For as he would not intrude upon others offices, ſo he would not croſs or violate the juſtice done by others. But now, finding the coaſt clear, he ſays, <hi>Neither do I condemn thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What, Lord? doſt thou then ſhew favour to foul offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Art thou rather pleaſed that groſs ſins ſhould be blanched, and ſent away with a gentle connivency? Far, far be this from the perfection of thy Juſtice. He that hence argues Adulteries not puniſhable by death, let him argue the unlawfulneſs of dividing of inheritances, becauſe in the caſe of the two wrangling brethren thou ſaidſt, <hi>Who made me a divider of inheritances?</hi> Thou declinedſt the office, thou didſt not diſlike the act, either of parting lands, or puniſhing offenders. Neither was here any abſolution of the woman from a ſentence of death, but a diſmiſſion of her from thy ſentence, which thou kneweſt not proper for thee to pronounce. Herein hadſt thou reſpect to thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to the main purpoſe of thy coming into the world; which was neither to be an arbiter of Civil Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor a judge of Criminal, but a Saviour of mankind; not to deſtroy the Body, but to ſave the Soul. And this was thy care in this miſerable Offender; <hi>Goe, and ſin no more.</hi> How much more doth it concern us to keep within the bounds of our vocation, and not to dare to trench upon the functions of others? How can we ever enough magnifie thy Mercy, who takeſt no pleaſure in the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? who ſo cameſt to ſave, that thou challengeſt us of unkindneſs for being miſerable, <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, O Son of God, though thou wouldſt not then be a Judge, yet thou wilt once be: Thou wouldſt not in thy firſt coming judge the ſins of men, thou wilt come to judge them in thy ſecond. The time ſhall come when upon that juſt and glorious Tribunall thou ſhalt judge every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his works. That we may not one day hear thee ſay, <hi>Goe, ye curſed,</hi> let us now hear thee ſay, <hi>Goe, ſin no more.</hi>

            <head>XXXIII. The Thankfull Penitent.</head>
            <p>ONE while I find <hi>Chriſt</hi> invited by a Publican, now by a Phariſee. Where-ever he went, he made better chear then he found, in an happy exchange of ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt for bodily.</p>
            <p>Who knows not the Phariſees to have been the proud ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; men over-conceited of themſelves, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous of others; ſevere in ſhew, Hypocrites in deed, ſtrict Sectaries, inſolent Juſticiaries? Yet here one of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and that in good earneſt. The man was not (like his fellows) captious, not ceremonious: had he been of their ſtamp, the omiſſion of waſhing the feet had been mortall. No profeſſion hath not yielded ſome good: <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> and <hi>Gamaliel</hi> were of the ſame ſtrain. Neither is it for nothing, that the Evangeliſt having branded this Sect for deſpiſing the counſell of God againſt themſelves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſubjoyns this hiſtory of <hi>Simon</hi> the Phariſee, as an exempt man. O Saviour, thou canſt find out good Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, good Publicans, yea a good Thief upon the Croſs; and that thou maiſt find, thou canſt make them ſo.</p>
            <p>At the beſt, yet he was a Phariſee, whoſe table thou here refuſedſt not. So didſt thou in wiſedom and mercy attemper thy ſelf, as to <hi>become all things to all men, that thou mighteſt win ſome.</hi> Thy Harbenger was rough, as in cloaths, ſo in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; profeſſedly harſh and auſtere: thy ſelf wert milde and ſociable. So it was fit for both. He was a preacher of Penance; thou the authour of comfort and Salvation: He made way for Grace; thou gaveſt it. Thou haſt bidden us to follow thy ſelf, not thy Fore-runner. That then which Politicks and time-ſervers doe for earthly advantages, we will doe for ſpirituall; frame our ſelves to all companies, not in
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:47750:164"/>
evil, but in good, yea in indifferent things. What wonder is it that thou, who cameſt down from Heaven to frame thy ſelf to our nature, ſhouldſt, whilſt thou wert on earth, frame thy ſelf to the ſeverall diſpoſitions of men? Catch not at this, O ye licentious Hypocrites, men of all hours, that can eat with gluttons, drink with drunkards, ſing with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds, ſcoffe with profane ſcorners, and yet talk holily with the religious, as if ye had hence any colour for your chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable conformity to all faſhions. Our Saviour never ſinn'd for any man's ſake, though for our ſakes he was ſociable, that he might keep us from ſinning. Can ye ſo converſe with leud good-fellows, as that ye repreſs their ſins, redreſs their exorbitances, win them to God? now ye walk in the ſteps of him that ſtuck not to ſit down in the Phariſee's houſe.</p>
            <p>There ſate the Saviour, and, <hi>Behold, a woman in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that was a ſinner.</hi> I marvell not that ſhe is led in with a note of wonder; wonder, both on her part, and on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s. That any ſinner, that a ſenſuall ſinner obdured in a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious trade of evil, ſhould voluntarily, out of a true remorſe for her leudneſs, ſeek to a Saviour, it is worthy of an accent of admiration. The noiſe of the Goſpel is common; but where is the power of it? it hath ſtore of hearers, but few converts. Yet were there no wonder in her, if it were not with reference to the power and mercy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that thus drew the ſinner, his mercy that received her. O Saviour, I wonder at her, but I bleſs thee for her; by whoſe onely Grace ſhe was both moved, and accepted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A ſinner?</hi> Alas, who was not? who is not ſo? Not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in many things we ſin all</hi>; but in all things we all let fall many ſins. Had there been a woman not a ſinner, it had been beyond wonder. One man there was that was not a ſinner; even he that was more then man, that God and Man, who was the refuge of this ſinner: but never woman that ſinned not. Yet he ſaid not, a Woman that had ſinned, but, <hi>that was a ſinner.</hi> An action doth not give denomination, but
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:47750:164"/>
a trade. Even the wiſe Charity of Chriſtians (much more the mercy of God) can diſtinguiſh between ſins of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and practice of ſin; and eſteem us not by a tranſient act, but by a permanent condition.</p>
            <p>The woman was noted for a luxurious and incontinent life. What a deal of variety there is of ſins? That which faileth cannot be numbred. Every ſin continued deſerves to brand the Soul with this ſtyle. Here one is pickt out from the reſt: ſhe is not noted for Murther, for Theft, for Idolatry; onely her Luſt makes her a woman that was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Other Vices uſe not to give the owner this title, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they ſhould be more hainous then it.</p>
            <p>Wantons may flatter themſelves in the indifferency or ſlightneſs of this offence; their Souls ſhall need no other conveiance to Hell then this: which cannot be ſo pleaſing to Nature as it is hatefull to God, who ſo ſpeaks of it as if there were no ſins but it, <hi>a Woman that was a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was a ſinner, now ſhe is not; her very preſence ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues her change. Had ſhe been ſtill in her old trade, ſhe would no more have endured the ſight of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then that Devil did which cried out, <hi>Art thou come to torment me?</hi> Her eyes had been lamps and fires of Luſt, not fountains of tears; her hairs had been nets to catch fooliſh lovers, not a towell for her Saviour's feet: yet ſtill ſhe carries the name of what ſhe was; a ſcar ſtill remains after the wound hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. <hi>Simon</hi> will be ever the Leper, and <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. How carefully ſhould we avoid thoſe actions which may ever ſtain us?</p>
            <p>What a difference there is betwixt the carriage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of God and men? The mercy of God, as it <hi>calleth thoſe things that are not as if they were,</hi> ſo it calleth thoſe things that were as if they were not; <hi>I will remember your iniquities no more.</hi> As ſome skilfull Chirurgion ſo ſets the bone, or heals the ſore, that it cannot be ſeen where the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was. Man's word is, that which is done cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: but the omnipotent goodneſs of God doth (as it
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:47750:165"/>
were) undoe our once-committed ſins. <hi>Take away my ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and thou ſhalt find none.</hi> What we were in our ſelves, we are not to him, ſince he hath changed us from our ſelves.</p>
            <p>O God, why ſhould we be niggardly, where thou art li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral? why ſhould we be reading thoſe lines which thou haſt not onely croſſed, but quite blotted, yea wiped out?</p>
            <p>It is a good word, <hi>She was a ſinner.</hi> To be wicked, is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to God, Angels, Saints, men; to have been ſo, is bleſſed and glorious. I rejoyce to look back, and ſee my <hi>Egyptians</hi> lying dead upon the ſhore, that I may praiſe the Authour of my deliverance and victory. Elſe, it matters not what they were, what I was. O God, thou whoſe ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is, <hi>I am,</hi> regardeſt the preſent. He befriends and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours us that ſays, <hi>Such ye were, but ye are waſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Place adds to the hainouſneſs of the ſin; <hi>In the City.</hi> The more publick the fact is, the greater is the ſcandall. Sin is ſin, though in a deſart. Others eyes do not make the act more vile in it ſelf; but the offence is multiplied by the number of beholders.</p>
            <p>I hear no Name of either the City or the Woman; ſhe was too well known in her time. How much better is it to be obſcure, then infamous? Herein, I doubt not, God meant to ſpare the reputation of a penitent Convert. He who hates not the perſon, but the ſin, cares onely to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſin, not the perſon. It is juſtice to proſecute the Vice, it is mercy to ſpare the Offender. How injurious a preſumption is it for any man to name her whom God would have concealed? and to caſt this aſperſion on thoſe whom God hath noted for holineſs?</p>
            <p>The worſt of this woman is paſt, <hi>She was a ſinner</hi>; the beſt is to come, She ſought out <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Where? In the houſe of a Phariſee. It was the moſt inconvenient place in the world for a noted ſinner to ſeek <hi>Chriſt</hi> in.</p>
            <p>No men ſtood ſo much upon the terms of their own Righteouſneſs; no men ſo ſcornfully diſdained an infamous perſon. The touch of an ordinary (though honeſt) <hi>Jew</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:47750:165"/>
was their pollution; how much more the preſence of a Strumpet? What a ſight was a known ſinner to him, to whom his holieſt neighbour was a ſinner? How doth he (though a better Phariſee) look awry to ſee ſuch a piece in his houſe, whilſt he dares think, <hi>If this man were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, he would ſurely know what manner of woman this is?</hi> Neither could ſhe fore-imagine leſs, when ſhe ventured to preſs over the threſhold of a Phariſee. Yet not the known auſterity of the man, and her miſ-welcome to the place, could affright her from ſeeking her Saviour even there. No diſadvantage can defer the Penitent Soul from a ſpeedy recourſe to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> She ſays not,
<q>If <hi>Jeſus</hi> were in the ſtreet, or in the field, or in the houſe of ſome humble Publican, or any-where ſave with a Phariſee, I would come to him; now I will rather defer my acceſs, then ſeek him where I ſhall find ſcorn and cenſure:</q> but, as not fearing the frowns of that overly Hoſt, ſhe thruſts her ſelf into <hi>Simon</hi>'s houſe to find <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
It is not for the diſtreſſed to be baſhfull; it is not for a believer to be ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous. O Saviour, if thy Spouſe miſs thee, ſhe will ſeek thee through the ſtreets; the blows of the watch ſhall not daunt her. If thou be on the other ſide of the water, a <hi>Peter</hi> will leap into the Sea, and ſwim to thee: if on the other ſide of the fire, thy bleſſed Martyrs will run through thoſe flames to thee. We are not worthy of the comfort of thy preſence, if whereſoever we know thou art, whether in priſon, or in exile, or at the ſtake, we do not haſten thither to injoy thee.</p>
            <p>The Place was not more unfit then the Time: a Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee's houſe was not more unproper for a ſinner, then a Feaſt was for humiliation. Tears at a Banquet are as Jiggs at a Funeral. There is a ſeaſon for all things. Muſick had been more apt for a Feaſt then mourning.</p>
            <p>The heart that hath once felt the ſting of ſin, and the ſweetneſs of remiſſion, hath no power to delay the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of what it feels, and cannot be confined to terms of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:47750:166"/>Whence then was this zeal of her acceſs? Doubtleſs, ſhe had heard from the mouth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in thoſe heavenly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his, many gracious invitations of all troubled and labouring Souls; ſhe had obſerved how he vouchſafed to come under the roofs of deſpiſed Publicans, of profeſſed enemies; ſhe had noted all the paſſages of his power and mercy; and now deep remorſe wrought upon her heart for her former viciouſneſs. The pool of her Conſcience was troubled by the deſcending Angel, and now ſhe ſteps in for a cure. The arrow ſtuck faſt in her Soul, which ſhe could not ſhake out; and now ſhe comes to this ſovereign Dittany, to expell it. Had not the Spirit of God wrought upon her ere ſhe came, and wrought her to come, ſhe had never either ſought or found <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now ſhe comes in, and finds that Saviour whom ſhe ſought: ſhe comes in, but not empty-handed: though debauched, ſhe was a <hi>Jeweſs.</hi> She could not but have heard that ſhe ought <hi>not</hi> to <hi>appear before the Lord empty.</hi> What then brings ſhe? It was not poſſible ſhe could bring to <hi>Chriſt</hi> a better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent then her own Penitent Soul: yet, to teſtifie that, ſhe brings another, delicate both for the veſſell and the contents, <hi>a box of Alabaſter</hi>; a ſolid, hard, pure, clear marble, fit for the receit of ſo precious an ointment: the ointment pleaſant and coſtly; a compoſition of many fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant Odours, not for medicine, but delight.</p>
            <p>The Soul that is truly touched with the ſenſe of its own ſin can think nothing too good, too dear for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The remorſed ſinner begins firſt with the tender of <hi>burnt-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and calves of a year old</hi>; thence he aſcends to Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs, <hi>thouſands of rams</hi>; and above that yet, to <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rivers of oyl</hi>; and yet higher, could be content to <hi>give the firſt-fruit of his body</hi> to expiate <hi>the ſin of his Soul.</hi> Any thing, every thing is too ſmall a price for peace. O Saviour, ſince we have taſted how ſweet thou art, lo, we bring thee the daintieſt and coſtlieſt perfumes of our hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Obediences: yea, if ſo much of our bloud, as this
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:47750:166"/>
woman brought oyntment, may be uſefull or pleaſing to thy name, we do moſt chearfully conſecrate it unto thee. If we would not have thee think Heaven too good for us, why ſhould we ſtick at any earthly retribution to thee in lieu of thy great mercies?</p>
            <p>Yet here I ſee more then the price. This odoriferous perfume was that wherewith ſhe had wont to make her ſelf pleaſing to her wanton Lovers; and now ſhe comes purpoſely to offer it up to her Saviour.</p>
            <p>As her Love was turned another way from ſenſuall to Divine, ſo ſhall her Ointment alſo be altered in the uſe: that which was abuſed to Luxury, ſhall now be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Devotion. There is no other effect in whatſoever true Converſion. <hi>As we have given our members ſervants to iniquity to commit iniquity, ſo ſhall we now give our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants unto righteouſneſs in holineſs.</hi> If the dames of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that thought nothing more worth looking on then their own faces, have ſpent too much time in their glaſſes; now they ſhall caſt in thoſe metalls to make a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for the waſhing of their uncleanneſſes. If I have ſpent the prime of my ſtrength, the ſtrength of my wit, upon my ſelf and vanity; I have beſtowed my Alabaſter-box amiſs: O now teach me, my God and Saviour, to improve all my time, all my abilities to thy glory. This is all the poor recompence can be made thee for thoſe ſhamefull diſhonours thou haſt received from me.</p>
            <p>The Woman is come in; and now ſhe doth not boldly face <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but, as unworthy of his preſence, ſhe <hi>ſtands behind.</hi> How could ſhe in that ſite waſh his feet with her tears? Was it that our Saviour did not ſit at the Feaſt, (after our faſhion,) but, according to the then-<hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> faſhion, lay on the one ſide? Or was it that this phraſe doth not ſo much import poſture as preſence? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, it was baſhfulneſs and ſhame ariſing from the conſcience of her own former wickedneſs that placed her thus. How well is the caſe altered? She had wont to look boldly in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:47750:167"/>
the face of her Lovers: now ſhe dares not behold the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance of her Saviour. She had wont to ſend her alluring beams forth into the eyes of her wanton pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramours: now ſhe caſts her dejected eyes to the earth, and dares not ſo much as raiſe them up to ſee thoſe eyes from which ſhe deſired commiſeration. It was a true inference of the Prophet, <hi>Thou haſt an whore's forehead, thou canſt not bluſh:</hi> there cannot be a greater ſign of whoriſhneſs then impudence. This woman can now bluſh; ſhe hath put off the Harlot, and is turned true Penitent. Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is both a ſign, and effect of Grace. O God, could we but bethink how wretched we are in nature, how vile through our ſins, how glorious, holy and powerfull a God thou art, (before whom the brighteſt Angels hide their faces,) we could not come but with a trembling awfulneſs into thy preſence.</p>
            <p>Together with ſhame, here is ſorrow: a ſorrow teſtified by tears; and tears in ſuch abundance, that ſhe waſhes the feet of our Saviour with thoſe ſtreams of penitence; <hi>She began to waſh his feet with tears.</hi> We hear when ſhe began, we hear not when ſhe ended. When the grapes are preſſed, the juice runs forth: ſo when the mind is preſſed, tears diſtill; the true juice of penitence and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Theſe eyes were not uſed to ſuch clouds, or to ſuch ſhowrs; there was nothing in them formerly but ſun-ſhine of pleaſure, beams of Luſt: Now they are reſolved into the drops of grief and contrition. Whence was this change, but from the ſecret working of God's Spirit? <hi>He cauſed his wind to blow, and the waters flowed; he ſmote the rock, and the waters guſhed out.</hi> O God, ſmite thou this rocky Heart of mine, and the waters of Repentance ſhall burſt forth in abundance.</p>
            <p>Never were thy feet, O Saviour, bedewed with more precious liquour then this of remorſefull tears. Theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo ſpent, but that thou keepeſt them in thy bottle; yea thou returneſt them back with intereſt of true comfort:
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:47750:167"/>
               <hi>They that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy. Bleſſed are they that mourn.</hi> Lo, this wet ſeed-time ſhall be followed with an harveſt of happineſs and glory.</p>
            <p>That this ſervice might be complete, as her Eyes were the Ewre, ſo her Hair was the Towell for the feet of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Doubtleſs at a Feaſt there was no want of the moſt curious linen for this purpoſe. All this was nothing to her: to approve her ſincere Humility, and hearty devotion to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> her hair ſhall be put to this glorious office. The hair is the chief ornament of womanhood: the feet, as they are the loweſt part of the body, ſo the meaneſt for account, and homelieſt for imployment: and lo, this Penitent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows the chief ornament of her head on the meaneſt office to the feet of her Saviour. That hair which ſhe was wont to ſpread as a net to catch her amorous companions, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the imployment of wiping the beautifull feet of him that brought the glad tidings of peace and ſalvation: and, might it have been any ſervice to him to have licked the duſt under thoſe feet of his, how gladly would ſhe have done it? Nothing can be mean that is done to the honour of a Saviour.</p>
            <p>Never was any hair ſo preferred as this. How I envy thoſe locks that were graced with the touch of thoſe ſacred feet; but much more thoſe lips that kiſſed them? Thoſe lips that had been formerly inured to the wanton touches of her laſcivious Lovers, now ſanctifie themſelves with the teſtimony of her humble homage and dear reſpects to the Son of God. Thus her oyntment, hands, eyes, hair, lips are now conſecrated to the ſervice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> her Saviour, whom ſhe had offended. If our ſatisfaction be not in ſome kind proportionable to our offence, we are no true Penitents.</p>
            <p>All this while I hear not one word fall from the mouth of this woman. What need her tongue ſpeak, when her eyes ſpake, her hands ſpake, her geſture, her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, her whole carriage was vocall? I like this ſilent
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:47750:168"/>
ſpeaking well, when our actions talk, and our tongues hold their peace. The common practice is contrary; Mens tongues are buſie, but their hands are ſtill. All their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lies in their tongue; their hands either doe nothing, or ill; ſo as their profeſſion is but wind, as their words. Wherefore are words but for expreſſion of the mind? If that could be known by the eye or by the hand, the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of both were alike. There are no words amongſt Spirits; yet they perfectly underſtand each other. <hi>The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God.</hi> All tongues cannot ſpeak ſo loud as they that have none. Give me the Chriſtian that is ſeen, and not heard. The noiſe that our tongue makes in a formality of profeſſion ſhall (in the ſilence of our hands) condemn us for Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>The Phariſee ſaw all this, but with an evil eye. Had he not had ſome Grace, he had never invited ſuch a Gueſt as <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and if he had had Grace enough, he had never entertained ſuch a thought as this of the gueſt he invited; <hi>If this man were a Prophet, he would have known what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of woman it is that toucheth him; for ſhe is a ſinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many errours in one breath? Juſtly (O <hi>Simon)</hi> hath this one thought loſt thee the thank of thy Feaſt. Belike, at the higheſt, thou judgedſt thy gueſt but a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; and now thou doubteſt whether he were ſo much. Beſides this undervaluation, how unjuſt is the ground of this doubt? Every Prophet knew not every thing; yea no Prophet ever knew all things. <hi>Eliſha</hi> knew the very ſecrets of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> privy-chamber: yet he knew not the calamity of his worthy Hoſteſs. The finite knowledge of the ableſt Seer reaches but ſo far as it will pleaſe God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it. Well might he therefore have been a Prophet, and in the knowledge of greater matters not have known this.</p>
            <p>Unto this, how weakly didſt thou, becauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent admiſſion of the woman, ſuppoſe him ignorant of her quality? As if knowledge ſhould be meaſured always by the noiſe of expreſſion. Stay but a while, and thou ſhalt find
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:47750:168"/>
that he well knew both her life and thy heart. Beſides, how injuriouſly doſt thou take this woman for what ſhe was? not conceiving, (as well thou mighteſt) were not this woman a Convert, ſhe would never have offered her ſelf into this preſence. Her modeſty and her tears bewray her change: and if ſhe be changed, why is ſhe cenſured for what ſhe is not?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how ſtrong did it ſavour of the leven of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, that thou ſuppoſeſt (were ſhe what ſhe was) that it could not ſtand with the knowledge and holineſs of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to admit of her leaſt touch, yea of her preſence? Whereas on the one ſide, outward converſation in it ſelf makes no man unclean or holy, but according to the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the patient; on the other, ſuch was the purity and perfection of this thy glorious gueſt, that it was not poſſibly infectible, nor any way obnoxious to the danger of others ſin. He that ſaid once, <hi>Who touched me?</hi> in regard of virtue iſſuing from him, never ſaid, Whom have I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? in regard of any contagion incident to him. We ſinfull creatures, in whom the Prince of this world finds too much, may eaſily be tainted with other mens ſins; He, who came to take away the ſins of the world, was uncapable of pollution by ſin. Had the woman then been ſtill a ſinner, thy cenſure of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was proud and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>The Phariſee ſpake; but it was within himſelf: and now, behold, <hi>Jeſus anſwering, ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we think, we ſpeak to our hearts, and we ſpeak to God; and he equally hears, as if it came out of our mouths. Thoughts are not free. Could men know and convince them, they would be no leſs liable to cenſure then if they came forth cloathed with words. God, who hears them, judges of them accordingly. So here, the heart of <hi>Simon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jeſus anſwers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus</hi> anſwers him, but with a Parable. He anſwers many a thought with Judgment; the blaſphemy of the heart, the murther of the heart, the adultery of the heart are anſwered
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:47750:169"/>
by him with reall vengeance. For <hi>Simon,</hi> our Saviour ſaw his errour was either out of ſimple ignorance or weak miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: where he ſaw no malice then, it is enough to anſwer with a gentle conviction. The convictive anſwer of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is by way of Parable. The wiſedom of God knows how to circumvent us for our gain; and can ſpeak that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingly by a prudent circumlocution, which right-down would not be digeſted. Had our Saviour ſaid in plain terms, <hi>Simon,</hi> whether doſt thou or this ſinner love me more? the Phariſee could not for ſhame but have ſtood upon his reputation, and in a ſcorn of the compariſon have proteſted his exceeding reſpects to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now, ere he is aware, he is fetch'd in to give ſentence againſt himſelf for her whom he condemned. O Saviour, thou haſt made us fiſhers of men; how ſhould we learn of thee, ſo to bait our hooks, that they may be moſt likely to take? Thou the great Houſholder of thy Church haſt provided victuals for thy family, thou haſt appointed us to dreſs them: if we do not ſo cook them as that they may fit the palats to which they are intended, we do both loſe our labour and thy coſt. The Parable is of two Debtours to one Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour; the one owed a leſſer ſum, the other a greater; both are forgiven. It was not the purpoſe of him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it, that we ſhould ſtick in the bark. God is our Creditour, our ſins our Debts; we are all Debtours, but one more deep then another. No man can pay this Debt alone; ſatisfaction is not poſſible: onely remiſſion can diſcharge us. God doth in mercy forgive as well the greateſt as the leaſt ſins. Our love to God is proportionable to the ſenſe of our remiſſion. So then the Phariſee cannot chuſe but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the more and greater the ſin is, the greater mercy in the forgiveneſs; and the more mercy in the forgiver, the greater obligation and more love in the forgiven.</p>
            <p>Truth, from whoſe mouth ſoever it falls, is worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up. Our Saviour praiſes the true judgment of a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee. It is an injurious indiſcretion in thoſe who are ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:47750:169"/>
againſt the perſons, that they reject the truth. He that would not quench the ſmoaking flax, incourages even the leaſt good. As the carefull Chirurgion ſtroaks the arm ere he ſtrikes the vein; ſo did <hi>Chriſt</hi> here, ere he convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Phariſee of his want of love, he graceth him with a fair approbation of his judgment. Yet the while turning both his face and his ſpeech to the poor Penitent; as one that cared more for a true humiliation for ſin, then for a falſe pretence of reſpect and innocence.</p>
            <p>With what a dejected and abaſhed countenance, with what earth-fixed eyes do we imagine the poor woman ſtood, when ſhe ſaw her Saviour direct his face and words to her?</p>
            <p>She that durſt but ſtand behind him, and ſteal the falling of ſome tears upon his feet, with what a bluſhing aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth ſhe behold his ſidereall countenance caſt upon her? Whilſt his eye was turned towards this Penitent, his ſpeech was turned to the Phariſee concerning that Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, by him miſtaken; <hi>Seeſt thou this Woman?</hi> He who before had ſaid, <hi>If this man were a Prophet, he would have known what manner of Woman this is,</hi> now hears, <hi>Seeſt thou this Woman? Simon</hi> ſaw but her outſide: <hi>Jeſus</hi> lets him ſee that he ſaw her heart; and will thus convince the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee that he is more then a Prophet, who knew not her converſation onely, but her Soul. The Phariſee, that went all by appearance, ſhall by her deportment ſee the proof of her good diſpoſition: it ſhall happily ſhame him to hear the compariſon of the wants of his own entertainments with the abundance of hers.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that any of this formall Sect ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in their Lotions. <hi>Simon</hi> had not given water to ſo great a Gueſt; ſhe waſhes his feet with her tears. By how much the water of the eye was more precious then the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth, ſo much was the reſpect and courteſie of this Penitent above the neglected office of the Phariſee. What uſe was there of a Towell, where was no water?
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:47750:170"/>
She that made a fountain of her eyes, made precious napa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her hair: that better flax ſhamed the linen in the Phariſee's cheſt.</p>
            <p>A kiſs of the cheek had wont to be pledge of the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of their gueſts. <hi>Simon</hi> neglects to make himſelf thus happy: ſhe redoubles the kiſſes of her humble thankfulneſs upon the bleſſed feet of her Saviour. The Phariſee omits ordinary oyl for the head: ſhe ſupplies the moſt precious and fragrant oyl to his feet.</p>
            <p>Now the Phariſee reads his own taxation in her praiſe; and begins to envy where he had ſcorned.</p>
            <p>It is our fault, O Saviour, if we miſtake thee. We are ready to think, ſo thou have the ſubſtance of good uſage, thou regardeſt not the complements and ceremonies; whereas now we ſee thee to have both meat and welcome in the Phariſee's houſe, and yet hear thee glance at his neglect of waſhing, kiſſing, anointing. Doubtleſs, omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of due circumſtances in thy Entertainment may deſerve to loſe our thanks. Do we pray to thee? do we hear thee preach to us? now we make thee good chear in our houſe: but if we perform not theſe things with the fit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of our outward carriages, we give thee not thy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thy kiſſes, thy oyl. Even meet ritual obſervances are requiſite for thy full welcome.</p>
            <p>Yet how little had theſe things been regarded, if they had not argued the woman's thankfull love to thee, and the ground of that love, ſenſe of her remiſſion, and the Phariſee's default in both?</p>
            <p>Love and action do neceſſarily evince each other. True love cannot lurk long unexpreſſed: it will be looking out at the eyes, creeping out of the mouth, breaking out at the fingers ends, in ſome actions of dearneſs; eſpecially thoſe wherein there is pain and difficulty to the agent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or pleaſure to the affected. O Lord, in vain ſhall we profeſs to love thee, if we doe nothing for thee. Since our goodneſs cannot reach up unto thee, who art our glorious
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:47750:170"/>
Head; O let us beſtow upon thy Feet (thy poor Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers here below) our tears, our hands, our oyntment, and whatever our gifts or endeavours may teſtifie our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love to thee in them.</p>
            <p>O happy word! <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven her.</hi> Methinks I ſee how this poor Penitent revived with this breath; how new life comes into her eyes, new bloud into her cheeks, new ſpirits into her countenance: like unto our Mother Earth; when, in that firſt confuſion, <hi>God ſaid, Let the earth bring forth graſs, the herb that beareth ſeed, and the fruit-tree yielding fruit,</hi> all runs out into flowers, and bloſſoms, and leaves, and fruit. Her former tears ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Now her chearfull ſmiles ſay, <hi>I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seldome ever do we meet with ſo perfect a Penitent; ſeldome do we find ſo gracious a diſmiſſion. What can be wiſhed of any mortall creature but Remiſſion, Safety, Faith, Peace? All theſe are here met to make a contrite Soul happy. Remiſſion, the ground of her Safety; Faith, the ground of her Peace; Safety and Salvation, the iſſue of her Remiſſion; Peace, the bleſſed fruit of her Faith.</p>
            <p>O Woman, the perfume that thou broughteſt is poor and baſe in compariſon of thoſe ſweet ſavours of reſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that are returned to thee. Well was that oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beſtowed, wherewith thy Soul is ſweetned to all Eternity.</p>

            </head>
            <p>WE may reade long enough ere we find <hi>Chriſt</hi> in an houſe of his own. <hi>The foxes have holes, and the birds have neſts:</hi> he that had all, poſſeſſed nothing. One while I ſee him in a Publican's houſe, then in a Phariſee's; now I find him at <hi>Martha</hi>'s. His laſt entertainment was with ſome neglect, this with too much ſolicitude. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was now in his way; the Sun might as ſoon ſtand ſtill as he.</p>
            <p>The more we move, the liker we are to Heaven, and to this God that made it. His progreſs was to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for ſome holy Feaſt. He whoſe Devotion neglected not any of thoſe ſacred Solemnities, will not neglect the due opportunities of his bodily refreſhing: as not thinking it meet to travell and preach harbourleſs, he diverts (where he knew his welcome) to the village of <hi>Bethany.</hi> There dwelt the two devout Siſters, with their Brother, his Friend <hi>Lazarus</hi>; their roof receives him. O happy houſe into which the Son of God vouchſafed to ſet his foot! O bleſſed women, that had the grace to be the Hoſteſſes to the God of Heaven! How ſhould I envy your felicity herein, if I did not ſee the ſame favour (if I be not wanting to my ſelf) lying open to me? I have two ways to entertain my Saviour, in his Members, and in himſelf. In his Members, by Charity and Hoſpitableneſs; <hi>what I doe to one of thoſe his little ones, I doe to him:</hi> In himſelf, by Faith; <hi>If any man open,</hi> he <hi>will come in and ſup with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Saviour, thou ſtandeſt at the door of our hearts, and knockeſt by the ſolicitations of thy Meſſengers, by the ſenſe of thy Chaſtiſements, by the motions of thy Spirit: if
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:47750:171"/>
we open to thee by a willing admiſſion and faithfull wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, thou wilt be ſure to take up our Souls with thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence; and not to ſit with us for a momentany meal, but to dwell with us for ever. Lo, thou didſt but call in at <hi>Bethany</hi>; but here ſhall be thy reſt for everlaſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha</hi> (it ſeems) as being the elder Siſter, bore the name of the Houſe-keeper; <hi>Mary</hi> was her aſſiſtent in the charge. A Bleſſed pair; Siſters not more in Nature then Grace, in ſpirit no leſs then in fleſh. How happy a thing it is when all the parties in a family are joyntly agreed to entertain <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner is <hi>Jeſus</hi> entred into the houſe then he falls to preaching: that no time may be loſt, he ſtays not ſo much as till his meat be made ready; but whilſt his bodily repaſt was in hand, provides ſpiritual food for his Hoſts. It was his <hi>meat and drink to doe the will of</hi> his <hi>Father:</hi> he fed more upon his own diet then he could poſſibly upon theirs; his beſt chear was to ſee them ſpiritually fed. How ſhould we, whom he hath called to this ſacred Function, <hi>be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon?</hi> We are, by his ſacred ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Lights of the world. No ſooner is the candle lighted, then it gives that light which it hath, and never intermits till it be waſted to the ſnuff.</p>
            <p>Both the Siſters for a time ſate attentively liſtening to the words of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Houſhold occaſions call <hi>Martha</hi> away: <hi>Mary</hi> ſits ſtill at his feet, and hears. Whether ſhall we more praiſe her Humility, or her Docility? I do not ſee her take a ſtool and ſit by him, or a chair and ſit above him; but, as deſiring to ſhew her heart was as low as her knees, ſhe ſits at his feet. She was lowly ſet, richly warmed with thoſe Heavenly beams. The greater ſubmiſſion, the more Grace. If there be one hollow in the valley lower then another, thither the waters gather.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Martha</hi>'s houſe is become a Divinity-ſchool: <hi>Jeſus,</hi> as the Doctour, ſits in the chair; <hi>Martha, Mary,</hi> and the reſt, ſit as Diſciples at his feet. Standing implies a readineſs
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:47750:172"/>
for motion; Sitting, a ſettled compoſedneſs to this holy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence.</p>
            <p>Had theſe two Siſters provided our Saviour never ſuch delicates, and waited on his trencher never ſo officiouſly, yet had they not liſtened to his inſtruction, they had not bidden him welcome; neither had he ſo well liked his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.</p>
            <p>This was the way to feaſt him; to feed their ears by his Heavenly Doctrine: His beſt chear is our proficiency; our beſt chear is his Word. O Saviour, let my Soul be thus feaſted by thee, do thou thus feaſt thy ſelf by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me; this mutual diet ſhall be thy praiſe and my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Martha</hi> was for the time an attentive hearer, yet now her care of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s entertainment carries her into the Kitchin; <hi>Mary</hi> ſits ſtill. Neither was <hi>Mary</hi> more devout then <hi>Martha</hi> buſie: <hi>Martha</hi> cares to feaſt <hi>Jeſus; Mary,</hi> to be feaſted of him. There was more ſolicitude in <hi>Martha</hi>'s active part; more piety in <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſedentary attendence: I know not in whether more zeal. Good <hi>Martha</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to expreſs her joy and thankfulneſs for the preſence of ſo bleſſed a Gueſt, by the actions of her carefull and plentious entertainment. I know not how to cenſure the Holy woman for her exceſs of care to welcome her Saviour. Sure ſhe her ſelf thought ſhe did well; and out of that confidence fears not to complain to <hi>Chriſt</hi> of her Siſter.</p>
            <p>I do not ſee her come to her Siſter, and whiſper in her ear the great need of her aid; but ſhe comes to <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and, in a kind of unkind expoſtulation of her neglect, makes her moan to him; <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care that my ſiſter hath left me to ſerve alone?</hi> Why did ſhe not rather make her firſt addreſs to her Siſter? Was it for that ſhe knew <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo tied by the ears, with thoſe adamantine chains that came from the mouth of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that untill his ſilence and diſmiſſion ſhe had no power to ſtir? Or was it
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:47750:172"/>
out of an honour and reſpect to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that in his preſence ſhe would not preſume to call off her Siſter without his leave?</p>
            <p>Howſoever, I cannot excuſe the Holy woman from ſome weakneſſes. It was a fault to meaſure her Siſter by her ſelf, and apprehending her own act to be good, to think her Siſter could not doe well if ſhe did not ſo too. Whereas Goodneſs hath much latitude. Ill is oppoſed to Good, not Good to Good. Neither in things lawfull or indifferent are others bound to our examples. <hi>Mary</hi> might hear, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> might ſerve, and both doe well. <hi>Mary</hi> did not cenſure <hi>Martha</hi> for her riſing from the feet of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to prepare his meal: neither ſhould <hi>Martha</hi> have cenſured <hi>Mary</hi> for ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s feet, to feed her Soul. It was a fault, that ſhe thought an exceſſive care of a liberal outward entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was to be preferred to a diligent attention to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſpirituall entertainment of them. It was a fault, that ſhe durſt preſume to queſtion our Saviour of ſome kind of unreſpect to her toil, <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care?</hi> What ſaieſt thou, <hi>Martha?</hi> Doſt thou challenge the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth of incogitancy and neglect? Doſt thou take upon thee to preſcribe unto that infinite Wiſedom, in ſtead of receiving directions from him? It is well thou metteſt with a Saviour, whoſe gracious mildneſs knows how to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and pity the errours of our zeal.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt needs ſay here wanted not fair pretences for the ground of this thy expoſtulation. Thou, the elder Siſter, workeſt; <hi>Mary,</hi> the younger, ſits ſtill. And what work was thine but the hoſpitall receit of thy Saviour and his train? Had it been for thine own paunch, or for ſome carnal friends, it had been leſs excuſable; now it was for <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, to whom thou couldſt never be too obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious.</p>
            <p>But all this cannot deliver thee from the juſt blame of this bold ſubincuſation, <hi>Lord, doſt thou not care?</hi> How ready is our weakneſs upon every ſlight diſcontentment
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:47750:173"/>
to quarrell with our beſt friend, yea with our good God; and the more we are put to it, to think our ſelves the more neglected, and to challenge God for our neglect? Do we groan on the bed of our ſickneſs, and languiſhing in pain complain of long hours and weary ſides? ſtraight we think, Lord, doſt thou not care that we ſuffer? Doth God's poor Church goe to wreck, whilſt <hi>the ploughers ploughing on her back make long furrows?</hi> Lord, doſt thou not care? But know thou, O thou feeble and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtfull Soul, the more thou doeſt, the more thou ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the more thou art cared for: neither is God ever ſo tender over his Church as when it is moſt exerciſed. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pang and ſtitch and gird is firſt felt of him that ſends it. O God, thou knoweſt our works, and our labour, and our patience; we may be ignorant and diffident; thou canſt not but be gracious.</p>
            <p>It could not but trouble devout <hi>Mary</hi> to hear her Siſter's impatient complaint; a complaint of her ſelf to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with ſuch vehemence of paſſion, as if there had been ſuch ſtrangeneſs betwixt the two Siſters, that the one would doe nothing for the other without an externall compulſion from a Superiour. How can ſhe chuſe but think,
<q>If I have offended, why was I not ſecretly taxed for it in a ſiſterly familiarity? What if there have been ſome little omiſſion? muſt the whole houſe ring of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord and all his Diſciples? Is this carriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Siſter? Is my Devotion worthy of a quarrell? Lord, doſt thou not care that I am injuriously cenſured?</q>
Yet I hear not a word of reply from that modeſt mouth. O holy <hi>Mary,</hi> I admire thy patient ſilence. Thy Siſter blames thee for thy Piety; the Diſciples (afterwards) blame thee for thy Bounty and coſt: not a word falls from thee in a juſt vindication of thine honour and innocence, but in an humble taciturnity thou leaveſt thine anſwer to thy Saviour.</p>
            <p>How ſhould we learn of thee, when we are complained of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:47750:173"/>
for well-doing, to ſeal up our lips, and to expect our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from above?</p>
            <p>And how ſure, how ready art thou, O Saviour, to ſpeak in the cauſe of the dumb? <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and troubled about many things; but one thing is needfull, and Mary hath choſen the better part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What needed <hi>Mary</hi> to ſpeak for her ſelf when ſhe had ſuch an Advocate? Doubtleſs <hi>Martha</hi> was, as it were, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from her ſelf with the multiplicity of her carefull thoughts: our Saviour therefore doubles her name in his compellation; that in ſuch diſtraction he may both find and fix her heart. The good woman made full account that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have ſent away her Siſter with a check, and her ſelf with thanks: but now her hopes fail her; and though ſhe be not directly reproved, yet ſhe hears her Siſter more approved then ſhe; <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull and troubled about many things.</hi> Our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived courteſie from her in her diligent and coſtly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment; yet he would not blanch her errour, and ſmooth her up in her weak miſpriſion. No obligations may ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall us, as that our tongues ſhould not be free to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove faults where we find them. They are baſe and ſervile ſpirits that will have their tongue tied to their teeth.</p>
            <p>This glance towards a reproof implies an oppoſition of the condition of the two Siſters. Themſelves were not more near in Nature, then their preſent humour and eſtate differed. <hi>One</hi> is oppoſed to many, <hi>neceſſary</hi> to ſuperfluous, <hi>ſolicitude</hi> to quietneſs: <hi>Thou art carefull and troubled about many things; one thing is neceſſary.</hi> How far then may our care reach to theſe earthly things? On the one ſide, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, thou haſt charged us to <hi>take no thought what to eat, drink, put on</hi>; on the other, thy choſen Veſſel hath told us, that <hi>he that provides not for his family hath denied the faith, and is worſe then an Infidel.</hi> We may, we muſt care for many things; ſo that our care be for good, and well.
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:47750:174"/>
For good, both in kind and meaſure; well, ſo as our care be free from diſtraction, from diſtruſt. From diſtraction, that it hinder us not from the neceſſary duties of our general Calling: from diſtruſt, that we miſdoubt not God's Providence whilſt we imploy our own. We cannot care for thee, unleſs we thus care for our ſelves, for ours.</p>
            <p>Alas! how much care do I ſee every-where? but how few <hi>Martha's</hi>? Her care was for her Saviour's entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ours for our ſelves. One finds perplexities in his Eſtate, which he deſires to extricate; another beats his brains for the raiſing of his Houſe: One buſies his thoughts about the doubtfull condition (as he thinks) of the Times, and caſts in his anxious head the imaginary events of all things, oppoſing his hopes to his fears; another ſtudies how to avoid the croſs blows of an Adverſary. <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art carefull and troubled about many things.</hi> Fooliſh men! why do we ſet our hearts upon the rack, and need not? why will we endure to bend under that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which more able ſhoulders have offered to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for our eaſe?</p>
            <p>Thou haſt bidden us, O God, to caſt our cares upon thee, with promiſe to care for us: We do gladly unload our ſelves upon thee. O let our care be to depend on thee, as thine is to provide for us.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Martha</hi> be pitied or taxed for her ſedulity, I am ſure <hi>Mary</hi> is praiſed for her devotion. <hi>One thing is neceſſary.</hi> Not by way of negation, as if nothing were neceſſary but this: but by way of compariſon, as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo neceſſary as this. Earthly occaſions muſt vail to ſpiritual. Of thoſe three main grounds of all our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Neceſſity, Convenience, Pleaſure, each tranſcends other: Convenience carries it away from Pleaſure, Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity from Convenience, and one degree of Neceſſity from another. The degrees are according to the conditions of the things neceſſary. The condition of theſe earthly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries is, that without them we cannot live temporally;
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:47750:174"/>
the condition of the ſpiritual, that without them we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live eternally. So much difference then as there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt temporary and eternal, ſo much there muſt needs be betwixt the neceſſity of theſe bodily actions and thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual: Both are neceſſary in their kinds; neither muſt here be an oppoſition, but a ſubordination. The Body and Soul muſt be friends, not rivals: we may not ſo plie the Chriſtian, that we neglect the man.</p>
            <p>Oh the vanity of thoſe men who, neglecting that one thing neceſſary, affect many things ſuperfluous! Nothing is needleſs with worldly minds but this one which is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, the care of their Souls. How juſtly do they loſe that they care not for, whilſt they over-care for that which is neither worthy nor poſſible to be kept?</p>
            <p>Neither is <hi>Mary</hi>'s buſineſs more allowed then her ſelf: <hi>She hath choſen the good part.</hi> It was not forced upon her, but taken up by her election. <hi>Martha</hi> might have ſate ſtill as well as ſhe: She might have ſtirr'd about as well as <hi>Martha. Mary</hi>'s will made this choice, not without the inclination of him who both gave this will and commends it. That will was before renewed; no marvel if it choſe the good: though this were not in a caſe of good and evil, but of good and better. We have ſtill this holy freedome, through the inoperation of him that hath freed us. Happy are we if we can improve this liberty to the beſt advantage of our Souls.</p>
            <p>The ſtability or perpetuity of good addes much to the praiſe of it. <hi>Martha</hi>'s part was ſoon gone; the thank and uſe of a little outward Hoſpitality cannot long laſt: but <hi>Mary's ſhall not be taken away from her.</hi> The act of her hearing was tranſient, the fruit permanent; ſhe now hears that which ſhall ſtick by her for ever.</p>
            <p>What couldſt thou hear, O Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> from thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred lips, which we hear not ſtill? That Heavenly Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is never but the ſame, not more ſubject to change then the Authour of it. It is not impoſſible that the exerciſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:47750:175"/>
of the Goſpel ſhould be taken from us; but the benefit and virtue of it is as inſeparable from our Souls as their Being. In the hardeſt times that ſhall ſtick cloſeſt to us; and till death, in death, after death ſhall make us happy.</p>

            <p>THE man was <hi>born blind:</hi> This Cure requires not Art, but Power; a Power no leſs then infinite and Divine. Nature preſuppoſeth a matter, though formleſs; Art looks for matter formed to our hands: God ſtands not upon either. Where there was not an Eye to be healed, what could an Oculiſt doe? It is onely a God that can create. Such are we, O God, to all ſpiritual things: we want not ſight, but eyes: it muſt be thou onely that canſt make us capable of illumination.</p>
            <p>The blind man <hi>ſate begging.</hi> Thoſe that have eyes and hands and feet of their own may be able to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; thoſe that want theſe helps muſt be beholden to the eyes, hands, feet of others. The impotent are caſt upon our mercy: Happy are we, if we can lend lims and ſenſes to the needy. Affected beggary is odious: that which is of God's making juſtly challengeth relief.</p>
            <p>Where ſhould this blind man ſit begging, but near the Temple? At one gate ſits a Cripple, a Blind man at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Well might theſe miſerable Souls ſuppoſe that Piety and Charity dwelt cloſe together: the two Tables were both of one quarry. Then are we beſt diſpoſed to mercy towards our brethren, when we have either craved or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged God's mercy towards our ſelves. If we go

thither to beg of God, how can we deny mites, when we hope for talents?</p>
            <p>Never did <hi>Jeſus</hi> move one foot but to purpoſe. He paſſed by; but ſo as that his Virtue ſtayed: ſo did he paſs by, that his eye was fixed. The blind man could not ſee him; he ſees the blind man. His goodneſs prevents us, and yields better ſupplies to our wants. He ſaw compaſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not ſhutting his eyes, not turning them aſide, but bending them upon that dark and diſconſolate Object. That which was ſaid of the Sun, is much more true of him that made it, <hi>Nothing is hid from his light:</hi> but of all other things Miſeries (eſpecially of his own) are moſt intentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eyed of him. Could we be miſerable unſeen, we had reaſon to be heartleſs. O Saviour, why ſhould we not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate thee in this mercifull improvement of our Senſes? Wo be to thoſe eyes that care onely to gaze upon their own beauty, bravery, wealth; not abiding to glance upon the ſores of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> the ſorrows of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the dungeon of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> the blind Beggar at the gate of the Temple.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples ſee the blind man too, but with different eyes: our Saviour for pity and cure, they for expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Maſter, who did ſin? this man, or his Parents, that he is born blind?</hi> I like well that whatſoever doubt troubled them, they ſtraight vent it into the ear of their Maſter. O Saviour, whilſt thou art in Heaven, thy ſchool is upon earth. Wherefore ſerve thy <hi>Prieſts lips,</hi> but to <hi>preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> What uſe is there of the tongue of the learned, but to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon? Thou teacheſt us ſtill; and ſtill we doubt, and ask, and learn.</p>
            <p>In one ſhort queſtion I find two Truths and two Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods; the Truths implied, the Falſhoods expreſſed. It is true, that commonly man's ſuffering is for ſin; that we may juſtly, and do often, ſuffer even for the ſins of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. It is falſe, that there is no other reaſon of our ſuffering but ſin; that a man could ſin actually before he was, or was before his being, or could before-hand ſuffer for
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:47750:176"/>
his after-ſins. In all likelihood that abſurd conceit of the Tranſmigration of Souls poſſeſſed the very Diſciples. How eaſily and how far may the beſt be miſcarried with a common errour? We are not thankfull for our own illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if we do not look with charity and pity upon the groſs miſ-opinions of our brethren.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour ſees, and yet will wink at ſo foul a miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Diſciples. I hear neither chiding nor conviction. He that could have inlightned their minds (as he did the world) at once, will doe it by due leiſure; and onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents himſelf here with a mild ſolution; <hi>Neither this man, nor his Parents.</hi> We learn nothing of thee, O Saviour, if not meekneſs. What a ſweet temper ſhould be in our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards the weakneſſes of others judgments? how ſhould we inſtruct them without bitterneſs, and without violence of Paſſion expect the meet ſeaſons of their better information? The tender Mother or Nurſe doth not rate her little one for that he goes not well; but gives him her hand, that he may goe better. It is the ſpirit of lenity that muſt reſtore and confirm the lapſed.</p>
            <p>The anſwer is direct and punctuall, neither the ſin of the man nor of his Parents bereaved him of his eyes: there was an higher cauſe of this privation, the glory that God meant to win unto himſelf by redreſſing it. The Parents had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in themſelves; the man had ſinned in his firſt Parents: it is not the guilt of either that is guilty of this blindneſs. All God's afflictive acts are not puniſhments; ſome are for the benefit of the creature, whether for probation, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or reformation; all are for the praiſe, whether of his Divine Power, or Juſtice, or Mercy.</p>
            <p>It was fit ſo great a work ſhould be uſher'd in with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. A ſudden and abrupt appearance would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemed ſo glorious a demonſtration of Omnipotence. The way is made; our Saviour addreſſes himſelf to the Miracle: a Miracle not more in the thing done, then in the form of doing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="347" facs="tcp:47750:176"/>The matter uſed was Clay. Could there be a meaner? could there be ought more unfit? O Saviour, how oft hadſt thou cured blindneſſes by thy word alone? how oft by thy touch? How eaſily couldſt thou have done ſo here? Was this to ſhew thy liberty, or thy power? Liberty, in that thou canſt at pleaſure uſe variety of means, not being tied to any; Power, in that thou couldſt make uſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries? Hadſt thou pull'd out a box and applied ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall ointment to the eyes, ſomething had been aſcribed to thy skill, more to the naturall power of thy receit: now thou mad'ſt uſe of clay, which had been enough to ſtop up the eyes of the ſeeing, the virtue muſt be all in thee, none in the means. The utter diſproportion of this help to the Cure adds glory to the worker.</p>
            <p>How clearly didſt thou hence evince to the world, that thou, who of clay couldſt make eyes, wert the ſame who of clay hadſt made man; ſince there is no part of the body that hath ſo little analogy to clay as the eye; this clearneſs is contrary to that opacity? Had not the <hi>Jews</hi> been more blind then the man whom thou curedſt, and more hard and ſtiff then the clay which thou mollifiedſt, they had, in this one work, both ſeen and acknowledged thy Deity.</p>
            <p>What could the clay have done without thy tempering? It was thy ſpittle that made the clay effectuall; it was that Sacred mouth of thine that made the ſpittle medicinall: the water of <hi>Siloe</hi> ſhall but waſh off that clay which this inward moiſture made powerfull. The clay thus tempered, muſt be applied by the hand that made it, elſe it avails nothing.</p>
            <p>What muſt the blind man needs think, when he felt the cold clay upon the holes of his eyes? or (ſince he could not conceive what an eye was) what muſt the beholders needs think, to ſee that hollowneſs thus filled up? Is this the way to give either eyes or ſight? Why did not the earth ſee with this clay as well as the man? What is there to hinder the fight, if this make it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:47750:177"/>Yet with theſe contrarieties muſt the Faith be exerciſed, where God intends the bleſſing of a Cure.</p>
            <p>It was never meant that this clay ſhould dwell upon thoſe pits of the eyes: it is onely put on to be waſhed off, and that not by every water; none ſhall doe it but that of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loam,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Sent</hi>; and if the man had not been ſent to <hi>Siloam,</hi> he had been ſtill blind. All things receive their virtue from Divine inſtitution. How elſe ſhould a piece of wheaten bread nouriſh the Soul? How ſhould ſpring-water waſh off ſpirituall filthineſs? How ſhould the fooliſhneſs of preaching ſave Souls? How ſhould the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of God's Miniſter be more effectuall then the breath of an ordinary Chriſtian? Thou, O God, haſt ſet apart theſe Ordinances; thy Bleſſing is annexed to them; hence is the ground of all our uſe, and their efficacy. Hadſt thou ſo inſtituted, <hi>Jordan</hi> would as well have healed Blindneſs, and <hi>Siloam</hi> Leproſy.</p>
            <p>That the man might be capable of ſuch a Miracle, his Faith is ſet on work; he muſt be led with his eyes daubed up to the pool of <hi>Siloam.</hi> He waſhes, and ſees. Lord, what did this man think when his eyes were now firſt given him? what a new world did he find himſelf now come into? how did he wonder at Heaven and earth, and the faces and ſhapes of all creatures, the goodly varieties of colours, the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the light, the lively beams of the Sun, the vaſt expanſion of the air, the pleaſant tranſparence of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; at the glorious piles of the Temple, and ſtately palaces of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> Every thing did not more pleaſe then aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him. Lo, thus ſhall we be affected, and more, when, the ſcales of our mortality being done away, we ſhall ſee as we are ſeen; when we ſhall behold the bleſſedneſs of that other world, the glory of the Saints and Angels, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majeſty of the Son of God, the incomprehenſible brightneſs of the all-glorious Deity. O my Soul, that thou couldſt be taken up before-hand with the admiration of that which thou canſt not as yet be capable of fore-ſeeing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="tcp:47750:177"/>It could not be but that many eyes had been witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this man's want of eyes. He ſate begging at one of the Temple-gates: not onely all the City, but all the Country muſt needs know him; thrice a year did they come up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; neither could they come to the Temple and not ſee him. His very blindneſs made him noted. Deformities and infirmities of body do more eaſily both draw and fix the eye then an ordinary ſymmetry of parts.</p>
            <p>Beſides his Blindneſs, his Trade made him remarkable; the importunity of his begging drew the eyes of the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. But of all other, the Place moſt notified him. Had he ſate in ſome obſcure village of <hi>Judaea,</hi> or in ſome blind lane of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> perhaps he had not been heeded of many; but now that he took up his ſeat in the heart, in the head of the chief City, whither all reſorted from all parts, what <hi>Jew</hi> can there be that knows not the blind beggar at the Temple-gate? Purpoſely did our Saviour make choice of ſuch a Subject for his Miracle; a man ſo poor, and ſo pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick: the glory of the work could not have reach'd ſo far, if it had been done to the wealthieſt Citizen of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Neither was it for nothing that the act and the man is doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of and inquired into by the beholders; <hi>Is not this he that ſate begging? Some ſaid, It is he; others ſaid, It is like him.</hi> No truths have received ſo full proofs as thoſe that have been queſtioned. The want or the ſudden preſence of an eye (much more of both) muſt needs make a great change in the face; thoſe little balls of light (which no doubt were more clear then Nature could have made them) could not but give a new life to the countenance. I marvell not if the neighbours, who had wont to ſee this dark viſage led by a guide, and guided by a ſtaffe, ſeeing him now wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king confidently alone out of his own inward light, and looking them chearfully in the face, doubted whether this were he. The miraculous cures of God work a ſenſible alteration in men, not more in their own apprehenſion,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:47750:178"/>
then in the judgement of others. Thus in the redreſs of the Spiritual blindneſs, the whole habit of the man is changed. Where before his Face looked dull and earthly; now there is a ſprightfull chearfulneſs in it, through the comfortable knowledge of God and Heavenly things. Whereas before his Heart was ſet upon worldly things; now he uſes them, but injoys them not: and that uſe is becauſe he muſt, not becauſe he would. Where before his fears and griefs were onely for pains of body, or loſs of eſtate or reputation; now they are onely ſpent upon the diſpleaſure of his God, and the peril of his Soul. So as now the neighbours can ſay, <hi>Is this the man? others, It is like him, it is not he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late-blind man hears, and now ſees himſelf queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and ſoon reſolves the doubt, <hi>I am he.</hi> He that now ſaw the light of the Sun, would not hide the light of Truth from others. It is an unthankfull ſilence, to ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the works of God in an affected ſecrecy. To make God a loſer by his bounty to us, were a ſhamefull injuſtice. We our ſelves abide not thoſe ſponges that ſuck up good turns unknown. O God, we are not worthy of our ſpiritual eye-ſight, if we do not publiſh thy mercies on the houſe top, and praiſe thee in the great congregation.</p>
            <p>Man is naturally inquiſitive: we ſearch ſtudiouſly into the ſecret works of Nature; we pry into the reaſons of the witty inventions of Art; but if there be any thing that tranſcends Art and Nature, the more high and abſtruſe it is, the more buſie we are to ſeek into it. This thirſt after hidden, yea forbidden, Knowledge did once coſt us dear: but where it is good and lawfull to know, inquiry is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; as here in theſe <hi>Jews, How were thine eyes opened?</hi> The firſt improvement of humane Reaſon is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, the next is information and reſolution: and if the meaneſt events paſs us not without a queſtion, how much leſs thoſe that carry in them wonder and advantage?</p>
            <p>He that was ſo ready to profeſs himſelf the ſubject of the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:47750:178"/>
Cure, is no niggard of proclaiming the Authour of it; <hi>A man that is called Jeſus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and ſent me to Siloam to waſh, and now I ſee.</hi> The blind man knew no more then he ſaid, and he ſaid what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, <hi>A man.</hi> He heard <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſpeak, he felt his hand; as yet he could look no farther: upon his next meeting he ſaw God in this man. In matter of Knowledge, we muſt be content to creep ere we can goe. As that other reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered blind man ſaw firſt men walk like trees, after like men; ſo no marvell if this man ſaw firſt this God onely as man, after this man as God alſo. Onwards he thinks him a wonderfull man, a mighty Prophet. In vain ſhall we either expect a ſudden perfection in the underſtanding of Divine matters, or cenſure thoſe that want it.</p>
            <p>How did this man know what <hi>Jeſus</hi> did? He was then ſtone-blind; what diſtinction could he yet make of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, of actions? True; but yet the blind man never wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the aſſiſtence of others eyes; their relation hath aſſur'd him of the manner of his Cure, beſides the contribution of his other Senſes: his Ear might perceive the ſpittle to fall, and hear the injoyned command; his Feeling percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the cold and moiſt clay upon his lips. All theſe conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned gave ſufficient warrant thus to believe, thus to report. Our ear is our beſt guide to a full apprehenſion of the works of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The works of God the Father, his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Government, are beſt known by the Eye. The works of God the Son, his Redemption and Mediation, are beſt known by the Ear. O Saviour, we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally ſee what thou haſt done here. What are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of thine Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, but the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the blind man's guide, what and how thou haſt wrought for us? On theſe we ſtrongly rely, theſe we do no leſs confidently believe then if our very eyes had been witneſſes of what thou didſt and ſufferedſt upon earth. There were no place for Faith; if the Ear were not worthy of as much credit as the Eye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="352" facs="tcp:47750:179"/>How could the neighbours doe leſs then ask where he was that had done ſo ſtrange a Cure? I doubt yet with what mind; I fear, not out of favour. Had they been but indifferent, they could not but have been full of ſilent wonder, and inclined to believe in ſo Omnipotent an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Now, as prejudiced to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and partiall to the Phariſees, they bring the late-blind man before thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed enemies unto <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the prepoſterous Religion of the Vulgar ſort, to claw and adore thoſe which have tyrannically uſurped upon their Souls, though with neglect, yea with contempt, of God in his word, in his works. Even unjuſt authority will never want ſoothing up in whatſoever courſes, though with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and oppoſition to the Truth. Baſe minds, where they find poſſeſſion, never look after right.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour had pick'd out the Sabbath for this Cure. It is hard to find out any time wherein Charity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable. As Mercy is an excellent Grace, ſo the works of it are fitteſt for the beſt day. We are all born blind: the Font is our <hi>Siloam:</hi> no day can come amiſs, but yet God's day is the propereſt for our waſhing and recovery.</p>
            <p>This alone is quarrell enough to theſe ſcrupulous wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers, that an act of Mercy was done on that day wherein their envy was but ſeaſonable.</p>
            <p>I do not ſee the man beg any more when he once had his eyes; no Burger in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was richer then he. I hear him ſtoutly defending that gracious authour of his Cure againſt the cavills of the malicious Phariſees: I ſee him as a reſolute Confeſſour ſuffering Excommunication for the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and maintaining the innocence and honour of ſo Bleſſed a Benefactour: I hear him reade a Divinity-Lecture to them that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> his chair, and convincing them of blindneſs, who puniſh'd him for ſeeing.</p>
            <p>How can I but envy thee, O happy man, who, of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:47750:179"/>
proveſt an Advocate for thy Saviour; whoſe gain of bodily ſight made way for thy Spirituall eyes; who haſt loſt a Synagogue, and haſt found Heaven; who, being abandoned of Sinners, art received of the Lord of Glory?</p>

            <head>XXXVI. The ſtubborn Devil ejected.</head>
            <p>HOW different, how contrary are our conditions here upon earth? Whilſt our Saviour is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured on the Mount,<note place="margin">Matth. 17.14. <hi>compared with</hi> Mark 9.14.</note> his Diſciples are perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the valley. Three of his choice Followers were with him above, raviſhed with the miraculous proofs of his Godhead: nine other were troubled with the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſtubborn Devil below.</p>
            <p>Much people was met to attend <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and there they will ſtay till he come down from <hi>Tabor.</hi> Their zeal and devotion brought them thither; their patient perſeverance held them there. We are not worthy the name of his clients, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not painfully ſeek him, and ſubmiſsly wait his leiſure.</p>
            <p>He that was now awhile retired into the Mount, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with his Father, and to receive the attendence of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> returns into the valley to the multitude. He was ſingled out awhile for prayer and contemplation; now he was joyned with the multitude for their miraculous cure and Heavenly inſtruction. We that are his ſpirituall agents muſt be either preparing in the mount, or exerciſing in the valley; one while in the mount of Meditation, in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Action another; alone to ſtudy, in the aſſembly to preach: here is much variety, but all is work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he came down from the hill, heard Muſick in the valley; <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when he came down from the hill, heard
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:47750:180"/>
diſcord. The Scribes (it ſeems) were ſetting hard upon the Diſciples: they ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi> abſent, nine of his train left in the valley, thoſe they fly upon. As the Devil, ſo his Imps watch cloſe for all advantages. No ſubtle enemy but will be ſure to attempt that part where is likelihood of leaſt defence, moſt weakneſs. When the Spouſe miſſes him whom her Soul loveth, every watchman hath a buffet for her. O Saviour, if thou be never ſo little ſtept aſide, we are ſure to be aſſaulted with powerfull Temptations.</p>
            <p>They that durſt ſay nothing to the Maſter, ſo ſoon as his back is turned fall foul upon his weakeſt Diſciples. Even at the firſt hatching the Serpent was thus crafty, to begin at the weaker veſſell: experience and time hath not abated his wit. If he ſtill work upon <hi>ſilly Women laden with divers luſts,</hi> upon rude and ungrounded Ignorants, it is no other then his old wont.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour upon the skirts of the hill knew well what was done in the plain; and therefore haſts down to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue of his Diſciples. The clouds and vapours do not ſooner ſcatter upon the Sun's breaking forth, then theſe cavils va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh at the preſence of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> in ſtead of oppoſition they are ſtraight upon their knees; here are now no quarrels, but humble ſalutations; and if <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s queſtion did not force theirs, the Scribes had found no tongue.</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs there were many eager Patients in this throng; none made ſo much noiſe as the father of the Demoniack. Belike upon his occaſion it was that the Scribes held conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation with the Diſciples. If they wrangled, he ſues, and that from his knees. Whom will not need make both hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eloquent? The caſe was wofull, and accordingly expreſſed. A ſon is a dear name; but this was his onely ſon. Were his grief ordinary yet, the ſorrow were the leſs; but he is a fearfull ſpectacle of judgment, for he is Lunatick. Were this Lunacy yet merely from a naturall diſtemper, it were more tolerable; but this is aggravated by the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a cruell ſpirit, that handles him in a moſt grievous
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:47750:180"/>
manner. Yet were he but in the rank of other Demoniacks, the diſcomfort were more eaſy; but lo, this ſpirit is worſe then all other his fellows; others are uſually diſpoſſeſſed by the Diſciples, this is beyond their power. <hi>I beſought thy Diſciples to caſt him out, but they could not: therefore, Lord, have thou mercy on my Son.</hi> The deſpair of all other helps ſends us importunately to the God of power. Here was his refuge; the ſtrong man had gotten poſſeſſion, it was onely the ſtronger then he that can eject him. O God, ſpirituall wickedneſſes have naturally ſeized upon our Souls: all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane helps are too weak; onely thy Mercy ſhall improve thy Power to our deliverance.</p>
            <p>What bowels could chuſe but yearn at the diſtreſs of this poor young man? Frenzy had taken his brain: that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was but health in compariſon of the tyrannicall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that evill ſpirit, wherewith it was ſeconded. Out of Hell there could not be a greater miſery: his ſenſes are either bereft, or elſe left to torment him; he is torn and racked, ſo as he foams and gnaſhes, he pines and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes; he is caſt ſometimes into the fire, ſometimes into the water. How that malicious Tyrant rejoyces in the miſchief done to the creature of God? Had earth had any thing more pernicious then fire and water, thither had he been thrown; though rather for torture, then diſpatch. It was too much favour to die at once. O God, with how dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemies haſt thou matched us? Abate thou their power, ſince their malice will not be abated.</p>
            <p>How many think of this caſe with pity and horrour, and in the mean time are inſenſible of their own fearfuller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
            <p>It is but oftentimes that the Devil would caſt this young man into a temporary fire; he would caſt the ſinner into an eternall fire, whoſe everlaſting burnings have no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. No fire comes amiſs to him; the fire of Affliction, the fire of Luſt, the fire of Hell. O God, make us apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the danger of our ſin, and ſecure from the fearfull iſſue of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="356" facs="tcp:47750:181"/>All theſe very ſame effects follow his ſpiritual poſſeſſion. How doth he tear and rack them whom he vexes and diſtracts with inordinate cares and ſorrows? How do they foam and gnaſh whom he hath drawn to an impatient repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at God's afflictive hand? How do they pine away who hourly decay and languiſh in Grace?</p>
            <p>Oh the lamentable condition of ſinfull ſouls, ſo much more dangerous, by how much leſs felt!</p>
            <p>But all this while what part hath the Moon in this man's miſery? How comes the name of that goodly Planet in queſtion? Certainly theſe diſeaſes of the brain follow much the courſe of this queen of moiſture. That power which ſhe hath in humours is drawn to the advantage of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſpirit; her predominancy is abuſed to his deſpight: whether it were for the better opportunity of his vexation, or whether for the drawing of envy and diſcredit upon ſo noble a creature. It is no news with that ſubtle enemy to faſten his effects upon thoſe ſecondary cauſes which he uſurps to his own purpoſes. What-ever be the means, he is the tormentour. Much wiſedom needs to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the evil ſpirit abuſing the good creature, and the good creature abuſed by the evil ſpirit.</p>
            <p>He that knew all things, asks queſtions; <hi>How long hath he been ſo?</hi> Not to inform himſelf; (That Devil could have done nothing without the knowledge, without the leave of the God of Spirits;) but that by the confeſſion of the Parent he might lay forth the wofull condition of the Child; that the thank and glory of the Cure might be ſo much greater, as the complaint was more grievous. <hi>He anſwered, From a child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O God, how I adore the depth of thy wiſe and juſt and powerfull diſpenſation? Thou that couldſt ſay, <hi>I have loved Jacob, and Eſau have I hated, ere the children had done good or evil,</hi> thoughteſt alſo good, ere this Child could be capable of good or evil, to yield him over to the power of that Evil one. What need I ask for any other reaſon then that which is
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:47750:181"/>
the rule of all Juſtice, thy Will? Yet even theſe weak eyes can ſee the juſt grounds of thine actions. That child, though an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> was conceived and born in that ſin which both could and did give Satan an intereſt in him. Beſides, the actual ſins of the Parents deſerved this revenge upon that piece of themſelves. Rather, O God, let me magnifie thy Mercy, that we and ours eſcape this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then queſtion thy Juſtice, that ſome eſcape not. How juſt might it have been with thee, that we, who have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven way to Satan in our ſins, ſhould have way and ſcope given to Satan over us in our puniſhments? It is thy praiſe that any of us are free; it is no quarrell that ſome ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Do I wonder to ſee Satan's bodily poſſeſſion of this young man from a child, when I ſee his ſpiritual poſſeſſion of every ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> from a longer date; not from a child, but from the womb, yea in it? Why ſhould not Satan poſſeſs his own? we are all by nature the ſons of wrath. It is time for us to renounce him in Baptiſm, whoſe we are till we be regenerate. He hath right to us in our firſt birth; our new birth acquits us from him, and cuts off all his claim. How miſerable are they that have nothing but Nature? Better had it been to have been unborn, then not to be born again.</p>
            <p>And if this poor ſoul from an infant were thus miſerably handled, having done none actual evil; how juſt cauſe have we to fear the like Judgments, who by many foul of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences have deſerved to draw this executioner upon us? O my Soul, thou haſt not room enough for thankfulneſs to that good God, who hath not delivered thee up to that malignant Spirit.</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed Father ſits not ſtill, neglects not means: <hi>I brought him to thy Diſciples.</hi> Doubtleſs the man came firſt to ſeek for <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; finding him abſent, he makes ſuit to the Diſciples. To whom ſhould we have recourſe in all our ſpiritual complaints but to the agents and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God? The noiſe of the like cures had ſurely brought
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:47750:182"/>
this man with much confidence to crave their ſuccour; and now how cold was he at the heart, when he found that his hopes were fruſtrate? <hi>They could not caſt him out.</hi> No doubt the Diſciples tried their beſt, they laid their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted charge upon this dumb ſpirit; but all in vain. They that could come with joy and triumph to their Maſter, and ſay, <hi>The Devils are ſubject to us,</hi> find now themſelves mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a ſtubborn and refractory ſpirit. Their way was hitherto ſmooth and fair; they met with no rub till now. And now ſurely the father of the Demoniack was not more troubled at this event then themſelves. How could they chuſe but fear leſt their Maſter had, with himſelf, with-drawn that ſpiritual power which they had formerly exerciſed? Needs muſt their heart fail them with their ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The man complained not of their impotence: it were fondly injurious to accuſe them for that which they could not doe: had the want been in their will, they had well deſerved a querulous language; it was no fault to want power. Onely he complains of the ſtubbornneſs, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the invincibleneſs of that evil ſpirit.</p>
            <p>I ſhould wrong you, O ye bleſſed Followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if I ſhould ſay that, as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> was gone up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mount, loſt their belief with their guide; ſo that ye, miſſing your Maſter, (who was now aſcended up to his <hi>Tabor,</hi>) were to ſeek for your Faith. Rather the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God ſaw reaſon to check your over-aſſured forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and both to pull down your hearts by a juſt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in the ſenſe of your own weakneſs, and to raiſe up your hearts to new acts of dependence upon that ſovereign power from which your limited virtue was derived.</p>
            <p>What was more familiar to the Diſciples then ejecting of Devils? In this onely it is denied them. Our good God ſometimes finds it requiſite to hold us ſhort in thoſe abilities whereof we make leaſt doubt, that we may feel whence we had them. God will be no leſs glorified in what we
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:47750:182"/>
cannot doe, then in what we can doe. If his Graces were alwaies at our command, and ever alike, they would ſeem naturall, and ſoon run into contempt: now we are juſtly held in an awfull dependence upon that gracious hand, which ſo gives as not to cloy us, and ſo denies as not to diſcourage us.</p>
            <p>Who could now but expect that our Saviour ſhould have pitied and bemoaned the condition of this ſad father and miſerable ſon, and have let fall ſome words of comfort upon them? In ſtead whereof I hear him chiding and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, <hi>O faithleſs and perverſe generation, how long ſhall I be with you? how long ſhall I ſuffer you?</hi> Complaining, not of that wofull father and more wofull ſon; it was not his faſhion to adde affliction to the diſtreſſed, to break ſuch bruiſed reeds; but of thoſe Scribes, who, upon the failing of the ſucceſs of this ſuit, had inſulted upon the diſability of the Followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and depraved his power: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps this impatient father, ſeduced by their ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, might ſlip into ſome thoughts of diſtruſt.</p>
            <p>There could not be a greater crimination then <hi>faithleſs and perverſe: faithleſs,</hi> in not believing; <hi>perverſe,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſtinately ſet in their unbelief. Doubtleſs theſe men were not free from other notorious crimes: all were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their Infidelity. Morall uncleanneſſes or violences may ſeem more hainous to men; none are ſo odious to God as theſe Intellectuall wickedneſſes.</p>
            <p>What an happy change is here in one breath of <hi>Chriſt? How long ſhall I ſuffer you? Bring him hither to me.</hi> The one is a word of anger, the other of favour. His juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation doth not exceed or impeach his Goodneſs. What a ſweet mixture there is in the perfect ſimplicity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature? <hi>In the midſt of judgment he remembers mercy,</hi> yea he acts it. His Sun ſhines in the midſt of this ſtorm. Whether he frown or whether he ſmile, it is all to one purpoſe, that he may win the incredulous and diſobedient. Whither ſhould the rigour of all our cenſures tend but to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:47750:183"/>
edification, and not to deſtruction? We are Phyſicians, we are not executioners; we give purges to cure, and not poiſons to kill. It is for the juſt Judge to ſay one day to reprobate Souls, <hi>Depart from me:</hi> in the mean time it is for us to invite all that are ſpiritually poſſeſſed to the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of mercy. <hi>Bring him hither to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Saviour, diſtance was no hindrance to thy work: why ſhould the Demoniack be brought to thee? Was it that this deliverance might be the better evicted, and that the beholders might ſee it was not for nothing that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were oppoſed with ſo refractory a ſpirit? or was it that the Scribes might be witneſſes of that ſtrong hoſtility that was betwixt thee and that foul ſpirit, and be aſhamed of their blaſphemous ſlander? or was it that the father of the Demoniack might be quickened in that Faith which now, through the ſuggeſtion of the Scribes, begun to droop; when he ſhould hear and ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo chearfully to undertake and perform that whereof they had bidden him deſpair?</p>
            <p>The poſſeſſed is brought; the Devil is rebuked and ejected. That ſtiffe ſpirit, which ſtood out boldly againſt the commands of the Diſciples, cannot but ſtoop to the voice of the Maſter: that power which did at firſt caſt him out of Heaven, eaſily diſpoſſeſſes him of an houſe of clay. <hi>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan,</hi> and then thou canſt not but flee.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples, who were not uſed to theſe affronts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be troubled at their miſ-ſucceſs: <hi>Maſter, why could not we caſt him out?</hi> Had they been conſcious of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in themſelves, they had never ask'd the queſtion. Little did they think to hear of their Unbelief. Had they not had great Faith, they could not have caſt out any Devils; had they not had ſome want of Faith, they had caſt out this. It is poſſible for us to be defective in ſome Graces, and not to feel it.</p>
            <p>Although not ſo much their weakneſs is guilty of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prevailing, as the ſtrength of that evil ſpirit. <hi>This kind goes
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:47750:183"/>
not out but by prayer and faſting.</hi> Weaker ſpirits were wont to be ejected by a command; this Devil was more ſturdy and boiſterous. As there are degrees of ſtatures in men, ſo there are degrees of ſtrength and rebellion in ſpirituall wickedneſſes. Here bidding will not ſerve, they muſt pray; and praying will not ſerve without faſting. They muſt pray to God that they may prevail; they muſt faſt to make their prayer more fervent, more effectuall. We cannot now command, we can faſt and pray. How good is our God to us, that whilſt he hath not thought fit to continue to us thoſe means which are leſs powerfull for the diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the powers of darkneſs, yet he hath given us the greater? Whilſt we can faſt and pray, God will command for us; Satan cannot prevail againſt us.</p>

            <head>XXXVII. The Widow's Mites.</head>
            <p>THE ſacred wealth of the Temple was either in ſtuff, or in coin. For the one the <hi>Jews</hi> had an houſe, for the other a cheſt. At the concourſe of all the males to the Temple thrice a year upon occaſion of the ſolemn Feaſts, the oblations of both kinds were liberall. Our Saviour, as taking pleaſure in the proſpect, ſets himſelf to view thoſe Offerings, whether for holy uſes or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable.</p>
            <p>Thoſe things we delight in, we love to behold: The eye and the heart will goe together. And can we think, O Saviour, that thy Glory hath diminiſhed ought of thy gracious reſpects to our beneficence? or that thine acceptance of our Charity was confined to the earth?
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47750:184"/>
Even now that thou ſitteſt at the right hand of thy Father's glory, thou ſeeſt every hand that is ſtretched out to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of thy poor Saints here below. And if vanity have power to ſtir up our Liberality out of a conceit to be ſeen of men, how ſhall Faith encourage our Bounty in knowing that we are ſeen of thee, and accepted by thee? Alas! what are we the better for the notice of thoſe periſhing and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent eyes, which can onely view the outſide of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; or for that waſte wind of applauſe which vaniſheth in the lips of the ſpeaker? Thine eye, O Lord, is piercing and retributive. As to ſee thee is perfect Happineſs, ſo to be ſeen of thee is true contentment and glory.</p>
            <p>And doſt thou, O God, ſee what we give thee, and not ſee what we take away from thee? Are our Offerings more noted then our Sacrileges? Surely thy Mercy is not more quick-ſighted then thy Juſtice. In both kinds our actions are viewed, our account is kept; and we are ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Rewards for what we have given, and Vengeance for what we have defalked. With thine eye of Knowledge thou ſeeſt all we doe; but what we doe well, thou ſeeſt with thine eye of Approbation. So didſt thou now behold theſe pious and charitable Oblations. How well wert thou pleaſed with this variety? Thou ſaweſt many rich men give much; and one poor Widow give more then they in leſſer room.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> were now under the <hi>Roman</hi> preſſure; they were all tributaries, yet many of them rich; and thoſe rich men were liberal to the common cheſt. Hadſt thou ſeen thoſe many rich give little, we had heard of thy cenſure: thou expecteſt a proportion betwixt the giver and the gift, betwixt the gift and the receit: where that fails, the blame is juſt. That Nation (though otherwiſe faulty enough) was in this commendable. How bounteouſly open were their hands to the houſe of God? Time was when their liberality was fain to be reſtrained by Proclamation; and now it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no incitement: the rich gave much, the pooreſt gave
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47750:184"/>
more. <hi>He ſaw a poor Widow caſting in two mites.</hi> It was miſery enough that ſhe was a Widow. The married woman is under the carefull proviſion of an Huſband; if ſhe ſpend, he earns: in that eſtate four hands work for her; in her viduity but two. Poverty added to the ſorrow of her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowhood. The loſs of ſome Huſbands is ſupplied by a rich joynture; it is ſome allay to the grief that the hand is left full, though the bed be empty: this woman was not more deſolate then needy. Yet this poor widow gives. And what gives ſhe? An offering like her ſelf, <hi>two mites</hi>; or, in our language, two half-farthing-tokens. Alas, good woman! who was poorer then thy ſelf? wherefore was that Corban, but for the relief of ſuch as thou? who ſhould receive, if ſuch give? Thy mites were ſomething to thee, nothing to the Treaſury. How ill is that gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed, which diſ-furniſheth thee, and adds nothing to the common ſtock? Some thrifty neighbour might perhaps have ſuggeſted this probable diſcouragement. <hi>Jeſus</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes and applauds her bounty: <hi>He called his Diſciples, and ſaid unto them, Verily I ſay unto you, this woman hath caſt in more then they all.</hi> Whilſt the rich put in their offerings, I ſee no Diſciples called; it was enough that <hi>Chriſt</hi> noted their gifts alone: but when the Widow comes with her two mites, now the domeſticks of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are ſummoned to aſſemble, and taught to admire this munificence; a ſolemn preface makes way to her praiſe, and her Mites are made more precious then the others Talents. <hi>She gave more then they all.</hi> More, not onely in reſpect of the Mind of the giver, but of the proportion of the gift, as hers. A mite to her was more then pounds to them: Pounds were little to them, two mites were all to her: They gave out of their abundance, ſhe out of her neceſſity. That which they gave, left the heap leſs, yet an heap ſtill; ſhe gives all at once, and leaves her ſelf nothing. So as ſhe gave, not more then any, but <hi>more then they all.</hi> God doth not ſo much regard what is taken out, as what is left. O Father of mercies,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47750:185"/>
thou lookeſt at once into the bottom of her heart and the bottom of her purſe; and eſteemeſt her gift according to both. As thou ſeeſt not as man, ſo thou valueſt not as man: Man judgeth by the worth of the gift, thou judgeſt by the mind of the giver and the proportion of the remainder. It were wide with us if thou ſhouldſt goe by quantities. Alas! what have we but mites, and thoſe of thine own len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? It is the comfort of our meanneſs, that our affections are valued, and not our preſents: neither haſt thou ſaid, <hi>God loves a</hi> liberal <hi>giver,</hi> but a <hi>chearfull.</hi> If I had more, O God, thou ſhouldſt have it; had I leſs, thou wouldſt not deſpiſe it, who <hi>accepteſt the gift according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, Lord, what have I but two mites, a Soul, and a Body? mere mites, yea, not ſo much, to thine Infiniteneſs. Oh that I could perfectly offer them up unto thee, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thine own right in them, and not according to mine. How graciouſly wouldſt thou be ſure to accept them? how happy ſhall I be in thine acceptation?</p>

            </head>
            <p>HE who had his own time and ours in his hand, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew and foretold the approach of his diſſolution. When men are near their end, and ready to make their Will, then is it ſeaſonable to ſue for Legacies. Thus did the Mother of the two <hi>Zebedees</hi>; therein well approving both her Wiſedom and her Faith: Wiſedom, in the fit choice of her opportunity; Faith, in taking ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:47750:185"/>The ſuit is half obtained that is ſeaſonably made. To have made this motion at the entry into their attendence, had been abſurd, and had juſtly ſeemed to challenge a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. It was at the parting of the Angel, that <hi>Jacob</hi> would be bleſſed. The double ſpirit of <hi>Elijah</hi> is not ſued for till his aſcending.</p>
            <p>But, O the admirable Faith of this good woman! When ſhe heard the diſcourſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Sufferings and Death, ſhe talks of his Glory; when ſhe hears of his Croſs, ſhe ſpeaks of his Crown. If ſhe had ſeen <hi>Herod</hi> come and tender his Scepter unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Elders of the <hi>Jews</hi> come upon their knees with a ſubmiſſive profer of their allegeance, ſhe might have had ſome reaſon to entertain the thoughts of a Kingdom: but now whilſt the ſound of betraying, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, dying, was in her ear, to make account of and ſuit for a room in his Kingdome, it argues a belief able to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over all diſcouragements.</p>
            <p>It was nothing for the Diſciples, when they ſaw him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his conqueſt of death and riſing from the grave, to ask him, <hi>Maſter, wilt thou now reſtore the kingdom unto Iſrael?</hi> but for a ſilly woman to look through his future Death and Paſſion, at his Reſurrection and Glory, it is no leſs worthy of wonder then praiſe.</p>
            <p>To hear a man in his beſt health and vigour to talk of his confidence in God, and aſſurance of Divine favour, cannot be much worth: but if in extremities we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve above hope, againſt hope, our Faith is ſo much more noble as our difficulties are greater.</p>
            <p>Never ſweeter perfume aroſe from any altar, then that which aſcended from <hi>Job</hi>'s dunghill, <hi>I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſtrange ſtyle is this that is given to this woman? It had been as eaſie to have ſaid, the wife of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> or the ſiſter of <hi>Mary</hi> or of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or (as her name was) plain <hi>Salome:</hi> but now, by an unuſual deſcription, ſhe is ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>The Mother of Zebedee's children. Zebedee</hi> was an obſcure
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:47750:186"/>
man; ſhe, as his wife, was no better: the greateſt honour ſhe ever had or could have, was to have two ſuch ſons as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>; theſe give a title to both their Parents. Honour aſcends as well as deſcends. Holy Children dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the loyns and womb from whence they proceed, no leſs then their Parents traduce honour unto them. <hi>Salome</hi> might be a good wife, a good huſwife, a good woman, a good neighbour: all theſe cannot ennoble her ſo much as <hi>the mother of Zebedee's children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a world of pain, toil, care, coſt, there is in the birth and education of Children? Their good proof requites all with advantage. Next to happineſs in our ſelves, is to be happy in a gracious Iſſue.</p>
            <p>The ſuit was the ſons, but by the mouth of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: it was their beſt policy to ſpeak by her lips. Even theſe Fiſhermen had already learned craftily to fiſh for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. Ambition was not ſo bold in them as to ſhew her own face: the envy of the ſuit ſhall thus be avoided, which could not but follow upon their perſonall requeſt. If it were granted, they had what they would; if not, it was but the repulſe of a woman's motion: which muſt needs be ſo much more pardonable, becauſe it was of a mother for her ſons.</p>
            <p>It is not diſcommendable in parents to ſeek the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their children. Why may not <hi>Abraham</hi> ſue for an <hi>Iſmael?</hi> So it be by lawfull means, in a moderate meaſure, in due order, this endeavour cannot be amiſs. It is the neglect of circumſtances that makes theſe deſires ſinfull. Oh the madneſs of thoſe Parents, that care not which way they raiſe an houſe; that deſire rather to leave their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren great, then good; that are more ambitious to have their ſons Lords on earth, then Kings in Heaven! Yet I commend thee, <hi>Salome,</hi> that thy firſt plot was to have thy ſons Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> then after to prefer them to the beſt places of that attendence. It is the true method of Divine prudence, O God, firſt to make our children happy
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47750:186"/>
with the honour of thy ſervice, and then to endeavour their meet advancement upon earth.</p>
            <p>The mother is put upon this ſuit by her ſons; their heart was in her lips. They were not ſo mortified by their continual converſation with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> hearing his Heavenly doctrine, ſeeing his Divine carriage, but that their minds were yet roving after temporal Honours. Pride is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt coat, which we put off laſt, and which we put on firſt. Who can wonder to ſee ſome ſparks of weak and worldly deſires in their holieſt teachers, when the bleſſed Apoſtles were not free from ſome ambitious thoughts whilſt they ſate at the feet, yea in the boſome of their Saviour?</p>
            <p>The near kindred this woman could challenge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> might ſeem to give her juſt colour of more familiarity; yet now that ſhe comes upon a ſuit, ſhe ſubmits her ſelf to the loweſt geſture of ſuppliants. We need not be taught, that it is fit for petitioners to the Great, to preſent their humble ſupplications upon their knees. O Saviour, if this woman, ſo nearly allied to thee according to the fleſh, coming but upon a temporal occaſion to thee, being as then compaſſed about with humane infirmities, adored thee ere ſhe durſt ſue to thee; what reverence is enough for us that come to thee upon ſpiritual ſuits, ſitting now in the height of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory and Majeſty? Say then, thou wife of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> what is it that thou craveſt of thine Omnipotent kinſman? <hi>A certain thing.</hi> Speak out, woman; what is this certain thing that thou craveſt? How poor and weak is this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory anticipation to him that knew thy thoughts ere thou utteredſt them, ere thou entertainedſt them? We are all in this tune; every one would have ſomething; ſuch perhaps as we are aſhamed to utter. The Proud man would have a certain thing; Honour in the world: the Covetous would have a certain thing too; Wealth and abundance: the Malicious would have a certain thing; Revenge on his enemies: the Epicure would have Pleaſure and Long life; the Barren, Children; the Wanton, Beauty.
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:47750:187"/>
Each one would be humoured in his own deſire; though in variety, yea contradiction to other; though in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not more to God's will, then our own good.</p>
            <p>How this ſuit ſticks in her teeth, and dares not freely come forth, becauſe it is guilty of its own faultineſs? What a difference there is betwixt the prayers of Faith, and the motions of Self-love and Infidelity? Thoſe come forth with boldneſs, as knowing their own welcome, and being well aſſured both of their warrant and acceptation: theſe ſtand bluſhing at the door, not daring to appear; like to ſome baffled ſuit, conſcious to its own unworthineſs and juſt repulſe. Our inordinate deſires are worthy of a check: when we know that our requeſts are holy, we cannot come with too much confidence to the throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>He that knew all their thoughts afar off, yet, as if he had been a ſtranger to their purpoſes, asks, <hi>What wouldſt thou?</hi> Our infirmities do then beſt ſhame us, when they are fetcht out of our own mouths: Like as our prayers alſo ſerve not to acquaint God with our wants, but to make us the more capable of his mercies.</p>
            <p>The ſuit is drawn from her; now ſhe muſt ſpeak. <hi>Grant that theſe my two ſons may ſit, one on thy right hand, the other on thy left, in thy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is hard to ſay, whether out of more pride or igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. It was as received as erroneous a conceit amongſt the very Diſciples of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that he ſhould raiſe up a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom over the now-tributary and beſlaved people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were now their maſters; their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was, that their <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould ſhake off this yoke, and reduce them to their former Liberty. So grounded was this opinion, that the two Diſciples in their walk to <hi>Emmaus</hi> could ſay, <hi>We truſted it had been he that ſhould have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Iſrael</hi>; and when, after his Reſurrection, he was walking up mount <hi>Olivet</hi> towards Heaven, his very Apoſtles could ask him, if he would now reſtore that long-expected Kingdom. How ſhould we mitigate our cenſures
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47750:187"/>
of our Chriſtian brethren, if either they miſtake, or know not ſome ſecondary truths of Religion, when the domeſtick attendents of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who heard him every day till the very point of his Aſcenſion, miſapprehended the chief cauſe of his coming into the world, and the ſtate of his Kingdom? If our Charity may not bear with ſmall faults, what doe we under his name that conniv'd at greater? Truth is as the Sun; bright in it ſelf, yet there are many cloſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners into which it never ſhined. O God, if thou open our hearts, we ſhall take in thoſe beams: till thou doe ſo, teach us to attend patiently for our ſelves, charitably for others.</p>
            <p>Theſe Fiſhermen had ſo much Courtſhip to know, that the right hand and the left of any Prince were the chief places of Honour. Our Saviour had ſaid that his twelve Followers ſhould ſit upon twelve thrones, and judge the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> This good woman would have her two ſons next to his perſon, the prime Peers of his Kingdom. Every one is apt to wiſh the beſt to his own. Worldly Honour is neither worth our ſuit, nor unworthy our acceptance. Yea, <hi>Salome,</hi> had thy mind been in Heaven, hadſt thou intended this deſired preeminence of that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial ſtate of Glory, yet I know not how to juſtifie thine ambition. Wouldſt thou have thy ſons preferred to the <hi>Father of the faithfull,</hi> to the bleſſed Mother of thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? That very wiſh were preſumptuous. For me, O God, my ambition ſhall go ſo high as to be a Saint in Heaven, and to live as holily on earth as the beſt; but for preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Heavenly honour, I do not, I dare not affect it. It is enough for me, if I may lift up my head amongſt the heels of thy Bleſſed ones.</p>
            <p>The mother asks, the ſons have the anſwer. She was but their tongue, they ſhall be her ears. God ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes the acts to the firſt mover, rather then to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
            <p>It was a ſore check, <hi>Ye know not what ye ask.</hi> Tn our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary communication to ſpeak idly, is ſin; but in our
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47750:188"/>
ſuits to <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be ſo inconſiderate, as not to underſtand our own petitions, muſt needs be a foul offence.</p>
            <p>As Faith is the ground of our Prayers, ſo Knowledge is the ground of our Faith. If we come with indigeſted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, we profane that Name we invoke.</p>
            <p>To convince their unfitneſs for Glory, they are ſent to their impotency in ſuffering; <hi>Are ye able to drink of the cup whereof I ſhall drink, and to be baptized with the Baptiſm wherewith I am baptized?</hi> O Saviour, even thou, who wert one with thy Father, haſt a cup of thine own: never Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo bitter as that which was mixed for thee. Yea, even thy draught is ſtinted; it is not enough for thee to ſip of this Cup, thou muſt drink it up to the very dregs. When the vinegar and gall were tendred to thee by men, thou didſt but kiſs the cup; but when thy Father gave into thine hands a potion infinitely more diſtaſtfull, thou (for our health) didſt drink deep of it even to the bottom, and ſaidſt, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> And can we repine at thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing draughts of Affliction that are tempered for us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men, when we ſee thee, the Son of thy Father's love, thus dieted? We pledge thee, O Bleſſed Saviour, we pledge thee, according to our weakneſs, who haſt begun to us in thy powerfull ſufferings. Onely do thou enable us (after ſome four faces made in our reluctation, yet) at laſt willingly to pledge thee in our conſtant Sufferings for thee.</p>
            <p>As thou muſt be drenched within, ſo muſt thou be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized without. Thy Baptiſm is not of water, but of bloud; both theſe came from thee in thy Paſſion: we cannot be thine, if we partake not of both. If thou haſt not grudged thy precious bloud to us, well maiſt thou challenge ſome worthleſs drops from us.</p>
            <p>When they talk of thy Kingdome, thou ſpeakeſt of thy bitter Cup, of thy bloudy Baptiſm. Suffering is the way to reigning. <hi>Through many tribulations muſt we enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> There was never wedge of gold that did not firſt paſs the fire; there was never pure grain
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:47750:188"/>
that did not undergoe the flail. In vain ſhall we dream of our immediate paſſage from the pleaſures and jollity of earth to the glory of Heaven. Let who will hope to walk upon Roſes and Violets to the throne of Heaven; O Saviour, let me trace thee by the track of thy Bloud, and by thy red ſteps follow thee to thine eternall reſt and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>I know this is no eaſy task; elſe thou hadſt never ſaid, <hi>Are ye able?</hi> Who ſhould be able if not they that had been ſo long bleſſed with thy preſence, informed by thy doctrine, and (as it were) beforehand poſſeſſed of their Heaven in thee? Thou hadſt never made them judges of their power, if thou couldſt not have convinced them of their weakneſs. Alas! how full of feebleneſs is our body, and our mind of impatience! If but a Bee ſting our fleſh, it ſwells; and if but a tooth ake, the head and heart complain. How ſmall trifles make us weary of our ſelves? What can we doe without thee? without thee what can we ſuffer? If thou be not, O Lord, ſtrong in my weakneſs, I cannot be ſo much as weak; I cannot ſo much as be. Oh, do thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare me for my day, and enable me to my trialls: <hi>I can doe all things through</hi> thee <hi>that ſtrengtheneſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The motion of the two Diſciples was not more full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity then their anſwer; <hi>We are able.</hi> Out of an eager deſire of the Honour, they are apt to undertake the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The beſt men may be miſtaken in their own powers. Alas, poor men! when it came to the iſſue, they ran away, and I know not whither one without his coat. It is one thing to ſuffer in ſpeculation, another in practice. There cannot be a worſe ſign then for a man in a carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to vaunt of his own abilities. How juſtly doth God ſuffer that man to be foiled purpoſely, that he may be aſhamed of his own vain ſelf-confidence? O God, let me ever be humbly dejected in the ſenſe of mine own inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; let me give all the Glory to thee, and take nothing to my ſelf but my infirmities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:47750:189"/>Oh the wonderfull mildneſs of the Son of God! He doth not rate the two Diſciples, either for their ambition in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or preſumption in undertaking: but leaving the worſt, he takes the beſt of their anſwer; and omitting their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, incourages their good intentions: <hi>Ye ſhall drink in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of my cup, and be baptized with my baptiſm: but to ſit on my right hand and my left, is not mine to give, but to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi> I know not whether there be more mercy in the conceſſion, or ſatisfaction in the deniall. Were it not an high honour to drink of thy Cup, O Saviour, thou hadſt not fore-promiſed it as a favour. I am deceived if what thou grantedſt were much leſs then that which thou deniedſt. To pledge thee in thine own Cup, is not much leſs dignity and familiarity then to ſit by thee. <hi>If we ſuffer with</hi> thee, <hi>we ſhall alſo reign together with</hi> thee. What greater promotion can fleſh and bloud be capable of, then a conformity to the Lord of Glory? Enable thou me to drink of thy Cup, and then ſet me where thou wilt.</p>
            <p>But, O Saviour, whilſt thou dignifieſt them in thy grant, doſt thou diſparage thy ſelf in thy denial? <hi>Not mine to give?</hi> Whoſe is it, if not thine? If it be thy Father's, it is thine: Thou, who art Truth, haſt ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Yea, becauſe thou art one with the Father, it is not thine to give to any ſave thoſe for whom it is prepared of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Father's preparation was thine, his gift is thine; the Decree of both is one. That eternal counſel is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable upon our vain deſires. The Father gives theſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly honours to none but by thee; thou giveſt them to none but according to the Decree of thy Father. Many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees there are of celeſtiall Happineſs. Thoſe ſupernall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are not all of an height. That Providence which hath varied our ſtations upon earth, hath pre-ordered our ſeats above.

            <head>XXXIX. The Tribute-money pay'd.</head>
            <p>ALL theſe other Hiſtories report the Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; this ſhews both his Power and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: his Power over the creature;<note place="margin">Luk. 4.31. <hi>compared with</hi> 38.</note> his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to civil powers. <hi>Capernaum</hi> was one of his own Cities; there he made his chief abode, in <hi>Peter</hi>'s houſe: to that Hoſt of his therefore do the Toll-gatherers repair for the Tribute. When that great Diſciple ſaid, <hi>We have left all,</hi> he did not ſay, We have abandoned all, or ſold, or given away all; but, we have left, in reſpect of managing, not of poſſeſſion; not in reſpect of right, but of uſe and preſent fruition; ſo left, that upon juſt occaſion we may reſume; ſo left, that it is our due, though not our buſineſs. Doubtleſs he was too wiſe to give away his own, that he might borrow of a ſtranger. His own roof gave him ſhelter for the time, and his Maſter with him. Of him, as the Houſholder, is the Tribute required; and by and for him is it alſo pay'd. I inquire not either into the occaſion, or the ſum. What need we make this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action ſacrilegious? as if that half-ſhekel which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be pay'd by every <hi>Iſraelite</hi> to the uſe of the Tabernacle and Temple, were now diverted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Exchequer. There was no neceſſity that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Lords ſhould be tied to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> reckonings; it was free for them to impoſe what payments they pleaſed upon a ſubdued people: when great <hi>Auguſtus</hi> commanded the world to be taxed, this rate was ſet. The mannerly Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectours demand it firſt of him, with whom they might be more bold; <hi>Doth not your Maſter pay tribute?</hi> All <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum</hi> knew <hi>Chriſt</hi> for a great Prophet; his Doctrine had
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47750:190"/>
raviſh'd them, his Miracles had aſtoniſh'd them: yet when it comes to a money-matter, his ſhare is as deep as the reſt. Queſtions of profit admit no difference. Still the ſacred Tribe challengeth reverence: who cares how little they receive, how much they pay? Yet no man knows with what mind this demand was made; whether in a churliſh grudging at <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s immunity, or in an awfull compellation of the ſervant rather then the Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> had it ready what to anſwer. I hear him not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their ſtay till he ſhould goe in and know his Maſter's reſolution; but, as one well acquainted with the mind and practice of his Maſter, he anſwers, <hi>Yes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was no truer pay-maſter of the King's dues then he that was King of Kings. Well did <hi>Peter</hi> know that he did not onely give, but preach tribute. When the <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> laid twigs for him, as ſuppoſing that ſo great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would be all for the liberty and exemption of God's choſen people, he choaks them with their own coin, and told them the ſtamp argued the right; <hi>Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſar's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Saviour, how can thy ſervants challenge that freedom which thy ſelf hadſt not? who that pretends from thee can claim homage from thoſe to whom thou gaveſt it? If thou by whom Kings reign forbareſt not to pay tribute to an heathen Prince, what power under thee can deny it to thoſe that rule for thee?</p>
            <p>That demand was made without doors. No ſooner is <hi>Peter</hi> come in, then he is prevented by his Maſter's queſtion, <hi>What thinkeſt thou, Simon? of whom do the Kings of the earth receive tribute? of their own children, or of ſtrangers?</hi> This very interrogation was anſwer enough to that which <hi>Peter</hi> meant to move: he that could thus know the heart, was not in true right liable to humane exactions.</p>
            <p>But, O Saviour, may I preſume to ask what this is to thee? Thou haſt ſaid, <hi>My kingdom is not of this world:</hi> how doth it concern thee what is done by the Kings of
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:47750:190"/>
the earth, or impoſed upon the ſons of earthly Kings? Thou wouldſt be the Son of an humble Virgin; and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt not a Royall ſtate, but a ſervile. I diſpute not thy natural right to the throne, by thy lineal deſcent from the loins of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>David:</hi> what ſhould I plead that which thou waveſt? It is thy Divine Royalty and Sonſhip which thou here juſtly urgeſt; the argument is irrefragable and convictive. If the Kings of the earth do ſo privilege their children that they are free from all tributes and impoſitions; how much more ſhall the King of Heaven give this immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to his onely and natural Son? ſo as in true reaſon I might challenge an exemption for me and my train. Thou mighteſt, O Saviour, and no leſs challenge a tribute of all the Kings of the earth to thee, by whom all powers are ordained. Reaſon cannot mutter againſt this claim: the creature owes it ſelf and whatſoever it hath to the Maker; he owes nothing to it. <hi>Then are the children free.</hi> He that hath right to all needs not pay any thing; elſe there ſhould be a ſubjection in Sovereignty, and men ſhould be debtours to themſelves. But this right was thine own pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar, and admits no partners; why doſt thou ſpeak of children, as of more, and, extending this privilege to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſay, <hi>Leſt we ſcandalize them?</hi> Was it for that thy Diſciples, being of thy robe, might juſtly ſeem intereſſed in the liberties of their Maſter? Surely no otherwiſe were they children, no otherwiſe free. Away with that fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conceit, which challenges an immunity from ſecular commands and taxes to a ſpiritual and adoptative Sonſhip: no earthly Saintſhip can exempt us from tribute to whom tribute belongeth. There is a freedom, O Saviour, which our Chriſtianity calls us to affect; a freedom from the yoke of Sin and Satan, from the ſervitude of our corrupt affections: we cannot be Sons if we be not thus free. Oh free thou us by thy free Spirit from the miſerable bondage of our Nature, ſo ſhall the children be free: but as to theſe ſecular duties, no man is leſs free then the children.
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47750:191"/>
O Saviour, thou wert free, and wouldſt not be ſo; thou wert free by natural right, wouldſt not be free by voluntary diſpenſation, <hi>Leſt an offence might be taken.</hi> Surely had there followed an offence, it had been taken onely, and not given. <hi>Woe be to the man by whom the offence cometh.</hi> It cometh by him that gives it; it cometh by him that takes it when it is not given: no part of this blame could have cleaved unto thee either way.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch was thy goodneſs, that thou wouldſt not ſuffer an offence unjuſtly taken at that which thou mighteſt juſtly have denied. How jealous ſhould we be even of others perils? how carefull ſo to moderate our power in the uſe of lawfull things, that our Charity may prevent others ſcandalls? to remit of our own right for another's ſafety? Oh the deplorable condition of thoſe wilfull men, who care not what blocks they lay in the way to Heaven, not forbearing by a known leudneſs to draw others into their own damnation!</p>
            <p>To avoid the unjuſt offence even of very Publicans, <hi>Jeſus</hi> will work a Miracle. <hi>Peter</hi> is ſent to the ſea; and that not with a net, but with an hook. The Diſciple was now in his own trade. He knew a net might incloſe many fiſhes, an hook could take but one: with that hook muſt he go angle for the Tribute-money. A fiſh ſhall bring him a <hi>ſtater</hi> in her mouth; and that fiſh that bites firſt. What an unuſual bearer is here? what an unlikely element to yield a piece of ready coin?</p>
            <p>Oh that Omnipotent power which could command the fiſh to be both his treaſurer to keep his ſilver, and his purveyour to bring it! Now whether, O Saviour, thou cauſedſt this fiſh to take up that ſhekel out of the bottom of the ſea, or whether by thine Almighty word thou mad'ſt it in an inſtant in the mouth of that fiſh, it is neither poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to determine, nor neceſſary to inquire. I rather adore thine infinite Knowledge and Power, that couldſt make uſe of unlikelieſt means; that couldſt ſerve thy ſelf of the very
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47750:191"/>
fiſhes of the ſea, in a buſineſs of earthly and civil imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was not out of need that thou didſt this: (though I do not find that thou ever affectedſt a full purſe.) What veins of Gold or mines of Silver did not lie open to thy command? But out of a deſire to teach <hi>Peter,</hi> that whilſt he would be tributary to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the very fiſh of the ſea was tributary to him. How ſhould this incourage our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon that Omnipotent hand of thine, which hath Heaven, earth, ſea at thy diſpoſing? Still thou art the ſame for thy Members, which thou wert for thy ſelf the Head. Rather then offence ſhall be given to the world by a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neglect of thy dear children, thou wilt cauſe the very fowls of Heaven to bring them meat, and the fiſh of the ſea to bring them money. O let us look up ever to thee by the eye of our Faith; and not be wanting in our dependence upon thee, who canſt not be wanting in thy Providence over us.</p>

            <head>XL. <hi>Lazarus</hi> Dead.</head>
            <p>OH the Wiſedom of God in penning his own ſtory! The Diſciple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved comes after his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Evangeliſts, that he might glean up thoſe rich ears of hiſtory which the reſt had paſſed over. That Eagle ſoars high, and towrs up by degrees. It was much to turn wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into wine; but it was more to feed five thouſand with five loaves. It was much to reſtore the Ruler's ſon; it was more to cure him that had been 38 years a crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It was much to cure him that was born blind; it was more to raiſe up <hi>Lazarus</hi> that had been ſo ſong
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47750:192"/>
dead. As a ſtream runs ſtill the ſtronger and wider, the nearer it comes to the Ocean whence it was derived; ſo didſt thou, O Saviour, work the more powerfully, the nearer thou dreweſt to thy Glory. This was, as one of thy laſt, ſo of thy greateſt Miracles; when thou wert ready to die thy ſelf, thou raiſedſt him to life who ſmelt ſtrong of the grave. None of all the ſacred Hiſtories is ſo full and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall as this, in the report of all circumſtances. Other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles do not more tranſcend Nature, then this tranſcends other Miracles.</p>
            <p>This alone was a ſufficient eviction of thy Godhead, O Bleſſed Saviour: none but an infinite power could ſo far goe beyond Nature, as to recall a man four days dead from, not a mere privation, but a ſettled corruption. Earth muſt needs be thine, from which thou raiſeſt his body; Heaven muſt needs be thine, from whence thou fetcheſt his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. None but he that created man, could thus make him new.</p>
            <p>Sickneſs is the common preface to death; no mortall nature is exempted from this complaint; even <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved, is ſick. What can ſtrength of Grace or dearneſs of reſpect prevail againſt diſeaſe, againſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution?</p>
            <p>It was a ſtirring meſſage that <hi>Mary</hi> ſent to <hi>Jeſus, He whom thou loveſt is ſick:</hi> as if ſhe would imply, that his part was no leſs deep in <hi>Lazarus</hi> then hers. Neither doth ſhe ſay, He that loves thee is ſick; but, <hi>He whom thou loveſt:</hi> not pleading the merit of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his affection to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the mercy and favour of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to him. Even that other reflexion of love had been no weak motive; for, O Lord, thou haſt ſaid, <hi>Becauſe he hath ſet his love upon me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I deliver him.</hi> Thy goodneſs will not be behind us for love, who profeſſeſt to love them that love thee. But yet the argument is more forcible from thy love to us; ſince thou haſt juſt reaſon to reſpect every thing of thine own, more then ought that can proceed from us.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47750:192"/>
Even we weak men, what can we ſtick at where we love? Thou, O infinite God, art Love it ſelf. Whatever thou haſt done for us is out of thy love: the ground and motive of all thy mercies is within thy ſelf, not in us; and if there be ought in us worthy of thy love, it is thine own, not ours; thou giveſt what thou accepteſt. <hi>Jeſus</hi> well heard the firſt groan of his dear <hi>Lazarus</hi>; every ſhort breath that he drew, every ſigh that he gave was upon account: yet this Lord of Life lets his <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſicken, and languiſh, and die; not out of neglect or impotence, but out of power and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>This ſickneſs is not to death.</hi> He to whom the iſſues of death belong, knows the way both into it and out of it. He meant that ſickneſs ſhould be to death in reſpect of the preſent condition, not to death in reſpect of the event; to death in the proceſs of Nature, not to death in the ſucceſs of his Divine power, <hi>that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.</hi> O Saviour, thy uſuall ſtyle is, the Son of man; thou that wouldſt take up our infirmities, wert willing thus to hide thy Godhead under the courſe weeds of our Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but here thou ſaiſt, <hi>That the Son of God might be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> Though thou wouldſt hide thy Divine glory, yet thou wouldſt not ſmother it. Sometimes thou wouldſt have thy Sun break forth in bright gleams, to ſhew that it hath no leſs light even whilſt it ſeems kept in by the clouds. Thou wert now near thy Paſſion; it was moſt ſeaſonable for thee at this time to ſet forth thy juſt title. Neither was this an act that thy Humanity could challenge to it ſelf, but far tranſcending all finite powers. To die, was an act of the Son of man; to raiſe from death, was an act of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>Neither didſt thou ſay merely, that God, but, <hi>that the Son of God might be glorified.</hi> God cannot be glorified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Son be ſo. In very naturall Relations, the wrong or diſreſpect offered to the child reflects upon the father, as contrarily the parent's upon the child; how much more where the love and reſpect is infinite? where the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:47750:193"/>
whole eſſence is communicated with the intireneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation?</p>
            <p>O God, in vain ſhall we tender our Devotions to thee indefinitely, as to a glorious and incomprehenſible Majeſty, if we kiſs not the Son, who hath moſt juſtly ſaid, <hi>Ye believe in the Father, believe alſo in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What an happy family was this? I find none upon earth ſo much honoured; <hi>Jeſus loved Martha, and her ſiſter, and Lazarus.</hi> It is no ſtanding upon terms of precedency: the Spirit of God is not curious in marſhalling of places. Time was when <hi>Mary</hi> was confeſſed to have choſen the better part; here <hi>Martha</hi> is named firſt, as moſt intereſſed in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s love: for ought appears all of them were equally dear. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had familiarly lodged under their roof. How fit was that to receive him, whoſe in-dwellers were hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, pious, unanimous? Hoſpital, in the glad entertainment of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and his train; Pious, in their Devotions; Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous, in their mutual Concord? As contrarily he balks and hates that houſe which is taken up with uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, profaneneſs, contention.</p>
            <p>But, O Saviour, how doth this agree? thou lovedſt this Family; yet hearing of their diſtreſs, thou heldeſt off two days more from them? Canſt thou love thoſe thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeſt not? canſt thou regard them from whom thou wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly abſenteſt thy ſelf in their neceſſity? Behold, thy love, as it is above ours, ſo it is oft againſt ours. Even out of very affection art thou not ſeldom abſent. None of thine but have ſometimes cried, <hi>How long, Lord?</hi> What need we inſtance, when thine eternal Father did purpoſely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrange his face from thee, ſo as thou criedſt out of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking?</p>
            <p>Here thou wouldſt knowingly delay, whether for the greatning of the Miracle, or for the ſtrengthning of thy Diſciples Faith.</p>
            <p>Hadſt thou gone ſooner, and prevented the death, who had known whether ſtrength of Nature, and not thy
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47750:193"/>
miraculous power, had done it? Hadſt thou overtaken his death by this quickning viſitation, who had known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this had been onely ſome qualm or ecſtaſie, and not a perfect diſſolution? Now this large gap of time makes thy work both certain and glorious.</p>
            <p>And what a clear proof was this beforehand to thy Diſciples, that thou wert able to accompliſh thine own Reſurrection on the third day, who wert able to raiſe up <hi>Lazarus</hi> on the fourth? The more difficult the work ſhould be, the more need it had of an Omnipotent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</p>
            <p>He that was Lord of our times and his own, can now, when he found it ſeaſonable, ſay, <hi>Let us go into Judaea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> Why left he it before? was it not upon the heady violence of his enemies? Lo,<note place="margin">

            <p>We may, we muſt be wiſe as ſerpents, for our own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; we muſt be careleſs of danger, when God calls us to the hazzard. It is far from God's purpoſe to give us leave ſo far to reſpect our ſelves, as that we ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect him. Let <hi>Judaea</hi> be all ſnares, all croſſes; O Saviour, when thou calleſt us, we muſt put our lives into our hands, and follow thee thither.</p>
            <p>This journey thou haſt purpoſed and contrived; but what neededſt thou to acquaint thy Diſciples with thine intent? Where didſt thou ever (beſides this) make them of counſell with thy voiages? Neither didſt thou ſay, How think you if I go? but, <hi>Let us go.</hi> Was it for that thou, who kneweſt thine own ſtrength, kneweſt alſo their weakneſs? Thou wert reſolute, they were timorous: they were ſenſible enough of their late perill, and fearfull of more; there was need to fore-arm them with an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the worſt, and preparation for it. Surpriſall with evils may indanger the beſt conſtancy. The heart is
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:47750:194"/>
apt to fail, when it finds it ſelf intrapped in a ſudden miſchief.</p>
            <p>The Diſciples were dearly affected to <hi>Lazarus</hi>; they had learned to love where their Maſter loved: yet now, when our Saviour ſpeaks of returning to that region of perill, they pull him by the ſleeve, and put him in mind of the violence offered unto him; <hi>Maſter, the Jews of late ſought to ſtone thee, and goeſt thou thither again?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No leſs then thrice in the fore-going Chapter did the <hi>Jews</hi> lift up their hands to murther him by a cruel lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. Whence was this rage and bloudy attempt of theirs? Onely for that he taught them the truth concerning his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and gave himſelf the juſt ſtyle of the Son of God. How ſubject carnal hearts are to be impatient of Heavenly verities? Nothing can ſo much fret that malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſpirit which rules in thoſe breaſts, as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould have his own. If we be perſecuted for his Truth, we do but <hi>ſuffer with him with whom we ſhall</hi> once <hi>reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However the Diſciples pleaded for their Maſter's ſafety, yet they aimed at their own; they well knew their danger was inwrapped in his. It is but a cleanly colour that they put upon their own fear. This is held but a weak and baſe Paſſion; each one would be glad to put off the opinion of it from himſelf, and to ſet the beſt face upon his own impotency.</p>
            <p>Thus white-livered men, that ſhrink and ſhift from the Croſs, will not want fair pretences to evade it. One pleads the perill of many dependents; another the disfurniſhing the Church of ſucceeding abettours: each will have ſome plauſible excuſe for his ſound skin. What errour did not our Saviour rectifie in his followers? Even that fear which they would have diſſembled is graciouſly diſpelled by the juſt conſideration of a ſure and inevitable Providence. <hi>Are there not twelve hours in the day,</hi> which are duely ſet and proceed regularly for the direction of all the motions
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:47750:194"/>
and actions of men? So in this courſe of mine which I muſt run on earth, there is a ſet and determined time wherein I muſt work, and doe my Father's will. The Sun that guides theſe hours is the determinate counſell of my Father, and his calling to the execution of my charge: whilſt I follow that, I cannot miſcarry, no more then a man can miſs his known way at high noon: this while, in vain are either your diſſwaſions or the attempts of enemies; they cannot hurt, ye cannot divert me.</p>
            <p>The journey then holds to <hi>Judaea</hi>; his attendents ſhall be made acquainted with the occaſion. He that had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly denied the deadlineſs of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his ſickneſs, would not ſuddenly confeſs his death; neither yet would he alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether conceal it: ſo will he therefore confeſs it, as that he will ſhadow it out in a borrowed expreſſion; <hi>Lazarus our friend ſleepeth.</hi> What a ſweet title is here both of death, and of <hi>Lazarus?</hi> Death is a ſleep; <hi>Lazarus</hi> is our friend. Lo, he ſays not, my friend, but, <hi>ours</hi>; to draw them firſt into a gracious familiarity and communion of friendſhip with himſelf: for what doth this import but, Ye are my friends, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> is both my friend and yours? <hi>Our friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O meek and mercifull Saviour, that diſdaineſt not to ſtoop ſo low, as that, whilſt thou <hi>thoughteſt it no robbery to be equall unto God,</hi> thou thoughteſt it no diſparagement to match thy ſelf with weak and wretched men! <hi>Our friend Lazarus.</hi> There is a kind of parity in Friendſhip. There may be Love where is the moſt inequality; but friendſhip ſuppoſes pairs: yet the Son of God ſays of the ſons of men, <hi>Our friend Lazarus.</hi> Oh what an high and happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this for mortal men to aſpire unto, that the God of Heaven ſhould not be aſhamed to own them for friends! Neither ſaith he now abruptly, <hi>Lazarus</hi> our friend is dead; but, <hi>Lazarus our friend ſleepeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Saviour, none can know the eſtate of life or death ſo well as thou that art the Lord of both. It is enough that
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:47750:195"/>
thou telleſt us death is no other then ſleep: that which was wont to paſs for the couſin of death, is now it ſelf. All this while we have miſtaken the caſe of our diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: we took it for an enemy, it proves a friend; there is pleaſure in that wherein we ſuppoſed horrour.</p>
            <p>Who is afraid, after the weary toils of the day, to take his reſt by night? or what is more refreſhing to the ſpent traveller then a ſweet ſleep? It is our infidelity, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparation that makes death any other then advantage. Even ſo, Lord, when thou ſeeſt I have toiled enough, let me ſleep in peace: and when thou ſeeſt I have ſlept e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, awake me, as thou didſt thy <hi>Lazarus; But I go to awake him.</hi> Thou ſaidſt not, Let us go to awake him: thoſe whom thou wilt allow companions of thy way, thou wilt not allow partners of thy work; they may be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they cannot be actours. None can awake <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of this ſleep, but he that made <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Every mouſe or gnat can raiſe us up from that other ſleep; none but an Omnipotent power from this. This ſleep is not without a diſſolution. Who can command the Soul to come down and meet the body, or command the body to piece with it ſelf and riſe up to the Soul, but the God that created both? It is our comfort and aſſurance (O Lord) againſt the terrours of death and tenacity of the grave, that our Reſurrection depends upon none but thine Omnipotence.</p>
            <p>Who can blame the Diſciples if they were loth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Judaea?</hi> Their laſt entertainment was ſuch as might juſtly diſhearten them. Were this (as literally taken) all the reaſon of our Saviour's purpoſe of ſo perillous a voiage, they argued not amiſs, <hi>If he ſleep, he ſhall doe well.</hi> Sleep in ſickneſs is a good ſign of recovery. For extremity of pain bars our reſt: when Nature therefore finds ſo. much reſpiration, ſhe juſtly hopes for better terms. Yet it doth not always follow, <hi>If he ſleep, he ſhall doe well:</hi> How many have died in lethargies? how many have loſt in ſleep what they would not have forgone waking? <hi>Adam</hi> ſlept and loſt his
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:47750:195"/>
rib; <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſlept and loſt his ſtrength; <hi>Saul</hi> ſlept and loſt his weapon; <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> and <hi>Holofernes</hi> ſlept and loſt their heads. In ordinary courſe it holds well; here they miſtook and erred. The miſconſtruction of the words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> led them into an unſeaſonable and erroneous ſuggeſtion. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more dangerous then to take the ſpeeches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the ſound of the letter: one errour will be ſure to draw on more; and if the firſt be never ſo ſlight, the laſt may be important.</p>
            <p>Wherefore are words but to expreſs meanings? why do we ſpeak but to be underſtood? Since then our Saviour ſaw himſelf not rightly conſtrued, he delivers himſelf plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Lazarus is dead.</hi> Such is thy manner, O thou eternall Word of thy Father, in all thy ſacred expreſſions. Thine own mouth is thy beſt commentary: what thou haſt more obſcurely ſaid in one paſſage, thou interpreteſt more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in another. Thou art the Sun, which giveſt us that light whereby we ſee thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>But how modeſtly doſt thou diſcover thy Deity to thy Diſciples? Not upon the firſt mention of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his death, inſtantly profeſſing thy Power and will of his reſuſcitation; but contenting thy ſelf onely to intimate thy Omniſcience, in that thou couldſt in that abſence and diſtance know and report his departure, they ſhall gather the reſt, and cannot chuſe but think, we ſerve a Maſter that knows all things, and he that knows all things can doe all things.</p>
            <p>The abſence of our Saviour from the death-bed of <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was not caſuall, but voluntary; yea, he is not onely willing with it, but glad of it; <hi>I am glad for your ſakes that I was not there.</hi> How contrary may the affections of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and ours be, and yet be both good? The two worthy Siſters were much grieved at our Saviour's abſence, as doubting it might ſavour of ſome neglect; <hi>Chriſt</hi> was glad of it, for the advantage of his Diſciples Faith. I cannot blame them that they were thus ſorry; I cannot but bleſs him that he was thus glad. The gain of their Faith in ſo Divine a Miracle was
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:47750:196"/>
more then could be countervailed by their momentany ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. God and we are not alike affected with the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; He laughs where we mourn, he is angry where we are pleaſed.</p>
            <p>The difference of the affections ariſes from the difference of the Objects, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> and they apprehend in the ſame occurrence. Why are the Siſters ſorrowfull? becauſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s abſence <hi>Lazarus</hi> died. Why was <hi>Jeſus</hi> glad he was not there? for the benefit which he ſaw would accrue to their Faith. There is much variety of proſpect in every act, according to the ſeverall intentions and iſſues thereof, yea even in the very ſame eyes. The father ſees his ſon combating in a Duell for his Country; he ſees blows and wounds on the one ſide, he ſees renown and victory on the other: he grieves at the wounds, he rejoyces in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Thus doeth God in all our Afflictions: he ſees our tears, and hears our groans, and pities us; but withall he looks upon our Patience, our Faith, our Crown, and is glad that we are afflicted.</p>
            <p>O God, why ſhould not we conform our diet unto thine? When we lie in pain and extremity, we cannot but droop under it; but do we find our ſelves increaſed in true Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, in Patience, in Hope, in a conſtant reliance on thy Mercies? Why are we not more joyed in this then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with the other; ſince the leaſt grain of the increaſe of Grace is more worth then can be equalled with whole pounds of bodily vexation?</p>
            <p>O ſtrange conſequence! <hi>Lazarus is dead</hi>; nevertheleſs, <hi>Let us goe unto him.</hi> Muſt they not needs think, What ſhould we doe with a dead man? What ſhould ſeparate, if death cannot? Even thoſe whom we loved dearlieſt, we avoid once dead; now we lay them aſide under the board, and thence ſend them out of our houſes to their grave. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath Death more horrour in it then noiſomeneſs; and if we could intreat our eyes to endure the horrid aſpect of Death in the face we loved, yet can we perſwade our ſent
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:47750:196"/>
to like that ſmell that ariſes up from its corruption? O <hi>love ſtronger then Death!</hi> Behold here a friend whom the very Grave cannot ſever.</p>
            <p>Even thoſe that write the longeſt and moſt paſſionate dates of their amity, ſubſcribe but, <hi>Your friend till death</hi>; and if the ordinary ſtrain of humane friendſhip will ſtretch yet a little farther, it is but to the brim of the grave: thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a friend may follow us, and ſee us beſtowed in this houſe of our Age; but there he leaves us to our worms and duſt. But for thee, O Saviour, the grave-ſtone, the earth, the coffin are no bounders of thy dear reſpects; even after death, and buriall, and corruption, thou art graciouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to thoſe thou loveſt. Beſides the Soul (whereof thou ſaieſt not, Let us goe to it, but, Let it come to us,) there is ſtill a gracious regard to that duſt which was and ſhall be a part of an undoubted member of that myſticall body whereof thou art the Head. Heaven and earth yield no ſuch friend but thy ſelf. O make me ever ambitious of this Love of thine, and ever unquiet till I feel my ſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of thee.</p>
            <p>In the mouth of a mere man this word had been incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, <hi>Lazarus is dead, yet let us goe to him</hi>; in thine, O Almighty Saviour, it was not more loving then ſeaſonable; ſince I may juſtly ſay of thee, thou haſt more to doe with the dead then with the living: for, both they are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more, and have more inward communion with thee, and thou with them. Death cannot hinder either our paſſage to thee, or thy return to us. I joy to think the time is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, when thou ſhalt come to every of our graves, and call us up out of our duſt, and we <hi>ſhall hear thy voice, and live.</hi>

            <p>GReat was the opinion that theſe devout Siſters had of the Power of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> as if Death durſt not ſhew her face to him, they ſuppoſe his preſence had prevented their Brother's diſſolution: And now the news of his approach begins to quicken ſome late hopes in them. <hi>Martha</hi> was ever the more active. She that was before ſo buſily ſtirring in her houſe to entertain <hi>Jeſus,</hi> was now as nimble to goe forth of her houſe to meet him: She in whoſe face joy had wont to ſmile upon ſo Bleſſed a Gueſt, now ſalutes him with the ſighs and tears and blubbers and wrings of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate mourner. I know not whether the ſpeeches of her greeting had in them more ſorrow or Religion. She had been well catechized before; even ſhe alſo had ſate at <hi>Jeſus</hi> his feet, and can now give good account of her Faith in the Power and Godhead of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the certainty of a future Reſurrection. This Conference hath yet taught her more, and raiſed her heart to an expectation of ſome won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull effect. And now ſhe ſtands not ſtill, but haſts back into the Village to her Siſter; carried thither by the two wings of her own hopes, and her Saviour's commands. The time was, when ſhe would have called off her Siſter from the feet of that Divine Maſter, to attend the houſhold oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; now ſhe runs to fetch her out of the houſe to the feet of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doubtleſs <hi>Martha</hi> was much affected with the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and as ſhe was over-joyed with it her ſelf, ſo ſhe knew how equally welcome it would be to her Siſter: yet ſhe doth not ring it out aloud in the open Hall, but
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:47750:197"/>
ſecretly whiſpers this pleaſing tidings in her Siſter's ear, <hi>The Maſter is come, and calleth for thee.</hi> Whether out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, or diſcretion. It is not fit for a woman to be loud and clamorous: nothing beſeems that Sex better then ſilence and baſhfulneſs; as not to be too much ſeen, ſo not to be heard too far. Neither did Modeſty more charm her tongue then Diſcretion; whether in reſpect to the gueſts, or to <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. Had thoſe gueſts heard of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being there, they had either out of fear or prejudice withdrawn themſelves from him; neither durſt they have been wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of that wonderfull Miracle, as being over-awed with that <hi>Jewiſh</hi> edict which was out againſt him: or perhaps they had withheld the Siſters from going to him, againſt whom they knew how highly their Governours were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed. Neither was ſhe ignorant of the danger of his own perſon, ſo lately before aſſaulted violently by his enemies at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> She knew they were within the ſmoak of that bloudy City, the neſt of his enemies; ſhe holds it not therefore fit to make open proclamation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but rounds her Siſter ſecretly in the ear. Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity doth not bid us abate any thing of our warineſs and honeſt policies; yea it requires us to have no leſs of the Serpent then of the Dove.</p>
            <p>There is a time when we muſt preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> on the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top; there is a time when we muſt ſpeak him in the ear, and (as it were) with our lips ſhut. Secrecy hath no leſs uſe then divulgation. She ſaid enough, <hi>The Maſter is come, and calleth for thee.</hi> What an happy word was this which was here ſpoken? what an high favour is this that is done, that the Lord of Life ſhould perſonally come and call for <hi>Mary?</hi> yet ſuch as is not appropriated to her. Thou, comeſt to us ſtill, O Saviour, if not in thy bodily preſence, yet in thy ſpiritual, thou calleſt us ſtill, if not in thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal voice, yet in thine Ordinances. It is our fault, if we doe not as this good woman, ariſe quickly, and come to thee. Her friends were there about her, who came pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:47750:198"/>
to condole with her; her heart was full of heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: yet ſo ſoon as ſhe hears mention of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets friends, Brother, grief, cares, thoughts, and haſts to his preſence.</p>
            <p>Still was <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſtanding in the place where <hi>Martha</hi> left him. Whether it be noted to expreſs <hi>Mary</hi>'s ſpeed, or his own wiſe and gracious reſolutions; his preſence in the Village had perhaps invited danger, and ſet off the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded witneſſes of the work: or it may be to ſet forth his zealous deſire to diſpatch the errand he came for; that as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s faithfull ſervant would not receive any courteſie from the houſe of <hi>Bethuel,</hi> till he had done his Maſter's buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs concerning <hi>Rebeccah,</hi> ſo thou, O Saviour, wouldſt not ſo much as enter into the houſe of theſe two Siſters in <hi>Bethany,</hi> till thou hadſt effected this glorious work which occaſioned thee thither. It was thy <hi>meat and drink to doe the will of</hi> thy <hi>Father</hi>; thy beſt entertainment was within thy ſelf. How do we follow thee, if we ſuffer either plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures or profits to take the wall of thy ſervices?</p>
            <p>So good women were well worthy of kind friends. No doubt <hi>Bethany,</hi> being not two miles diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> could not but be furniſhed with good acquaintance from the City: theſe knowing the dearneſs, and hearing of the death of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> came over to comfort the ſad Siſters. Charity together with the common practice of that Nation calls them to this duty. All our diſtreſſes expect theſe good offices from thoſe that love us; but of all others Death, as that which is the extremeſt of evils, and makes the moſt fearfull havock in families, cities, kingdoms, worlds. The complaint was grievous, <hi>I look'd for ſome to comfort me, but there was none.</hi> It is ſome kind of eaſe to ſorrow, to have partners; as a burthen is lightned by many ſhoulders; or as clouds, ſcattered into many drops, eaſily vent their moiſture into air. Yea the very preſence of friends abates grief. The perill that ariſes to the heart from Paſſion is the fixed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, when, like a corroſiving plaiſter, it eats in into
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47750:198"/>
the ſore: Some kind of remedy it is, that it may breath out in good ſociety.</p>
            <p>Theſe friendly neighbours ſeeing <hi>Mary</hi> haſten forth, make haſte to follow her. <hi>Martha</hi> went forth before; I ſaw none goe after her: <hi>Mary</hi> ſtirs; they are at her heels. Was it for that <hi>Martha,</hi> being the elder Siſter, and the huſwife of the family, might ſtir about with leſs obſervation? or was it that <hi>Mary</hi> was the more paſſionate, and needed the more heedy attendence? However, their care and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs is truely commendable; they came to comfort her, they doe what they came for. It contents them not to ſit ſtill and chat within doors, but they wait on her at all turns. Perturbations of Mind are diſeaſes: good keepers do not onely tend the Patient in bed, but when he ſits up, when he tries to walk; all his motions have their carefull aſſiſtence. We are no true friends, if our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the redreſs of diſtempers in them we love be not aſſiduous and unweariable.</p>
            <p>It was but a loving ſuſpicion, <hi>She is gone to the grave to weep there.</hi> They well knew how apt paſſionate minds are to take all occaſions to renew their ſorrow; every Object affects them. When ſhe ſaw but the Chamber of her dead Brother, ſtraight ſhe thinks, There was <hi>Lazarus</hi> wont to lie, and then ſhe wept afreſh; when the Table, There <hi>Lazarus</hi> was wont to ſit, and then new tears ariſe; when the Garden, There <hi>Lazarus</hi> had wont to walk, and now again ſhe weeps. How much more do theſe friends ſuppoſe the Paſſions would be ſtirred with the ſight of the Grave, when ſhe muſt needs think, There is <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus?</hi> O Saviour, if the place of the very dead corps of our friend have power to draw our hearts thither, and to affect us more deeply; how ſhould our hearts be drawn to and affected with Heaven, where thou ſitteſt at the right hand of thy Father? There (O thou <hi>which wert dead, and art alive,</hi>) is thy Body and thy Soul preſent, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy glorious Deity. Thither, O thither let our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47750:199"/>
be; not to mourn there, (where is no place for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) but to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious, and more and more to long for that thy beatificall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>Their indulgent love miſtook <hi>Mary</hi>'s errand; their thoughts (how kind ſoever) were much too low: whilſt they ſuppoſed ſhe went to a dead Brother, ſhe went to a living Saviour. The world hath other conceits of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and carriage of the regenerate then are truly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſetting ſuch conſtructions upon them as their own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reaſon ſuggeſts: they think them dying, when behold they live; ſorrowfull, when they are alwaies rejoycing; poor, whilſt they make many rich. How juſtly do we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from them as incompetent Judges, and pity thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations which we cannot avoid?</p>
            <p>Both the Siſters met <hi>Chriſt</hi>; not both in one poſture: <hi>Mary</hi> is ſtill noted, as for more Paſſion, ſo for more Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſhe that before ſate at the feet of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> now falls at his feet. That preſence had wont to be familiar to her, and not without ſome outward homelineſs; now it fetches her upon her knees, in an awfull veneration: whether out of a reverent acknowledgment of the ſecret excellency and power of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; or out of a dumb intimation of that ſuit concerning her dead Brother, which ſhe was afraid to utter. The very geſture it ſelf was ſupplicatory. What poſition of body can be ſo fit for us, when we make our addreſs to our Saviour? It is an irreligious unmannerlineſs for us to goe leſs. Where the heart is affected with an awfull acknowledgment of Majeſty, the body cannot but bow.</p>
            <p>Even before all her neighbours of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> doth <hi>Mary</hi> thus fall down at the feet of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; ſo many witneſſes as ſhe had, ſo many ſpies ſhe had of that forbidden obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. It was no leſs then Excommunication for any body to confeſs him: yet good <hi>Mary,</hi> not fearing the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that might be given by thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Goſſips, adores him; and in her ſilent geſture ſays, as much as her Siſter
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:47750:199"/>
had ſpoken before, <hi>Thou art the Chriſt, the Son of God.</hi> Thoſe that would give <hi>Chriſt</hi> his right muſt not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſcrupulous fears. Are we naturally timorous? Why do we not fear the deniall, the excluſion of the Almighty? <hi>Without ſhall be the fearfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her humble proſtration is ſeconded by a lamentable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here, my brother had not died.</hi> The Siſters are both in one mind, both in one ſpeech; and both of them in one ſpeech bewray both ſtrength and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: ſtrength of Faith, in aſcribing ſo much power to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that his preſence could preſerve from death; Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in ſuppoſing the neceſſity of a preſence for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Why, <hi>Mary,</hi> could not thine Omnipotent Saviour as well in abſence have commanded <hi>Lazarus</hi> to live? Is his hand ſo ſhort, that he can doe nothing but by contaction? If his Power were finite, how could he have forbidden the ſeizure of death? if infinite, how could it be limited to place, or hindred by diſtance? It is a weakneſs of Faith to meaſure ſucceſs by means, and means by preſence, and to tie effects to both, when we deal with an Almighty agent. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite cauſes work within their own ſphere; all places are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually near, and all effects equally eaſy to the infinite. O Saviour, whilſt thou now ſitteſt gloriouſly in Heaven, thou doſt no leſs impart thy ſelf unto us then if thou ſtoodeſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by us, then if we ſtood locally by thee: no place can make difference of thy virtue and aid.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>Mary</hi>'s moan; no motion, no requeſt ſounded from her to her Saviour. Her ſilent ſuit is returned with a mute anſwer; no notice is taken of her errour. Oh that marvellous mercy that connives at our faulty infirmities! All the reply that I hear of is, a compaſſionate groan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelf. O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> thou that wert free from all ſin, wouldſt not be free even from ſtrong affections. Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Holineſs ſhould want much work, if even vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſions might not be quitted from offence. <hi>Mary</hi> wept; her tears drew on tears from her friends, all their
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:47750:200"/>
tears united drew groans from thee. Even in thine Heaven thou doſt no leſs pity our ſorrows: thy Glory is free from groans, but abounds with compaſſion and mercy: if we be not ſparing of our tears, thou canſt not be inſenſible of our ſorrows. How ſhall we imitate thee, if, like our looking-glaſs, we do not anſwer tears, and weep on them that weep upon us?</p>
            <p>Lord, thou kneweſt (in abſence) that <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, and doſt thou not know where he was buried? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou wert farther off when thou ſaweſt and reportedſt his death, then thou wert from the grave thou inquiredſt of: thou that kneweſt all things, yet askeſt what thou knoweſt, <hi>Where have ye laid him?</hi> Not out of need, but out of will: that as in thy ſorrow, ſo in thy queſtion thou mightſt depreſs thy ſelf in the opinion of the beholders for the time, that the glory of thine inſtant Miracle might be the greater, the leſs it was expected. It had been all one to thy Omnipotence to have made a new <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; or in that remoteneſs to have commanded <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whereſoever he was, to come forth: but thou wert neither willing to work more miracle then was requiſite, nor yet unwilling to fix the minds of the people upon the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome marvellous thing that thou meanteſt to work; and therefore askeſt, <hi>Where have you laid him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are not more glad of the queſtion, then ready for the anſwer; <hi>Come and ſee.</hi> It was the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as likewiſe of thoſe <hi>Aegyptians</hi> among whom they had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, to lay up the dead bodies of their friends with great reſpect; more coſt was wont to be beſtowed on ſome of their graves then on their houſes: as neither aſhamed then, nor unwilling to ſhew the decency of their ſepulture, they ſay, <hi>Come and ſee.</hi> More was hoped for from <hi>Chriſt</hi> then a mere view; they meant and expected that his eye ſhould draw him on to ſome farther action. O Saviour, whilſt we deſire our ſpirituall reſuſcitation, how ſhould we labour to bring thee to our grave? how ſhould we lay open our
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47750:200"/>
deadneſs before thee, and bewray to thee our impotence and ſenſeleſneſs? Come, Lord, and ſee what a miſerable carkaſs I am; and by the power of thy mercy raiſe me from the ſtate of my corruption.</p>
            <p>Never was our Saviour more ſubmiſsly dejected then now immediately before he would approve and exalt the majeſty of his Godhead. To his groans and inward grief he adds his tears. Anon they ſhall confeſs him a God; theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Paſſions ſhall onwards evince him to be a Man. The <hi>Jews</hi> conſtrue this well; <hi>See how he loved him.</hi> Never did any thing but love fetch tears from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But they do foully miſconſtrue <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the other; <hi>Could not he that opened the eyes of him that was born blind, have cauſed that even this man ſhould not have died?</hi> Yes, know ye, O vain and importune queſtioniſts, that he could have done it with eaſe. To open the eyes of a man born blind was more then to keep a ſick man from dying: this were but to uphold and maintain Nature from decaying; that were to create a new ſenſe, and to reſtore a deficiency in Nature. To make an eye was no whit leſs difficult then to make a man: he that could doe the greater might well have done the leſs. Ye ſhall ſoon ſee this was not for want of power. Had ye ſaid, Why would he not? Why did he not? the queſtion had been fairer, and the anſwer no leſs eaſy; For his own greater glory. Little do ye know the drift whether of God's acts, or delays; and ye know as much as you are worthy. Let it be ſufficient for you to underſtand, that he who can doe all things will doe that which ſhall be moſt for his own honour.</p>
            <p>It is not improbable that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who before groaned in himſelf, for compaſſion of their tears, now groaned for their incredulity. Nothing could ſo much afflict the Saviour of men as the ſins of men. Could their externall wrongs to his body have been ſeparated from offence againſt his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perſon, their ſcornfull indignities had not ſo much affected him. No injury goes ſo deep as our ſpirituall
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:47750:201"/>
provocations of our God. Wretched men! why ſhould we grieve the good Spirit of God in us? why ſhould we make him groan for us that died to redeem us?</p>
            <p>With theſe groans, O Saviour, thou cameſt to the grave of <hi>Lazarus.</hi> The door of that houſe of Death was ſtrong and impenetrable. Thy firſt word was, <hi>Take away the ſtone.</hi> O weak beginning of a mighty Miracle! If thou meanteſt to raiſe the dead, how much more eaſy had it been for thee to remove the grave-ſtone? One grain of Faith in thy very Diſciples was enough to remove mountains; and doſt thou ſay, <hi>Take away the ſtone?</hi> I wis, there was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter weight that lay upon the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> then the ſtone of his Tomb, the weight of Death and Corruption; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rocks and hills were not ſo heavy a load as this alone: why then doſt thou ſtick at this ſhovel-full? Yea, how eaſy had it been for thee to have brought up the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> through the ſtone, by cauſing that marble to give way by a ſudden rarefaction? But thou thoughteſt beſt to make uſe of their hands rather: whether for their own more full conviction; for had the ſtone been taken away by thy Followers, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> thereupon walked forth, this might have appeared to thy malignant enemies to have been a ſet match betwixt thee, the Diſciples and <hi>Lazarus:</hi> or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the exerciſe of our Faith, that thou mighteſt teach us to truſt thee under contrary appearances. Thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to remove the ſtone ſeemed to argue an impotence; ſtraight that ſeeming weakneſs breaks forth into an act of Omnipotent power. The homelieſt ſhews of thine humane infirmity are ever ſeconded with ſome mighty proofs of thy Godhead; and thy Miracle is ſo much more wondred at, by how much it was leſs expected.</p>
            <p>It was ever thy juſt will that we ſhould doe what we may. To remove the ſtone or to untie the napkin was in their power; this they muſt doe: to raiſe the dead was out of their power; this therefore thou wilt doe alone. Our hands muſt doe their utmoſt, ere thou wilt put to thine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="397" facs="tcp:47750:201"/>O Saviour, we are all dead and buried in the grave of our ſinfull Nature. The ſtone of obſtination muſt be taken away from our hearts, ere we can hear thy reviving voice: we can no more remove this ſtone then dead <hi>Lazarus</hi> could remove his; we can adde more weight to our graves. O let thy faithfull agents, by the power of thy Law, and the grace of thy Goſpell, take off the ſtone, that thy voice may enter into the grave of miſerable corruption.</p>
            <p>Was it a modeſt kind of mannerlineſs in <hi>Martha,</hi> that ſhe would not have <hi>Chriſt</hi> annoyed with the ill ſent of that ſtale carkaſs? or was it out of diſtruſt of reparation, ſince her brother had paſſed all the degrees of corruption, that ſhe ſays, <hi>Lord, by this time he ſtinketh, for he hath been dead four days?</hi> He that underſtood hearts, found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what amiſs in that intimation; his anſwer had not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to rectifie that which was utterly faultleſs. I fear the good woman meant to object this as a likely obſtacle to any farther purpoſes or proceedings of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Weak faith is ſtill apt to lay blocks of difficulties in the way of the great works of God.</p>
            <p>Four days were enough to make any corps noiſome. Death it ſelf is not unſavoury; immediately upon diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the body retains the wonted ſweetneſs: it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance under death that is thus offenſive. Neither is it otherwiſe in our Spiritual condition: the longer we lie under our ſin, the more rotten and corrupt we are. He who upon the freſh commiſſion of his ſin recovers himſelf by a ſpeedy repentance, yields no ill ſent to the noſtrills of the Almighty. The Candle that is preſently blown in again offends not; it is the Snuffe which continues choaked with its own moiſture that ſends up unwholſome and odious fumes. O Saviour, thou wouldſt yield to death, thou wouldſt not yield to corruption: Ere the fourth day thou wert riſen again. I cannot but receive many deadly foils; but oh, do thou raiſe me up again ere I ſhall paſs the degrees of rottenneſs in my ſins and treſpaſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:47750:202"/>They that laid their hands to the ſtone, doubtleſs held now ſtill awhile, and looked one while on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> another while upon <hi>Martha,</hi> to hear what iſſue of reſolution would follow upon ſo important an objection: when they find a light touch of taxation to <hi>Martha, Said not I to thee, that if thou wouldſt believe, thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> That holy woman had before profeſſed her belief, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had profeſſed his great intentions; both were now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: and now our Saviour is fain to revive both her memory and Faith; <hi>Said not I to thee?</hi> The beſt of all Saints are ſubject to fits of unbelief and oblivion; the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy whereof muſt be the inculcation of God's mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull promiſes of their relief and ſupportation. O God, if thou have ſaid it, I dare believe; I dare caſt my Soul upon the belief of every word of thine. <hi>Faithfull art thou which haſt promiſed, who wilt alſo doe it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſpite of all the unjuſt diſcouragements of Nature we muſt obey <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s command. What-ever <hi>Martha</hi> ſuggeſts, they remove the ſtone, and may now ſee and ſmell him dead, whom they ſhall ſoon ſee revived. The ſent of the corps is not ſo unpleaſing to them, as the perfume of their obedience is ſweet to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And now when all impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are removed, and all hearts ready for the work, our Saviour addreſſes to the Miracle.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Eyes</hi> begin; they are <hi>lift up</hi> to Heaven. It was the malicious miſ-ſuggeſtion of his enemies, that he look'd down to <hi>Beelzebub:</hi> the beholders ſhall now ſee whence he expects and derives his power; and ſhall by him learn whence to expect and hope for all ſucceſs. The heart and the eye muſt go together: he that would have ought to doe with God, muſt be ſequeſtred and lifted up from earth.</p>
            <p>His Tongue ſeconds his Eye; <hi>Father.</hi> Nothing more ſtuck in the ſtomack of the <hi>Jews,</hi> then that <hi>Chriſt</hi> called himſelf the Son of God; this was imputed to him for a Blaſphemy, worthy of ſtones. How ſeaſonably is this word
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:47750:202"/>
ſpoken in the hearing of theſe <hi>Jews,</hi> in whoſe ſight he will be preſently approved ſo? How can ye now, O ye cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, except at that title, which ye ſhall ſee irrefragably juſtified? Well may he call God Father, that can raiſe the dead out of the grave. In vain ſhall ye ſnarl at the ſtyle, when ye are convinced of the effect.</p>
            <p>I hear of no Prayer, but a Thanks for hearing. Whilſt thou ſaidſt nothing, O Saviour, how doth thy Father hear thee? Was it not with thy Father and thee as it was with thee and <hi>Moſes?</hi> Thou ſaidſt, <hi>Let me alone, Moſes,</hi> when he ſpake not. Thy will was thy prayer. Words expreſs our hearts to men, thoughts to God. Well didſt thou know, out of the ſelf-ſameneſs of thy will with thy Father's, that if thou didſt but think in thine heart that <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould riſe, he was now raiſed. It was not for thee to pray vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and audibly, leſt thoſe captious hearers ſhould ſay, thou didſt all by intreaty, nothing by power. Thy thanks overtake thy deſires; ours require time and diſtance: our thanks ariſe from the Echo of our prayers reſounding from Heaven to our hearts; Thou, becauſe thou art at once in earth and Heaven, and knoweſt the grant to be of equall paces with the requeſt, moſt juſtly thankeſt in praying.</p>
            <p>Now ye cavilling <hi>Jews</hi> are thinking ſtraight, Is there ſuch diſtance betwixt the Father and the Son? is it ſo rare a thing for the Son to be heard, that he pours out his thanks for it as a bleſſing unuſuall? Do ye not now ſee that he who made your heart, knows it, and anticipates your fond thoughts with the ſame breath? <hi>I knew that thou heareſt me always; but I ſaid this for their ſakes, that they might believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mercifull Saviour, how can we enough admire thy goodneſs, who makeſt our belief the ſcope and drift of thy doctrine and actions! Alas, what wert thou the better if they believed thee ſent from God? what wert thou the worſe if they believed it not? Thy perfection and glory ſtands not upon the ſlippery terms of our approbation or
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:47750:203"/>
diſlike; but is reall in thy ſelf, and that infinite, without poſſibility of our increaſe or diminution. We, we onely are they that have either the gain or loſs in thy receit or rejection: yet ſo doſt thou affect our belief, as if it were more thine advantage then ours.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, whilſt thou ſpak'ſt to thy Father, thou lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedſt up thine eyes; now thou wert to ſpeak unto dead <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> thou liftedſt up thy voice, and <hi>criedſt aloud, Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, come forth.</hi> Was it that the ſtrength of the voice might anſwer to the ſtrength of the affection? ſince we faintly require what we care not to obtain, and vehemently utter what we earneſtly deſire. Was it that the greatneſs of the voice might anſwer to the greatneſs of the work? Was it that the hearers might be witneſſes of what words were uſed in ſo miraculous an act; no magicall incantations, but autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative and Divine commands? Was it to ſignifie that <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> his Soul was called from far; the ſpeech muſt be loud that ſhall be heard in another world? Was it in relation to the eſtate of the body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> whom thou hadſt repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſleep; ſince thoſe that are in a deep and dead ſleep cannot be awaked without a loud call? Or was it in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of that loud voice of the laſt Trumpet, which ſhall ſound into all graves, and raiſe all fleſh from their duſt?</p>
            <p>Even ſo ſtill, Lord, when thou wouldſt raiſe a Soul from the death of ſin, and grave of corruption, no eaſie voice will ſerve. Thy ſtrongeſt commands, thy loudeſt denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of Judgments, the ſhrilleſt and ſweeteſt promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy Mercies, are but enough.</p>
            <p>How familiar a word is this, <hi>Lazarus, come forth?</hi> no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he was wont to uſe whilſt they lived together. Neither doth he ſay, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> revive; but, as if he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him already living, <hi>Lazarus, come forth:</hi> To let them know, that thoſe who are dead to us, are to and with him alive; yea in a more entire and feeling ſociety, then whilſt they carried their clay about them. Why do I fear that ſeparation which ſhall more unite me to my Saviour?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:47750:203"/>Neither was the word more familiar then commanding, <hi>Lazarus, come forth.</hi> Here is no ſuit to his Father, no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration to the deceaſed, but a flat and abſolute injunction, <hi>Come forth.</hi> O Saviour, that is the voice that I ſhall once hear ſounding into the bottom of my grave, and raiſing me up out of my duſt; that is the voice that ſhall pierce the rocks, and divide the mountains, and fetch up the dead out of the loweſt deeps. Thy word made all; thy word ſhall repair all. Hence, all ye diffident fears; he whom I truſt is Omnipotent.</p>
            <p>It was the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> faſhion to enwrap the corps in linen, to tie the hands and feet, and to cover the face of the dead. The Fall of man (beſides weakneſs) brought ſhame upon him; ever ſince, even whilſt he lives, the whole Body is covered; but the Face, becauſe ſome ſparks of that extinct Majeſty remain there, is wont to be left open. In death (all thoſe poor remainders being gone, and leaving defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and gaſtlineſs in the room of them) the Face is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo.</p>
            <p>There lies <hi>Lazarus</hi> bound in double fetters: One Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty word hath looſed both; and now <hi>he that was bound came forth.</hi> He whoſe power could not be hindred by the chains of death, cannot be hindred by linen bonds: He that gave life gave motion, gave direction: He that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Soul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> into the body, guided the body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> without his eyes, moved the feet without the full liberty of his regular paces. No doubt the ſame power ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe ſwathing-bands of death, that the feet might have ſome little ſcope to move, though not with that freedome that followed after. Thou didſt not onely, O Saviour, raiſe the body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but the Faith of the beholders. They cannot deny him dead, whom they ſaw riſing; they ſee the ſigns of death, with the proofs of life. Thoſe very ſwathes convinced him to be the man that was raiſed. Thy leſs Miracle confirms the greater; both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Faith of the beholders. O clear and irrefragable
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:47750:204"/>
example of our reſuſcitation! Say now, ye ſhameleſs <hi>Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cees,</hi> with what face can ye deny the Reſurrection of the body, when ye ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> after four-days death riſing up out of his grave? And if <hi>Lazarus</hi> did thus ſtart up at the bleating of this Lamb of God, that was now every day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for the ſlaughter-houſe; how ſhall the dead be rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed up out of their graves by the roaring of that glorious and immortall Lion, whoſe voice ſhall ſhake the powers of Heaven, and move the very foundations of the earth?</p>
            <p>With what ſtrange amazedneſs do we think that <hi>Martha</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and the Diſciples, look'd to ſee <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth in his winding-ſheet, ſhackled with his linen fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and walk towards them? Doubtleſs fear and horrour ſtrove in them, whether ſhould be for the time more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. We love our friends dearly; but to ſee them again after their known death, and that in the very robes of the grave, muſt needs ſet up the hair in a kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth rigour. And now, though it had been moſt eaſy for him that brake the adamantine fetters of death, to have broke in pieces thoſe linen ligaments wherewith his raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> was encumbred; yet he will not doe it but by their hands. He that ſaid, <hi>Remove the ſtone,</hi> ſaid, <hi>Looſe Lazarus.</hi> He will not have us expect his immediate help in that we can doe for our ſelves. It is both a lazineſs, and a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous tempting of God, to look for an extraordinary and ſupernaturall help from God, where he hath enabled us with common aid.</p>
            <p>What ſtrange ſalutations do we think there were betwixt <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> that had raiſed him; betwixt <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his Siſters and neighbours and friends? what amazed looks? what unuſuall complements? For <hi>Lazarus</hi> was himſelf at once: here was no leiſure of degrees to reduce him to his wonted perfection; neither did he ſtay to rub his eyes, and ſtretch his benummed lims, nor take time to put off that dead ſleep wherewith he had been ſeized; but inſtantly he is both alive, and freſh, and vigorous: if they
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:47750:204"/>
do but let him goe, he walks ſo as if he had ailed nothing, and receives and gives mutuall gratulations. I leave them entertaining each other with glad embraces, with diſcourſes of reciprocall admiration, with praiſes and adorations of that God and Saviour that had fetched him into life.</p>

            <p>NEver did our Saviour take ſo much ſtate upon him as now that he was going towards his Paſſion: other journies he meaſured on foot, without noiſe or train; this with a Princely equipage and loud acclamation.

            <p>Thou wouldſt not loſe ought of thy right; thou that waſt a King, wouldſt be proclaimed ſo: but that it might appear thy Kingdome was not of this world, thou that couldſt have commanded all worldly magnificence, thoughteſt fit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon it.</p>

Thither would <hi>Jeſus</hi> come as a King, as a Prieſt, as a Prophet: acclaimed as a King; teaching the people, and foretelling the wofull vaſtation of it, as a Prophet; and as a Prieſt taking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of his Temple, and vindicating it from the foul profanations of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sacrilege. Oft before had he come to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> without any remarkable change, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſemblance of State; now that he gives ſome little glimpſe of his Royalty, <hi>the whole City was moved.</hi> When the Sages of the Eaſt brought the firſt news of the King of the <hi>Jews, Herod was troubled and all Jeruſalem with him</hi>; and now that the King of the <hi>Jews</hi> comes himſelf (though in ſo mean a port) there is a new commotion. The ſilence and obſcurity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> never troubles the world; he may be an underling without any ſtir: but if he do but put forth himſelf never ſo little to bear the leaſt ſway amongſt men, now their bloud is up; the whole City is moved. Neither is it otherwiſe in the private oeconomy of the Soul. O Saviour, whilſt thou doſt, as it were, hide thy ſelf, and lie ſtill in the heart, and takeſt all terms contentedly from us, we entertain thee with no other then a friendly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; but when thou once beginneſt to ruffle with our Corruptions, and to exerciſe thy Spiritual power in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of our vile Affections, now all is in a ſecret up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, all the angles of the heart are moved.</p>
            <p>Although, doubtleſs, this commotion was not ſo much of tumult, as of wonder. As when ſome uncouth ſight preſents it ſelf in a populous ſtreet, men run, and gaze, and throng, and inquire; the feet, the tongue, the eyes walk; one ſpectatour draws on another, one asks and preſſes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the noiſe increaſes with the concourſe, each helps to ſtir up others expectation: ſuch was this of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What means this ſtrangeneſs? Was not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Spouſe of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Had he not choſen her out of all the earth? Had he not begotten many children of her, as the pledges of their love? How juſtly maiſt thou now, O Saviour,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:47750:206"/>
complain with that mirrour of Patience, <hi>My breath was grown ſtrange to my own wife, though I intreated her for the childrens ſake of my own body?</hi> Even of thee is that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, which thy choſen Veſſel ſaid of thy Miniſters, Thou art <hi>made a gazing-ſtock to the world, to Angels, and to men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As all the world was bound to thee for thine Incarnation and reſidence upon the face of the earth, ſo eſpecially <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> to whoſe limits thou confinedſt thy ſelf; and therein, above all the reſt, three Cities, <hi>Nazareth, Capernaum, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> on whom thou beſtowedſt the moſt time, and coſt of preaching, and miraculous works. Yet in all three thou receivedſt not ſtrange entertainment onely, but hoſtile. In <hi>Nazareth</hi> they would have caſt thee down headlong from the Mount: In <hi>Capernaum</hi> they would have bound thee: In <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they crucified thee at laſt, and now are amazed at thy preſence. Thoſe places and perſons that have the greateſt helps and privileges afforded to them, are not always the moſt anſwerable in the return of their thankfulneſs. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s being amongſt us doth not make us happy, but his welcome. Every day may we hear him in our ſtreets, and yet be as new to ſeek as theſe Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem; Who is this?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it a queſtion of applauſe, or of contempt, or of ignorance? Applauſe of his abettours, contempt of the Scribes and Phariſees, ignorance of the multitude? Surely his abettours had not been moved at this ſight: the Scribes and Phariſees had rather envied then contemned: the multitude doubtleſs inquired ſeriouſly, out of a deſire of information. Not that the Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> knew not <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was ſo ordinary a gueſt, ſo noted a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet amongſt them. Queſtionleſs this queſtion was asked of that part of the train which went before this Triumph, whilſt our Saviour was not yet in ſight, which ere long his preſence had reſolved. It had been their duty to have known, to have attended <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yea to have publiſh'd
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:47750:206"/>
him to others: ſince this is not done, it is well yet that they ſpend their breath in an inquiry. No doubt there were many that would not ſo much as leave their ſhop-board, and ſtep to their doors or their windows to ſay, <hi>Who is this?</hi> as not thinking it could concern them who paſſed by, whilſt they might ſit ſtill, Thoſe Greeks were in ſome way to good, that could ſay to <hi>Philip, We would ſee Jeſus.</hi> O Saviour, thou haſt been ſo long amongſt us, that it is our juſt ſhame if we know thee not. If we have been ſlack hitherto, let our zealous inquiry make amends for our neglect. Let outward pomp and worldly glory draw the hearts and tongues of carnall men after them; O let it be my care and happineſs to ask after nothing but thee.</p>
            <p>The attending Diſciples could not be to ſeek for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; which of the Prophets have not put it into their mouths? <hi>Who is this?</hi> Ask <hi>Moſes,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The ſeed of the Woman</hi> that <hi>ſhall break the Serpent's head.</hi> Ask our Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The Shiloh of the tribe of Judah.</hi> Ask <hi>David,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The King of glory.</hi> Ask <hi>Eſay,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>Immanuel, Wonderfull, Counſellour, The mighty God, The everlaſting Father, The Prince of peace.</hi> Ask <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and he ſhall tell you, <hi>The righteous Branch.</hi> Ask <hi>Daniel,</hi> he ſhall tell you, <hi>The Meſſiah.</hi> Ask <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, he ſhall tell you, <hi>The Lamb of God.</hi> If ye ask the God of the Prophets, he hath told you, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Yea, if all theſe be too good for you to conſult with, the Devils themſelves have been forced to ſay, <hi>I know who thou art, even that Holy One of God.</hi> On no ſide hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> left himſelf without a teſtimony; and accordingly the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude here have their anſwer ready, <hi>This is Jeſus, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of Nazareth in Galilee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ye undervalue your Maſter, O ye well-meaning Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Chriſt: A Prophet? yea, more then a Prophet? John Baptiſt</hi> was ſo, yet was but the Harbinger of this <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> This was that God by whom the Prophets were
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:47750:207"/>
both ſent and inſpired. <hi>Of Nazareth,</hi> ſay you? ye miſtake him: <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was the place of his Birth, the proof of his Tribe, the evidence of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip.</hi> If <hi>Nazareth</hi> were honoured by his preaching, there was no reaſon he ſhould be diſhonoured by <hi>Nazareth.</hi> No doubt, he whom you confeſſed, pardoned the errour of your confeſſion. Ye ſpake but according to the common ſtyle: The two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples in their walk to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> after the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> give him no other title. This belief paſſed current with the people; and thus high even the vulgar thoughts could then riſe: and, no doubt, even thus much was for that time very acceptable to the Father of Mercies. If we make profeſſion of the Truth according to our knowledge, though there be much imperfection in our apprehenſion and delivery, the mercy of our good God takes it well; not judging us for what we have not, but accepting us in what we have. Shouldſt thou, O God, ſtand ſtrictly upon the punctual degrees of knowledge, how wide would it goe with millions of Souls? for beſides much errour in many, there is more ignorance. But herein do we juſtly magnifie and adore thy Goodneſs, that where thou findeſt diligent endeavour of better information mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with an honeſt ſimplicity of heart, thou paſſeſt by our unwilling defects, and crowneſt our well-meant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
            <p>But oh the wonderfull hand of God in the carriage of this whole buſineſs! The people proclaimed <hi>Chriſt</hi> firſt a King; and now they proclaim him a Prophet. Why did not the <hi>Roman</hi> bands run into arms upon the one? why did not the Scribes and Phariſees and the envious Prieſthood mutiny upon the other? They had made Decrees againſt him, they had laid wait for him; yet now he paſſes in ſtate through their ſtreets, acclaimed both a King and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, without their reluctation. What can we impute this unto, but to the powerfull and over-ruling arm of his Godhead? He that reſtrained the rage of <hi>Herod</hi> and his
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:47750:207"/>
Courtiers upon the firſt news of a King born, now reſtrains all the oppoſite powers of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from lifting up a finger againſt this laſt and publick avouchment of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall and Propheticall Office of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> When fleſh and bloud have done their worſt, they can be but ſuch as he will make them: If the Legions of Hell combine with the Potentates of the earth, they cannot go beyond the reach of their tether: Whether they riſe or ſit ſtill, they ſhall by an inſenſible ordination perform that will of the Almighty which they leaſt think of, and moſt oppoſe.</p>
            <p>With this humble pomp and juſt acclamation, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, doſt thou paſs through the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the Temple. Thy firſt walk was not to <hi>Herod</hi>'s pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, or to the Market-places or Burſes of that populous City, but to the Temple; whether it were out of duty, or out of need: As a good Son when he comes from far, his firſt alighting is at his Father's houſe, neither would he think it other then prepoſterous, to viſit ſtrangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his friends, or friends before his Father. Beſides that the Temple had more uſe of thy preſence: both there was the moſt diſorder, and from thence, as from a corrupt ſpring, it iſſued forth into all the chanels of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> A wiſe Phyſician inquires firſt into the ſtate of the head, heart, liver, ſtomack, the vitall and chief parts, ere he asks after the petty ſymptoms of the meaner and leſs-concerning members. Surely all good or evil begins at the Temple. If God have there his own, if men find there nothing but wholſome inſtruction, holy example, the Commonwealth cannot want ſome happy tincture of Piety, Devotion, Sanctimony; as that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant perfume from <hi>Aaron</hi>'s head ſweetens his utmoſt skirts. Contrarily, the diſtempers of the Temple cannot but affect the Secular ſtate. As therefore the good Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, when he ſees the leaves grow yellow, and the branches unthriving, looks preſently to the root; ſo didſt thou, O holy Saviour, upon ſight of the diſorders ſpred over
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:47750:208"/>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judaea,</hi> addreſs thy ſelf to the rectifying of the Temple.</p>
            <p>No ſooner is <hi>Chriſt</hi> alighted at the gate of the outer Court of his Father's houſe, then he falls to work: Reformation was his errand; that he roundly attempts. That holy ground was profaned by ſacrilegious barterings: within the third court of that ſacred place was a publick Mart held; here was a throng of buiers and ſellers, though not of all commodities, (the <hi>Jews</hi> were not ſo irreligious,) onely of thoſe things which were for the uſe of Sacrifice. The <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> came many of them from far; it was no leſs from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba</hi> then the ſpace of an hundred and threeſcore miles; neither could it be without much inconvenience for them to bring their Bullocks, Sheep, Goats, Lambs, meal, oyl, and ſuch other holy proviſion with them up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> Order was taken by the Prieſts, that theſe might for money be had cloſe by the Altar; to the eaſe of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and the benefit of the ſeller, and perhaps no diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to themſelves. The pretence was fair, the practice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable. The great Owner of the Temple comes to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the reputation and rights of his own houſe; and in an indignation at that ſo foul abuſe, lays fiercely about him, and with his three-ſtringed ſcourge whips out thoſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegious chapmen, caſts down their tables, throws away their baskets, ſcatters their heaps, and ſends away their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers with ſmart and horrour.</p>
            <p>With what fear and aſtoniſhment did the repining of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders look upon ſo unexpected a Juſticer, whilſt their conſcience laſhed them more then thoſe cords, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that meek chaſtiſer more affrighted them then his blows? Is this that mild and gentle Saviour that came to <hi>take upon him our ſtripes,</hi> and to undergoe <hi>the chaſtiſements of our peace?</hi> Is this that quiet <hi>Lamb, which before his ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers openeth not his mouth?</hi> See now how his eyes ſparkle with holy anger, and dart forth beams of indignation in the faces of theſe guilty Collybiſts: ſee how his hands deal
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:47750:208"/>
ſtrokes and ruine. Yea, thus, thus it became thee, O thou gracious Redeemer of men, to let the world ſee, thou haſt not loſt thy Juſtice in thy Mercy; that there is not more lenity in thy forbearances, then rigour in thy juſt ſeverity; that thou canſt thunder, as well as ſhine.</p>
            <p>This was not thy firſt act of this kind; at the entrance of thy publick work thou beganneſt ſo as thou now ſhutteſt up, with purging thine Houſe. Once before had theſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders been whipt out of that holy place, which now they dare again defile. Shame and ſmart is not enough to reclaim obdur'd offenders. Gainfull ſins are not eaſily checked, but leſs eaſily maſtered. Theſe bold flies, where they are beaten off, will alight again. <hi>He that is filthy</hi> will <hi>be filthy ſtill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oft yet had our Saviour been (beſides this) in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and often had ſeen the ſame diſorder; he doth not think fit to be always whipping. It was enough thus twice to admoniſh and chaſtiſe them before their ruine. That God who hates ſin always, will not chide always, and ſtrikes more ſeldome; but he would have thoſe few ſtrokes perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall monitours; and if thoſe prevail not, he ſmites but once. It is his uniform courſe, firſt the Whip, and if that ſpeed not, then the Sword.</p>
            <p>There is a reverence due to God's Houſe for the Owner's ſake, for the ſervice's ſake. Secular and profane actions are not for that Sacred roof, much leſs uncivil and beaſtly. What but Holineſs can become that place which is <hi>the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Holineſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The faireſt pretences cannot bear out a ſin with God. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could there be more plauſible colours caſt upon any act; the convenience, the neceſſity of proviſions for the Sacrifice: yet through all theſe do the fiery eyes of our Saviour ſee the foul Covetouſneſs of the Prieſts, the Fraud of the Money-changers, the intolerable abuſe of the Temple. Common eyes may be cheated with eaſy pretexts; but he that looks through the heart at the face, juſtly anſwers our Apologies with ſcourges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:47750:209"/>None but the hand of publick Authority muſt reform the abuſes of the Temple. If all be out of courſe there, no man is barred from ſorrow; the grief may reach to all, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of reformation onely to thoſe whom it concerneth. It was but a juſt queſtion, though ill propounded to <hi>Moſes, Who made thee a Judge or a Ruler?</hi> We muſt all imitate the zeal of our Saviour; we may not imitate his correction. If we ſtrike uncalled, we are juſtly ſtricken for our arrogation, for our preſumption. A tumultuary remedy may prove a medicine worſe then the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay of ſo ſharp and imperious an act from ſo meek an Agent? Why did not the Prieſts and Levites (whoſe this gain partly was) abett theſe money-changers, and make head againſt <hi>Chriſt?</hi> why did not thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of men ſtand upon their defence, and wreſt that whip out of the hand of a ſeemingly-weak and unarmed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; but in ſtead hereof run away like ſheep from before him, not daring to abide his preſence, though his hand had been ſtill? Surely, had theſe men been ſo many armies, yea, ſo many Legions of Devils, when God will aſtoniſh and chaſe them, they cannot have the power to ſtand and reſiſt. How eaſy is it for him that made the heart, to put either terrour or courage into it at pleaſure? O Saviour, it was none of thy leaſt Miracles, that thou didſt thus drive out a world of able offenders in ſpite of their gain and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackfull reſolutions; their very profit had no power to ſtay them againſt thy frowns. <hi>Who hath reſiſted</hi> thy <hi>will?</hi> Mens hearts are not their own: they are, they muſt be ſuch as their Maker will have them.</p>

            <p>WHen in this State our Saviour had rid through the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that evening he lodged not there. Whether he would not, that after ſo publick an acclamation of the people he might avoid all ſuſpicion of plots or popularity: (Even unjuſt jealouſies muſt be ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; neither is there leſs wiſedom in the prevention, then in the remedy of evils;) or whether he could not, for want of an invitation; <hi>Hoſanna</hi> was better cheap then an entertainment; and perhaps the envy of ſo ſtomacked a Reformation diſcouraged his hoſts. However, he goes that evening ſupperleſs out of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> O unthankfull Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens! Do ye thus part with your no leſs meek then glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King? His title was not more proclaimed in your ſtreets then your own ingratitude. If he have purged the Temple, yet your hearts are foul. There is no wonder in mens unworthineſs; there is more then wonder in thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O thou Saviour of men, that wouldſt yet return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther where thou wert ſo palpably diſregarded. If they gave thee not thy Supper, thou giveſt them their Breakfaſt: If thou maiſt not ſpend the night with them, thou wilt with them ſpend the day. O love of unthankfull Souls, not diſcourageable by the moſt hatefull indignities, by the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt repulſes! What burthen canſt thou ſhrink under, who canſt bear the weight of Ingratitude?</p>
            <p>Thou that giveſt food to all things living, art thy ſelf hungry. <hi>Martha, Mary</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> kept not ſo poor an houſe, but that thou mighteſt have eaten ſomething at <hi>Bethany.</hi> Whether thine haſte out-ran thine appetite; or
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:47750:210"/>
whether on purpoſe thou forbareſt repaſt, to give oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to thine inſuing Miracle, I neither ask, nor reſolve. This was not the firſt time that thou waſt hungry. As thou wouldſt be a man, ſo thou wouldſt ſuffer thoſe infirmities that belong to Humanity. Thou cameſt to be our High Prieſt; it was thy act and intention, not onely to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede for thy people, but to transfer unto thy ſelf, as their ſins, ſo their weakneſſes and complaints. Thou knoweſt to pity what thou haſt felt. Are we pinched with want? we endure but what thou didſt, we have reaſon to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; thou enduredſt what we do, we have reaſon to be thankfull.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall we ſay to this thine early hunger? The morning, as it is privileged from exceſs, ſo from need; the ſtomack is not wont to riſe with the body. Surely, as thine occaſions were, no ſeaſon was exempted from thy want: thou hadſt ſpent the day before in the holy labour of thy Reformation; after a ſupperleſs departure thou ſpenteſt the night in Prayer; no meal refreſhed thy toil. What do we think much to forbear a morſell, or to break a ſleep for thee, who didſt thus neglect thy ſelf for us?</p>
            <p>As if meat were no part of thy care, as if any thing would ſerve to ſtop the mouth of hunger, thy breakfaſt is expected from the next Tree. A Fig-tree grew by the way ſide, full grown, well ſpred, thick leaved, and ſuch as might promiſe enough to a remote eye: thither thou cameſt to ſeek that which thou foundeſt not; and not finding what thou ſoughteſt, as diſpleaſed with thy diſappointment, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt that plant which deluded thy hopes. Thy breath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly blaſted that deceitfull tree; it did (no otherwiſe then the whole world muſt needs doe) wither and die with thy Curſe.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, I had rather wonder at thine actions then diſcuſs them. If I ſhould ſay that, as man, thou either kneweſt not or conſideredſt not of this fruitleſneſs, it could no way prejudice thy Divine Omniſcience; this infirmity
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:47750:210"/>
were no worſe then thy wearineſs or hunger. It was no more diſparagement to thee to grow in Knowledge, then in Stature; neither was it any more diſgrace to thy perfect Humanity, that thou (as man) kneweſt not all things at once, then that thou wert not in thy childhood at thy full growth. But herein I doubt not to ſay, it is more likely thou cameſt purpoſely to this Tree, knowing the barrenneſs of it anſwerable to the ſeaſon, and fore-reſolving the event; that thou mighteſt hence ground the occaſion of ſo inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive a Miracle: like as thou kneweſt <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dying, was dead, yet wouldſt not ſeem to take notice of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that thou mighteſt the more glorifie thy Power in his reſuſcitation. It was thy willing and determined diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment for a greater purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But why didſt thou curſe a poor Tree for the want of that fruit which the ſeaſon yielded not? If it pleaſed thee to call for that which it could not give, the Plant was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and if innocent, why curſed? O Saviour, it is fitter for us to adore then to examine. We may be ſawcy in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after thee, and fond in anſwering for thee.</p>
            <p>If that ſeaſon were not for a ripe fruit, yet for ſome fruit it was. Who knows not the nature of the Fig-tree to be always bearing? That plant (if not altogether barren) yields a continuall ſucceſſion of increaſe; whilſt one fig i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ripe, another is green; the ſame bough can content both our taſt and our hope. This tree was defective in both, yielding nothing but an empty ſhade to the miſ-hoping traveller.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, I have learn'd that thou, O Saviour, wert wont not to ſpeak onely, but to work Parables. And what was this other then a reall Parable of thine? All this while hadſt thou been in the world; thou hadſt given ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs of thy Mercy, (the earth was full of thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,) none of thy Judgments: now, immediately before thy Paſſion, thou thoughteſt fit to give this double demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of thy juſt auſterity. How elſe ſhould the world
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:47750:211"/>
have ſeen thou canſt be ſevere as well as meek and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? And why mighteſt not thou, who madeſt all things, take liberty to deſtroy a plant for thine own Glory? Wherefore ſerve thy beſt creatures but for the praiſe of thy Mercy and Juſtice? What great matter was it if thou, who once ſaidſt, <hi>Let the earth bring forth the herb yielding ſeed, and the tree yielding the fruit of its own kind,</hi> ſhalt now ſay, <hi>Let this fruitleſs tree wither?</hi> All this yet was done in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: In this act: of thine I ſee both an Embleme, and a Prophecy. How didſt thou herein mean to teach thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples how much thou hateſt an unfruitfull profeſſion, and what judgments thou meanteſt to bring upon that barren generation? Once before hadſt thou compared the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation to a Fig-tree in the midſt of thy vineyard, which, after three years expectation and culture yielding no fruit, was by thee, the Owner, doomed to a ſpeedy exciſion: now thou acteſt what thou then ſaidſt. No tree abounds more with leaf and ſhade; no Nation abounded more with Ceremoniall obſervations and ſemblances of Piety. Outward profeſſion, where there is want of inward truth and reall practice, doth but help to draw on and aggravate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Had this Fig-tree been utterly bare and leafleſs, it had perhaps eſcaped the Curſe. Hear this, ye vain Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, that care onely to ſhew well, never caring for the ſincere truth of a conſcionable Obedience: your fair outſide ſhall be ſure to help you to a Curſe.</p>
            <p>That which was the fault of this Tree, is the puniſhment of it, <hi>fruitleſneſs: Let no fruit grow on thee hence-forward for ever.</hi> Had the boughs been appointed to be torn down, and the body ſplit in pieces, the doom had been more eaſie; that juicy plant might yet have recovered, and have lived to recompenſe this deficiency: now it ſhall be what it was, <hi>fruitleſs.</hi> Woe be to that Church or Soul that is puniſhed with her own Sin. Outward plagues are but favours in compariſon of Spirituall judgments.</p>
            <p>That Curſe might well have ſtood with a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance;

At laſt this reſults, that Force is not their way; Subtlety and Treachery muſt doe that which ſhould be vainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by Power.</p>
            <p>Who is ſo fit to work this feat againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> as one of his own? There can be no Treaſon where is not ſome Truſt.

Who ſo fit among the domeſticks as he that bare the bag, and over-lov'd that which he bare? That heart which hath once enſlaved it ſelf to red and white earth, may be made any thing. Who can truſt to the power of good means, when <hi>Judas,</hi> who heard <hi>Chriſt</hi> daily, whom others heard to preach <hi>Chriſt</hi> daily, who daily ſaw <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miracles, and daily wrought Miracles in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s name, is (at his beſt) a Thief, and ere long a Traitour? That crafty and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Spirit which preſided in that bloudy counſel hath ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily found out a fit inſtrument for this Helliſh plot. As God knows, ſo Satan gueſſes, who are his, and will be ſure to make uſe of his own. If <hi>Judas</hi> were <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s domeſtick, yet he was Mammon's ſervant: he could not but hate that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter whom he formally profeſſed to ſerve, whilſt he really ſerved that maſter which <hi>Chriſt</hi> profeſſed to hate. He is but in his trade, whilſt he is bartering even for his Maſter; <hi>What will ye give me? and I will deliver him unto you.</hi> Saidſt thou not well, O Saviour, <hi>I have choſen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil?</hi> Thou that kneweſt to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt men and ſpirits, calleſt <hi>Judas</hi> by his right name. Loe, he is become a Tempter to the worſt of evils.</p>
            <p>Wretched <hi>Judas!</hi> whether ſhall I more abhor thy trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, of wonder at thy folly? What will they, what can they give thee valuable to that head Which thou profereſt to ſale? Were they able to pay, or thou capable to receive all thoſe precious metalls that are laid up in the ſecret cabins of the whole earth, how were this price equivalent to the worth of him that made them? Had they been able to have fetch'd down thoſe rich and glittering ſpangles of Heaven, and to have put them into thy fiſt, what had this been to weigh with a God? How baſely therefore doſt thou ſpeak of chaffering for him whoſe the world was? <hi>What will ye give me?</hi> Alas! what were they? what had they, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, to pay for ſuch a purchace? The time was, when he that ſet thee on work could ſay, <hi>All the Kingdoms of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:47750:212"/>
the earth, and the glory of them are mine; and I give them to whom I pleaſe: all theſe will I give thee.</hi> Had he now made that offer to thee in this wofull bargain, it might have carried ſome colour of a temptation: and even thus it had been a match ill made. But for thee to tender a trade of ſo invaluable a commodity to theſe pelting petty-chapmen for thirty poor ſilverlings, it was no leſs baſe then wicked.</p>
            <p>How unequall is this rate? Thou that valuedſt <hi>Mary</hi>'s ointment which ſhe beſtowed upon the feet of <hi>Chriſt</hi> at three hundred pieces of ſilver, ſelleſt thy Maſter, on whom that precious odour was ſpent, at thirty. Worldly hearts are peny-wiſe, and pound-fooliſh: they know how to ſet high prices upon the worthleſs traſh of this world; but for Heavenly things, or the God that owns them, theſe they ſhamefully undervalue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I will deliver him unto you.</hi> Falſe and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Judas!</hi> it was more then thou couldſt doe; thy price was not more too low then thy undertaking was too high. Had all the powers of Hell combined with thee, they could not have delivered thy Maſter into the hands of men. The act was none but his own; all that he did, all that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered was perfectly voluntary. Had he pleaſed to reſiſt, how eaſily had he with one breath blown thee and thy complices down into their Hell? It is no thank to thee that he would be delivered. O Saviour, all our ſafety, all our comfort depends not ſo much upon thine act as upon thy will: in vain ſhould we have hoped for the benefit of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced redemption.</p>
            <p>The bargain is driven, the price paid. <hi>Judas</hi> returns, and looks no leſs ſmoothly upon his Maſter and his fellows then as if he had done no diſſervice. What cares he? his heart tells him he is rich, though it tell him he is falſe. He was not now firſt an Hypocrite. The Paſſeover is at hand; no man is ſo buſy to prepare for it, or more devoutly forward to receive it then <hi>Judas.</hi>

How many proofs had he formerly of his Maſter's Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience? There was no day wherein he ſaw not that thoughts and things abſent came familiar under his cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance: yet this Miſcreant dares plot a ſecret villany againſt his perſon, and face it: if he cannot be honeſt, yet he will be cloſe. That he may be notoriouſly impudent, he ſhall know he is deſcried: whilſt he thinks fit to conceal his treachery, our Saviour thinks not fit to conceal the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that treacherous conſpiracy; <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you that one of you ſhall betray me.</hi> Who would not think but that diſcovered wickedneſs ſhould be aſhamed of it ſelf? Did not <hi>Judas</hi> (think we) bluſh, and grow pale again, and caſt down his guilty eyes, and turn away his troubled coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance at ſo galling an intimation? Cuſtome of ſin ſteels the brow, and makes it uncapable of any relenting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Could the other Diſciples have diſcerned any change in any one of their faces, they had not been ſo ſorrowfully affected with the charge. Methinks I ſee how intentively they bent their eyes upon each others, as if they would have look'd through thoſe windows down into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; with what ſelf-confidence, with what mutuall jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie they peruſed each others foreheads: and now, as rather thinking fit to diſtruſt their own innocence then their Maſter's aſſertion, each trembles to ſay, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> It is poſſible there may lurk ſecret wickedneſs in ſome blind corner of the heart, which we know not of: It is poſſible that time and temptation, working upon our corruption, may at laſt draw us into ſome ſuch ſin as we could not fore-believe. Whither may we not fall, if we be left to our own ſtrength? It is both wiſe and holy to miſdoubt the worſt: <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, how fair hath <hi>Judas</hi> (all this while) car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with his fellows? Had his former life bewrayed any falſhood or miſdemeanour, they had ſoon found where to pitch their juſt ſuſpicion: now <hi>Judas</hi> goes for ſo honeſt a man, that every Diſciple is rather ready to ſuſpect himſelf
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:47750:213"/>
then him. It is true, he was a thief; but who knows that beſides his Maker? The outſides of men are no leſs deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then their hearts. It is not more unſafe to judge by outward appearances, then it is uncharitable not to judge ſo.</p>
            <p>Oh the head-ſtrong reſolutions of wickedneſs, not to be checked by any oppoſition! Who would not but have thought, if the notice of an intended evil could not have prevented it, yet that the threats of judgment ſhould have affrighted the boldeſt offender? <hi>Judas</hi> can ſit by, and hear his Maſter ſay, <hi>Wo be to the man by whom the Son of man is betraied; it had been better for that man never to have been born,</hi> and is no more blank'd then very innocence; but thinks, What care I? I have the money; I ſhall eſcape the ſhame: the fact ſhall be cloſe, the match gainfull: it will be long ere I get ſo much by my ſervice; if I fare well for the preſent, I ſhall ſhift well enough for the future. Thus ſecretly he claps up another bargain; he <hi>makes a covenant with death, and with Hell an agreement.</hi> O <hi>Judas,</hi> didſt thou ever hear ought but truth fall from the mouth of that thy Divine Maſter? Canſt thou diſtruſt the certainty of that dreadfull menace of vengeance? How then durſt thou perſiſt in the purpoſe of ſo flagitious and damnable a villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? Reſolved ſinners run on deſperately in their wicked courſes; and have ſo bent their eyes upon the profit or pleaſure of their miſchievons projects, that they will not ſee Hell lie open before them in the way.</p>
            <p>As if that ſhameleſs man meant to outbrave all accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, and to outface his own heart, he dares aſk too, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> No Diſciple ſhall more zealouſly abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate that crime then he that foſters it in his boſome. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Searcher of hearts knows by him, is lock'd up in his own breaſt: to be perfidious is nothing, ſo he may be ſecret: his Maſter knows him for a Traitour, it is not long that he ſhall live to complain; his fellows think him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: all is well, whilſt he is well eſteemed. Reputation
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:47750:214"/>
is the onely care of falſe hearts, not truth of being, not conſcience of merit; ſo they may ſeem fair to men, they care not how foul they are to God.</p>
            <p>Had our Saviour onely had this knowledge at the ſecond hand, this boldneſs had been enough to make him ſuſpect the credit of the beſt intelligence: Who could imagine that a guilty man dared thus brow-beat a juſt accuſation? Now he whoſe piercing and unfailing eyes ſee things as they are, not as they ſeem, can peremptorily convince the impudence of this hollow queſtioniſt with a direct affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; <hi>Thou haſt ſaid.</hi> Fooliſh Traitour! couldſt thou think that thoſe blear eyes of thine would endure the beams of the Sun, or that counterfeit ſlip, the fire? was it not ſufficient for thee to be ſecretly vicious, but thou muſt preſume to conteſt with an Omniſcient accuſer? Haſt thou yet enough? Thou ſuppoſedſt thy crime unknown. To men it was ſo; had thy Maſter been no more, it had been ſo to him: now his knowledge argues him Divine. How durſt thou yet reſolve to lift up thy hand againſt him, who knows thine offence, and can either prevent or revenge it? As yet the charge was private, either not heard, or not obſerved by thy fellows: it ſhall be at firſt whiſpered to one, and at laſt known to all. Baſhfull and penitent ſinners are fit to be concealed; ſhame is meet for thoſe that have none.</p>
            <p>Curioſity of Knowledge is an old diſeaſe of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: beſides, <hi>Peter</hi>'s zeal would not let him dwell under the danger of ſo doubtfull a crimination; he cannot but ſit on thorns, till he know the man. His ſigns ask what his voice dare not. What law requires all followers to be equally beloved? Why may not our favours be freely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed where we like beſt, without envy, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice? None of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s train could complain of neglect; <hi>John</hi> is higheſt in grace. Bloud, affection, zeal, diligence have indeared him above his fellows. He that is deareſt in reſpect, is next in place: in that form of ſide-ſitting at
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:47750:214"/>
the Table, he leaned on the boſome of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> Where is more love, there may be more boldneſs. This ſecrecy and intireneſs privileges <hi>John</hi> to ask that ſafely, which <hi>Peter</hi> might not without much inconvenience and perill of a check. The beloved Diſciple well underſtands this ſilent language, and dares put <hi>Peter</hi>'s thought into words. Love ſhutteth out fear. O Saviour, the confidence of thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs emboldens us not to ſhrink at any ſuit. Thy love ſhed abroad in our hearts bids us ask that which in a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger were no better then preſumption. Once, when <hi>Peter</hi> ask'd thee a queſtion concerning <hi>John, What ſhall this man doe?</hi> he received a ſhort anſwer, <hi>What is that to thee?</hi> Now, when <hi>John</hi> asks thee a queſtion (no leſs ſeemingly curious) at <hi>Peter</hi>'s inſtance, <hi>Who is it that betrays thee?</hi> however thou mighteſt have returned him the ſame anſwer, (ſince neither of their perſons was any more concerned,) yet thou condeſcendeſt to a mild and full (though ſecret) ſatisfaction. There was not ſo much difference in the men, as in the matter of the demand. No occaſion was given to <hi>Peter</hi> of moving that queſtion concerning <hi>John</hi>; the indefinite aſſertion of treaſon amongſt the Diſciples was a moſt juſt occaſion of moving <hi>John</hi>'s queſtion for <hi>Peter</hi> and himſelf. That which therefore was timorouſly demanded, is anſwered graciouſly; <hi>He it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop when I have dipped it. And he gave the ſop to Judas.</hi> How loth was our Saviour to name him whom he was not unwilling to deſign? All is here expreſſed by dumb ſigns; the hand ſpeaks what the tongue would not. In the ſame language wherein <hi>Peter</hi> asked the queſtion of <hi>John,</hi> doth our Saviour ſhape an anſwer to <hi>John:</hi> what a beck demanded, is anſwered by a ſop.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, I do not hear thee ſay, Look on whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I frown, or to whomſoever I doe a publick affront, that is the man; but, <hi>To whomſoever I ſhall give a ſop.</hi> Surely a by-ſtander would have thought this man deep in thy books, and would have conſtrued this act, as they did thy
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:47750:215"/>
tears for <hi>Lazarus, See how he loves him.</hi> To carve a man out of thine own diſh, what could it ſeem to argue but a ſingularity of reſpect? Yet, lo, there is but one whom thou hateſt, one onely Traitour at thy board; and thou giveſt him a ſop. The outward Gifts of God are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the proofs of his Love; yea, ſometimes are beſtowed in diſpleaſure. Had not he been a wiſe Diſciple that ſhould have envied the great favour done to <hi>Judas,</hi> and have ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macked his own preterition? So fooliſh are they, who, meaſuring Gods affection by temporall benefits, are ready to applaud proſpering wickedneſs, and to grudge outward bleſſings to them who are uncapable of any better.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After the ſop Satan entred into Judas.</hi> Better had it been for that treacherous Diſciple to have wanted that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell: Not that there was any malignity in the bread, or that the ſop had any power to convey Satan into the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, or that by a neceſſary concomitance that evil ſpirit was in or with it. Favours ill uſed make the heart more capable of farther evil. That wicked Spirit commonly takes occaſion by any of Gods gifts, to aſſault us the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly. After our Sacramentall morſell, if we be not the better, we are ſure the worſe. I dare not ſay, yet I dare think, that <hi>Judas,</hi> comparing his Maſter's words and <hi>John</hi>'s whiſperings with the tender of this ſop, and finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf thus denoted, was now ſo much the more irritated to perform what he had wickedly purpoſed. Thus Satan took advantage by the ſop of a farther poſſeſſion. Twice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had that evil Spirit made a palpable entry into that leud heart. Firſt, in his Covetouſneſs and Theft; thoſe ſinfull habits could not be without that authour of ill: then, in his damnable reſolution, and plot of ſo hainous a conſpiracy againſt <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Yet now (as if it were new to begin) <hi>After the ſop Satan entred.</hi> As in every groſs ſin which we entertain, we give harbour to that evil Spirit; ſo in every degree of growth in wickedneſs, new hold is taken by him of the heart. No ſooner is the foot over the
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:47750:215"/>
threſhold, then we enter into the houſe: when we paſs thence into the inner rooms, we make ſtill but a perfect entrance. At firſt Satan entred, to make the houſe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>'s heart his own; now he enters into it as his own. The firſt purpoſe of ſin opens the gates to Satan; conſent admits him into the entry; full reſolution of ſin gives up the keys to his hands, and puts him into abſolute poſſeſſion. What a plain difference there is betwixt the regenerate and evil heart? Satan lays ſiege to the beſt by his Temptations; and ſometimes upon battery and breach made enters: the other admits him by willing compoſition. When he is entred upon the Regenerate, he is entertained with perpetuall skirmiſhes, and by an holy violence at laſt repulſed: in the other he is plauſibly received, and freely commandeth. Oh the admirable meekneſs of this Lamb of God! I ſee not a frown, I hear not a check; but, <hi>What thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> Why do we ſtartle at our petty wrongs, and ſwell with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and break into furious revenges upon every occaſion, when the pattern of our Patience lets not fall one harſhword upon ſo foul and bloudy a Traitour? Yea, ſo fairly is this carried, that the Diſciples as yet can apprehend no change; they innocently think of commodities to be bought: when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaks of their Maſter ſold, and, as one that longs to be out of pain, haſtens the pace of his irreclamable conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour, <hi>That thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> It is one thing to ſay, Doe what thou intendeſt, and another to ſay, <hi>Doe quickly what thou doeſt.</hi> There was villany in the deed; the ſpeed had no ſin, the time was harmleſs, whilſt the man and the act were wicked. O <hi>Judas,</hi> how happy had it been for thee, if thou hadſt never done what thou perfidiouſly intendedſt? but ſince thou wilt needs doe it, delay is but a torment.</p>
            <p>That ſteely heart yet relents not; the obfirmed Traitour knows his way to the High Prieſt's hall and to the Garden; the watchword is already given, <hi>Hail, Maſter,</hi> and <hi>a kiſs.</hi> Yet more Hypocriſy? yet more preſumption upon ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained a lenity? How kneweſt thou, O thou falſe Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,

whether that ſacred cheek would ſuffer it ſelf to be defiled with thine impure touch? Thou well foundeſt thy treachery was unmasked; thine heart could not be ſo falſe to thee as not to tell thee how hatefull thou wert. Goe, kiſs and adore thoſe ſilverlings which thou art too ſure of; the Maſter whom thou haſt ſold is not thine. But oh the impudence of a deplored ſinner! That tongue which hath agreed to ſell his Maſter dares ſay, <hi>Hail:</hi> and thoſe lips that have paſſed the compact of his death dare offer to kiſs him whom they had covenanted to kill. It was God's charge of old, <hi>Kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry.</hi> O Saviour, thou hadſt reaſon to be angry with this kiſs; the ſcourges, the thorns, the nails, the ſpear of thy Murtherers were not ſo painfull, ſo piercing, as this touch of <hi>Judas:</hi> all theſe were in this one alone.

            <p>WHat a Preface do I find to my Saviour's Paſſion? an Hymn, and an Agony: a chearfull Hymn, and an Agony no leſs ſorrowfull. An Hymn begins, both to raiſe and teſtify the courageous reſolutions of his Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; an Agony follows, to ſhew that he was truly ſenſible of thoſe extremities wherewith he was reſolved to grapple. All the Diſciples bore their part in that Hymn; it was fit they ſhould all ſee his comfortable and Divine Magnanimity wherewith he entred into thoſe ſad liſts: onely Three of them ſhall be allowed to be the witneſſes of his Agony;
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:47750:216"/>
onely thoſe three that had been the witneſſes of his glorious Transfiguration. That ſight had well fore-arm'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them for this: how could they be diſmay'd to ſee his trouble, who there ſaw his Majeſty? how could they be diſmay'd to ſee his Body now ſweat, which they had then ſeen to ſhine? how could they be daunted to ſee him now accoſted with <hi>Judas</hi> and his train, whom they then ſaw at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias?</hi> how could they be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to hear the reproaches of baſe men, when they had heard the voice of God to him from that excellent glory, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed?</hi>

            <p>Now before theſe eyes this Sun begins to be over-caſt with clouds; <hi>He began to be ſorrowfull and very heavy.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſad thoughts for mankind had he ſecretly hatched, and yet ſmothered in his own breaſt; now his grief is too great to keep in: <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto death.</hi> O Saviour, what muſt thou needs feel when thou ſaidſt ſo? Feeble minds are apt to bemoan themſelves upon light oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; the grief muſt needs be violent that cauſeth a ſtrong heart to break forth into a paſſionate complaint. Woe is me! what a word is this for the Son of God? Where is that Comforter which thou promiſedſt to ſend to others? where is that thy <hi>Father of all mercies and God of all comfort, in whoſe preſence is the fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand there are pleaſures for evermore?</hi> where are thoſe conſtant and chearfull reſolutions of a fearleſs walking through the valley of the ſhadow of death? Alas! if that face were not hid from thee whoſe eſſence could not be diſunited, theſe pangs could not have been. The Sun was withdrawn awhile, that there might be a cool, though not a dark night, as in the world, ſo in thy breaſt; withdrawn in reſpect of ſight, not of being. It was the hardeſt piece of thy ſufferings, that thou muſt be diſconſolate.</p>
            <p>But to whom doſt thou make this moan, O thou Saviour of men? Hard is that man driven that is fain to complain to

They might be aſtoniſh'd with thy grief; but there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power in their hands to free thee from thoſe ſorrows, nor power in their compaſſion to mitigate them. Nay, in this condition what could all the Angels of Heaven (as of themſelves) doe to ſuccour thee? What ſtrength could they have but from thee? What creature can help when thou complaineſt?

It was not thy Body that ſuffered now: the pain of body is but as the body of pain; the anguiſh of the Soul is as the ſoul of anguiſh. That, and in that thou ſufferedſt. Where are they that dare ſo far diſparage thy Sorrow, as to ſay thy Soul ſuffered onely in ſympathy with thy Body; not immediately, but by participation; not in its ſelf, but in its partner?

No, no: It was the ſad weight of the Sin of mankind; it was the heavy burthen of thy Father's wrath for our ſin that thus preſſed thy Soul, and wrung from thee theſe bitter expreſſions.</p>
            <p>What can it avail thee, O Saviour, to tell thy grief to men? who can eaſe thee, but he of whom thou ſaidſt, <hi>My Father is greater then I?</hi> Lo, to him thou turneſt; <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was not this that <hi>prayer</hi> (O dear <hi>Chriſt</hi>) which <hi>in the days of thy fleſh thou offeredſt up with ſtrong crying and tears to him that was able to ſave thee from death?</hi> Surely this was it. Never was cry ſo ſtrong; never was God thus ſolicited. How could Heaven chuſe but ſhake at ſuch a Prayer from the Power that made it? How can my heart but tremble to hear this ſuit from <hi>the Captain of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> O thou that ſaidſt, <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> doſt thou ſuffer ought from thy Father but what thou wouldſt, what thou determinedſt? was this Cup of thine either ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall or forced? wouldſt thou wiſh for what thou kneweſt thou wouldſt not have poſſible? Far, far be theſe miſ-rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoughts of our ignorance and frailty. Thou cameſt to ſuffer, and thou wouldſt doe what thou cameſt for: yet ſince thou wouldſt be a man, thou wouldſt take all of man, ſave ſin: it is but humane (and not ſinfull) to be loth to ſuffer what we may avoid. In this velleity of thine, thou wouldſt ſhew what that Nature of ours which thou hadſt
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:47750:218"/>
aſſumed could incline to wiſh; but in thy reſolution, thou wouldſt ſhew us what thy victorious thoughts raiſed and aſſiſted by thy Divine power had determinately pitched upon: <hi>Nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> As man thou hadſt a Will of thine own: no humane Soul can be perfect without that main faculty. That will, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally could be content to incline towards an exemption from miſeries, gladly vails to that Divine will whereby thou art deſigned to <hi>the chaſtiſements of our peace.</hi> Thoſe pains which in themſelves were grievous, thou embraceſt as decreed: ſo as thy fear hath given place to thy love and obedience. How ſhould we have known theſe evils ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, if thou hadſt not in half a thought inclined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate them? How could we have avoided ſo formidable and deadly evils, if thou hadſt not willingly undergone them? We acknowledge thine holy fear, we adore thy Divine fortitude.</p>
            <p>Whilſt thy Mind was in this fearfull agitation, it is no marvell if thy Feet were not fixed. Thy place is more changed then thy thoughts. One while thou walkeſt to thy drouzy Attendents, and ſtirreſt up their needfull vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy; then thou returneſt to thy paſſionate Devotions, thou falleſt again upon thy face. If thy Body be humbled down to the earth, thy Soul is yet lower; thy prayers are ſo much more vehement as thy pangs are. <hi>And being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of bloud falling down to the ground.</hi> O my Saviour, what an agony am I in, whilſt I think of thine? What pain, what fear, what ſtrife, what horrour was in thy Sacred breaſt? How didſt thou ſtruggle under the weight of our ſins, that thou thus ſweateſt, that thou thus bleedeſt? All was peace with thee: thou wert one with thy coeternal and coeſſential Father; all the Angels worſhipp'd thee; all the powers of Heaven and earth aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledged thine Infiniteneſs. It was our perſon that feoffed thee in this miſery and torment; in that thou
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:47750:218"/>
ſuſtainedſt thy Father's wrath and our curſe. If eternal death be unſufferable, if every ſin deſerve eternal death, what, O what was it for thy Soul in this ſhort time of thy bitter Paſſion to anſwer thoſe millions of eternal deaths which all the ſins of all mankind had deſerved from the juſt hand of thy Godhead? I marvell not if thou bleedeſt a ſweat, if thou ſweateſt bloud: If the moiſture of that Sweat be from the Body, the tincture of it is from the Soul. As there never was ſuch another Sweat, ſo neither can there be ever ſuch a Suffering. It is no wonder if the Sweat were more then natural, when the Suffering was more then humane.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, ſo willing was that precious bloud of thine to be let forth for us, that it was ready to prevent thy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutours; and iſſued forth in thoſe pores, before thy wounds were opened by thy Tormentours. Oh that my heart could bleed unto thee with true inward compunction for thoſe ſins of mine which are guilty of this thine Agony, and have drawn bloud of thee both in the Garden and on the Croſs. Woe is me: I had been in Hell, if thou hadſt not been in thine Agony; I had ſcorched, if thou hadſt not ſweat. Oh let me abhor my own wickedneſs, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and bleſs thy Mercy.</p>
            <p>But, O ye bleſſed Spirits which came to comfort my conflicted Saviour, how did ye look upon this Son of God, when ye ſaw him labouring for life under theſe violent temptations? with what aſtoniſhment did ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him bleeding whom ye adored? In the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, after his Duell with Satan, ye came and miniſtred unto him; and now in the Garden, whilſt he is in an harder combat, ye appear to ſtrengthen him. O the wiſe and marvellous diſpenſation of the Almighty! Whom God will afflict, an Angel ſhall relieve; the Son ſhall ſuffer, the Servant ſhall comfort him; the God of Angels droopeth, the Angel of God ſtrengthens him.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> if as Man thou wouldſt be <hi>made a little lower
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:47750:219"/>
then the Angels</hi>; how can it diſparage thee to be attended and cheared up by an Angel? Thine Humiliation would not diſdain comfort from meaner hands. How free was it for thy Father to convey ſeaſonable conſolations to thine humbled Soul, by whatſoever means? Behold, though thy Cup ſhall not paſs, yet it ſhall be ſweetned. What if thou ſee not (for the time) thy Father's face? yet thou ſhalt feel his hand. What could that Spirit have done without the God of Spirits? O Father of Mercies, thou maiſt bring thine into Agonies, but thou wilt never leave them there. <hi>In the midſt of the ſorrows of my heart thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts ſhall refreſh my Soul.</hi> Whatſoever be the means of my ſupportation, I know and adore the Authour.</p>

            <p>WHerefore, O Saviour, didſt thou take thoſe three choice Diſciples with thee from their fellows, but that thou expectedſt ſome comfort from their preſence? A ſeaſonable word may ſometimes fall from the meaneſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent; and the very ſociety of thoſe we truſt carries in it ſome kind of contentment. Alas! what broken reeds are men? Whilſt thou art ſweating in thine Agony, they are ſnorting ſecurely. Admonitions, threats, intreaties can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keep their eyes open. Thou telleſt them of danger, they will needs dream of eaſe; and though twice rouzed (as if they had purpoſed this neglect) they careleſly ſleep out thy ſorrow and their own perill. What help haſt
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47750:219"/>
thou of ſuch Followers? In the mount of thy Transfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they ſlept, and beſides fell on their faces, when they ſhould behold thy glory, and were not themſelves for fear; in the garden of thine Agony they fell upon the ground for drouzineſs, when they ſhould compaſſionate thy ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and loſt themſelves in a ſtupid ſleepineſs. Doubtleſs even this diſregard made thy prayers ſo much more fervent. The leſs comfort we find on earth, the more we ſeek above. Neither ſoughteſt thou more then thou foundeſt: Lo, thou <hi>wert heard in that which</hi> thou <hi>fearedſt.</hi> An Angel ſupplies men; that Spirit was vigilant whilſt thy Diſciples were hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. The exchange was happy.</p>
            <p>No ſooner is this good Angel vaniſhed, then that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Devil appears: <hi>Judas</hi> comes up, and ſhews himſelf in the head of thoſe miſcreant troups. He whoſe too much honour it had been to be a Follower of ſo Bleſſed a Maſter, affects now to be the leader of this wicked rabble. The Sheep's fleece is now caſt off; the Wolf appears in his own likeneſs. He that would be falſe to his Maſter, would be true to his Chapmen: Even evil ſpirits keep touch with themſelves. The bold Traitour dares yet ſtill mix Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy with Villany; his very ſalutations and kiſſes murther. O Saviour, this is no news to thee. All thoſe who under a ſhow of Godlineſs practiſe impiety do ſtill betray thee thus. Thou who hadſt ſaid, <hi>One of you is a Devil,</hi> didſt not now ſay, <hi>Avoid, Satan</hi>; but, <hi>Friend, wherefore art thou come?</hi> As yet, <hi>Judas,</hi> it was not too late. Had there been any the leaſt ſpark of Grace yet remaining in that perfidious boſome, this word had fetch'd thee upon thy knees. All this Sunſhine cannot thaw an obdurate heart. The ſign is given, <hi>Jeſus</hi> is taken. Wretched Traitour! why wouldſt thou for this purpoſe be thus attended? and ye fooliſh Prieſts and Elders! why ſent you ſuch a band and ſo armed for this apprehenſion? One meſſenger had been enough for a voluntary priſoner. Had my Saviour been unwilling to be taken, all your forces (with all the Legions of Hell
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:47750:220"/>
to help them) had been too little: ſince he was willing to be attached, two were too many. When he did but ſay, <hi>I am he,</hi> that eaſy breath alone routed all your troups, and caſt them to the earth, whom it might as eaſily have caſt down into Hell. What if he had ſaid, I will not be taken? where had ye been? or what could your ſwords and ſtaves have done againſt Omnipotence?</p>
            <p>Thoſe Diſciples that failed of their vigilance, failed not of their courage: they had heard their Maſter ſpeak of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding ſwords, and now they thought it was time to uſe them: <hi>Shall we ſmite?</hi> They were willing to fight for him with whom they were not carefull to watch: but of all other <hi>Peter</hi> was moſt forward; in ſtead of opening his lips, he unſheaths his ſword; and in ſtead of Shall I? ſmites. He had noted <hi>Malchus,</hi> a buſie ſervant of the High prieſt, too ready to ſecond <hi>Judas,</hi> and to lay his rude hands upon the Lord of Life: againſt this man his heart riſes, and his hand is lift up. That ear which had too-officiouſly liſtened to the unjuſt and cruell charge of his wicked Maſter, is now ſevered from that worſe head which it had miſ-ſerved.</p>
            <p>I love and honour thy zeal, O bleſſed Diſciple: Thou couldſt not brook wrong done to thy Divine Maſter. Had thy life been dearer to thee then his ſafety, thou hadſt not drawn thy ſword upon a whole troup. It was in earneſt that thou ſaidſt, <hi>Though all men, yet not I</hi>; and, <hi>Though I ſhould die with thee, yet I will not deny thee.</hi> Lo, thou art ready to die upon him that ſhould touch that Sacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; what would thy life now have been in compariſon of renouncing him? Since thou wert ſo fervent, why didſt thou not rather fall upon that Treachour that betray'd him, then that Sergeant that arreſted him? Surely the ſin was ſo much greater, as the plot of miſchief is more then the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; as a Domeſtick is nearer then a Stranger; as the treaſon of a Friend is worſe then the forced enmity of an Hireling. Was it that the guilty wretch upon the fact done ſubduced himſelf, and ſhrouded his falſe head under the
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:47750:220"/>
wings of darkneſs? Was it that thou couldſt not ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly apprehend the odious depth of that Villany, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly hate him that had been thy old companion? Was it that thy amazedneſs as yet conceived not the purpoſed iſſue of this ſeizure, and aſtoniſhedly waited for the ſucceſs? Was it that though <hi>Judas</hi> were more faulty, yet <hi>Malchus</hi> was more imperiouſly cruell? Howſoever, thy Courage was awaked with thy ſelf; and thy heart was no leſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere then thine hand was raſh. <hi>Put up again thy ſword into his place; for all they that take the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> Good intentions are no warrant for our actions. O Saviour, thou canſt at once accept of our meanings, and cenſure our deeds. Could there be an affection more worth incouragement then the love to ſuch a Maſter? Could there be a more juſt cauſe wherein to draw his ſword then in thy quarrell? Yet this love, this quarrell cannot ſhield <hi>Peter</hi> from thy check: thy meek tongue ſmites him gently, who had furiouſly ſmote thine enemy; <hi>Put up thy ſword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſword; but to put up, not to uſe: there is a ſword which <hi>Peter</hi> may uſe; but it is of another metall. Our weapons are, as our warfare, ſpiritual: if he ſmite not with this, he incurs no leſs blame then for ſmiting with the other; as for this material ſword, what ſhould he doe with it that is not allowed to ſtrike? When the Prince of Peace bade his followers ſell their coat and buy a ſword, he meant to inſinuate the need of theſe arms, not their improvement; and to teach them the danger of the time, not the manner of the repulſe of danger. When they therefore ſaid, <hi>Behold, here are two ſwords</hi>; he anſwered, <hi>It is enough:</hi> he ſaid not, Go buy more. More had not been enow, if a bodily defence had been intended: <hi>David</hi>'s tower had been too ſtreight to yield ſufficient furniture of this kind. When it comes to uſe, <hi>Peter</hi>'s own ſword is too much: <hi>Put up thy ſword.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is a temporal ſword; and that ſword muſt be drawn, elſe wherefore is it? but drawn by him that bears it; and he bears it that is ordained to be an avenger, to <hi>execute
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47750:221"/>
wrath upon him that doeth evil; for he bears not the ſword in vain.</hi> If another man draw it, it cuts his fingers; and draws ſo much bloud of him that unwarrantably wields it, as that <hi>he who takes the ſword ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> Can I chuſe but wonder how <hi>Peter</hi> could thus ſtrike unwounded? how he, whoſe firſt blow made the fray, could eſcape hewing in pieces from that band of Ruffians? This could not have been, if thy power, O Saviour, had not reſtrained their rage; if thy ſeaſonable and ſharp reproof had not prevented their revenge.</p>
            <p>Now, for ought I ſee, <hi>Peter</hi> ſmarts no leſs then <hi>Malchus:</hi> neither is <hi>Peter</hi>'s ear leſs ſmitten by the mild tongue of his Maſter, then <hi>Malchus</hi> his ear by the hand of <hi>Peter.</hi> Weak Diſciple! thou <hi>haſt zeal, but not according to knowledge:</hi> there is not more danger in this act of thine, then inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ignorance. <hi>The cup which my Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> Thou draweſt thy ſword to reſcue me from ſuffering. Alas! if I ſuffer not, what would become of thee? what would become of mankind? where were that eternal and juſt Decree of my Father, wherein I am a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world?</hi> Doſt thou go about to hinder thine own and the whole world's Redemption? Did I not once before call thee <hi>Satan,</hi> for ſuggeſting to me this immunity from my Paſſion? and doſt thou now think to favour me with a reall oppoſition to this great and neceſſary work? Canſt thou be ſo weak as to imagine that this Suffering of mine is not free and voluntary? Canſt thou be ſo injurious to me as to think I yield, becauſe I want aid to reſiſt? Have I not given to thee and to the world many undeniable proofs of my Omnipotence? Didſt thou not ſee how eaſy it had been for me to have blown away theſe poor forces of my adverſaries? Doſt thou not know that, if I would require it, all the glorious troups of the Angels of Heaven (any one whereof is more then worlds of men) would preſently ſhew themſelves ready to attend and reſcue me? Might this have ſtood with the Juſtice
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:47750:221"/>
of my Decree, with the Glory of my Mercy, wirh the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Man's Redemption, it had been done; my Power ſhould have triumphed over the impotent malice of my enemies: but now, ſince that eternal Decree muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, my Mercy muſt be approved, mankind muſt be ranſomed; and this cannot be done without my Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; thy well-meant valour is no better then a wrong to thy ſelf, to the world, to me, to my Father.</p>
            <p>O gracious Saviour, whilſt thou thus ſmiteſt thy Diſciple, thou healeſt him whom thy Diſciple ſmote. Many greater Miracles hadſt thou done; none that bewraied more mercy and meekneſs then this laſt Cure: of all other this ear of <hi>Malchus</hi> hath the loudeſt tongue to blazon the praiſe of thy Clemency and Goodneſs to thy very enemies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came that man but in an hoſtile manner to attach thee? Beſides his own, what favour was he worthy of for his Maſters ſake? And if he had not been more forward then his fellows, why had not his skin been as whole as theirs? Yet, even amidſt the throng of thine apprehenders, in the heat of their violence, in the height of their malice, and thine own inſtant peril of death, thou healeſt that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ear, which had been guilty of hearing Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt thee, and receiving cruell and unjuſt charges concerning thee. O <hi>Malchus,</hi> could thy ear be whole, and not thy heart broken and contrite with remorſe for riſing up againſt ſo mercifull and ſo powerfull an hand? Couldſt thou chuſe but ſay,
<q>O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> I ſee it was thy Providence that preſerved my head, when my ear was ſmitten; it is thine Almighty Power that hath miraculouſly reſtored that ear of mine which I had juſtly forfeited: this head of mine ſhall never be guilty of plotting any farther miſchief againſt thee; this ear ſhall never entertain any more reproaches of thy name; this heart of mine ſhall ever acknowledge and magnifie thy tender mercies, thy Divine Omnipotence?</q>
Could thy fellows ſee ſuch a demonſtration of Power and Goodneſs
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:47750:222"/>
with unrelenting hearts? Unthankfull <hi>Malchus,</hi> and cruell ſouldiers! ye were worſe wounded, and felt it not. God had ſtruck your breaſts with a fearfull obduration, that ye ſtill perſiſt in your bloudy enterpriſe. <hi>And they that had laid hold on Jeſus, led him away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Goe now, wretched Hypocrite, and rend thy garment; whilſt in the mean time thou art worthy to have thy Soul rent from thy body, for thy ſpightfull Blaſphemy againſt the Son of God. Onwards thy pretence is fair, and ſuch as cannot but receive applauſe from thy compacted crue; <hi>What need have we of witneſſes? behold, now ye have heard his Blaſphemy. What think ye? And they anſwered &amp; ſaid, He is guilty of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What heed is to be taken of mens judgment? So light are they upon the balance, that one dram of prejudice or foreſtalment turns the ſcales. Who were theſe but the grave Benchers of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Synod of the choice Rabbi's of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> yet theſe paſs ſentence againſt the Lord of Life; ſentence of that death of his, whereby (if ever) they ſhall be redeemed from the murther of their ſentence.</p>
            <p>O Saviour, this is not the laſt time wherein thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived cruel dooms from them that profeſs Learning and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:47750:224"/>
Holineſs. What wonder is it if thy weak members ſuffer that which was endured by ſo perfect an Head? What care we to be judged by man's day, when thou, who art the Righteous Judge of the world, wert thus misjudged by men? Now is the fury of thy malignant enemies let looſe upon thee: what meaſure can be too hard for him that is denounced worthy of death? Now thoſe foul mouths de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file thy Bleſſed Face with their impure ſpittle, the venomous froth of their malice; now thoſe cruell hands are lifted up to buffet thy Sacred Cheeks; now ſcorn and inſultation triumphs over thine humble Patience, <hi>Propheſy unto us, thou Chriſt, who it is that ſmote thee.</hi> O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> what a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is here of a Paſſion? There thou ſtandſt bound, condemned, ſpat upon, buffetted, derided by malicious ſinners. Thou art bound, who cameſt to looſe the bands of death; thou art condemned, whoſe ſentence muſt acquit the world; thou art ſpat upon, that art <hi>fairer then the ſons of men</hi>; thou art buffeted, <hi>in whoſe mouth was no guile</hi>; thou art derided, who <hi>art cloathed with Glory and Majeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean while, how can I enough wonder at thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy, who in the midſt of all theſe wofull indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties couldſt find a time to caſt thine eyes back upon thy frail and ingratefull Diſciple; and in whoſe gracious ear <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cock ſounded louder then all theſe reproaches? O Saviour, thou who in thine apprehenſion couldſt forget all thy dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, to correct and heal his over-laſhing, now in the heat of thy arraignment and condemnation canſt forget thy own miſery, to reclaim his errour; and by that ſeaſonable glance of thine eye, to ſtrike his heart with a needfull remorſe. He that was lately ſo valiant to fight for thee, now the next morning is ſo cowardly as to deny thee: He ſhrinks at the voice of a Maid, who was not daunted with the ſight of a Band. O <hi>Peter,</hi> had thy ſlip been ſudden, thy fall had been more eaſy: Premonition aggravates thy offence; that ſtone was foreſhew'd thee whereat thou ſtumbledſt: neither did thy warning more adde to thy guilt, then thine own
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:47750:224"/>
fore-reſolution. How didſt thou vow, though thou ſhouldſt die with thy Maſter, not to deny him? Hadſt thou ſaid nothing, but anſwered with a trembling ſilence, thy ſhame had been the leſs. Good purpoſes, when they are not held, do ſo far turn enemies to the entertainer of them, as that they help to double both his ſin and puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Yet a ſingle denial had been but eaſie; thine (I fear to ſpeak it) was lined with ſwearing and execration. Whence then, oh whence was this ſo vehement and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory diſclamation of ſo gracious a Maſter? What ſuch danger had attended thy profeſſion of his attendence? One of thy fellows was known to the High prieſt for a Follower of <hi>Jeſus</hi>; yet he not onely came himſelf into that open Hall, in view of the Bench, but treated with the Maid that kept the door to let thee in alſo. She knew him what he was; and could therefore ſpeak to thee, as brought in by his mediation, <hi>Art not thou alſo one of this man's Diſciples? Thou alſo</hi> ſuppoſes the firſt acknowledged ſuch; yet what crime, what danger was urged upon that noted Diſciple? What could have been more to thee? Was it that thy heart miſgave thee thou mighteſt be called to account for <hi>Malchus?</hi> It was no thank to thee that that ear was healed; neither did there want thoſe that would think how near that ear was to the head. Doubtleſs, that buſie fellow himſelf was not far off, and his fellows and kinſmen would have been apt enough to follow thee (beſides thy Diſcipleſhip) upon a bloudſhed, a riot, a reſcue. Thy conſcience hath made thee thus unduly timorous: and now, to be ſure to avoid the imputation of that affray, thou renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt all knowledge of him in whoſe cauſe thou foughteſt. Howſoever the ſin was hainous. I tremble at ſuch a Fall of ſo great an Apoſtle. It was thou, O <hi>Peter,</hi> that buffetedſt thy Maſter more then thoſe <hi>Jews</hi>; it was to thee that he turned the cheek from them, as to view him by whom he moſt ſmarted: he felt thee afar off, and
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:47750:225"/>
anſwered thee with a look; ſuch a look as was able to kill and revive at once. Thou haſt wounded me, (maiſt thou now ſay) O my Saviour, <hi>thou haſt wounded my heart with one of thine eyes:</hi> that one Eye of thy Mercy hath woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my heart with a deep remorſe for my grievous ſin, with an indignation at my unthankfulneſs; that one glance of thine hath reſolved me into the tears of ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. <hi>Oh that mine eyes were fountains,</hi> and my cheeks chanels that ſhall never be dried! <hi>And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.</hi>

            <p>WELL worthy were theſe <hi>Jews</hi> to be tributary; they had caſt off the yoke of their God, and had juſtly earned this <hi>Roman</hi> ſervitude. <hi>Tiberius</hi> had befriended them too well with ſo favourable a Governour as <hi>Pilate.</hi> Had they had the power of life and death in their hands, they had not been beholden to an Heathen for a Legall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I know not whether they more repine at this ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or pleaſe themſelves to think how cleanly they can ſhift off this bloud into another's hand. Theſe great Maſters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> flock from their own Conſiſtory to <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall: The Sentence had been theirs, the Execution muſt be his; and now they hope to bear down <hi>Jeſus</hi> with the ſtream of that frequent confluence.</p>
            <p>But what ails you, O ye Rulers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that ye ſtand thus thronging at the door? why do ye not go into that publick room of Judicature, to call for that Juſtice ye came for? Was it for that ye would not defile your ſelves with
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:47750:225"/>
the contagion of an Heathen roof? Holy men! your Conſciences would not ſuffer you to yield to ſo impure an act; your Paſſeover muſt be kept, your perſons muſt be clean: whilſt ye expect Juſtice from the man, ye abhor the pollution of the place. Woe to you Prieſts, Scribes, Elders, Hypocrites; can there be any roof ſo unclean as that of your own breaſts? Not <hi>Pilate</hi>'s walls, but your hearts are impure. Is Murther your errand? and do you ſtick at a locall infection? <hi>God ſhall ſmite</hi> you, ye <hi>whited walls.</hi> Do ye long to be ſtained with bloud, with the bloud of God? and do ye fear to be defiled with the touch of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s pavement? Doth ſo ſmall a Gnat ſtick in your throats, whilſt ye ſwallow ſuch a Camel of flagitious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs? Go out of your ſelves, ye falſe diſſemblers, if ye would not be unclean. <hi>Pilate,</hi> onwards, hath more cauſe to fear leſt his walls ſhould be defiled with the preſence of ſo prodigious Monſters of Impiety.</p>
            <p>That plauſible Governour condeſcends to humour their Superſtition: They dare not come in to him; he yields to go forth to them. Even <hi>Pilate</hi> begins juſtly, <hi>What accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bring you againſt this man?</hi> It is no judging of Religion by the outward demeanour of men; there is more Juſtice amongſt <hi>Romans</hi> then amongſt <hi>Jews.</hi> Theſe malicious Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi's thought it enough that they had ſentenced <hi>Jeſus</hi>; no more was now expected but a ſpeedy execution. <hi>If he were not a malefactour, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.</hi> Civill Juſtice muſt be their hangman. It is enough conviction that he is delivered up to the ſecular powers. Themſelves have judg'd, theſe other muſt kill. <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> have changed places: this Pagan ſpeaks that Law and Juſtice which that High prieſt ſhould have done; and that High prieſt ſpeaks thoſe murthering incongruities which would better have beſeemed the mouth of a Pagan. What needs any new triall? Doſt thou know, <hi>Pilate,</hi> who we are? Is this the honour that thou giveſt to our ſacred Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? Is this thy valuation of our Sanctity? Had the baſeſt
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:47750:226"/>
of the vulgar complained to thee, thou couldſt but have put them to a review: Our Place and Holineſs look'd not to be diſtruſted. If our ſcrupulous Conſciences ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect thy very walls, thou maiſt well think there is ſmall reaſon to ſuſpect our Conſciences. Upon a full hearing, ripe deliberation, and exquiſitely-judiciall proceeding, we have ſentenced this Malefactour to death; there needs no more from thee but thy command of Execution. Oh monſter, whether of Malice or Unjuſtice! Muſt he then be a Malefactour whom ye will condemn? Is your bare word ground enough to ſhed bloud? Whom did ye ever kill but the righteous? By whoſe hands periſhed the Prophets? The word was but miſtaken; ye ſhould have ſaid, <hi>If we had not been Malefactours, we had never deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up this innocent man unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt needs be notoriouſly unjuſt which very Nature hath taught Pagans to abhor. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſees and hates this bloudy ſuggeſtion and practice.
<q>Do ye pretend Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and urge ſo injurious a violence? If he be ſuch as ye accuſe him, where is his conviction? If he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be legally convicted, why ſhould he die? Do you think I may take your complaint for a crime? If I muſt judge for you, why have you judged for your ſelves? Could ye ſuppoſe that I would condemn any man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard? If your <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Laws yield you this liberty, the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws yield it not to me. It is not for me to judge after your laws, but after our own. Your prejudgment may not ſway me. Since ye have gone ſo far, be ye your own carvers of Juſtice; <hi>Take ye him, and judge him according to your Law.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>O <hi>Pilate,</hi> how happy had it been for thee, if thou hadſt held thee there? thus thou hadſt waſh'd thy hands more clean then in all thy baſons. Might Law have been the rule of this Judgment, and not Malice, this bloud had not been ſhed. How palpably doth their tongue bewray their heart? <hi>It is not lawfull for us to put any man to death.
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:47750:226"/>
Pilate</hi> talks of Judgment, they talk of Death. This was their onely aim: Law was but a colour, Judgment was but a ceremony; Death was their drift, and without this nothing. Bloud-thirſty Prieſts and Elders! it is well that this power of yours is reſtrained: no Innocence could have been ſafe, if your lawleſs will had had no limits. It were pity this ſword ſhould be in any but juſt and ſober hands. Your fury did not always conſult with Law: what Law allowed your violence to <hi>Stephen,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and your deadly attempts againſt this Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> whom ye now perſecute? How lawfull was it for you to procure that death which ye could not inflict? It is all the care of Hypocrites to ſeek umbrages and pretences for their hatefull purpoſes; and to make no other uſe of Laws (whether Divine or humane) but to ſerve turns.</p>
            <p>Where death is fore-reſolved, there cannot want ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations. Malice is not ſo barren as not to yield crimes enough. <hi>And they began to accuſe him, ſaying, We found this fellow perverting the nation; and forbidding to give tribute unto Caeſar, ſaying that he himſelf is Chriſt and King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>What accuſations ſaidſt thou, O <hi>Pilate?</hi> Hainous and capitall. Thou mighteſt have believed our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent intimation: but ſince thou wilt needs urge us to particulars, know that we come furniſhed with ſuch an inditement as ſhall make thine ears glow to hear it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that Blaſphemy whereof he hath been condemned by us, this man is a Seducer of the people, a raiſer of Sedition, an uſurper of Sovereignty.</q>
O impudent ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion! What marvell is it, O Saviour, if thine honeſt ſervants be loaded with ſlanders, when thy moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon eſcaped not ſo ſhamefull criminations? Thou a perverter of the Nation, who taughteſt the way of God truely? Thou a forbidder of Tribute, who pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt it, who preſcribedſt it, who provedſt it to be <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:47750:227"/>
due? Thou a challenger of temporall Sovereignty, who avoidedſt it, renouncedſt it, profeſſedſt to come to ſerve? Oh the forehead of Malice! Go, ye ſhameleſs traducers, and ſwear that Truth is guilty of all Falſhood, Juſtice of all Wrong; and that the Sun is the onely cauſe of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Fire of Cold.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Pilate</hi> ſtartles at the Charge. The name of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is in mention: Theſe potent ſpells can fetch him back to the common Hall, and call <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to the Bar. There, O Saviour, ſtandeſt thou meekly to be judged, who ſhalt once come to judge the quick and the dead. Then ſhall he before whom thou ſtoodeſt guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and dejected, ſtand before thy dreadfull Majeſty guilty and trembling.</p>
            <p>The name of a King, of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> is juſtly tender and awfull; the leaſt whiſper of an Uſurpation or diſturbance is entertained with a jealous care. <hi>Pilate</hi> takes this inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation at the firſt bound; <hi>Art thou then the King of the Jews?</hi> He felt his own free-hold now touched, it was time for him to ſtir. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Weeks were now famouſly known to be near expiring. Many arrogant and buſie ſpirits, (as <hi>Judas</hi> of <hi>Galilee, Theudas,</hi> and that <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Seducer) taking that advantage, had raiſed ſeverall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies, ſet up new titles to the Crown, gathered Forces to maintain their falſe claims. Perhaps <hi>Pilate</hi> ſuppoſed ſome ſuch buſineſs now on foot, and therefore asks ſo cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that was no leſs Wiſedom then Truth, thought it not beſt either to affirm or deny at once. Sometimes it may be extremely prejudiciall to ſpeak all truths. To diſclaim that Title ſuddenly which had been of old given him by the Prophets, at his Birth by the Eaſtern Sages, and now lately at his Proceſſion by the acclaiming multitude, had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to himſelf; to profeſs and challenge it abſolutely, had been unſafe, and needleſly provoking. By wiſe and juſt degrees therefore doth he ſo affirm this truth, that he
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:47750:227"/>
both ſatisfies the inquirer, and takes off all perill and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice from his aſſertion. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall know him a King; but ſuch a King as no King needs to fear, as all Kings ought to acknowledge and adore: <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world.</hi> It is your miſtaking, O ye earthly Potentates, that is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your fears. <hi>Herod</hi> hears of a King born, and is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; <hi>Pilate</hi> hears of a King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and is incenſed. Were ye not ignorant, ye could not be jealous: Had ye learned to diſtinguiſh of Kingdoms, theſe ſuſpicions would vaniſh.</p>
            <p>There are Secular Kingdoms, there are Spirituall; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe trenches upon other: your Kingdom is Secular, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s is Spirituall; both may, both muſt ſtand together. His Laws are Divine, yours civil: His Reign is eternall, yours temporall: the glory of his Rule is inward, and ſtands in the Graces of Sanctification, Love, Peace, Righteouſneſs, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; yours in outward pomp, riches, magnificence: His Enemies are the Devil, the World, the Fleſh; yours are bodily uſurpers, and externall peace-breakers: His Sword is the power of the Word and Spirit, yours materiall: His rule is over the Conſcience, yours o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bodies and lives: He puniſhes with Hell, ye with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall death or torture. Yea ſo far is he from oppoſing your Government, that <hi>by him</hi> ye <hi>Kings reign</hi>: Your Scepters are his; but to maintain, not to wield, not to reſiſt. O the unjuſt fears of vain men! He takes not away your earthly Kingdoms, who gives you Heavenly; he diſcrowns not the Body, who crowns the Soul; his intention is not to make you leſs great, but more happy.</p>
            <p>The charge is ſo fully anſwered, that <hi>Pilate</hi> acquits the priſoner. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Maſters ſtand ſtill without; their very malice dares not venture their pollution in going in to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their accuſation. <hi>Pilate</hi> hath examined him within; and now comes forth to theſe eager complainants, with a cold anſwer to their over-hot expectation; <hi>I find in him no fault at all.</hi> O noble teſtimony of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Innocence, from that mouth
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:47750:228"/>
which afterwards doomed him to death. What a difference there is betwixt a man as he is himſelf, and as he is the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of others wills? It is <hi>Pilate</hi>'s tongue that ſays, <hi>I find in him no fault at all:</hi> It is the <hi>Jews</hi> tongue in <hi>Pilate</hi>'s mouth that ſays, <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi> That cruel ſentence cannot blot him whom this atteſtation cleareth. Neither doth he ſay, I find him not guilty in that whereof he is accuſed; but gives an univerſall acquittance of the whole carriage of <hi>Chriſt, I find in him no fault at all.</hi> In ſpite of Malice, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence ſhall find abettours. Rather then <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall want witneſſes, the mouth of <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhall be opened to his juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. How did theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> bloud-ſuckers ſtand thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ſtricken with ſo unexpected a word? His abſolution was their death; his acquitall their conviction. <hi>No fault,</hi> when we have found Crimes? <hi>no fault at all,</hi> when we have condemned him for capitall offences? How palpably doth <hi>Pilate</hi> give us the lie? How ſhamefully doth he affront our authority and diſparage our juſtice? So ingenuous a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony doubtleſs exaſperated the fury of theſe <hi>Jews:</hi> the fire of their indignation was ſeven-fold more intended with the ſenſe of their repulſe.</p>
            <p>I tremble to think how juſt <hi>Pilate</hi> as yet was, and how ſoon after depraved; yea, how mercifull together with that Juſtice. How fain would he have freed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he found faultleſs? Corrupt cuſtome, in memory of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, allowed to gratify the <hi>Jews</hi> with the free delivery of ſome one priſoner. (Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition would be incroaching; the Paſchall Lamb was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument enough of that happy reſcue: men affect to have ſomething of their own.) <hi>Pilate</hi> was willing to take this advantage of diſmiſſing <hi>Jeſus.</hi> That he might be the more likely to prevail, he propoſeth him with the choice and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of ſo notorious a Malefactour, as he might juſtly think uncapable of all mercy; <hi>Barabbas,</hi> a Thief, a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, a Seditionary; infamous for all, odious to all. Had he propounded ſome other innocent priſoner, he might have
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:47750:228"/>
feared the election would be doubtfull; he cannot miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt the competition of ſo prodigious a Malefactour. <hi>Then they all cried again, Not him, but Barabbas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Malice beyond all example ſhameleſs and bloudy! Who can but bluſh to think that an Heathen ſhould ſee <hi>Jews</hi> ſo impetuouſly unjuſt, ſo ſavagely cruell? He knew there was no Fault to be found in <hi>Jeſus</hi>; he knew there was no Crime that was not to be found in <hi>Barabbas:</hi> yet he hears (and bluſhes to hear) them ſay, <hi>Not him, but Barabbas.</hi> Was not this (think we) out of ſimilitude of condition? Every thing affects the like to it ſelf; every thing affects the preſervation of that it liketh. What wonder is it then if ye <hi>Jews,</hi> who profeſs your ſelves the murtherers of that Juſt One, favour a <hi>Barabbas?</hi> O Saviour, what a killing indignity was this for thee to hear from thine own Nation? Haſt thou refuſed all Glory, to put on ſhame and miſery for their ſakes? Haſt thou diſregarded thy Bleſſed ſelf, to ſave them? and do they refuſe thee for <hi>Barabbas?</hi> Haſt thou ſaid, Not Heaven, but Earth; not Sovereignty, but Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; not the Gentile, but the <hi>Jew?</hi> and do they ſay, Not him, but <hi>Barabbas? Do ye thus requite the Lord, O ye foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh people</hi> and unjuſt? Thus were thine ears and thine eyes firſt crucified; and through them was thy Soul wounded e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to death, before thy death; whilſt thou ſaweſt their rage, and heardſt their noiſe of <hi>Crucify, crucify.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pilate</hi> would have chaſtiſed thee. Even that had been a cruel mercy from him; for what evil hadſt thou done? But that cruelty had been true mercy to this of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom no bloud would ſatisfy but that of thy heart. He calls for thy Fault, they call for thy Puniſhment; as proclaiming thy Crucifixion is not intended to ſatisfy Juſtice, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, <hi>They cried the more, Crucify him, Crucify him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As their clamour grew, ſo the Preſident's Juſtice declined. Thoſe Graces that lie looſe and ungrounded, are eaſily waſht away with the firſt tide of Popularity. Thrice had that man proclaimed the Innocence of him whom he now
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:47750:229"/>
inclines to condemn, <hi>willing to content the people.</hi> Oh the fooliſh aims of Ambition! Not God, not his Conſcience come into any regard; but the People. What a baſe Idol doth the proud man adore? even the Vulgar, which a baſe man deſpiſeth. What is their applauſe but an idle wind? what is their anger but a painted fire? O <hi>Pilate,</hi> where now is thy ſelf and thy people? whereas a good conſcience would have ſtuck by thee for ever, and have given thee boldneſs before the face of that God which thou and thy people ſhall never have the Happineſs to behold.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> have play'd their firſt part; the Gentiles muſt now act theirs. Cruell <hi>Pilate,</hi> who knew <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for envy,</hi> accuſed falſly, maliciouſly purſued, hath turned his profered chaſtiſement into ſcourging. <hi>Then Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late took Jeſus and ſcourged him.</hi> Woe is me, dear Saviour; I feel thy laſhes; I ſhrink under thy painfull whippings; thy nakedneſs covers me with ſhame and confuſion. That tender and precious body of thine is galled and torn with cords. Thou that didſt of late water the garden of <hi>Geth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemani</hi> with the drops of thy bloudy ſweat, doſt now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew the pavement of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s Hall with the ſhowrs of thy bloud. How fully haſt thou made good thy word, <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting?</hi> How can I be enough ſenſible of my own ſtripes? theſe blows are mine; both my ſins have given them, and they give remedies to my ſins. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes are we healed.</hi> O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> why ſhould I think ſtrange to be ſcourged with tongue or hand, when I ſee thee bleeding? what laſhes can I fear either from Heaven or earth, ſince thy ſcourges have been born for me, and have ſanctified them to me? Now, dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> what a world of inſolent reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, indignities, tortures, arr thou entring into? To an ingenuous and tender diſpoſition ſcorns are torment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:47750:229"/>
but here pain helps to perfect thy miſery, their deſpight.</p>
            <p>Who ſhould be actours in this whole bloudy execution, but grim and barbarous Souldiers, men inured to cruelty, in whoſe faces were written the characters of Murther, whoſe very trade was killing, and whoſe looks were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prevent their hands? Theſe, for the greater ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of their concourſe, are called together; and whether by the connivence or the command of their wicked Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or by the inſtigation of the malicious <hi>Jews</hi> conſpire to anticipate his death with ſcorns, which they will after inflict with violence.</p>
            <p>O my Bleſſed Saviour, was it not enough that thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Body was ſtripped of thy garments, and waled with bloudy ſtripes; but that thy Perſon muſt be made the moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king-ſtock of thine inſulting enemies, thy Back diſguiſed with purple robes, thy Temples wounded with a thorny Crown, thy Face ſpat upon, thy Cheeks buffetted, thy Head ſmitten, thy Hand ſceptred with a reed, thy Self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided with wry mouths, bended knees, ſcoffing acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Inſolent Souldiers! whence is all this jeering and ſport, but to flout Majeſty? All theſe are the ornaments and ceremonies of a Royall Inauguration, which now in ſcorn ye caſt upon my deſpiſed Saviour. Goe on, make your ſelves merry with this jolly paſtime. Alas! long agoe ye now feel whom ye ſcorned. Is he a King, think you, whom ye thus play'd upon? Look upon him with gnaſhing and horrour, whom ye look'd at with mockage and inſultation. Was not that Head fit for your Thorns, which you now ſee crowned with Glory and Majeſty? Was not that Hand fit for a Reed, whoſe iron Scepter cruſhes you to death? Was not that Face fit to be ſpat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the dreadfull aſpect whereof ye are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the mountains to cover you?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, whither, O whither doſt thou ſtoop, O thou coeternal Son of thine eternal Father? whither doſt
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:47750:230"/>
thou abaſe thy ſelf for me? I have ſinned, and thou art puniſhed; I have exalted my ſelf, and thou art dejected; I have clad my ſelf with ſhame, and thou art ſtripped; I have made my ſelf naked, and thou art cloathed with robes of diſhonour; my head hath deviſed evil, and thine is pierced with thorns; I have ſmitten thee, and thou art ſmitten for me; I have diſhonoured thee, and thou for my ſake art ſcorned; thou art made the ſport of men for me, that have deſerved to be inſulted on by Devils.</p>
            <p>Thus diſguiſed, thus bleeding, thus mangled, thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed art thou brought forth, whether for compaſſion, or for a more univerſall deriſion, to the furious multitude, with an <hi>Ecce homo, Behold the man:</hi> look upon him, O ye mercileſs <hi>Jews</hi>; ſee him in his ſhame, in his wounds and bloud, and now ſee whether ye think him miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Ye ſee his Face blew and black with buffeting, his Eyes ſwoln, his Cheeks beſlabbered with ſpittle, his Skin torn with ſcourges, his whole Body bathed in bloud; and would ye yet have more? <hi>Behold the man</hi>; the man whom ye envied for his greatneſs, whom ye feared for his uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation: Doth he not look like a King? is he not royally dreſſed? See whether his magnificence do not command reverence from you. Would ye wiſh a finer King? Are ye not afraid he will wreſt the Scepter out of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s hand? <hi>Behold the man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea, and behold him well, O thou proud <hi>Pilate,</hi> O ye cruel Souldiers, O ye inſatiable <hi>Jews.</hi> Ye ſee him baſe, whom ye ſhall ſee glorious; the time ſhall ſurely come wherein ye ſhall ſee him in another dreſs: he ſhall ſhine whom ye now ſee to bleed; his Crown cannot be now ſo ignominious and painfull, as it ſhall be once majeſtical and precious; ye who now bend your knees to him in ſcorn, ſhall ſee all knees both in Heaven and in earth and under the earth to bow before him in an awfull adoration; ye that now ſee him with contempt, ſhall behold him with horrour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="455" facs="tcp:47750:230"/>What an inward war do I yet find in the breaſt of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late?</hi> His Conſcience bids him ſpare, his Popularity bids him kill. His Wife, warned by a Dream, warns him to <hi>have no hand in the bloud of that juſt man</hi>; the importunate multitude preſſes him for a ſentence of death. All ſhifts have been tried to free the man whom he hath pronounced innocent: All violent motives are urged to condemn that man whom malice pretends guilty.</p>
            <p>In the height of this ſtrife, when Conſcience and moral Juſtice were ready to ſway <hi>Pilate</hi>'s diſtracted heart to a juſt diſmiſſion, I hear the <hi>Jews</hi> cry out, <hi>If thou let this man goe, thou art not Caeſar's friend.</hi> There is the word that ſtrikes it dead: it is now no time to demur any more. In vain ſhall we hope that a carnal heart can prefer the care of his Soul to the care of his ſafety and honour, God to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Now <hi>Jeſus</hi> muſt die: <hi>Pilate</hi> haſts into the Judgment-hall; the Sentence ſticks no longer in his teeth, <hi>Let him be crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet how foul ſo ever his Soul ſhall be with this fact, his hands ſhall be clean. <hi>He took water and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am innocent of the bloud of this juſt perſon: ſee ye to it.</hi> Now all is ſafe I wis: this is expiation enough; water can waſh off bloud, the hands can cleanſe the heart: proteſt thou art innocent, and thou canſt not be guilty. Vain Hypocrite! canſt thou think to ſcape ſo? Is Murther of no deeper dye? Canſt thou dream waking, thus to avoid the charge of thy wife's dream? Is the guilt of the bloud of the Son of God to be wip'd off with ſuch eaſe? What poor ſhifts do fooliſh ſinners make to beguile themſelves? Any thing will ſerve to charm the Conſcience, when it liſts to ſleep.</p>
            <p>But, Oh Saviour, whilſt <hi>Pilate</hi> thinks to waſh off the guilt of thy bloud with water, I know there is nothing that can waſh off the guilt of this his ſin but thy bloud. Oh do thou waſh my Soul in that precious bathe, and I ſhall be clean. Oh <hi>Pilate,</hi> if that very bloud which thou
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:47750:231"/>
ſheddeſt do not waſh off the guilt of thy bloudſhed, thy water doth but more defile thy Soul, and intend that fire wherewith thou burneſt.</p>
            <p>Little did the deſperate <hi>Jews</hi> know the weight of that bloud, which they were ſo forward to wiſh upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their children. Had they deprecated their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in that horrible murther, they could not ſo eaſily have avoided the vengeance: but now that they fetch it upon themſelves by a willing execration, what ſhould I ſay, but that they long for a curſe? it is pity they ſhould not be miſerable. And have ye not now felt, O Nation worthy of plagues, have ye not now felt what bloud it was whoſe guilt ye affected? Sixteen hundred years are now paſſed ſince you wiſhed your ſelves thus wretched: have ye not been ever ſince the hate and ſcorn of the world? Did ye not live (many of you) to ſee your City buried in aſhes, and drowned in bloud? to ſee your ſelves no Nation? Was there ever people under Heaven that was made ſo famous a ſpectacle of miſery and deſolation? Have ye yet enough of that bloud which ye called for upon your ſelves and your children? Your former Cruelties, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſes, Idolatries coſt you but ſome ſhort Captivities; God cannot but be juſt: this Sin, under which you now lie groaning and forlorn, muſt needs be ſo much greater then theſe, as your vaſtation is more; and what can that be other then the murther of the Lord of Life? Ye have what ye wiſht: be miſerable till ye be penitent.</p>

            <head>XLIX. The Crucifixion.</head>
            <p>THE ſentence of Death is paſt, and now who can with dry eyes behold the ſad pomp of my Saviour's bloudy execution? All the ſtreets are full of gazing ſpectatours, waiting for this ruefull ſight. At laſt, O Saviour, there thou comeſt out of <hi>Pilate</hi>'s gate, bearing that which ſhall ſoon bear thee. To expect thy Croſs was not torment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; thou muſt carry it. All this while thou ſhalt not onely ſee, but feel thy death before it come; and muſt help to be an agent in thine own Paſſion. It was not out of favour, that, thoſe ſcornfull robes being ſtripped off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thou art led to death in thine own cloaths. So was thy face beſmeared with bloud, ſo ſwoln and diſcoloured with buffettings, that thou couldſt not have been known but by thy wonted habit. Now thine inſulting enemies are ſo much more imperiouſly cruell, as they are more ſure of their ſucceſs. Their mercileſs tormentings have made thee half dead already: yet now, as if they had done nothing, they begin afreſh; and will force thy weakned and fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature to new tasks of pain. The tranſverſe of thy Croſs (at leaſt) is upon thy ſhoulder: when thou canſt ſcarce goe, thou muſt carry. One kicks thee with his foot, another ſtrikes thee with his ſtaff, another drags thee haſtily by thy cord, and more then one ſpur on thine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitied wearineſs with angry commands of haſte. Oh true form and ſtate of a ſervant! All thy former actions, O Saviour, were (though painfull, yet) free; this, as it is in it ſelf ſervile, ſo it is tyrannouſly inforced: Inforced yet more upon thee by thy own Love to mankind, then by their power and deſpight. It was thy Father that
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:47750:232"/>
               <hi>laid upon</hi> thee <hi>the iniquity of us all:</hi> It was thine own Mercy that cauſed thee to bear our ſins upon the Croſs, and to bear the Croſs (with the curſe annexed to it) for our ſins. How much more voluntary muſt that needs be in thee, which thou requireſt to be voluntarily undertaken by us? It was thy charge, <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs, and follow me.</hi> Thou didſt not ſay, Let him bear his croſs as forceably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by another; but, <hi>Let him take up his croſs,</hi> as his free burthen: free in reſpect of his heart, not in reſpect of his hand: ſo free, that he ſhall willingly undergoe it, when it is laid upon him; not ſo free as that he ſhall lay it upon himſelf unrequired. O Saviour, thou didſt not ſnatch the Croſs out of the Souldiers hands, and caſt it upon thy ſhoulder; but when they laid it on thy neck, thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wenteſt it. The conſtraint was theirs, the will was thine. It was not ſo heavy to them, or to <hi>Simon,</hi> as it was to thee: they felt nothing but the wood, thou felteſt it clogged with the load of the ſins of the whole world. No marvell if thou faintedſt under that ſad burthen; thou that beareſt up the whole earth by thy word, didſt ſweat, and pant, and groan under this unſupportable carriage. O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how could I be confounded in my ſelf to ſee thee, after ſo much loſs of bloud and over-toiledneſs of pain, languiſhing under that fatal Tree! And yet why ſhould it more trouble me to ſee thee ſinking under thy Croſs now, then to ſee thee anon hanging upon thy Croſs? In both thou wouldſt render thy ſelf weak and miſerable, that thou mighteſt ſo much the more glorify thy infinite mercy in ſuffering.</p>
            <p>It is not out of any compaſſion of thy miſery, or care of thine eaſe, that <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> is forced to be the porter of thy Croſs; it was out of their own eagerneſs of thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch: thy feeble paces were too ſlow for their purpoſe; their thirſt after thy bloud made them impatient of delay. If thou have wearily ſtruggled with the burthen of thy ſhame all along the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when thou comeſt once
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:47750:232"/>
paſt the gates, an helper ſhall be deputed to thee: the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of thy death was more ſweet to them, then the pain of a lingring paſſage. What thou ſaidſt to <hi>Judas,</hi> they ſay to the Executioner, <hi>What thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> Whilſt thou yet liveſt, they cannot be quiet, they cannot be ſafe: to haſten thine end, they lighten thy carriage.</p>
            <p>Hadſt thou done this out of choice which thou didſt out of conſtraint, how I ſhould have envied thee, O <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> as too happy in the honour to be the firſt man that bore that Croſs of thy Saviour, wherein millions of bleſſed Martyrs have (ſince that time) been ambitious to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thee? Thus to bear thy Croſs for thee, O Saviour, was more then to bear a Crown from thee. Could I be worthy to be thus graced by thee, I ſhould pity all other glories.</p>
            <p>Whilſt thou thus paſſeſt, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> the ſtreets and ways reſound not all with one note. If the malicious <hi>Jews</hi> and cruell Souldiers inſulted upon thee, and either haled or railed thee on with a bitter violence, thy faithfull Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were no leſs loud in their moans and ejulations; neither would they endure that the noiſe of their cries and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be drowned with the clamour of thoſe reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: but eſpecially thy Bleſſed Mother, and thoſe other zealous aſſociates of her own ſex, were moſt paſſionate in their wailings. And why ſhould I think that all that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout multitude which ſo lately cried <hi>Hoſanna</hi> in the ſtreets, did not alſo bear their part in theſe publick condolings? Though it had not concerned thy ſelf, O Saviour, thine ears had been ſtill more open to the voice of grief then of malice: and ſo thy lips alſo are open to the one, ſhut to the other. <hi>Daughters of Jeruſalem, weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves and for your children.</hi> Who would not have thought, O Saviour, that thou ſhouldſt have been wholly taken up with thine own ſorrows? The expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo bitter a Death had been enough to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed any Soul but thine: yet even now can thy gracious
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:47750:233"/>
eye find time to look beyond thine own miſeries, at theirs; and to pity them, who, inſenſible of their own inſuing condition, mourned for thine now preſent. They ſee thine extremity, thou foreſeeſt theirs; they pour out their ſorrow upon thee, thou diverteſt it upon themſelves. We ſilly creatures walk blindfolded in this vale of tears, and little know what evil is towards us: onely what we feel we know; and whilſt we feel nothing, can find leiſure to beſtow our commiſeration on thoſe who need it perhaps leſs then our ſelves. Even now, O Saviour, when thou wert within the view of thy <hi>Calvary,</hi> thou canſt foreſee and pity the vaſtation of thy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; and giveſt a ſad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the imminent deſtruction of that City which lately had coſt thee tears, and now ſhall coſt thee bloud. It is not all the indign cruelty of men that can rob thee of thy Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> could not want Malefactours, though <hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> was diſmiſſed. That all this execution might ſeem to be done out of the zeal of Juſtice, two capital offenders, adjudged to their Gibbet, ſhall accompany thee, O Saviour, both to thy death, and in it. They are led manicled after thee, as leſs criminous: no ſtripes had diſabled them from bearing their own Croſſes. Long agoe was this unmeet ſociety foretold by thine Evangelical Seer, <hi>He was taken from priſon and from judgment; He was cut out of the land of the living; He made his grave with the Wicked.</hi> O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> it had been diſparagement enough to thee to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beſt of men, (ſince there is much ſin in the perfecteſt, and there could be no ſin in thee;) but to be matched with the ſcum of mankind, whom vengeance would not let to live, is ſuch an indignity as confounds my thoughts. Surely there is no Angel in Heaven but would have been proud to attend thee; and what could the earth afford worthy of thy train? yet malice hath ſuited thee with company next to Hell; that their viciouſneſs might reflect upon thee, and their ſin might ſtain thine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:47750:233"/>
Ye are deceived, O ye fond Judges: This is the way to grace your dying malefactours; this is not the way to diſgrace him whoſe guiltleſneſs and perfection triumph'd over your injuſtice: his preſence was able to make your Thieves happy; their preſence could no more blemiſh him then your own. Thus guarded, thus attended, thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied art thou, Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> led to that loathſome and infamous hill, which now thy laſt bloud ſhall make Sacred: now thou ſetteſt thy foot upon that riſing ground which ſhall prevent thine <hi>Olivet,</hi> whence thy Soul ſhall firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into thy Glory.</p>
            <p>There whilſt thou art dreſſing thy ſelf for thy laſt Act, thou art preſented with that bitter and farewell-potion wherewith dying Malefactours were wont to have their ſenſes ſtupified, that they might not feel the torments of their execution. It was but the common mercy of men to alleviate the death of Offenders; ſince the intent of their laſt doom is not ſo much pain, as diſſolution.</p>
            <p>That draught, O Saviour, was not more welcome to the guilty then hatefull unto thee. In the vigour of all thine inward and outward ſenſes thou wouldſt incounter the moſt violent aſſaults of death, and ſcornedſt to abate the leaſt touch of thy quickeſt apprehenſion. Thou well kneweſt that the work thou wenteſt about would require the uſe of all thy powers; it was not thine eaſe that thou ſoughteſt, but our Redemption; neither meanteſt thou to yield to thy laſt enemy, but to reſiſt and to overcome him: which that thou mighteſt doe the more gloriouſly, thou challengedſt him to doe his worſt; and in the mean time wouldſt not disfurniſh thy ſelf of any of thy power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full faculties. This greateſt combat that ever was ſhall be fought on even hand: neither wouldſt thou ſteal that Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which thou now atchievedſt over Death and Hell. Thou didſt but touch at this cup; it is a far bitterer then this that thou art now drinking up to the dregs: thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedſt that which was offered thee by men, but that which
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:47750:234"/>
was mixed by thine eternal Father (though mere Gall and Wormwood) thou didſt drink up to the laſt drop. And therein, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> lies all our health and ſalvation. I know not whether I do more ſuffer in thy pain, or joy in the iſſue of thy Suffering.</p>
            <p>Now, even now, O Saviour, art thou entring into thoſe dreadfull liſts, and now thou art grappling with thy laſt enemy; as if thou hadſt not ſuffered till now, now thy bloudy Paſſion begins: a cruell expoliation begins that violence. Again do theſe grim and mercileſs Souldiers lay their rude hands upon thee, and ſtrip thee naked; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain are thoſe bleeding wales lay'd open to all eyes; again muſt thy Sacred Body undergoe the ſhame of an abhorred nakedneſs. Lo, thou that cloatheſt man with raiment, beaſts with hides, fiſhes with ſcales and ſhells, earth with flowers, Heaven with Stars, art deſpoiled of cloaths, and ſtandeſt expoſed to the ſcorn of all beholders. As the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> entred into his Paradiſe, ſo doſt thou (the Second <hi>Adam</hi>) into thine, naked; and as the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was cloathed with Innocence when he had no cloaths, ſo wert thou (the Second) too: and more then ſo; thy naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, O Saviour, cloaths our Souls not with Innocence one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but with Beauty. Hadſt not thou been naked, we had been cloathed with confuſion. O happy nakedneſs, whereby we are covered from ſhame! O happy ſhame, whereby we are inveſted with glory! All the beholders ſtand wrapped with warm garments; thou onely art ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to tread the wine-preſs alone. How did thy Bleſſed Mother now wiſh her veil upon thy ſhoulders? and that Diſciple who lately ran from thee naked, wiſh'd in vain that his loving pity might doe that for thee, which fear for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Shame is ſucceeded with Pain. Oh the torment of the Croſs! Methinks I ſee and feel how, having faſtned the tranſverſe to the body of that fatal Tree, and laid it upon the ground, they racked and ſtrained thy tender and ſacred
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:47750:234"/>
Lims, to fit the extent of their fore-appointed meaſure; and having tentered out thine arms beyond their natural reach, how they faſtned them with cords, till thoſe ſtrong iron nails (which were driven up to the head, through the palms of thy Bleſſed hands) had not more firmly then painfully fixed thee to the Gibbet. The tree is raiſed up, and now not without a vehement concuſſion ſettled in the mortiſe. Woe is me! how are thy joynts and ſinews torn, and ſtretched till they crack again, by this torturing diſtenſion? how doth thine own weight torment thee, whilſt thy whole body reſts upon this forced and dolorous hold, till thy nailed feet bear their part in a no-leſs-afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſupportation? How did the rough iron pierce thy Soul, whilſt, paſſing through thoſe tender and ſenſible parts, it carried thy fleſh before it, and as it were rivetted it to that ſhamefull Tree?</p>
            <p>There now, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> there thou hangeſt between Heaven and earth, naked, bleeding, forlorn, deſpicable, the ſpectacle of miſeries, the ſcorn of men. Be abaſhed, O ye Heavens and earth, and all ye creatures wrap up your ſelves in horrour and confuſion, to ſee the ſhame and pain and curſe of your moſt pure and Omnipotent Creatour. How could ye ſubſiſt, whilſt he thus ſuffers in whom ye are? O Saviour, didſt thou take fleſh for our Redemption, to be thus indignly uſed, thus mangled, thus tortured? Was this meaſure fit to be offered to that Sacred Body that was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt of the pure ſubſtance of an immaculate Virgin? Woe is me! that which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted with ſin, is all blemiſhed with humane cruelty, and ſo wofully disfigured, that the Bleſſed Mother that bore thee could not now have known thee; ſo bloudy were thy Temples, ſo ſwoln and diſcoloured was thy Face, ſo was the Skin of thy whole body ſtreaked with red and blew ſtripes, ſo did thy thorny diadem ſhade thine Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Countenance, ſo did the ſtreams of thy bloud cover and deform all thy Parts. The eye of Senſe could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:47750:235"/>
thee, O dear Saviour, in the neareſt proximity to thy Croſs: the eye of Faith ſees thee in all this diſtance; and by how much more ignominy, deformity, pain it finds in thee, ſo much more it admires the glory of thy mercy. Alas! is this the Head that is decked by thine eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Crown of pure gold, of immortall and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible Majeſty, which is now buſhed with thorns? Is this the Eye that ſaw the Heavens opened, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcending upon that Head, that ſaw ſuch reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Heavenly brightneſs on mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> which now begins to be overclouded with death? Are theſe the Ears that heard the voice of thy Father owning thee out of Heaven, which now tingle with buffettings, and glow with reproaches, and bleed with thorns? Are theſe the Lips that <hi>ſpake as never man ſpake, full of grace and power,</hi> that called out dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that ejected the ſtubborneſt Devils, that commanded the cure of all diſeaſes, which now are ſwoln with blows, and diſcoloured with blewneſs and bloud? Is this the Face that ſhould be <hi>fairer then the ſons of men,</hi> which the Angels of Heaven ſo deſired to ſee, and can never be ſatisfied with ſeeing, that is thus foul with the naſty mixtures of ſweat, and bloud, and ſpittings on? Are theſe the Hands that <hi>ſtretched out the Heavens as a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> that by their touch healed the lame, the deaf, the blind, which are now bleeding with the nails? Are theſe the Feet which walked lately upon the liquid pavement of the ſea, before whoſe footſtool all the Nations of the earth are bidden to worſhip, that are now ſo painfully fixed to the Croſs? O cruell and unthankfull mankind, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch meaſure to the Lord of Life! O infinitely-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Saviour, that wouldſt ſuffer all this for unthankfull mankind! That fiends ſhould doe theſe things to guilty ſouls, it is (though terrible, yet) juſt; but that men ſhould doe thus to the Bleſſed Son of God, it is beyond the capacity of our horrour.</p>
            <p>Even the moſt hoſtile diſpoſitions have been onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:47750:235"/>
to kill; Death hath ſated the moſt eager malice: thine enemies, O Saviour, held not themſelves ſatisfied, unleſs they might enjoy thy torment. Two Thieves are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be thy companions in death; thou art deſigned to the midſt, as the chief malefactour: on whether hand ſoever thou lookeſt, thine eye meets with an hatefull partner. But, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how ſhall I enough admire and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate thy infinite Mercy, who madeſt ſo happy an uſe of this <hi>Jewiſh</hi> deſpight, as to improve it to the occaſion of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of one, and the comfort of millions? Is not this, as the laſt, ſo the greateſt ſpecialty of thy wonderfull compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to convert that dying Thief? with thoſe nailed hands to ſnatch a Soul out of the mouth of Hell? Lord, how I bleſs thee for this work? how do I ſtand amazed at this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other the demonſtrations of thy Goodneſs and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? The Offender came to die: nothing was in his thoughts but his guilt and torment: <hi>whilſt he was yet in his bloud,</hi> thou <hi>ſaidſt, This Soul ſhall live.</hi> Ere yet the intoxicating Potion could have time to work upon his brain, thy Spirit infuſes Faith into his heart. He that before had nothing in his eye but preſent death and torture, is now lifted up above his Croſs in a bleſſed ambition; <hi>Lord, remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom.</hi> Is this the voice of a Thief, or of a Diſciple? Give me leave, O Saviour, to borrow thine own words; <hi>Verily I have not found ſo great faith, no not in all Iſrael.</hi> He ſaw thee hanging miſerably by him, and yet ſtyles thee <hi>Lord</hi>; he ſaw thee dying, yet talks of thy <hi>Kingdom</hi>; he felt himſelf dying, yet talks of a future <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance.</hi> O Faith ſtronger then death, that can look beyond the Croſs at a Crown; beyond diſſolution at a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Life and Glory! Which of thine eleven were heard to ſpeak ſo gracious a word to thee in theſe thy laſt pangs? After thy Reſurrection and knowledge of thine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible condition it was not ſtrange for them to talk of thy Kingdom; but in the midſt of thy ſhamefull death, for a dying malefactour to ſpeak of thy reigning, and to implore
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:47750:236"/>
thy remembrance of himſelf in thy Kingdom, it is ſuch an improvement of Faith as raviſheth my Soul with admiration. O bleſſed Thief, that haſt thus happily ſtoln Heaven! How worthy hath thy Saviour made thee to be a partner of his ſufferings, a pattern of undauntable belief, a ſpectacle of unſpeakable mercy? <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe.</hi> Before I wondred at thy Faith; now I envy at thy Felicity. Thou cravedſt a remembrance; thy Saviour ſpeaks of a preſent poſſeſſion, <hi>This day:</hi> thou ſuedſt for remembrance as a favour to the abſent; thy Saviour ſpeaks of thy preſence with him: thou ſpakeſt of a Kingdom; thy Saviour of Paradiſe. As no Diſciple could be more faithfull, ſo no Saint could be happier. O Saviour, what a precedent is this of thy free and powerfull grace? Where thou wilt give, what unworthineſs can bar us from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? when thou wilt give, what time can prejudice our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? who can deſpair of thy goodneſs, when he that in the morning was poſting towards Hell, is in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with thee in Paradiſe? Lord, he could not have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken this to thee, but by thee, and from thee. What poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility was there for a Thief to think of thy Kingdom, without thy Spirit? That good Spirit of thine breathed upon this man, breathed not upon his fellow; their trade was alike, their ſin was alike, their ſtate alike, their croſs alike, onely thy Mercy makes them unlike: <hi>One</hi> is <hi>taken, the other</hi> is <hi>refuſed.</hi> Bleſſed be thy Mercy in taking one; bleſſed be thy Juſtice in leaving the other. Who can deſpair of that Mercy? who cannot but tremble at that Juſtice?</p>
            <p>Now, O ye cruell Prieſts and Elders of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ye have full leiſure to feed your eyes with the ſight ye ſo much longed for; there is the bloud ye purchaſed: and is not your malice yet glutted? Is not all this enough, without your taunts and ſcoffs and ſports at ſo exquiſite a miſery? The people, the paſſengers are taught to inſult, where they ſhould pity. Every man hath a ſcorn ready to caſt at a dying innocent. A generous nature is more wounded
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:47750:236"/>
with the tongue, then with the hand. O Saviour, thine ear was more painfully pierced then thy brows, or hands, or feet. It could not but goe deep into thy Soul, to hear theſe bitter and girding reproaches from them thou cameſt to ſave.</p>
            <p>But, alas! what flea-bitings were theſe in compariſon of thoſe inward torments which thy Soul felt in the ſenſe and apprehenſion of thy Father's wrath for the ſins of the whole world, which now lay heavy upon thee for ſatisfaction? This, oh this was it that preſſed thy Soul as it were to the neathermoſt Hell. Whilſt thine Eternall Father look'd lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly upon thee, what didſt thou, what neededſt thou to care for the frowns of men or Devils? but when he once turn'd his face from thee, or bent his brows upon thee, this, this was worſe then death. It is no marvell now, if darkneſs were upon the face of the whole earth, when thy Father's Face was eclipſed from thee by the interpoſition of our ſins. How ſhould there be light in the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, when the God of the world, the Father of lights, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the want of light within? That word of thine, O Saviour, was enough to fetch the Sun down out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to diſſolve the whole frame of Nature, when thou criedſt, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Oh what pangs were theſe, dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> that drew from thee this complaint? Thou well kneweſt nothing could be more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall to thine enemies, then to hear this ſad language from thee: they could ſee but the outſide of thy ſufferings; never could they have conceived ſo deep an anguiſh of thy Soul, if thy own lips had not expreſſed it. Yet, as not regarding their triumph, thou thus poureſt out thy ſorrow: and when ſo much is uttered, who can conceive what is felt?</p>
            <p>How is it then with thee, O Saviour, that thou thus aſtoniſheſt men and Angels with ſo wofull a quiritation? Had thy God left thee? Thou not long ſince ſaidſt, <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> Are ye now ſevered? Let this thought be as far from my Soul, as my Soul from Hell. No more
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:47750:237"/>
can thy Bleſſed Father be ſeparated from thee, then from his own Eſſence. His Union with thee is eternall; his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was intercepted: He could not withdraw his Preſence, he would withdraw the influence of his comfort. Thou, the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> ſtoodſt for mankind upon this Tree of the Croſs, as the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood and fell for mankind under the Tree of offence. Thou bareſt our ſins; thy Father ſaw us in thee, and would puniſh us in thee, thee for us: how could he but withhold comfort, where he intended chaſtiſement? Herein therefore he ſeems to forſake thee for the preſent, in that he would not deliver thee from that bitter Paſſion which thou wouldſt undergoe for us. O Saviour, hadſt thou not been thus forſaken, we had periſhed; thy dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction is our ſafety: and however our narrow Souls are not capable of the conceit of thy pain and horrour; yet we know there can be no danger in the forſaking, whilſt thou canſt ſay, <hi>My God.</hi> He is ſo thy God as he cannot be ours: all our right is by Adoption, thine by Nature; thou art one with him in eternall Eſſence, we come in by Grace and mercifull election: yet whilſt thou ſhalt enable me to ſay, <hi>My God,</hi> I ſhall hope never to ſink under thy deſertions.</p>
            <p>But whilſt I am tranſported with the ſenſe of thy Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, O Saviour, let me not forget to admire thoſe ſweet Mercies of thine which thou pouredſt out upon thy Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutours. They rejoyce in thy death, and triumph in thy miſery, and ſcoff at thee in both: In ſtead of calling down fire from Heaven upon them, thou heapeſt coals of fire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads. <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they doe.</hi> They blaſpheme thee, thou prayeſt for them; they ſcorn, thou pitieſt; they ſin againſt thee, thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt for their forgiveneſs; they profeſs their malice, thou pleadeſt their ignorance. O compaſſion without exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, without meaſure, fit for the Son of God, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of men! Wicked and fooliſh <hi>Jews!</hi> ye would be miſerable, he will not let you: ye would fain pull upon your ſelves the guilt of his bloud, he deprecates it: ye kill,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:47750:237"/>
he ſues for your remiſſion and life. His tongue cries lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then his bloud; <hi>Father, forgive them.</hi> O Saviour, thou couldſt not but be heard. Thoſe who out of ignorance and ſimplicity thus perſecuted thee, find the happy iſſue of thine interceſſion. Now I ſee whence it was that three thouſand ſouls were converted ſoon after at one Sermon. It was not <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſpeech, it was thy prayer, that was thus effectuall. Now they have grace to know and confeſs whence they have both forgiveneſs and ſalvation; and can recompenſe their blaſphemies with thankſgiving. What ſin is there, Lord, whereof I can deſpair of the remiſſion, or what offence can I be unwilling to remit, when thou prayeſt for the forgiveneſs of thy murtherers and blaſphemers?</p>
            <p>There is no day ſo long but hath his evening. At laſt, O Bleſſed Saviour, thou art drawing to an end of theſe painfull Sufferings, when ſpent with toil and torment thou crieſt out, <hi>I thirſt.</hi> How ſhouldſt thou doe other? O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how ſhouldſt thou doe other then thirſt? The night thou hadſt ſpent in watching, in prayer, in agony, in thy conveyance from the Garden to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> in thy reſtleſs anſwers, in buffetings and ſtripes; the day in arraignments, in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from place to place, in ſcourgings, in ſtripping, in ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and diſrobing, in bleeding, in tugging under thy Croſs, in woundings and diſtenſion, in pain and paſſion: No marvell if thou thirſtedſt. Although there was more in this drought then thy need: It was no leſs requiſite thou ſhouldſt thirſt, then that thou ſhouldſt die: Both were upon the ſame predetermination, both upon the ſame prediction. How elſe ſhould that word be verified, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.14, 15. <hi>All my bones are out of joynt; my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels: My ſtrength is dried up like a potſherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou haſt brought me into the duſt of death?</hi> Had it not been to make up that word whereof one jot cannot paſs, though thou hadſt felt this thirſt, yet thou hadſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:47750:238"/>
it. Alas! what could it avail to bemoan thy wants to inſulting enemies, whoſe ſport was thy miſery? How ſhould they pity thy thirſt, that pitied not thy bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? It was not their favour that thou expectedſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, but their conviction. O Saviour, how can we, thy ſinfull ſervants, think much to be exerciſed with hunger and thirſt, when we hear thee thus plain?</p>
            <p>Thou that not long ſince proclaimedſt in the Temple, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink: He that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> now thy ſelf thirſteſt: Thou, in whom we believe, complaineſt to want ſome drops; thou hadſt the command of all the waters both above the firmament and below it, yet thou wouldſt thirſt. Even ſo, Lord, thou that wouldſt die for us, wouldſt thirſt for us. O give me to thirſt after thoſe waters which thou promiſeſt, what-ever become of thoſe waters which thou wouldſt want. The time was, when, craving water of the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> thou gaveſt better then that thou askedſt. Oh give me to thirſt after that more precious Water; and ſo do thou give me of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, that I may never thirſt again.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed God! how marvellouſly doſt thou contrive thine own affairs? Thine enemies, whilſt they would deſpight thee, ſhall unwittingly juſtifie thee, and convince themſelves. As thou fore-ſaidſt, <hi>In thy thirſt, they gave thee vinegar to drink.</hi> Had they given thee Wine, thou hadſt not taken it: the night before thou hadſt taken leave of that comfortable liquour, reſolving to drink no more of that ſweet juice till thou ſhouldſt drink it new with them in thy Father's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Had they given thee Water, they had not fulfilled that prediction, whereby they were ſelf-condemned. I know not now, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> whether this laſt draught of thine were more pleaſing to thee or more diſtaſtfull: Diſtaſtfull in it ſelf; (for what liquour could be equally harſh;) pleaſing, that it made up thoſe Sufferings thou wert to endure, and thoſe Prophecies thou wert to fulfill.</p>
            <p>

            <p>And now, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how eaſily have carnall eyes all this while miſtaken the paſſages and intentions of this thy laſt and moſt glorious work? Our weakneſs could hitherto ſee nothing here but pain and ignominy; now my better-inlightned eyes ſee in this elevation of thine both honour and happineſs. Lo, thou that art the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour betwixt God and man, the Reconciler of Heaven and earth, art lift up betwixt earth and Heaven, that thou mighteſt accord both. Thou that art the great <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> the conquerour of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe powers of Death and Hell, art exalted upon this Triumphall Chariot of the Croſs, that thou mighteſt trample upon Death, and drag all thoſe Infernall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities manicled after thee. Thoſe Arms which thine enemies meant violently to extend, are ſtretched forth for the imbracing of all mankind that ſhall come in for the benefit of thine all-ſufficient redemption. Even whilſt thou ſuffereſt, thou reigneſt. Oh the impotent mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſilly men! They think to diſgrace thee with wrie faces, with tongues put out, with bitter ſcoffs, with poor wretched indignities; when in the mean time <hi>the Heavens declare thy righteouſneſs,</hi> O Lord, and the Earth ſhews forth thy power. The Sun pulls in his light, as not abiding to ſee the Sufferings of his Creatour; the Earth trembles under the ſenſe of the wrong done to her Maker; the Rocks rend, the veil of the Temple tears
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:47750:239"/>
from the top to the bottom: ſhortly, all the frame of the world acknowledges the dominion of that Son of God whom Man deſpiſed.</p>
            <p>Earth and Hell have done their worſt. O Saviour, thou art in thy Paradiſe, and triumpheſt over the malice of men and Devils: The remainders of thy Sacred perſon are not yet free. The Souldiers have parted thy garments, and caſt lots upon thy ſeamleſs coat. (Thoſe poor ſpoils cannot ſo much inrich them as glorifie thee, whoſe Scriptures are fulfilled by their barbarous ſortitions.) The <hi>Jews</hi> ſue to have thy bones divided; but they ſue in vain. No more could thy garments be whole, then thy body could be broken. One inviolable Decree over-rules both. Fooliſh executioners! ye look up at that crucified Body, as if it were altogether in your power and mercy; nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to you but impotence and death: little do ye know what an irreſiſtible guard there is upon that Sacred corps; ſuch, as if all the powers of Darkneſs ſhall band againſt, they ſhall find themſelves confounded. In ſpite of all the gates of Hell that word ſhall ſtand, <hi>Not a bone of him ſhall be broken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Still the infallible Decree of the Almighty leads you on to his own ends, through your own ways. Ye ſaw him already dead, whom ye came to diſpatch: thoſe bones therefore ſhall be whole, which ye had had no power to break. But yet, that no piece either of your cruelty or of Divine prediction may remain unſatisfied, he whoſe Bones may not be impaired, ſhall be wounded in his fleſh; he whoſe Ghoſt was yielded up, muſt yield his laſt bloud. <hi>One of the ſouldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with there came out bloud and water.</hi> Malice is wont to end with life; here it over-lives it. Cruell man! what means this ſo late wound? what commiſſion hadſt thou for this bloudy act? <hi>Pilate</hi> had given leave to break the bones of the living, he gave no leave to goar the ſide of the dead: what wicked ſuperrerogation is this? what a ſuperfluity
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:47750:239"/>
of maliciouſneſs? To what purpoſe did thy ſpear pierce ſo many hearts in that one? why wouldſt thou kill a dead man? Methinks the Bleſſed Virgin, and thoſe other paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate aſſociates of hers, and the Diſciple whom <hi>Jeſus</hi> loved, together with the other of his fellows, the friends and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and eſpecially he that was ſo ready to draw his ſword upon the troup of his Maſter's apprehenders, ſhould have work enough to contain themſelves within the bounds of patience at ſo ſavage a ſtroke: their ſorrow could not chuſe but turn to indignation, and their hearts could not but riſe (as even mine doth now) at ſo impertinent a villany. How eaſily could I rave at that rude hand? But, O God, when I look up to thee, and conſider how thy holy and wiſe Providence ſo overrules the moſt barbarous actions of men, that (beſides their will) they turn beneficiall, I can at once hate them, and bleſs thee. This very wound hath a mouth to ſpeak the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhip of my Saviour, and the truth of thy Scripture, <hi>They ſhall look at him whom they have pierced.</hi> Behold now the Second <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping, and out of his ſide formed the Mother of the living, the Evangelicall Church: Behold the Rock which was ſmitten, and the waters of life guſhed forth. Behold <hi>the fountain that is ſet open to the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, for ſin and for uncleanneſs</hi>; a fountain not of water one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but of bloud too. O Saviour, by thy water we are waſhed, by thy bloud we are redeemed. Thoſe two Sacraments which thou didſt inſtitute alive, flow alſo from thee dead, as the laſt memorialls of thy Love to thy Church: the Water of Baptiſm, which is <hi>the laver of Regeneration; the Bloud of the new Teſtament ſhed for remiſſion of ſins:</hi> and theſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Spirit that gives life to them both, are the three Witneſſes on earth, whoſe atteſtation cannot fail us. O precious and ſovereign wound, by which our Souls are healed! Into this cleft of the rock let my Dove fly and enter, and there ſafely hide her ſelf from the talons of all the Birds of prey.</p>
            <p>It could not be but that the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> contrived and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:47750:240"/>
acted at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in ſo ſolemn a Feſtivall, muſt needs draw a world of beholders. The <hi>Romans,</hi> the Centurion and his band, were there as actours, as ſuperviſours of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thoſe ſtrangers were no otherwiſe engaged, then as they that would hold fair correſpondence with the Citizens where they were engariſoned: their freedome from preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice rendred them more capable of an ingenuous conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all events. <hi>Now when the Centurion and they that were with him that watched Jeſus ſaw the Earthquake, and the things that were done, they feared greatly, and glorified God, and ſaid, Truly this was the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a marvellous concurrence is here of ſtrong and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable convictions? Meekneſs in ſuffering, Prayer for his murtherers, a faithfull reſignation of his Soul into the hands of his Heavenly Father, the Sun eclipſed, the Heavens dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the earth trembling, the graves open, the rocks rent, the veil of the Temple torn; who could goe leſs then this, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God?</hi> He ſuffers patiently; this is through the power of Grace: many good men have done ſo through his enabling. The frame of Nature ſuffers with him; this is proper to the God of Nature, the Son of God.</p>
            <p>I wonder not that theſe men confeſſed thus; I wonder that any Spectatour confeſſed it not: theſe proofs were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to fetch all the world upon their knees, and to have made all mankind a Convert. But all hearts are not alike; no means can work upon the wilfully-obdured. Even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this the Souldier pierced that Bleſſed Side; and whilſt <hi>Pagans</hi> relented, <hi>Jews</hi> continued impenitent. Yet even of that Nation, thoſe beholders whom envy and partiality had not intereſſed in this ſlaughter, were ſtricken with juſt aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and ſmote their breaſts, and ſhook their heads, and by paſſionate geſture ſpake what their tongues durſt not. How many muſt there needs be, in this univerſall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, of them whom he had healed of diſeaſes, or freed from Devils, or miraculouſly fed, or ſome way obliged in their perſons or friends? Theſe, as they were deeply affected
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:47750:240"/>
with the mortall indignities which were offered to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> ſo they could not but be raviſhed with wonder at thoſe powerfull demonſtrations of the Deity of him in whom they believed; and ſtrangely diſtracted in their thoughts, whilſt they compared thoſe Sufferings with that Omnipotence. As yet their Faith and Knowledge was but in the bud or in the blade. How could they chuſe but think, Were he not the Son of God, how could theſe things be? and if he were the Son of God, how could he die? His Reſurrection, his Aſcenſion, ſhould ſoon after perfect their belief; but in the mean time their hearts could not but be conflicted with thoughts hard to be reconciled. Howſoever, they glorify God, and ſtand amazed at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the iſſue.</p>
            <p>But above all other, O thou Bleſſed Virgin, the Holy Mother of our Lord, how many ſwords pierced thy Soul, whilſt ſtanding cloſe by his Croſs thou ſaweſt thy dear Son and Saviour thus indignly uſed, thus ſtripped, thus ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, thus nailed, thus bleeding, thus dying, thus pierced? How did thy troubled heart now recount what the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> had reported to thee from God in the meſſage of thy bleſſed Conception of that Son of God? How didſt thou think of the miraculous formation of that thy Divine burthen by the power of the Holy Ghoſt? How didſt thou recall thoſe prophecies of <hi>Anna</hi> and <hi>Simeon</hi> concerning him, and all thoſe ſupernaturall works of his, the irrefragable proofs of his Godhead? and laying all theſe together, with the miſerable infirmities of his Paſſion, how wert thou cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with him? The care that he took for thee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of his torments could not chuſe but melt thy heart into ſorrow: But oh! when in the height of his pain and miſery thou heardſt him cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> what a cold horrour poſſeſſed thy Soul? I cannot now wonder at thy qualms and ſwounings; I could rather wonder that thou ſurvivedſt ſo ſad an hour. But when, recollecting thy ſelf, thou ſaweſt the Heavens
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:47750:241"/>
to bear a part with thee in thy mourning, and felteſt the Earth to tremble no leſs then thy ſelf, and foundeſt that the dreadfull concuſſion of the whole frame of Nature proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Deity of him that would thus ſuffer and die, and remembredſt his frequent predictions of drinking this bitter cup, and of being baptized thus in Bloud; thou beganſt to take heart, and to comfort thy ſelf with the aſſured expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the glorious iſſue. More then once had he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told thee his victorious Reſurrection. He who had openly profeſſed <hi>Jonas</hi> for his type, and had fore-promiſed in three days to raiſe up the ruined Temple of his Body; had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs given more full intimation unto thee, who hadſt ſo great a ſhare in that ſacred Body of his. <hi>The juſt ſhall live by Faith.</hi> Lo, that Faith of thine in his enſuing Reſurrection and in his triumph over death, gives thee life, and chears up thy drouping Soul, and bids it in an holy confidence to triumph over all thy fears and ſorrows; and him whom thou now ſeeſt dead and deſpiſed, repreſents unto thee living, immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, glorious.</p>

he hath done too much already, in ſentencing an innocent to death: no doubt that Centurion had related unto him the miraculous ſymptoms of that Paſſion. He that ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly condemned Innocence, could rather have wiſhed that juſt man alive, then have denied him dead.

Now even <hi>Nicodemus</hi> comes in for a part, and fears not the envy of a good profeſſion. Death hath let that man looſe, whom the Law formerly over-awed with reſtraint.

O Saviour, the earth was thine and the fulneſs of it; yet, as thou hadſt not an houſe of thine own whilſt thou livedſt, ſo thou hadſt not a grave when thou wert dead. <hi>Joſeph</hi> that rich Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour lent thee his; lent it ſo, as it ſhould never be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: thou took'ſt it up but for a while; but that little touch of that Sacred Corps of thine made it too good for the owner.</p>
            <p>O happy <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that hadſt the honour to be Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord of the Lord of Life! how well is thy houſe-room re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay'd with a <hi>manſion not made with hands, eternall in the heavens?</hi> Thy Garden and thy Tomb were hard by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary,</hi> where thou couldſt not fail of many monitions of thy frailty. How oft hadſt thou ſeaſoned that new Tomb with ſad and ſavoury meditations? and hadſt oft ſaid within thy ſelf, Here I ſhall once lie down to my laſt reſt, and wait for my Reſurrection? Little didſt thou then think to have been diſappointed by ſo Bleſſed a Gueſt; or that thy grave ſhould be again ſo ſoon empty, and in that emptineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any mortall in-dweller. How gladly doſt thou now reſign thy grave to him in whom thou liveſt, and who liveth for ever, whoſe Soul is in Paradiſe, whoſe God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:47750:242"/>
every-where? Hadſt thou not been rich before, this gift had enriched thee alone, and more ennobled thee then all thine earthly Honour. Now great Princes envy thy bounty, and have thought themſelves happy to kiſs the ſtones of that rock which thou thus hewedſt, thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowedſt.</p>
            <p>Thus purely wrapped and ſweetly embalmed lies the precious Body of our Saviour in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s new Vault. Are ye now alſo at reſt, O ye <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rulers? Is your malice dead and buried with him? Hath <hi>Pilate</hi> enough ſerved your envy and revenge? Surely it is but a common hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that can die; yours ſurviveth death, and puts you upon a farther project. <hi>The chief Prieſts and Phariſees came together unto Pilate, ſaying, Sir, we remember that this Deceiver ſaid whilſt he was yet alive, After three days I will riſe again: Command therefore that the Sepulcher be made ſure till the third day; leſt his Diſciples come by night, and ſteal him away, and ſay to the people he is riſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How full of terrours and inevitable perplexities is guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Theſe men were not more troubled with envy at <hi>Chriſt</hi> alive, then now with fear of his Reſurrection. And what can now ſecure them? <hi>Pilate</hi> had helpt to kill him; but who ſhall keep him from riſing? Wicked and fooliſh <hi>Jews!</hi> how fain would ye fight againſt God and your own hearts? how gladly would ye deceive your ſelves, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him to be a Deceiver whom your conſciences knew to be no leſs true then powerfull? <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſtill in your eye: That man was no phantaſm; his death, his reviving was undeniable; the ſo-freſh reſuſcitation of that dead body after four days diſſolution was a manifeſt conviction of Omnipotence. How do ye vainly wiſh that he could deceive you in the fore-reporting of his own Reſurrection? Without a Divine power he could have raiſed neither <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> nor himſelf: with and by it, he could as well raiſe himſelf as <hi>Lazarus.</hi> What need we other witneſſes then your own mouths? That which he would doe, ye confeſs
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:47750:242"/>
he foretold; that the truth of his word might anſwer the power of this deed, and both of them might argue him the God of Truth and Power, and your ſelves enemies to both. And now what muſt be done? The Sepulcher muſt be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and you with it: An huge ſtone, a ſtrong guard muſt doe the deed: and that ſtone muſt be ſealed, that guard of your own deſigning. Methinks I hear the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and buſie Officers, when they were rolling that other weighty Stone (for ſuch we probably conceive) to the mouth of the vault with much toil and ſweat and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, how they bragg'd of the ſureneſs of the place and unremovableneſs of that load; and when that ſo choice a Watch was ſet, how they boaſted of their valour and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, and ſaid, they would make him ſafe from either riſing or ſtealing. Oh the madneſs of impotent men, that think by either wile or force to fruſtrate the will and deſigns of the Almighty! How juſtly doth that wiſe and powerfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of the world laugh them to ſcorn in Heaven, and befool them in their own vain devices? O Saviour, how much evidence had thy Reſurrection wanted, if theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had not been thus maliciouſly provident? how irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable is thy Riſing made by theſe bootleſs endeavours of their prevention?</p>
            <p>All this while the devout <hi>Maries</hi> keep cloſe, and ſilently ſpend their Sabbath in a mixture of grief and hope. How did they wear out thoſe ſad hours in bemoaning themſelves each to other; in mutuall relations of the patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, of the happy expiration of their Saviour, of the wonderfull events both in the Heavens and earth that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his Crucifixion, of his frequent and clear Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of his Reſurrection? And now they have gladly agreed, (ſo ſoon as the time will give them leave,) in the dawning of the Sunday-morning to viſit that dear Sepulcher. Neither will they goe empty-handed: She that had beſtowed that coſtly Alabaſter-box of Ointment upon their Saviour alive, hath prepared no leſs precious Odours for him dead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="480" facs="tcp:47750:243"/>Love is reſtleſs and fearleſs. In the dark of night theſe good Women goe to buy their ſpices, and ere the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break are gone out of their houſes towards the Tomb of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to beſtow them. This Sex is commonly fearfull; it was much for them to walk alone in that unſafe ſeaſon: yet, as deſpiſing all fears and dangers, they thus ſpend the night after their Sabbath. Might they have been allowed to buy their Perfumes on the Sabbath, or to have viſited that holy Tomb ſooner, can we think they would have ſtaid ſo long? can we ſuppoſe they would have cared more for the Sabbath then for the <hi>Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> who now kept his Sabbath in the Grave? Sooner they might not come, later they would not, to preſent their laſt homage to their dead Saviour. Had theſe holy women known their <hi>Jeſus</hi> to be alive, how had they haſted, who made ſuch ſpeed to doe their laſt offices to his ſacred Corps? For us, we <hi>know that</hi> our <hi>Redeemer liveth</hi>; we know where he is. O Saviour, how cold and heartleſs is our love to thee, if we do not haſte to find thee in thy Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if our Souls do not fly up to thee in all holy Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections into thy Heaven?</p>
            <p>Of all the Women <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> is firſt named, and in ſome Evangeliſts alone: She is noted above her fellows. None of them were ſo much obliged, none ſo zealouſly thankfull: Seven Devils were caſt out of her by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> That Heart which was freed from Satan by that powerfull diſpoſſeſſion, was now poſſeſſed with a free and gracious bounty to her deliverer. Twice at the leaſt hath ſhe poured out her fragrant and coſtly Odours upon him. Where there is a true ſenſe of favour and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, there cannot but be a fervent deſire of retribution. O Bleſſed Saviour, could we feel the danger of every ſin, and the malignity of thoſe ſpirituall poſſeſſions from which thou haſt freed us, how ſhould we pour out our ſelves into thankfulneſs unto thee?</p>
            <p>Every thing here had horrour. The Place, both ſolitary
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:47750:243"/>
and a Sepulcher: Nature abhors, as the viſage, ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Death and Corruption. The Time, Night; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Moon gave them ſome faint glimmering: (for this being the ſeventeenth day of her age, afforded ſome light to the latter part of the night.) The Buſineſs, the viſitation of a dead Corps. Their zealous Love hath eaſily overcome all theſe. They had followed him in his Sufferings when the Diſciples left him; they attended him to his Croſs weeping; they followed him to his Grave, and ſaw how <hi>Joſeph</hi> laid him: even there they leave him not, but, ere it be day-light, return to pay him the laſt tribute of their duty. How much <hi>ſtronger is Love then death?</hi> O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> why ſhould not we imitate thy love to us? Thoſe <hi>whom thou loveſt, thou loveſt to the end,</hi> yea in it, yea after it: even when we are dead, not our Souls onely, but our very duſt is dearly reſpected of thee. What condition of thine ſhould remove our affections from thy perſon in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from thy lims on earth?</p>
            <p>Well did theſe worthy Women know what <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathaea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had done to thee; they ſaw how curiouſly they had wrapped thee, how preciouſly they had embalmed thee: yet, as not thinking others beneficence could be any juſt excuſe of theirs, they bring their own Odours to thy Sepulture to be perfumed by the touch of thy Sacred Body. What thank is it to us that others are obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to thee, whilſt we are ſlack or niggardly? We may rejoyce in others forwardneſs; but if we reſt in it, how ſmall joy ſhall it be to us, to ſee them go to Heaven without us?</p>
            <p>When on the Friday-evening they attended <hi>Joſeph</hi> to the intombing of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they mark'd the place, they mark'd the paſſage, they mark'd that inner grave-ſtone which the owner had fitted to the mouth of that tomb; which all there care is now to remove; <hi>Who ſhall roll away the ſtone?</hi> That other more weighty load wherewith the vault was barred, the ſeal, the guard ſet upon both, came not perhaps into their knowledge; this was the private
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:47750:244"/>
plot of <hi>Pilate</hi> and the Prieſts, beyond the reach of their thoughts.</p>
            <p>I do not hear them ſay, How ſhall we recover the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our Odours? or, How ſhall we avoid the envy and cenſure of our angry Elders, for honouring him whom the Governours of our Nation have thought worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation? The onely thought they now take is, <hi>Who ſhall roll away the ſtone?</hi> Neither do they ſtay at home and move this doubt, but when they are well forward on their way, reſolving to try the iſſue. Good hearts cannot be ſo ſolicitous for any thing under Heaven, as for removing thoſe impediments which lie between them and their Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> thou who art clearly revealed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, art yet ſtill both hid and ſealed up from too many here on earth: Neither is it ſome thin veil that is ſpred between thee and them, but an huge ſtone; even a true ſtone of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence lies rolled upon the mouth of their hearts. Yea, if a ſecond weight were ſuperadded to thy Grave here, no leſs then three ſpirituall bars are interpoſed betwixt them and thee above; Idleneſs, Ignorance, Unbelief. Who ſhall roll away theſe ſtones, but the ſame power that removed thine? O Lord, remove that our Ignorance, that we may know thee; our Idleneſs, that we may ſeek thee; our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, that we may find and enjoy thee.</p>
            <p>How well it ſucceeds when we go faithfully and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably about our work, and leave the iſſue to God? Lo, now God hath removed the cares of theſe holy Women, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the grave-ſtone. To the wicked that falls out which they feared, to the Godly that which they wiſhed and cared for, yea more. Holy cares ever prove well; the worldly dry the bones, and diſappoint the hopes. Could theſe good Viſitants have known of a greater ſtone ſealed, of a ſtrong watch ſet, their doubts had been doubled: now God goes beyond their thoughts, and at once removes that which both they did and might have feared: The ſtone is removed, the ſeal broken, the watch fled. What a ſcorn
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:47750:244"/>
doth the Almighty God make of the impotent deſigns of men? They thought, the ſtone ſhall make the grave ſure, the ſeal ſhall make the ſtone ſure, the guard ſhall make both ſure: Now when they think all ſafe, God ſends an Angel from Heaven above, the earth quakes beneath, the ſtone rolls away, the Souldiers ſtand like carkaſſes, and when they have got heart enough to run away, think themſelves valiant; the Tomb is opened, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is riſen, they confounded. Oh the vain projects of ſilly men! as if with one ſhovel-full of mire they would dam up the Sea; or with a clout hang'd forth they would keep the Sun from ſhining. Oh theſe Spiders-webs, or houſes of cards which fond children have (as they think) skilfully framed, which the leaſt breath breaks and ruines! Who are we, ſorry worms, that we ſhould look in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny buſineſs to prevail againſt our Creatour? What creature is ſo baſe that he cannot arm againſt us to our confuſion? The Lice and Frogs ſhall be too ſtrong for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Worms for <hi>Herod. There is no wiſedom nor counſell againſt the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh the marvellous pomp and magnificence of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Reſurrection! The Earth quakes, the Angel appears; that it may be plainly ſeen that this Divine perſon now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing had the command both of Earth and Heaven. At the diſſolution of thine Humane nature, O Saviour, was an Earthquake, at the re-uniting of it is an Earthquake; to tell the world that the God of Nature then ſuffered, and had now conquered. Whilſt thou laieſt ſtill in the earth, the earth was ſtill; when thou cameſt to fetch thine own, <hi>The earth trembled at the preſence of the Lord, at the preſence of the God of Jacob.</hi> When thou our true <hi>Sampſon</hi> awakedſt, and foundeſt thy ſelf tied with theſe <hi>Philiſtian</hi> cords, and rouſedſt up, and brakeſt thoſe hard and ſtrong twiſts with a ſudden power, no marvell if the room ſhook under thee.</p>
            <p>Good cauſe had the earth to quake, when the God that made it powerfully calls for his own fleſh from the uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her bowells. Good cauſe had ſhe to open her graves and yield up her dead, in attendence to the Lord of Life,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:47750:245"/>
whom ſhe had preſumed to detain in that cell of darkneſs. What a ſeeming impotence was here, that thou, who art the true Rock of thy Church, ſhouldſt lie obſcurely ſhrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s rock? thou, that art the true corner-ſtone of thy Church, ſhouldſt be ſhut up with a double ſtone, the one of thy grave, the other of thy vault? thou, <hi>by whom we are ſealed to the day of our Redemption,</hi> ſhouldſt be ſealed up in a blind cavern of earth? But now what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of power doth both the world and I ſee, in thy glorious Reſurrection? The rocks tear, the graves open, the ſtones roll away, the dead riſe and appear, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers flee and tremble, Saints and Angels attend thy riſing. O Saviour, thou laieſt down in weakneſs, thou riſeſt in power and glory; thou laieſt down like a man, thou riſeſt like a God.</p>
            <p>What a lively image haſt thou herein given me of the dreadfull majeſty of the generall Reſurrection and thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance? Then not the earth onely, but <hi>the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken:</hi> not ſome few graves ſhall be open, and ſome Saints appear; but all the bars of death ſhall be broken, and <hi>all that ſleep in their graves ſhall awake, and ſtand up from the dead</hi> before thee: not ſome one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſhall deſcend; but thou, <hi>the great Angel of the Covenant,</hi> attended with thouſand thouſands of thoſe mighty Spirits. And if theſe ſtout Souldiers were ſo filled with terrour at the feeling of an Earthquake and the ſight of an Angel, that they had ſcarce breath left in them for the time to witneſs them alive; where ſhall thine enemies appear, O Lord, in the day of thy terrible appearance, when the earth ſhall reel and vaniſh, and the elements ſhall be on a flame about their ears, and the Heavens ſhall wrap up as a ſcroll?</p>
            <p>O God, thou mighteſt have removed this ſtone by the force of thine Earthquake, as well as rive other rocks; yet thou wouldſt rather uſe the miniſtery of an Angel: or, thou that gaveſt thy ſelf life, and gaveſt being both to the
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:47750:245"/>
ſtone and to the earth, couldſt more eaſily have removed the ſtone then moved the earth; but it was thy pleaſure to make uſe of an Angel's hand. And now he that would ask why thou wouldſt doe it rather by an Angel then by thy ſelf, may as well ask why thou didſt not rather give thy Law by thine own immediate hand then by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Angels; why by an Angel thou ſtruckeſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with plagues, the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> with the ſword; why an Angel appeared to comfort thee after thy Temptation and Agony, when thou wert able to comfort thy ſelf; why thou uſeſt the influences of Heaven to fruiten the earth; why thou imployeſt Second cauſes in all events, when thou couldſt doe all things alone. It is good reaſon thou ſhouldſt ſerve thy ſelf of thine own; neither is there any ground to be required whether of their motion or reſt, beſides thy will.</p>
            <p>Thou didſt raiſe thy ſelf, the Angels removed the ſtone. They that could have no hand in thy Reſurrection, yet ſhall have an hand in removing outward impediments; not becauſe thou neededſt, but becauſe thou wouldeſt: like as thou alone didſt raiſe <hi>Lazarus,</hi> thou badeſt others let him looſe. Works of Omnipotency thou reſerveſt to thine own immediate performance; ordinary actions thou doeſt by ſubordinate means.</p>
            <p>Although this act of the Angels was not merely with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thee; but partly to thoſe devout Women, to eaſe them of their care, to manifeſt unto them thy Reſurrection. So officious are thoſe glorious Spirits, not onely to thee their Maker, but even to the meaneſt of thy ſervants, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the furtherance of all their ſpirituall deſigns. Let us bring our Odours, they will be ſure to roll away the ſtone. Why do not we imitate them in our forwardneſs to promote each others Salvation? We pray to doe thy will here as they doe in Heaven: if we do not act our wiſhes, we do but mock thee in our Devotions.</p>
            <p>How glorious did this Angel of thine appear? The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:47750:246"/>
Souldiers ſaw his face like lightning, both they and the Women ſaw his garments ſhining, bright, and white as ſnow: ſuch a preſence became his errand. It was fit that, as in thy Paſſion the Sun was darkened, and all creatures were clad with heavineſs, ſo in thy Reſurrection the beſt of thy creatures ſhould teſtifie their joy and exultation in the brightneſs of their habit; that as we on Feſtivall-days put on our beſt cloaths, ſo thine Angels ſhould celebrate this bleſſed Feſtivity with a meet repreſentation of Glory. They could not but injoy our joy, to ſee the work of man's Redemption thus fully finiſhed: and if there be <hi>mirth in Heaven at the converſion of one ſinner,</hi> how much more when a world of ſinners is perfectly ranſomed from death, and reſtored to Salvation? Certainly, if but one or two appeared, all rejoyced, all triumphed. Neither could they but be herein ſenſible of their own happy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, who by thy mediation are confirmed in their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eſtate; ſince thou by the bloud of thy Croſs and power of thy Reſurrection haſt <hi>reconciled things not in earth onely, but in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, above all other, the Love of thee their God and Saviour muſt needs heighten their joy, and make thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry theirs. It is their perpetuall work to praiſe thee: how much more now when ſuch an occaſion was offered as never had been ſince the world began, never could be after? when thou the God of Spirits hadſt vanquiſhed all the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall powers of darkneſs, when thou the Lord of Life hadſt conquered death for thee and all thine, ſo as they may now boldly inſult over their laſt enemy, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, if Heaven can be capable of an increaſe of joy and felicity, never had thoſe Bleſſed Spirits ſo great a cauſe of triumph and gratulation as in this day of thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reſurrection. How much more, O dear <hi>Jeſu,</hi> ſhould we men, whoſe fleſh thou didſt aſſume, unite, revive, for whoſe ſake and in whoſe ſtead thou didſt vouchſafe to
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:47750:246"/>
ſuffer and die, whoſe arrerages thou payedſt in death and acquittedſt in thy Reſurrection, whoſe Souls are diſcharged, whoſe Bodies ſhall be raiſed by the power of thy riſing; how much more ſhould we think we have cauſe to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with the happy memory of this great work of thy Divine Power and unconceivable Mercy?</p>
            <p>Lo now, how weak ſoever I am in my ſelf, yet in the confidence of this victorious Reſurrection of my Saviour I dare boldly challenge and defie you, O all ye adverſe Powers. Doe the worſt ye can to my Soul; in deſpite of you it ſhall be ſafe.</p>
            <p>Is it Sin that threats me? Behold, this Reſurrection of my Redeemer publiſhes my diſcharge. My Surety was arreſted and caſt into the priſon of his Grave: had not the utmoſt farthing of mine arrerages been paid, he could not have come forth. He is come forth: the Sum is fully ſatisfied. What danger can there be of a diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Debt?</p>
            <p>Is it the Wrath of God? Wherefore is that but for ſin? If my ſin be defrayed, that quarrell is at an end: and if my Saviour ſuffered it for me, how can I fear to ſuffer it in my ſelf? That infinite Juſtice hates to be twice paid. He is riſen, therefore he hath ſatisfied. <hi>Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died; yea rather, that is riſen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is it Death it ſelf? Lo, my Saviour, that overcame death by dying, hath triumph'd over him in his Reſurrection. How can I now fear a conquered enemy? What harm is there in the Serpent, but for his ſting? <hi>The ſting of death is ſin:</hi> that is pulled out by my powerfull Redeemer, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now hurt me; it may refreſh me to carry this cool Snake in my boſome.</p>
            <p>O then, my dear Saviour, I bleſs thee for thy Death; but I bleſs thee more for thy Reſurrection. That was a work of wonderfull Humility, of infinite Mercy; this was a work of infinite Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In that was humane Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:47750:247"/>
in this Divine Omnipotence: In that thou didſt <hi>die for our ſins</hi>; in this thou didſt <hi>riſe again for our Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now how am I conformable to thee, if, when thou art riſen, I lie ſtill in the grave of my Corruptions? How am I a lim of thy body, if, whilſt thou haſt that perfect do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over death, death hath dominion over me; if, whilſt thou art alive and glorious, I lie rotting in the duſt of death? I know the locomotive faculty is in the Head: by the power of the Reſurrection of thee our Head, all we thy Members cannot but be raiſed. As the earth cannot hold my Body from thee in the day of the Second Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſo cannot ſin withhold my Soul from thee in the Firſt. How am I thine, if I be not riſen? and <hi>if</hi> I <hi>be riſen with</hi> thee, why do I not <hi>ſeek the things above, where thou ſitteſt at the right hand of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Vault or Cave which <hi>Joſeph</hi> had hewn out of the rock was large, capable of no leſs then ten perſons: upon the mouth of it Eaſtward was that great ſtone rolled; within it, at the right hand, in the North part of the Cave, was hewn out a receptacle for the body, three handfulls high from the pavement; and a ſtone was accordingly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the cover of that Grave.</p>
            <p>Into this Cave the good Women (finding the ſtone rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away) deſcended to ſeek the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and in it ſaw the Angels. This was the Goal to which <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> ran, finding the ſpoils of death, the grave-cloaths wrapped up, and the napkin that was about the head fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded up together and laid in a place by it ſelf: and as they came in haſte, ſo they return'd with wonder.</p>
            <p>I marvell not at your ſpeed, O ye bleſſed Diſciples, if upon the report of the Women ye ran, yea flew upon the wings of zeal, to ſee what was become of your Maſter. Ye had wont to walk familiarly together in the attendence of your Lord: now ſociety is forgotten; and, as for a wager, each tries the ſpeed of his legs, and, with neglect of other, vies who ſhall be firſt at the Tomb.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="489" facs="tcp:47750:247"/>Who would not but have tried maſteries with you in this caſe, and have made light touches of the earth to have held paces with you? Your deſire was equall; but <hi>John</hi> is the younger, his lims are more nimble, his breath more free: he firſt looks into the Sepulcher, but <hi>Peter</hi> goes down firſt. O happy competition who ſhall be more zealous in the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after <hi>Chriſt!</hi> Ye ſaw enough to amaze you, not enough to ſettle your Faith. How well might you have thought,
<q>Our Maſter is not ſubduced, but riſen? Had he been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by others hands, this fine linen had not been left behind: Had he not himſelf riſen from this bed of earth, he had not thus wrapped up his night-cloaths, and laid them ſorted by themſelves. What can we doubt, when he foretold us he would riſe?</q>
O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how wilt thou pardon our errours? how ſhould we pardon and pity the errours of each other in leſſer occaſions, when as yet thy prime and deareſt Diſciples, after ſo much Divine inſtruction, <hi>knew not the Scriptures, that thou muſt riſe again from the dead?</hi> They went away more aſtoniſhed then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident; more full of wonder as yet then of belief.</p>
            <p>There is more ſtrength of zeal (where it takes) in the weaker Sex. Thoſe holy Women, as they came firſt, ſo they ſtaid laſt: eſpecially devout <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> ſtands ſtill at the mouth of the Cave weeping. Well might thoſe tears have been ſpared, if her Knowledge had been anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to her Affection, her Faith to her Fervour. Withall, (as our eye will be where we love) ſhe ſtoops, and looks down into that dear Sepulcher.</p>
            <p>Holy deſires never but ſpeed well. There ſhe <hi>ſees two</hi> glorious <hi>Angels, the one</hi> ſitting <hi>at the head, the other at the feet where the body of Jeſus had lain.</hi> Their ſhining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhew'd them to be no mortall creatures: beſides that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> had but newly come out of the Sepulcher, and both found and left it empty in her ſight, which was now ſuddenly filled with thoſe celeſtiall gueſts. That white linen wherewith <hi>Joſeph</hi> had ſhrouded the
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:47750:248"/>
Sacred Body of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was now ſhamed with a brighter whiteneſs.</p>
            <p>Yet do I not find the good Woman ought appalled with that inexpected glory. So was her heart taken up with the thought for her Saviour, that ſhe ſeemed not ſenſible of whatſoever other Objects. Thoſe tears which ſhe did let drop into the Sepulcher, ſend up back to her the voice of thoſe Angels, <hi>Woman, why weepeſt thou?</hi> God and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels take notice of every tear of our Devotion. The ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wonder hath not dried her eyes, nor charmed her tongue: She freely confeſſeth the cauſe of her grief to be the miſſing of her Saviour; <hi>They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</hi> Alas, good <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!</hi> how doſt thou loſe thy tears? of whom doſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but of thy beſt friend? who hath removed thy Lord but himſelf? who but his own Deity hath taken away that humane body out of that region of death? Neither is he now laid any more, he ſtands by thee whoſe removall thou complaineſt of. Thus many a tender and humbled Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts it ſelf with the want of that Saviour whom it hath, and feeleth not.</p>
            <p>Senſe may be no judge of the bewailed abſence of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Do but turn back thine eye, O thou Religious Soul, <hi>and ſee Jeſus ſtanding by thee,</hi> though <hi>thou kneweſt not that it was Jeſus.</hi> His habit was not his own. Sometimes it pleaſes our Saviour to appear unto his not like himſelf: his holy diſguiſes are our trialls. Sometimes he will ſeem a Stranger, ſometimes an Enemy; ſometimes he offers himſelf to us in the ſhape of a poor man, ſometimes of a diſtreſſed captive. Happy is he that can diſcern his Saviour in all forms. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> took him for a Gardener. Devout <hi>Magdalene,</hi> thou art not much miſtaken. As it was the trade of the Firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to dreſs the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> ſo was it the trade of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to tend the Garden of his Church. He digs up the ſoil by ſeaſonable afflictions, he ſows in it the ſeeds of Grace, he plants it with gracious motions, he waters it
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:47750:248"/>
with his Word, yea with his own Bloud, he weeds it by wholſome cenſures. O Bleſſed Saviour, what is it that thou neglecteſt to doe for this ſelected incloſure of thy Church? As in ſome reſpect thou art <hi>the true Vine, and</hi> thy <hi>Father the Husbandman</hi>; ſo alſo in ſome other we are the Vine, and thou art the Husbandman. Oh be thou ſuch to me as thou appearedſt unto <hi>Magdalene:</hi> break up the fallows of my Nature, implant me with Grace, prune me with meet corrections, bedew me with the former and latter rain; doe what thou wilt to make me fruitfull.</p>
            <p>Still the good woman weeps, and ſtill complains, and paſſionately enquires of thee, O Saviour, for thy ſelf. How apt are we, if thou doſt never ſo little vary from our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, to miſ-know thee, and to wrong our ſelves by our miſ-opinions? All this while haſt thou concealed thy ſelf from thine affectionate client; thou ſaweſt her tears, and heardeſt her importunities and inquiries: at laſt (as it was with <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that he could no longer contain himſelf from the notice of his brethren) thy compaſſion cauſes thee to break forth into a clear expreſſion of thy ſelf, by expreſſing her name unto her ſelf; <hi>Mary.</hi> She was uſed, as to the name, ſo to the ſound, to the accent. Thou ſpakeſt to her before, but in the tone of a ſtranger; now of a friend, of a Maſter. Like a good Shepherd, thou <hi>calleſt thy ſheep by their name, and they know thy voice.</hi> What was thy call of her, but a clear pattern of our Vocation?</p>
            <p>As her, ſo thou calleſt us, firſt, familiarly, effectually. She could not begin with thee otherwiſe then in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a ſtranger; it was thy mercy to begin with her. That correction of thy Spirit is ſweet and uſefull, <hi>Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ye have known God, or rather are known of him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4.9.</note> We do know thee, O God, but our active know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is after our paſſive; firſt we are known of thee, then we know thee that kneweſt us. And as our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſo is our Calling, ſo is our Election; thou begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to us in all, and moſt juſtly ſaiſt, <hi>You have not choſen
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:47750:249"/>
me, but I have choſen you.</hi> When thou wouldſt ſpeak to this Devout client as a ſtranger, thou ſpakeſt aloof; <hi>Woman, whom ſeekeſt thou?</hi> now when thou wouldſt be known to her, thou calleſt her by her name, <hi>Mary.</hi> Generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and common mercies are for us as men; but where thou giveſt Grace as to thine elect, thou comeſt cloſe to the Soul, and winneſt us with dear and particular intimations.</p>
            <p>That very name did as much as ſay, Know him of whom thou art known and beloved, and turns her about to thy view and acknowledgment: <hi>She turned her ſelf, and ſaith unto him, Rabboni, which is to ſay, Maſter.</hi> Before, her face was towards the Angels: this word fetches her about, and turns her face to thee from whom her miſpriſion had averted it. We do not rightly apprehend thee, O Saviour, if any creature in Heaven or earth can keep our eyes and our hearts from thee. The Angels were bright and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; thy appearance was homely, thy habit mean: yet when ſhe heard thy voice, ſhe turns her back upon the Angels, and ſalutes thee with a <hi>Rabboni,</hi> and falls down before thee, in a deſire of an humble amplexation of thoſe Sacred feet which ſhe now rejoyces to ſee paſt the uſe of her Odours.</p>
            <p>Where there was ſuch familiarity in the mutuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation, what means ſuch ſtrangeneſs in the charge? <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father.</hi> Thou wert not wont, O Saviour, to make ſo dainty of being touched: It is not long ſince theſe very ſame hands tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thee in thine anointing; the Bloudy-fluxed woman touched thee; the thankfull Penitent in <hi>Simon</hi>'s houſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thee. What ſpeak I of theſe? The multitude touch'd thee, the Executioners touch'd thee; and even after thy Reſurrection thou didſt not ſtick to ſay to thy Diſciples, <hi>Touch me, and ſee,</hi> and to invite <hi>Thomas</hi> to put his fingers into thy ſide: neither is it long after this before thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt the three <hi>Maries</hi> to touch and hold thy feet. How
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:47750:249"/>
then ſaiſt thou, <hi>Touch me not?</hi> Was it in a mild taxation of her miſtaking? as if thou hadſt ſaid, Thou knoweſt not that I have now an Immortal body, but ſo demeaneſt thy ſelf towards me as if I were ſtill in my wonted condition: know now that the caſe is altered: howſoever indeed I have not yet aſcended to my Father, yet this Body of mine, which thou ſeeſt to be reall and ſenſible, is now impaſſible, and qualified with immortality, and therefore worthy of a more awfull veneration then heretofore. Or was it a gentle reproof of her dwelling too long in this dear hold of thee, and fixing her thoughts upon thy Bodily preſence; together with an implied direction of reſerving the height of her affection for thy perfect Glorification in Heaven? Or laſtly, was it a light touch of her too much haſte and eagerneſs in touching thee, as if ſhe muſt uſe this ſpeed in preventing thine Aſcenſion, or elſe be indangered to be diſappointed of her hopes? as if thou hadſt ſaid, Be not ſo paſſionately forward avd ſudden in laying hold of me, as if I were inſtantly aſcending; but know that I ſhall ſtay ſome time with you upon earth, before my go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to my Father. O Saviour, even our well-meant zeal in ſeeking and injoying thee may be faulty; if we ſeek thee where we ſhould not, on earth; how we ſhould not, unwarrantably. There may be a kind of carnality in ſpiriuall actions. <hi>If we have heretofore known thee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, henceforth know we thee ſo no more.</hi> That thou livedſt here in this ſhape, that colour, this ſtature, that habit, I ſhould be glad to know; nothing that concerns thee can be unuſefull. Could I ſay, here thou ſateſt, here thou layeſt, here and thus thou wert crucified, here bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, here ſetteſt thy laſt foot; I ſhould with much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment ſee and recount theſe memorialls of thy preſence. But if I ſhall ſo faſten my thoughts upon theſe, as not to look higher to the ſpirituall part of thine atchievements, to the power and iſſue of thy Reſurrection, I am never the better.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="494" facs="tcp:47750:250"/>No ſooner art thou riſen then thou ſpeakeſt of aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; as thou didſt lie down to riſe, ſo didſt thou riſe to aſcend: that is the conſummation of thy Glory, and ours in thee. Thou that forbadſt her touch, enjoynedſt her er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand; <hi>Goe to my brethren, and ſay, I aſcend unto my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and your Father, to my God and your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The annunciation of thy Reſurrection and Aſcenſion is more then a private fruition; this is for the comfort of one, that for the benefit of many. To ſit ſtill and injoy, is more ſweet for the preſent; but to goe and tell, is more gainfull in the ſequel. That great Angel thought himſelf (as he well might) highly honoured, in that he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to carry the happy news unto the Bleſſed Virgin (thy Holy Mother) of her conception of thee her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: how honourable muſt it needs be to <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> that ſhe muſt be the meſſenger of thy ſecond birth, thy Reſurrection, and inſtant Aſcenſion? <hi>How beautifull</hi> do <hi>the feet of thoſe</hi> deſerve to be, <hi>who bring the glad tidings of peace</hi> and Salvation? What matter is it, O Lord, if men deſpiſe, where thou wilt honour?</p>
            <p>To whom then doſt thou ſend her? <hi>Goe tell my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> who are thoſe? were they not thy Followers? yea, were they not thy Forſakers? yet ſtill thou ſtyleſt them thy Brethren. O admirable Humility! O infinite Mercy! How doſt thou raiſe their titles with thy ſelf? At firſt they were thy Servants, then Diſciples, a little before thy death they were thy Friends; now after thy Reſurrection they were thy Brethren. Thou that wert exalted infinitely higher from mortall to immortall, deſcendeſt ſo much lower to call them Brethren, who were before Friends, Diſciples, Servants. What do we ſtand upon the terms of our poor inequality, when the Son of God ſtoops ſo low as to call us Brethren? But, oh Mercy without meaſure! Why wilt thou, how canſt thou, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, call them Brethren, whom in their laſt parting thou foundſt fugitives? Did they not run from thee? did not
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:47750:250"/>
one of them rather leave his inmoſt coat behind him, then not be quit of thee? did not another of them deny thee, yea abjure thee? and yet thou ſaiſt, <hi>Goe tell my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> It is not in the power of the ſins of our infirmity to unbrother us: when we look at the acts themſelves, they are hainous; when at the perſons, they are ſo much more faulty as more obliged; but when we look at the mercy of thee who haſt called us, now, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us?</hi> When we have ſinned, thy dearneſs hath reaſon to aggravate our ſorrows; but when we have ſorrowed, our Faith hath no leſs reaſon to uphold us from deſpairing: Even yet we are Brethren. Brethren in thee, O Saviour, who art aſcending for us; in thee, who haſt made thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ours, thy God our God. He is thy Father by eternall Generation, our Father by his gracious Adoption; thy God by Unity of Eſſence, our God by his Grace and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
            <p>It is this propriety wherein our life and happineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth: They are weak comforts that can be raiſed from the apprehenſion of thy generall Mercies. What were I the better, O Saviour, that God were thy Father, if he be not mine? Oh do thou give me a particular ſenſe of my intereſt in thee, and thy goodneſs to me. Bring thou thy ſelf home to me, and let me find that I have a God and Saviour of my own.</p>
            <p>It is fit I ſhould mark thy order; Firſt, <hi>my Father,</hi> then, <hi>yours.</hi> Even ſo, Lord, He is firſt thine, and in thine onely right ours. It is in thee that we are adopted, it is in thee that we are elected; without thee, God is not onely a ſtranger, but an enemy to us. Thou onely canſt make us free, thou onely canſt make us Sons. Let me be found in thee, and I cannot fail of a Father in Heaven.</p>
            <p>With what joy did <hi>Mary</hi> receive this errand? with what joy did the Diſciples welcome it from her? Here was good news from a far Country, even as far as the utmoſt regions of Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:47750:251"/>Thoſe Diſciples whoſe flight ſcattered them upon their Maſter's apprehenſion, are now, at night, like a diſperſed Covy met together by their mutuall call: their aſſembly is ſecret; when the light was ſhut in, <hi>when the doors were ſhut</hi> up. Still were they fearfull, ſtill were the <hi>Jews</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious. The aſſured tidings of their Maſter's Reſurrection and Life hath filled their hearts with joy and wonder. Whilſt their thoughts and ſpeech are taken up with ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a ſubject, his miraculous and ſudden preſence bids their ſenſes be witneſſes of his reviving and their happineſs. <hi>When the doors were ſhut where the Diſciples were aſſembled, for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus, and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid, Peace be unto you.</hi> O Saviour, how thou cameſt in thither I wonder, I inquire not: I know not what a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body can doe; I know there is nothing that thou canſt not doe. Had not thine entrance been recorded for ſtrange and ſupernaturall, why was thy ſtanding in the midſt noted before thy paſſage into the room? why were the doors ſaid to be ſhut whilſt thou earneſt in? why were thy Diſciples amazed to ſee thee ere they heard thee? Doubtleſs, they that once before took thee for a Spirit when thou didſt walk upon the waters, could not but be aſtoniſhed to ſee thee whilſt the doors were barred (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any noiſe of thine entrance) to ſtand in the midſt: well might they think thou couldſt not thus be there, if thou wert not the God of Spirits. There might ſeem more ſcruple of thy realty then of thy power: and therefore, after thy wonted greeting, thou ſheweſt them thy hands and thy feet, ſtamped with the impreſſions of thy late ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Thy reſpiration ſhall argue the truth of thy life. Thou breatheſt on them as a Man, thou giveſt them thy Spirit as a God; and as God and Man thou ſendeſt them on the great errand of thy Goſpel.</p>
            <p>All the miſts of their doubts are now diſpelled, the Sun breaks out clear. <hi>They were glad when they had ſeen the Lord.</hi> Had they known thee for no other then a meer
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:47750:251"/>
man, this re-appearance could not but have affrighted them; ſince till now by thine Almighty power this was never done, that the long-ſince dead roſe out of their graves, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto many: But when they recounted the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous works that thou hadſt done, and thought of <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſo lately raiſed, thine approved Deity gave them confidence, and thy preſence joy.</p>
            <p>We cannot but be loſers by our abſence from holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Where wert thou, O <hi>Thomas,</hi> when the reſt of that Sacred Family were met together? Had thy fear put thee to ſo long a flight, that as yet thou wert not returned to thy fellows? or didſt thou ſuffer other occaſions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thee from this happineſs? Now for the time thou miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedſt that Divine breath which ſo comfortably inſpired the reſt; now thou art ſuffered to fall into that weak diſtruſt which thy preſence had prevented. They told thee, <hi>We have ſeen the Lord</hi>; was not this enough? would no eyes ſerve thee but thy own? were thy ears to no uſe for thy Faith? <hi>Except I ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not believe.</hi> Suſpicious man! who is the worſe for that? whoſe is the loſs if thou believe not? Is there no certainty but in thine own ſenſes? Why were not ſo many and ſo holy eyes and tongues as credible as thine own hands and eyes? How little wert thou yet acquainted with the ways of Faith? <hi>Faith comes by hearing.</hi> Theſe are the tongues that muſt win the whole world to an aſſent; and durſt thou the firſt man detrect to yield? Why was that word ſo hard to paſs? Had not that thy Divine Maſter foretold thee with the reſt that he muſt be crucified, and the third day riſe again? Is any thing related to be done but that which was fore-promiſed? any thing beyond the ſphere of Divine Omnipotence? Go then, and pleaſe thy ſelf in thine over-wiſe incredulity, whilſt thy fellows are happy in believing.</p>
            <p>It is a whole week that <hi>Thomas</hi> reſts in this ſullen unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:47750:252"/>
in all which time doubtleſs his ears were beaten with the many conſtant aſſertions of the holy Women, (the firſt witneſſes of the Reſurrection,) as alſo of the two Diſciples walking to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> (whoſe hearts burning within them, had ſet their tongues on fire in a zealous relation of thoſe happy occurrences,) with the aſſured reports of the riſing and re-appearance of many Saints in attendence of the Lord and giver of life: yet ſtill he ſtruggles with his own diſtruſt, and ſtiffly ſuſpends his belief to that truth whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelf enough convinced. As all bodies are not equally apt to be wrought upon by the ſame Medicine, ſo are not all Souls by the ſame means of Faith; one is refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, whilſt others are pliable. O Saviour, how juſtly mighteſt thou have left this man to his own pertinacy? whom could he have thank'd if he had periſhed in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief? But, O thou good Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that couldſt be content to leave the ninety and nine to go fetch one ſtray in the wilderneſs, how carefull wert thou to reduce this ſtraggler to his fellows? Right ſo were thy Diſciples re-aſſembled, ſuch was the ſeaſon, the place the ſame, ſo were the doors ſhut up, when (that unbelieving Diſciple being now preſent with the reſt) thou ſo cameſt in, ſo ſtoodſt in the midſt, ſo ſhewedſt thy hands and feet; and ſingling out thy incredulous client, inviteſt his eyes to ſee, and his fingers to handle thine hands, and his hand to be thruſt into thy ſide, that he might not be faithleſs, but faithfull.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how thou pitieſt the errours and infirmities of thy ſervants? Even when we are froward in our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceits, and worthy of nothing but deſertion, how thou followeſt us, and overtakeſt us with mercy; and in thine abundant compaſſion wilt reclaim and ſave us, when either we meant not or would not? By how much more unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy thoſe eyes and hands were to ſee and touch that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall and glorious Body, by ſo much more wonderfull was thy Goodneſs in condeſcending to ſatisfy that curious Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:47750:252"/>
Neither do I hear thee ſo much as to chide that weak obſtinacy. It was not long ſince thou didſt ſharply take up the two Diſciples that walk'd to <hi>Emmaus, O fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken</hi>; but this was under the diſguiſe of an unknown traveller, upon the way, when they were alone: Now thou ſpeakeſt with thine own tongue, before all thy Diſciples; in ſtead of rebuking, thou onely exhorteſt, <hi>Be not faithleſs, but faithfull.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold, thy Mercy no leſs then thy Power hath melted the congealed heart of thy unbelieving follower. <hi>Then Thomas anſwered and ſaid unto him, My Lord, and my God.</hi> I do not hear that, when it came to the iſſue, <hi>Thomas</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his hands in this triall: his eyes were now ſufficient aſſurance; the ſenſe of his Maſter's Omniſcience in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular challenge of him ſpared (perhaps) the labour of a farther diſquiſition. And now how happily was that doubt beſtowed, which brought forth ſo faithfull a confeſſion, <hi>My Lord, my God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hear not ſuch a word from thoſe that believed. It was well for us, it was well for thee, O <hi>Thomas,</hi> that thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſtedſt: elſe, neither had the world received ſo perfect an evidence of that Reſurrection whereon all our Salvation dependeth; neither hadſt thou yielded ſo pregnant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine an aſtipulation to thy Bleſſed Saviour. Now thou doſt not onely profeſs his Reſurrection, but his Godhead too, and thy happy intereſt in both. And now, if <hi>they</hi> be <hi>bleſſed that have not ſeen, and</hi> yet <hi>believed</hi>; bleſſed art thou alſo, who having ſeen, haſt thus believed: and bleſſed be thou, O God, who knoweſt how to make advantage of the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of thy choſen, for the promoting of their Salvation, the confirmation of thy Church, the glory of thine own Name. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>IT ſtood not with thy purpoſe, O Saviour, to aſcend immediately from thy grave into Heaven; thou mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to take the earth in thy way; not for a ſudden paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, but for a leiſurely converſation. Upon thine Eaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day thou ſpakeſt of thine Aſcenſion; but thou wouldſt have forty days interpoſed. Hadſt thou meerly reſpected thine own Glory, thou hadſt inſtantly changed thy grave for thy Paradiſe; for ſo much the ſooner hadſt thou been poſſeſſed of thy Father's joy; we would not continue in a Dungeon, when we might be in a Palace: but thou, who for our ſakes vouchſafedſt to deſcend from Heaven to earth, wouldſt now in the upſhot have a gracious regard to us in thy return.</p>
            <p>Thy Death had troubled the hearts of many Diſciples, who thought that condition too mean to be compatible with the glory of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; and thoughts of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence were apt to ſeize upon the holieſt breaſts. So long therefore wouldſt thou hold footing upon earth, till the world were fully convinced of the infallible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of thy Reſurrection; of all which time thou onely canſt give an account: it was not for fleſh and bloud to trace the ways of Immortality; neither was our frail, corruptible, ſinfull nature a meet companion for thy now-glorified Humanity; the glorious Angels of Heaven were now thy fitteſt attendents. But yet how oft did it pleaſe thee graciouſly to impart thy ſelf this while unto men; and not onely to appear unto thy Diſciples, but to renew unto them the familiar forms of
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:47750:253"/>
thy wonted converſation, in conferring, walking, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with them? And now when thou dreweſt near to thy laſt parting, thou, who hadſt many times ſhewed thy ſelf before to thy ſeverall Diſciples, thoughteſt meet to aſſemble them all together, for an univerſall vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
            <p>Who can be too rigorous in cenſuring the ignorances of well-meaning Chriſtians, when he ſees the domeſtick Followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even after his Reſurrection, miſtake the main End of his coming in the fleſh? <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore again the Kingdom to Iſrael?</hi> They ſaw their Maſter now out of the reach of all <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> envy; they ſaw his power illimited and irreſiſtible; they ſaw him ſtay ſo long upon earth, that they might imagine he meant to fix his abode there; and what ſhould he doe there, but reign? and wherefore ſhould they be now aſſembled, but for the choice and diſtribution of Offices, and for the ordering of the affairs of that ſtate which was now to be vindicated? Oh weak thoughts of well-inſtructed Diſciples! What ſhould an Heavenly body doe in an earthly throne? How ſhould a ſpirituall life be imployed in ſecular cares? How poor a buſineſs is the Temporall Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? And even yet, O Bleſſed Saviour, I do not hear thee ſharply controll this erroneous conceit of thy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Followers; thy mild correction inſiſts rather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the time, then the miſconceived ſubſtance of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration. It was thy gracious purpoſe that thy Spirit ſhould by degrees rectify their judgments, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them with thy Divine truths; in the mean time it was ſufficient to raiſe up their hearts to an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Holy Ghoſt, which ſhould ſhortly lead them into all needfull and requiſite verities. And now, with a gracious promiſe of that Spirit of thine, with a carefull charge renewed unto thy Diſciples for the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of thy Goſpel, with an Heavenly Benediction of all
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:47750:254"/>
thine acclaiming attendents, thou takeſt leave of earth. <hi>When he had ſpoken theſe things, whilſt they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh happy parting, fit for the Saviour of mankind, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that Divine converſation, to that ſucceeding Glory! O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> let me ſo far imitate thee, as to depart hence with a bleſſing in my mouth; let my Soul, when it is ſtepping over the threſhold of Heaven, leave behind it a legacy of Peace and Happineſs.</p>
            <p>It was from the mount of Olives that thou tookeſt thy riſe into Heaven. Thou mighteſt have aſcended from the valley, all the globe of earth was alike to thee: but ſince thou wert to mount upward, thou wouldſt take ſo much advantage as that ſtair of ground would afford thee; thou wouldſt not uſe the help of a Miracle in that wherein Nature offered her ordinary ſervice. What difficulty had it been for thee to have ſtyed up from the very center of earth? But ſince thou hadſt made hills ſo much nearer unto Heaven, thou wouldeſt not neglect the benefit of thine own Creation. Where we have common helps, we may not depend upon Supernaturall proviſions; we may not ſtrain the Divine Providence to the ſupply of our neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, or the humouring of our preſumption. Thou that couldſt alwaies have walked on the Sea, wouldſt walk ſo but once, when thou wantedſt ſhipping: thou, to whom the higheſt mountains were but valleys, wouldſt walk up to an hill to aſcend thence into Heaven. O God, teach me to bleſs thee for means, when I have them; and to truſt thee for means, when I have them not; yea to truſt to thee without means, when I have no hope of them.</p>
            <p>What Hill was this thou choſeſt but the mount of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives? Thy Pulpit ſhall I call it, or thine Oratory? The place from whence thou hadſt wont to ſhowr down thine Heavenly Doctrine upon the hearers; the place whence thou hadſt wont to ſend up thy Prayers unto thy Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father; the place that ſhared with the Temple for
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:47750:254"/>
both: In the day-time thou wert preaching in the Temple, in the night praying in the mount of Olives. On this very hill was the bloudy ſweat of thine Agony; now is it the mount of thy Triumph. From this mount of Olives did flow that oyl of gladneſs wherewith thy Church is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly refreſhed. That God that uſes to puniſh us in the ſame kind wherein we have offended, retributes alſo to us in the ſame kind and circumſtances wherein we have been afflicted. To us alſo, O Saviour, even to us thy unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy members doſt thou ſeaſonably vouchſafe to give a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable joy to our heavineſs, laughter to our mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, glory to contempt and ſhame. Our agonies ſhall be anſwered with exaltation.</p>
            <p>Whither then, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> whither didſt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend? whither but home into thine Heaven? From the mountain wert thou taken up; and what but Heaven is above the hills? Lo, theſe are thoſe mountains of ſpices which thy Spouſe, the Church, long ſince deſired thee to climbe. Thou haſt now climbed up that infinite ſteepneſs, and haſt left all ſublimity below thee. Already hadſt thou approved thy ſelf the Lord and commander of Earth, of Sea, of Hell. The Earth confeſs'd thee her Lord, when at thy voice ſhe rendered thee thy <hi>Lazarus</hi>; when ſhe ſhook at thy Paſſion, and gave up her dead Saints: The Sea ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged thee, in that it became a pavement to thy feet and (at thy command) to the feet of thy Diſciple; in that it became thy treaſury for thy Tribute-money: Hell found and acknowledged thee, in that thou conqueredſt all the powers of darkneſs; even him that had the power of death, the Devil. It now onely remained that, as the Lord of the Air, thou ſhouldſt paſs through all the regions of that yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding element; and, as Lord of Heaven, thou ſhouldſt paſs through all the glorious contignations thereof; that ſo <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee</hi> might <hi>bow to thee both in Heaven, and in Earth, and under the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thou hadſt an everlaſting right to that Heaven that
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:47750:255"/>
ſhould be, an undoubted poſſeſſion of it ever ſince it was; yea even whilſt thou didſt cry and ſpraul in the Cratch, whilſt thou didſt hang upon the Croſs, whilſt thou wert ſealed up in thy Grave: but thine Humane nature had not taken actuall poſſeſſion of it till now. Like as it was in thy true type, <hi>David,</hi> he had right to the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael</hi> immediately upon his anointing; but yet many an hard brunt did he paſs ere he had the full poſſeſſion of it in his aſcent to <hi>Hebron.</hi> I ſee now, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> I ſee where thou art; even far above all Heavens, at the right hand of thy Father's Glory. This is the far country into which the Nobleman went to receive for himſelf a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; far off to us, to thee near, yea intrinſecall. Oh do thou raiſe up my Heart thither to thee; place thou my Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections upon thee above, and teach me therefore to love Heaven becauſe thou art there.</p>
            <p>How then, O Bleſſed Saviour, how didſt thou aſcend? <hi>Whilſt they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight.</hi> So waſt thou taken up, as that the act was thine own, the power of the act none but thine. Thou that deſcendedſt waſt the ſame that aſcendedſt: as in thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent there was no uſe of any power or will but thine own, no more was there in thine aſcent. Still and ever wert thou the Maſter of thine own acts. Thou laidſt down thy own life, no man took it from thee; Thou raiſedſt up thy ſelf from death, no hand did or could help thee; Thou carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt up thine own glorified fleſh, and placedſt it in Heaven. The Angels did attend thee, they did not aid thee: whence had they their ſtrength but from thee? <hi>Elias</hi> aſcended to Heaven, but he was fetch'd up in a chariot of fire; that it might appear hence, that man had need of others helps; who elſe could not of himſelf ſo much as lift up himſelf to the Aiery Heaven, much leſs to the Empyreall. But thou, our Redeemer, needeſt no chariot, no carriage of Angels: thou art the Authour of life and motion; they move in and from thee. As thou therefore didſt move thy ſelf upward,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:47750:255"/>
ſo, by the ſame Divine power, thou wilt raiſe us up to the participation of thy Glory. Theſe <hi>vile bodies ſhall be made like to thy glorious body, according to the working whereby thou art able to ſubdue all things unto thy ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elias</hi> had but one witneſs of his rapture into Heaven: S. <hi>Paul</hi> had none, no not himſelf; for, <hi>whether in the body, or out of the body,</hi> he knew not. Thou, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> wouldſt neither have all eyes witneſſes of thine Aſcenſion, nor yet too few. As after thy Reſurrection thou didſt not ſet thy ſelf upon the pinnacle of the Temple, nor yet pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly ſhew thy ſelf within it, as making thy preſence too cheap; but madeſt choice of thoſe eyes whom thou wouldſt bleſs with the ſight of thee; thou wert ſeen indeed of five hundred at once, but they were Brethren: So in thine Aſcenſion, thou didſt not carry all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> promiſcuouſly forth with thee to ſee thy glorious departure, but onely that ſelected company of thy Diſciples which had attended thee in thy life. Thoſe who immediately upon thine aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding returned to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perſons: a competent number of witneſſes, to verify that thy miraculous and triumphant paſſage into thy Glory. Lo, thoſe onely were thought worthy to behold thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſticall Aſcent, which had been partners with thee in thy Humiliation. Still thou wilt have it thus with us, O Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and we embrace the condition: if we will converſe with thee in thy lowly eſtate here upon earth, wading with thee through contempt and manifold afflictions, we ſhall be made happy with the ſight and communion of thy Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry above.</p>
            <p>O my Soul, be thou now (if ever) raviſhed with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of this comfortable and bleſſed farewell of thy Saviour. What a ſight was this? how full of joyfull aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, of ſpirituall conſolation? Methinks I ſee it ſtill with their eyes, how thou my glorious Saviour didſt leiſurely and inſenſibly riſe up from thine <hi>Olivet,</hi> taking leave of thine acclaiming Diſciples now left below thee, with gracious eyes,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:47750:256"/>
with Heavenly benedictions. Methinks I ſee how they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thee with eager and longing eyes, with arms lifted up, as if they had wiſhed them winged to have ſoared up after thee. And if <hi>Eliah</hi> gave aſſurance to his ſervant <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha,</hi> that if he ſhould behold him in that rapture, his Maſter's Spirit ſhould be doubled upon him; what an acceſſion of the ſpirit of joy and confidence muſt needs be to thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Diſciples in ſeeing thee thus gradually riſing up to thy Heaven? Oh how unwillingly did their intentive eyes let go ſo Bleſſed an Object! How unwelcome was that Cloud that interpoſed it ſelf betwixt thee and them, and, cloſing up it ſelf, left onely a glorious ſplendour behind it, as the bright track of thine Aſcenſion? Of old here below the Glory of the Lord appeared in the Cloud; now afar off in the sky the Cloud intercepted this Heavenly Glory; if diſtance did not rather doe it, then that bright meteor. Their eyes attended thee on thy way ſo far as their beams would reach; when they could goe no farther, the Cloud received thee. Lo, yet even that very ſcreen whereby thou wert taken off from all earthly view was no other then glorious: how much rather do all the beholders fix their ſight upon that Cloud, then upon the beſt piece of the Firmament? Never was the Sun it ſelf gazed on with ſo much intention. With what long looks, with what aſtoniſhed acclamations did theſe tranſported beholders follow thee their aſcending Saviour? as if they would have look'd through that Cloud and that Heaven that hid thee from them.</p>
            <p>But oh, what tongue of the higheſt Archangel of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven can expreſs the welcome of thee the King of Glory into thoſe Bleſſed Regions of Immortality? Surely the Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall Heaven never reſounded with ſo much joy: <hi>God aſcended with jubilation, and the Lord with the ſound of the Trumpet.</hi> It is not for us weak and finite creatures, to wiſh to conceive thoſe incomprehenſible, ſpirituall, Divine gratulations that the Glorious Trinity gave to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:47750:256"/>
and now-glorified Humane nature. Certainly, if <hi>when he brought his onely-begotten Son into the world, he ſaid, Let all the Angels worſhip him</hi>; much more now that he <hi>aſcends on high, and hath led captivity captive, hath he given him a Name above all names, that at the Name of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S all knees ſhould bow.</hi> And if the Holy Angels did ſo carol at his Birth, in the very entrance into that eſtate of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and infirmity; with what triumph did they receive him now returning from the perfect atchievement of Man's Redemption? And if when his type had vanquiſhed <hi>Goliah,</hi> and carried the head into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the damſels came forth to meet him with dances and timbrels; how ſhall we think thoſe Angelicall Spirits triumphed in meeting of the great Conquerour of Hell and Death? How did they ſing, <hi>Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye everlaſting doors, and the King of glory ſhall come in?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, as he ſhall come, ſo he went; and <hi>behold he ſhall come with thouſands of his Holy ones; thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him, and ten thouſand thouſands ſtood before him:</hi> From all whom methinks I hear that bleſſed applauſe, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was killed, to receive power, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and wiſedom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and praiſe: Praiſe, and honour, and glory, and power, be to him that ſitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> And why doſt not thou, O my Soul, help to bear thy part with that happy Quire of Heaven? Why art not thou rapt out of my boſome with an ecſtaſy of joy, to ſee this Humane nature of ours exalted above all the Powers of Heaven, adored of Angels, Archangels, Cherubin, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phim, and all thoſe mighty and glorious Spirits, and <hi>ſitting</hi> there <hi>crowned with infinite Glory and Majeſty?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although little would it avail thee that our Nature is thus honoured, if the benefit of this Aſcenſion did not reflect upon thee. How many are miſerable enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, notwithſtanding the Glory of their humane nature in <hi>Chriſt?</hi> None but thoſe that are found in him are the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:47750:257"/>
happier by him: who but the Members are the better for the glory of the Head? O Saviour, how ſhould our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have ever hoped to climb into Heaven, if thou hadſt not gone before and made way for us? It is for us that thou the fore-runner art entred in: Now thy Church hath her wiſh, <hi>Draw me, and I ſhall run after thee.</hi> Even ſo, O Bleſſed <hi>Jeſu,</hi> how ambitiouſly ſhould we follow thee with the paces of Love and Faith, and aſpire towards thy Glory? Thou that art <hi>the way,</hi> haſt made the way to thy ſelf and us: <hi>Thou didſt humble thy ſelf, and becameſt obedient to the death, even to the death of the Croſs. Therefore hath God alſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted thee</hi>; and upon the ſame terms will not fail to advance us: we ſee thy track before us, of Humility and Obedience. O teach me to follow thee in the rougheſt ways of Obedience, in the bloudy paths of Death, that I may at laſt overtake thee in thoſe high ſteps of Immortality.</p>
            <p>Amongſt thoſe millions of Angels that attended this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Aſcenſion of thine, O Saviour, ſome are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this lower ſtation, to comfort thine aſtoniſhed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, in the certain aſſurance of thy no-leſs-glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; <hi>Two men ſtood by them in white apparell.</hi> They ſtood by them, they were not of them; they ſeemed Men, they were Angels: <hi>Men</hi> for their familiarity; <hi>two,</hi> for more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of teſtimony; <hi>in white,</hi> for the joy of thine Aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>The Angels formerly celebrated thy Nativity with Songs; but we do not find they then appeared in white: thou wert then to undergoe much ſorrow, many conflicts; it was the vale of tears into which thou wert come down. So ſoon as thou wert riſen, the women ſaw an Angel in the form of a young man, cloathed in white; and now, ſo ſoon as thou art aſcended, <hi>Two men cloathed in white</hi> ſtand by thy Diſciples: thy task was now done, thy victory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved, and nothing remained but a Crown, which was now ſet upon thy Head. Juſtly therefore were thoſe bleſſed Angels ſuited with the robes of light and joy. And why ſhould our garments be of any other colour? why ſhould
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:47750:257"/>
oyl be wanting to our heads, when the eyes of our Faith ſee thee thus aſcended? It is for us, O Saviour, that thou art gone to prepare a place in thoſe celeſtiall manſions; it is for us that thou ſitteſt at the right hand of Majeſty. It is a piece of thy Divine Prayer to thy Father, that <hi>thoſe whom he hath given thee, may be with thee.</hi> To every blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Soul thou ſaieſt ſtill as thou didſt to <hi>Peter, Whither I goe thou canſt not follow me now, but thou ſhalt follow me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</hi> In aſſured hope of this Glory, why do I not rejoyce, and beforehand walk in white with thine Angels, that at the laſt I may walk with thee in white?</p>
            <p>Little would the preſence of theſe Angels have availed, if they had not been heard as well as ſeen. They ſtand not ſilent therefore, but, directing their ſpeech to the amazed beholders, ſay, <hi>Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing into Heaven?</hi> What a queſtion was this? Could any of thoſe two hundred and forty eyes have power to turn themſelves off to any other Object then that Cloud, and that point of Heaven where they left their aſcended Saviour? Surely eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them were ſo fixed, that had not the ſpeech of theſe Angels called them off, there they had ſet up their reſt till the darkneſs of night had interpoſed. Pardon me, O ye Bleſſed Angels; had I been there with them, I ſhould alſo have been unwilling to have mine eyes pull'd off from that dear proſpect, and diverted unto you. Never could they have gazed ſo happily as now. If but ſome Great man be advanced to Honour over our heads, how apt we are to ſtand at a gaze, and to eye him as ſome ſtrange meteor? Let the Sun but ſhine a little upon theſe Dialls, how are they look'd at by all paſſengers? Yet, alas! what can earthly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement make us other then we are, duſt and aſhes; which the higher it is blown, the more it is ſcattered? Oh how worthy is the King of Glory to command our eyes now in the higheſt pitch of his Heavenly exaltation? Lord, I can never look enough at the place where thou art; but what eye could be ſatisfied with ſeeing the way that thou wenteſt?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="510" facs="tcp:47750:258"/>It was not the purpoſe of theſe Angels to check the long looks of theſe faithfull Diſciples after their aſcended Maſter; it was onely a change of Eyes that they intended, of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall for Spirituall, of the eye of Senſe for the eye of Faith. <hi>This ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner as ye have ſeen him goe into Heaven.</hi> Look not after him, O ye weak Diſciples, as ſo departed that ye ſhall ſee him no more; if he be gone, yet he is not loſt; thoſe Heavens that received him ſhall reſtore him; neither can thoſe Bleſſed manſions decreaſe his Glory. Ye have ſeen him aſcend upon the chariot of a bright Cloud; and in the clouds of Heaven ye ſhall ſee him deſcend again to his laſt Judgment. He is gone: can it trouble you to know you have an Advocate in Heaven? Strive not now ſo much to exerciſe your bodily eyes in looking after him, as the eyes of your Souls in looking for him.</p>
            <p>Ye cannot, O ye Bleſſed Spirits, wiſh other then well to mankind. How happy a diverſion of eyes and thoughts is this that you adviſe? If it be our ſorrow to part with our Saviour, yet to part with him into Heaven it is our comfort and felicity: if his abſence could be grievous, his return ſhall be happy and glorious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Even ſo, Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</hi> In the mean while it is not Heaven that can keep thee from me, it is not Earth that can keep me from thee. Raiſe thou up my Soul to a life of Faith with thee: let me ever injoy thy converſation, whilſt I expect thy return.</p>
