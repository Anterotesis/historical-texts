            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Send you the following good news, which I hope will put an end to our reſtleſs Phanaticks troubling our peace for the future. On Thurſday the 22th of <hi>July</hi> 1680, the General of the Kings Forces having notice that Mr. <hi>Cameron</hi> (that Trumpet of Sedition and Rebellion) who lately emitted that moſt Treaſonable and horridly Rebellious Declaration againſt the Kings moſt Sacred Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, was with a conſiderable party of Horſe and Foot in <hi>Craford-John</hi> near <hi>Lanericke,</hi> he immediately commanded Sir <hi>Alexander Bruce</hi> of <hi>Earls-hall,</hi> Lieutenant to Captain <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> of <hi>Clever-houſe,</hi> to take his Troop, and a Troop of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and go in ſearch of the Rebels; who having diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Cameron</hi> and his Party, who conſiſted of one Hundred men, moſt Horſe, he Attacqued them ſo briskly, that they were forced to Retreat, and betook them to a great Marſh or Bogg, where the Kings Horſe could not come at them; upon which, Sir <hi>Alexander Bruce</hi> commanded his Troop and Dragoons to diſmount and quit their Horſe, and with great Bravery charg'd the Rebels on foot, though with great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and after a ſharp diſpute for half an hour, <hi>Camerons</hi> Party was totally Defeated, himſelf and Fourteen of his men killed on the place (though fighting the Battles of the Lord, as himſelf preacht ſome days before) and ſix Priſoners taken, amongſt which was that Notorious Murderer of the Archbiſhop of St. <hi>Andrews, Haxton</hi> of <hi>Rachilet,</hi> amongſt the dead were two more of thoſe Murderers. The Priſoners were brought hither this night, together with <hi>Camerons</hi> Head, which was carried upon a Poll through the ſtreets by the common Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and ſo fare all, who oppoſes the Kings Perſon or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as now eſtabliſhed by Law,</p>
