            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TAILORS TRAVELS, from LONDON, TO THE ISLE of WIGHT: VVith his Returne, and occasion of his Iourney.</p>
            <p>THE occasion why I undertooke this Insulary Journey or Voyage from one Island to another, was for three Respects: First, I had a great importunate desire to see my Gracious Soveraigne afflicted Lord and Master: Secondly, I travelled with an intent to get some Silver in this Iron Age, (for pleasure and profit should be the reward of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and harmelesse paines taking.) Before I began this high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perambulation, I did put forth many Bills to divers and sundry friends, to pay me some small sums of that pretious thing called Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at my returne; the purport, purpose, pretence, signification, meaning, or marrow-bone of the Bill, were these following words.</p>
            <p>When <hi>John Taylor</hi> hath beene from <hi>London</hi> to the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and returned againe, and that at his returne, he doe give or cause to be given to me, a Booke or Pamphlet of true newes and relations of Passages at the Island, and to and fro in his Iourney; I doe promise to give to him or his assignes, the summe of what I please in Lawfull money of England, provided that the sayd summe be not under 6 pence.</p>
            <p>NOW at my returne, if all my Customers doe pay me according to the Bill then am I exceedingly deceived; but if none of them doe pay me, then I am meerely couzened; and now begins the Story.</p>

            <p>And thus have I truly, and merrily told the passages and Relations, how I came to the Royall captiving Isle of <hi>Wight.</hi> Now it followes requisitely, that I certifie you of some Occurrences, and accidents there. It is to be noted, that the Gentlemen with their wives, having such faire, and speedy passage from <hi>Southampton</hi> to the Island, that at the Towne called <hi>Cowes</hi> they had two horses, which they left with their maides with me 'till the morning, for me to bring by land to <hi>Newport</hi> where His Majesty was: they with their wives tooke a small Boat about midnight, having the tide with them to carry them that Saturday night (or neare Sunday) 3 miles up by water to <hi>Newport</hi>: so they left me.</p>
            <p>All the fagge end of the Saturday night, and part of Sunday morning, I had the happinesse to be <hi>Iohn amongst the Maides,</hi> for we honestly lay in 2 beds in one chamber, but I would have no man so mad to imagine that we lay all three both together.</p>
            <p>Sunday the 22. of <hi>October</hi> we arose with the <hi>Sun,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the houres of the careles number of 6 and 7 (he is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49531:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
carelesse that sets all at 6 and 7) we quickly made our selves as fine as could be, in hope to see fine folkes, and fine things at Court, and so we mounted our Polfreys: (the Hostler of the Princes Armes at <hi>Cowes,</hi> being hired to be our Guide) who did ride before one Maid, and my selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the other, and so (by consequence) both the Maides were behinde us.</p>
            <p>The Hostler that should have guided me, guided himselfe, Riding before me, and leaving me behinde him sometimes a flight shoot or two; for he had many advantages of me; first he had the stronger horse, secondly he had the lighter carriage (for the Maide behinde him was like <hi>Lent,</hi> light, leane, and lank) but my Female Male was like <hi>Shrove-Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> fat, fair, plump, well fed, and weighty; thirdly he had two spurres, and a switch, of all which necessaries I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute, and without switch or spurre my horse would not goe.</p>
            <q>
               <l>And now a dirty tale I meane to tell:</l>
               <l>Ile show you what befell, and how I fell.</l>
            </q>
            <p>My ungodly Guide being much before me, within: mile of <hi>Newport,</hi> I came to a boggy-quagmire miry, rotten, filthy, dirty, <hi>slow,</hi> through, over, or into which I must passe; I not knowing the way, called alowd to the Guide to come back to direct me, which he did; but I having no switch or spurre (for correction) the horse would obey no direction; so that at last the Guide said there was no danger, but that I might ride through it any where.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Then I with kicking set my heeles to horse,</l>
               <l>Advent'ring to ride through it force perforce:</l>
               <l>My Guides misguiding made me much the bolder</l>
               <l>The horse fell in, quite plung'd up to the shoulder.</l>
               <l>I forward fell, and backward fell the Maid,</l>
               <l>Man, Maide, and horse in curious pickle laid,</l>
               <l>And never Eare did heare, or Eye did see</l>
               <l>Such a pair-Royall faire Triplicity.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49531:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>The danger past, we each on other gaping;</l>
               <l>Not angry, or well pleas'd, we fell to scraping:</l>
               <l>Sometimes we fretted, and our lips did bite,</l>
               <l>And somtimes (at our selves) we laught out right.</l>
               <l>I scrapt my selfe: the Maide, the Hostler drest.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Horse</hi> lookt on, uncurried like a beast.</l>
               <l>Thus we to <hi>Newport</hi> came in gay attire,</l>
               <l>Embredred over all with dirt and mire:</l>
               <l>And thus from <hi>Cowes</hi> we tumbled in the slowes,</l>
               <l>Man, Maide, and horse, moil'd like three beastly sowes:</l>
               <l>'Twas my base guide that put me in this trim,</l>

               <l>And that same stinking Hostler misled me.</l>

            <p>For which:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>First in a Knaves skinne I will wrap him hot,</l>

            <p>His Majesty, with an Heroick and unconquered patience, conquers his unmatchable afflictions, and with Christian constancy, expects a happy deliverance out of all his trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. His greatest griefe is the calamity of his people, and Kingdomes, and His chiefest endevours (on earth) is to settle them in Peace and happinesse; for which end he is twice every day (with his meniall servants) upon his knees, in publique prayers to his God, besides his frequent, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cogitations, and ejaculations; and it is not to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but the prayers, and humble Petitions of His Majesty (with those of His loyall Subjects) do ascend to the Throne of Grace, from whence (by the Almightyes mercy) strong and firme faith assures him of Peace, pardon, and the fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of future happinesse.</p>
            <p>And for infallible Testimonies against all Ignorant, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, detracting, mis-believing Heretiques, Schismatiques, and Sectaries to assure those Buzards of incredulity, that the Gracious, favourable, and preserving hand of God is with His Majesty, whereby he hath been a blessed instrument, (not onely in his former curing the griefe, or disease called the Evill) but since he came into this Island, He hath cured many, of whom so cured, there are 6 or 7 most remarkable, which I will relate as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. At a Towne called <hi>Winburne,</hi> (or <hi>Wimborne</hi>) in <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetshire,</hi> there dwels an<note n="*" place="margin">For testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the truth of this there is one <hi>Iohn New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> a Cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker, who dwels in Newport in the streete cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Castle Hole, this man did come over the water with her, and did see her lame, and cured.</note> Ancient woman, the Wife to a Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier (whose name I could not know by enquiry;) this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had a long time been so lame that she could not goe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49531:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and she hearing that the King was lodg'd in <hi>Carisbrook</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> she was perswaded in her minde that His Majesty could cure her, in which beliefe she made towards the Island, and with horse or Cart, or both, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaies, she was brought to Hurst Castle in <hi>Hampshire</hi> by land, from whence she was carried into a Boat in mens armes, which Boat brought her to <hi>Newport,</hi> from whence she was carried a mile to <hi>Carisbrook,</hi> where His Majesty did touch her, and her lamenesse ceased in three dayes space, so that with thankes to God, and prayers for the King, she departed from the Island, and went home 20. miles on foot. This was before the Treaty began, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the midst of August last.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mistresse <hi>Elizabeth Steevens</hi> of <hi>Durley</hi> in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> came from her borne to <hi>Winchester,</hi> and from thence to the Island to His Majesty to be cured of the evill, whereof she had been blinde of one Eye 16. daies and could not open her Eye by any meanes, and after the King had touched her, her Eye opened and she saw immediatly, with a clear and perfect sight. This was about the seventh of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Elizabeth Gage</hi> of <hi>Southampton</hi> (being 3 yeares of age) was exceeding lame, and in great paine, she came to his Majesty, and he touched her, whereby (through Gods blessing) she was presently cured.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Ioane Mathewes,</hi> aged 15. yeares, a Braziers Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one <hi>William Mathewes,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Newport</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> she had been long time painefully lame, and had been at the <hi>Bathe,</hi> and used many medicines in vaine; she came to the King on Thursday the 19. of October, He toucht her, and she had present ease, and every day shee goes better then other: myselfe saw her and spake with her, and I left her able to go reasonable well.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A Souldier in <hi>Calshot</hi> Castle in <hi>Hampshire,</hi> had 2. sore issues in his thighes, to which he did frequently apply me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which eased him, but cured him not: This man
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49531:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
went to the Island to His Majesty, who did touch him, and he did after that use his former medicines, which were wont to give him ease, but then the said application did most grievously vex and torment him; so that he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to forbeare to use the said Oyles, Emplasters, and Unguents, and then he was suddenly cured.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Mistresse <hi>Elizabeth Paine</hi> of <hi>Bristell</hi> was blinde, and such a Rhewmatick defluxion did dayly fall from her eyes, which did wet two or three large hancherchiefes every day; she came to the King on Sunday last, the 5. of this November, His Majesty did touch her eyes, the Rhewme ceased; so that she went away presently with a cleere and perfect sight; and two houres after she came to the King againe, and gave him thanks upon her knees; His Majesty bade her give thanks to God; so she with giving God praise, and prayers for the King, went from the Island to <hi>Bristoll</hi> with exceeding joy for her recovery.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Margaret Hezden,</hi> aged 73. yeares, dwelling in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> in <hi>Chayne</hi> lane, was not able to stir but as she was lifted from bed to chaire, and from chaire to bed, touched by His Majesty, and cured, so that with one crutch she did goe about her house, and drew 5 or 6. pots of Ale for me, and my company.</p>
            <p>These things (me thinkes) should move the mindes of some unmannerly Levellers to esteeme his Majesty as one that is not to be ranked or filed with common men.</p>
            <p>Concerning any Newes of business at the Treaty, there is so much made of it at <hi>London,</hi> that there is little (or none at all) at the Court; this is certaine, that from the 21. of <hi>October,</hi> till the first of <hi>November,</hi> (being 11. dayes) there was no debating or treating at all: for Sir <hi>Peter Killegr<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> things were silent, however the London Mercuries, and Moderate Occurrances did not faile to set forth newes (o<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their owne making) every weeke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49531:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>All that I can relate, is, that Sir <hi>Peter</hi> came to the King on Tuesday night, the last of <hi>October,</hi> and the next day (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>quondam</hi> All Saints) His Majesty, with the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners began to Treate, where it was agreed that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Governement in the Church should continue three yeares, that the Booke of Common Prayer should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, and not used publickly: That no Masse should be tollerated to be sayd in the Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in the Principallity of <hi>Wales</hi>: These matters of high consequence being concluded and agreed, there is great hope of speedy restauration of His Majesty to His just Rights, and a blessed peace for the Church, people, and Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>I came from the Island on Tuesday the 7. of <hi>November,</hi> and landed at a place called Hell Head, from thence I came 3 miles to <hi>Titchfield,</hi> on Wednesday I came 4 miles to <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Thursday to <hi>Warnford,</hi> (7. miles) Fryday I footed it 17. miles to <hi>Alton,</hi> and to <hi>Farnham,</hi> Saturday to <hi>Guilford,</hi> and to <hi>Cobham</hi> 18. miles, and Sunday 6 miles to <hi>Kingston,</hi> and on Munday the 13. of <hi>November,</hi> I came to <hi>London</hi> 10. Miles.</p>
            <p>And as I have written, merrily, truely, and impartially; so I must conclude accordingly without flattery, concerning thu <hi>Governour</hi> of the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> Colonel <hi>Hammand</hi>: the plaine truth is, that my selfe (with many others) did hate him so much, that he was very seldome or never prayed for; the reasons and motives which possest most men with this mistaking and misapplyed inveterate mallice, was upon the flying, lying reports, that the <hi>Governour</hi> had behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self most coursly ridged, and barbarously unrespective to His Majesty: The false weekely Pamphlets and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleteers (being inspired by their Father the Divell) were not ashamed to publish in print, that the Governour had proceeded so far it, incivility, as to immure or wall His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty in a small close roome, under many bolts, bars, grates, locks and keyes, and debarred Him the comforts of His
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49531:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
soule, and of the seociety of men; and further it was often printed (by severall lying Villaines) that the sayd Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <hi>Hammond,</hi> did strike the King on the face, and gave Him a black eye: These reports being invented by the Devills Imps (the firebrands of contention) printed and published by needy, greedy Knaves and Varlets, and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by too many Fooles and foolish Gotehamists (amongst which number, I with much simplicity was one;) and as by Oath and duty I am bound to serve, love, and honour my Soveraigne Lord and Master; so (on the contrary) my selfe with all true and Loyall Subjects had no cause to be well affected to any man that should dare to affront His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty with such transcended base indignities.</p>
            <p>But to give the world satisfaction of the truth; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all those aspersions and rumours against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, are most odious, scandalous, and malicious lies; for (according to the trust reposed in him) he hath alwayes carried him selfe with such deportment, and humblenesse of dutifull service to His Majesty, that he hath gained much love and favour from his Soveraigne, and such good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard from all knowing men, as belongs to a Gentleman of his place and Quallity.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>And therefore Reader understand and note,</l>
               <l>Who ever sayes I lye, he lies in's throate.</l>
