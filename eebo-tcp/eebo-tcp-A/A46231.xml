         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have thought good to anticipate somthing touching FOUR-FOOTED
BEASTS in general: which I trust I shall have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
performed, when I shall have praemised to you some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Name, the Parts, Place, Food, Growth, Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Life, Animal actions, Use and Differences</hi> thereof.
Now under the denomination of These,<note place="margin">Name.</note> are to be by us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Those Animals which, being of a middle nature between
the airy and the waterish, are for the most part covered with hair, somtimes with shells,
and do go upon four feet. I should call them, after the Greek idiom, <hi>Tetrapoda</hi> four-footed,
<hi>Tetrakola</hi> having four members or parts, <hi>Tetraskele</hi> four legg'd, and <hi>Tetrabamona</hi>
such as walk on four.<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 39.</note> In all the rest there is a manifold and incomprehensible varietie,
which, if you should well consider, would strike you with astonishment.</p>
            <p>Please first to view with me the <hi>outward Parts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</note> They which bring forth living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
have <hi>hairs;</hi> which produce eggs, a shell. The hairs of Horses are seen in their
large manes, so the locks of Lyons on their shoulders: and in Coneys within their
cheeks and feet. The Hare is of all living creatures the most hairy. The hairs grow
thicker in all with age. In the Horse onely they contract a grayness. Swine and porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
are covered with bristles, Sheep with wool, Goats have their beards hanging
down from their chin. The <hi>Hide</hi> of the Sea-horse is so thick, that out of it are formed
turned-spears: that also of the Elephant and Rhinoceros is almost impenetrable. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
is Natures wantonness,<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 37.</note> or lavishness, more evident than in the Horns. <hi>These It
spreads abroad into branches, as in the Harts. To Others it gives single Ones, as in the Harts
call'd Spitters which have young horns without tines. The horns of Others hath it fashioned as the
palms of hands spread abroad, and hath shot out fingers from them, whence they call them Platyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rota's</hi>
Broad-horned beasts. <hi>To the Roes, or wild Goats, hath it given horns with branches, but
little: neither hath it made them hanging down. Such as are circularly convolved or wound about,
as a worlebat, are given to the Rams: unlucky ones to Bulls. To the wild Goats of the Rocks,
such as are crookedly writhen backwards, to the Fallow-Deer on the contrary, forwards. Such as
stand bolt upright, and twined with the compassing about of wrinckles and sharpened lightly toward
the top, to the Strepsiceros</hi> a Beast half wild and half tame, <hi>which in</hi> Africa <hi>they call an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dax.
Those are moveable, as are ears, which be found among the herds in</hi> Phrygia: <hi>Those of the
Troglodyts</hi> (so called from their inhabiting in caverns) <hi>grow directly toward the earth, by
reason whereof they must turn their necks awry when they feed. To Others onely one horn is given,
and that in the middle of the head, or on the nose. To Some also are given horns of strength to run
on in a forcible assault; to Others, for striking withall. Some are hooked, Others contrariwise
<pb facs="tcp:59579:2"/>
crooking upwards. In Some they are cast in various manners, lying along, turned about, entangled
together: all of them tending toward a sharp point.</hi> To all them and them onely who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create
a living creature are given Ears, and they are movable. In Some they are less,
in Others greater. In the Harts onely they are cloven, and as it were divided: in
Ratts they are full of hairs. In Horses and all kind of labouring cattell they show
the tokens of the mind: in the weary they are flagging: panting or trembling in
the fearfull: standing upright in the raging: hanging loose in the sick. The Dog,
the Lion, and those which live upon hunting for the prey have the <hi>Mouth</hi> so cut open
as to gape wide; 't is of a middle size in the Swine. <hi>The snout or trunk</hi> is onely in the
Elephant. <hi>The Jaws</hi> in labouring cattell are long, in Apes round. <hi>The Neck</hi> in the
Lion onely, and the Wolf and <hi>the subtil Beast</hi> Hyaena is stiffened with each of them one
bone.<note place="margin">Plin H. N. l. 11. c. 42.</note> Touching the <hi>Paps or Teats</hi> this is observed by <hi>Pliny: The Beasts which have whole
hoofs, and bring not forth above two young at once, these all have two paps, and not otherwhere
than between the thighs: the cloven-footed and horned in the same place. The Cows have four,
the Sheep and Goats two. Those which are fruitfull with a numerous brood at once, and have
toes or claws in their feet, have many more along their whole belly, in a double rank, as the
Swine: the nobler sort have twelve, the vulgar fewer by two: in like manner the Bitches of
Dogs. Others have four in the middle part of the belly, as the Panthers: Others two, as the
Lionesses. The Elephant onely hath two under the shoulders; not in his breast, but on the side
hid under the arm-holes. None have any between their thighs which have claws on their feet.</hi>
They who live upon the prey have <hi>Claws,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 43.</note> five in the foremost feet, four in the rest.
Lions, Wolvs, Dogs, and a few other beasts have also in their after-feet five nails,
one whereof hangs close by the joining on of the leg:<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 45. &amp; 46.</note> the rest which are less have five
claws. All those that have toes or claws, have also <hi>Nails.</hi> But the Apes have them
bowed or roof-like rising up: the ravenous crooked: in the rest they stand right
out, as in dogs, except that which commonly hangs upon the leg. They have solid
or whole <hi>Hoofs</hi> which bear no horns: but the horned are cloven-footed. They
say that the Swine in some places of <hi>Illyria (Sclavonia)</hi> have whole hoofs. They are
renewed onely in that kind of beasts which bear burdens.<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 51.</note> Lastly, they have all <hi>Tails,</hi>
except Apes, and those that bring forth eggs, according to the need of their bodies.
<hi>They are bare in those that are rugged, or have bristles, as in boars: little in those that are full of
hairs, or wolly, as in bears: in those that are very long they are full of hard hair, as in horses.
Being cut off they renew again in lizards. In kine the tail is longest of all, and at the lowest
part long-hair'd. The same are longer in asses than in horses, but in those that bear burdens,
full of rough hairs: Lions have them in the lowest part as they are in Oxen and in Rats: with
the Panthers not so: with Foxes and Wolvs they are full of rough, or flock-like hair, as in Sheep,
but longer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No less is the diversity of the <hi>Inward Parts.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Internal Parts.</note> The <hi>Teeth</hi> in the brawn and wild boar
stick right out: in the Dog and the Lion, like as if they were indented or sawed: in
the Horse and Ox they stand close together; the foremost are sharp, those more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
are plain: The horned beasts want the one row: they stick not out in any,
where they are as sawed: none that have horns do either stick out or are sawed: but
in all these they are hollow, in others solidly fixt: they are in apes as in men. In
those that chew the cud, in the lion and the dog they are various or interchanged. In
Swine they never fall out. The <hi>Tongue</hi> in Crocodiles cleaveth wholly fast: in Lions
and Catts it is very rough and sharp, like a file. In the Elephant especially broad. <hi>The
Ribs</hi> in Swine are ten, in horned beasts thirteen. <hi>The Heart</hi> in all of them is in the
middle of the breast. In that of horses, oxen and harts are bones found. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
the greatest in mice, hares, rabbets, deer, hyaena's, and in all beasts
that through timidity become mischievous. <hi>The Lung</hi> is in the Tortoise without
bloud: In the Chamaeleon 't is according to proportion the greatest, and nothing
else within. <hi>The Belly</hi> in those that are whole-hoofd is rough and hard: in some of the
<pb facs="tcp:59579:2"/>
Land-beasts it hath a sharpness as of teeth, in others toothed, yet like a lattise. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the bellies of those that chew the cud we have spoken in the second book. <hi>The
Spleen</hi> in round in the double-hoof'd &amp; horn'd beasts: drawn out long-ways in those
that have many claws: very long in those that are whole-hoof'd: the lest in the
cattel that are in the region of <hi>Asia</hi> which is called <hi>Scepsis.</hi> All they which generate a
living creature have <hi>Reins:</hi> of those which bring forth eggs, onely the Tortoise.
None of those that bring forth eggs, except the Tortoise, have <hi>a Bladder:</hi> also
none, save those that have a bloudy lung: and none of them that want feet. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>the Fat</hi> and <hi>Tallow</hi> it is observed,<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 37.</note> 
               <hi>the Horned Beasts which are toothed but on
one side, and which have pastern-bones in their feet, abound with tallow; the double-hoof'd
and those that have their feet slit into toes, and are not horned, with fat. The tallow is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
together, and when it is cold it's brittle; and is always in the end of the flesh. On the
contrary the fat is between the flesh and the skin moistened with juice. Some grow not fat:
all that are fat are more barren.</hi> The Marrow <hi>in young beasts is reddish and in those of old
age it grows white: this is onely in hollow bones, neither is it in the thighs or shanks of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
cattell or dogs: it abounds in those that are fat; it is like tallow in the horned beasts:
in Bears there is none, in the Lion among the bones of his thighs and arms very little.</hi> And so
much of the parts.</p>
            <p>Nature hath designed the earth as <hi>the Place</hi> for most of them:<note place="margin">Place.</note> and the water to
a few of them, as to the Crocodile, the Sea-horse, the Castor, the Sea-tortoise.
Some of these and the other have certain dens or lurking places: some dwell among
the trees. You may find some in a cold, others in a hot climate: some things in
the same soil are denied to some of them.<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 8. c. 58.</note> In <hi>Cilicia</hi> (others read Lycia) <hi>the Bucks
and Does pass not over the mountains that border on the Syrians: the wild Asses go not over
the mountain that divides Cappadocia from Cilicia. On the coast by Hellespont the Harts do
not go to and fro to other territories: and about Argenusa they do not go beyond that lofty
mountain. In the Island Pordoselene</hi> (or Poroselene) <hi>the weasels run not over the way:
the Moles of Baeotia brought over into Lebadia avoid the very soil, which yet in Orchomenus,
which is close by, do root up whole fields. The Hares brought over into Ithaca die, and
that upon the uttermost shores: in Ebusus there are no Rabbets. Among the Cyrenians they
have had frogs that were dumb: but the kind of those Croakers brought out of the Continent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
still. In Olympus a mountain of Macedonia are no Wolvs, nor in the Island Creta
(now Candia.) 'Tis more wonderful, that there are no Harts in that Island, except in
the region of Cydon. In Africa are neither wild Boars, nor Harts, nor Goats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'T is likewise in vain to look for an uniformity <hi>in their Food.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Food.</note> Oxen, or kine,
Harts, Horses, Swine feed on herbs and fruits: the lower sort whereof is the food
of Sheep; the higher, as branches and twigs, of Goats. Wolvs, Lions and Dogs
delight in flesh: Beavers and Catts in fish: The Chamaeleon in flies. Some chaw
their victuals, some not. You may perhaps rightly reckon the Apes and Monkeys
among those that eat all things. It is believed, that the Bear lives in his dens in the
winter, out of that humour, or moisture, which he sucks out of his fore-feet, which
then swell.</p>
            <p>Touching their Generation take this,<note place="margin">Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> That Some bring forth without <hi>copulation,</hi>
as the Mice in <hi>Egypt</hi> after the running back of the <hi>Nile.</hi> Those that admit of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
do it most in autumn, summer or the spring: the Bulls and Bears do it
with raging violence, the Dogs not. The greatest number bring forth their young
alive; the Tortoises,<note place="margin">Resend. Antiq. Lusit. l. 1.</note> Crocodiles, Lizards, &amp;c eggs. I learn from <hi>Resendus</hi> that
Mares in <hi>Portugal</hi> conceive a mole (lump of unshapen flesh) from wind; and from
Others, that Cows being big do carry their young onely on the right side of the
womb, even when they carry twins. Their time <hi>of Going with young</hi> wonderfully
varies. The Wolf goes a moneth or at the utmost XL. days; the Dog (Bitch)
nine weeks; the Sow four moneths; the Goat five; the Sheep about six; the Cow
<pb facs="tcp:59579:3"/>
ten; the Horse eleven. The same (variety) must you understand of <hi>the number of their
young:</hi> the Mule, as is believed, never brings forth: the Wolf but once in it's life:
the Hare brings forth abundantly.</p>
            <p>Of <hi>their Augmentation</hi> it may suffice to say,<note place="margin">Growth.</note> that the Whole-hoof'd and Two-hoof'd
are greater than they that have claws (or fingers) except the Rhinoceros, the Camel,
the Sea-horse, &amp;c. and they differ in greatness from the those of the same kind according
to their places. In the Region of <hi>Camadu</hi> the Rams are not less than the Asses: About
<hi>Taprobane</hi> the Tortoises are so great that they weigh CIII. pounds: the Lizards in <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi>
are eight Cubits long.</p>
            <p>Some of them have a long,<note place="margin">Life.</note> Others a short <hi>Life.</hi> Hares and Cats attain onely to
the seventh year: the Ram and the Goat seldom to the tenth: the Sow arrives at the
twentieth: the Dog somtimes at the same: the Cow scarce exceeds sixteen: Horses
(the male-kind) somtimes reach the thirtieth year: yea the seventy fifth year, as we
read in <hi>Pliny.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 8. c. 42. &amp; 43.</note> 'Tis evident from the monuments <hi>of the Athenians,</hi> that a Mule hath
lived eighty years: and that the Harts have lived a hundred years you may find in

            <p>Unto <hi>the Animal Actions</hi> appertain <hi>the external</hi> and <hi>internal senses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Animal Actions.</note> 
               <hi>their appetites,</hi> and
<hi>their faculties of removing from place to place.</hi> The Bucks (and Does) and Lynx excell <hi>in
sight:</hi> the Hyenae and Cats see by night: the Moles little or nothing: the Hares are
quick of <hi>hearing:</hi> Camels, Harts and <hi>Lybian</hi> Mares are delighted with the musick of
the pipe: every one knows that Dogs are excellent at <hi>smelling:</hi> Swine have so little
(Smell) that they are not moved with the stench of filthy mud: the Ape exceeds us
<hi>in tasting,</hi> as the vulgar vers runs. If we take notice of their <hi>Inward (senses,)</hi> Some
are exceedingly stupid, as <hi>the Buff,</hi> who, if his head be coverd, thinks his whole
body to be hid; Others are most acute: there is nothing that the Apes do not imitate:
Foxes, ere they go over the ice, first by laying their ears to it, find out it's thickness:
Dogs remember journeys though very long: neither have any, except Man, a greater
memory. Harts, when they hear the barking of dogs, run along with the wind, that
therewith the sent of their footsteps might go farther off. For the rest you may look
in the chapters of Horses,<note place="margin">Cicero de Nat. Deor. l. 2. Plin. H. N. l. 8. c. 27.</note> Goats, Wolvs, and Others. But it is mostly to be wondred
at that so many four-footed beasts do know the things whereby they may be cured
of their diseases. The Panther seeks Mans dung. The Tortoise recovers it's strength
against serpents by feeding on Savory or Marjoram, or, as Some will have it, Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royal:
the Weasel by (eating of) Rue,<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 28. c. ult.</note> in its hunting of mice, when it is environed
with them in battel: the Cow in <hi>Cyprus</hi> cures itself against it's torments in the belly
by the excrements of men. In their <hi>Appetite, their Love</hi> and <hi>Lust</hi> especially shows it self:
so great is that of Apes toward their young, that <hi>they kill a great part of them by embracing
them.</hi> Sows swelling with lust are carried on with that fury that they would tear a
man:<note place="margin">Livius l. 41.</note> the Bulls also are so greatly furious, as <hi>that the brazen Cow at</hi> Syracuse, <hi>was enter'd
upon, and bespattered with seed by a wild Bul which had wandered from the heard.</hi> On the
contrary the Camel shuns copulation in open view.<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 8. c. 42.</note> 
               <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, that a Horse, his
eyes being uncovered, and he thereby seeing that he had copulated with his dam,
fell down a steep place, and so died. Touching their <hi>Motion</hi> we know that Some are
swift, Others slow. <hi>Xenophon</hi> believed, that no living creature doth aequall the Hare
in running. But <hi>Horace,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Xenoph. l. de Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione.</note> when he would express a most speedy carefulness, said
<hi>swifter than Harts:</hi> the Elck makes so long a journey in one day, as a horse doth in
three. I will say nothing of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Asses: for the common Asses are most slow, as
is also the Tiger, as <hi>Bontius</hi> informs us.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgot to speak of <hi>their Voice:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Voice.</note> of which ne'retheless there is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
variety in this sort of living creatures. For the Horse neighs, or hinneys: the
Bul low's, bellow's, or rowts: the Ass howls: the Ram clatters: the Sheep bleats:
the Swine grunts: the wild Boar grunts and cries out aloud with grinning: the Hart
<pb facs="tcp:59579:3"/>
and wild Ass clucks or cackles: the Goat chatters: the Lion roars: the Tygers
voice is hoars: the Panther cries: the Libbard waws as a cat: the Wolf howls: the
Elephant bray's: the Dog barks: the Fox yelps: the Kitling mew's: the Hare cries
like a child: the Mouse chirps or squeaks: the Weasel maketh a noise with it's teeth:
the Rat also, with the sawing of it's teeth: the Frog croaks.</p>
            <p>But let us come to <hi>their Use.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Use.</note> For no man will deny that they are made of God for
our benefit. Hence they are to us <hi>Aliment</hi> or nourishment, <hi>Medicin, Cloathing,</hi> and for
<hi>other Uses. Nourishment:</hi> For those that are covered with hair supply us with milk,
out of which is made butter and chees: the labouring cattel give us flesh, as do
also those which live in desarts, Harts, Fallow-deer, Boars, the Elck and others.
Neither are we onely provided for with necessaries; Nature hath not forgot to
store us also with delicacies: <hi>Martial</hi> calls the flesh of the Hare <hi>the chief daintie:</hi> the
flesh also of a tame Swine may so be seasoned or drest fiftie severall ways, that
they may seem to be so many sorts of wild Boars flesh. <hi>Medicaments:</hi> For they have
taught us some: 'tis not one alone wherewith they supply us: we have it from
the Weasel and Tortoise that savory and rue are available against venoms. The
Sea-hors hath taught us the art of bloud-letting by opening veins: the Harts have
led us to the knowledge of this, that dittany is good to draw darts (out of the
flesh.) You may consult History touching remedies against diseases. <hi>Cloathing:</hi> We
have great advantage from the cattel by the use of their skins: we are beholden to
them for the preservation of our bodies. The richest of the <hi>Caspian</hi> people made
their garments of Camels hairs: those (garments) also are made of wool which
<hi>Gaesar</hi> called <hi>subcoacta compressed,</hi> Helmodus Presbiter <hi>feltra &amp; filtra</hi> felts, the same
with those called by the Greeks <hi>Pileta</hi> and <hi>Pilota:</hi> Out of these or of the quilted
coverings made of course wool or flocks, or out of hides the soldiers made coats
or coverings, wherewith they might avoid the darts. The Dead ones supply us
with skins. The first coats that God made, were out of these. <hi>Hercules</hi> was cloathed
with the skin of a Lion. The ancient <hi>German</hi> Garments that covered their shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and breasts were made of Sheep-skins: their start-up-shoes and baggs were of
raw hides: the shoes of their more noble persons were of tawed and dressed lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
lastly the <hi>Frieslanders,</hi> by the command of <hi>Drusius,</hi> brought the hides of
Oxen into military use. Touching <hi>other Uses</hi> I shall onely say this: That Dogs
serve for our preservation: Cats defend the meat from the Mice: the Horse, the
Ass, the Mule, the Camel are used for carrying burdens.<note place="margin">Aristot. H. A. l. 5. c. 2.</note> Out of the Nervs or
sinews are made fiddle-strings. With the yard of the Camels are bows best span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or stretched out.<note place="margin">Dionys. Halicarn. l. 2.</note> The cords, wherewith the arms of the dart-shooting bows
are kept together, are twined or wreathed ont of the sinews. Paper is smoothed
or polished with Boars teeth. The vulgar or common servants among the <hi>Romans</hi> were
driven to their places of meeting by certain persons sounding with the horns of oxen.
<hi>Ambrose</hi> said <hi>that wine flowed down mens throats through a horn.</hi> The Barbarous North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
people did certainly drink out of the horns of the wild Bulls. The altar of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo
of Delos</hi> made of horns is accounted among the seven wonders of the world.
<hi>Bulls gall is of mighty vertue, even in copper, and in colouring skins of a golden colour.</hi>
What shall I say of their <hi>Dung?</hi> of the differences whereof <hi>Pliny</hi> thus speaks:<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 17. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Some

            <p>Touching <hi>their Differences</hi>

the whole host of Four-footed Beasts into their severall orders or ranks, the (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing)
History will teach us. First you will meet with the Whole-hoofed; next
Cloven-hoofed, both such as chew the cud, whether horned or not, and those
that chew not the cud: lastly those that have fingers &amp; toes, or claws, both those
who bring forth their young alive, whether on the land or water, and those who
bring forth eggs, which are either cover'd with a shell, or not. But I will not
further proceed herein.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Their nature.</note> they are
very sociable, they sup their drink, and plunge
their nose deep in the water, which is a signe

troubled their Horses. Of <hi>Serpents,</hi> and Horses,
<hi>Silius Ital.</hi> hath written. The tayl of a Trachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus
hung at a Mares belly, makes her cast her
foal,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 13. c. 27. Plut. Symp. l. 6. q. 8.</note> if we beleeve Aelian. They cannot abide
the sight of a sea-calf. They swound, if they
carry Appels, or Figs; but come to themselves
again, if you lay bread afore them: They will
not touch a kind of barley, that grows in
Thrace, near a Province of the Scythians and
Medes. They run mad, if you smeare their
nostrils with the herb laser, or benjamin. <hi>Gesner</hi>
was informed by an old man, that Gentiana,
or Pelwort, causes Mares to cast fole. If they
tread on henbane, they cast their shoos. If
Horses drink of the River Sybaris, they are
troubled with neezing: if of Cossiniris in
Thrace, that fall into the land of the Abdee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
they run mad. The same is said of a well,
or pit, not far from Potniae a city of Boeotia.
<hi>SIlius Ital.</hi> writes, that Catoes Horse, though

That not onely besieg'd persons have
eaten horse-flesh, as in Verona under Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian
the First, in Novara, under Lewis Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian;
at Rupel, under Lewis 13 of France, to
name no more, but we read that heathens make
it their food the name of the Nomedes, the
Scythians, the Scarmathae, and the late Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
is well knowne; these take pleasure in
wounding and cutting of Horses, and feeding
upon half rawe flesh: they eat Horses dyeing
the day before of themselves, or of a desease,
the impostumed place being cut up; and their
Kings, when they would distribute provisions
amongst them, were wont to give one horse
amongst 40 men. And also amongst the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians
in their Feasts on their bearth-day, they
had set before them whole roasted horses: and
among the Gearmans, they ate both wild and
tame horses, untill it was forbidden by <hi>Gregory</hi>
the III. <hi>Bruerenus</hi> relates,<note place="margin">Bruyer. l. 13. c. 42. Plin. H. N. l. 18. c. 10.</note> that he hath heard
that the Inhabitants of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> eate colts.
<hi>Blood</hi> also hath beene a delicate: <hi>Pliny</hi> indeed
reports that the Sauromatae doe live of hirse,
especially puls, and also rawe meal mingled
with blood out of the thigh vaines. <hi>Mecovius</hi>
and <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> have written, that if tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
be surprized with hunger and thirst,
they satisfie themselves with opening of vaines
and drinking of blood. Wee read in <hi>Horace,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">l. 2. carm.</note>
that the Cancany, who according to some are
Besalte, and according to Acron and Porphiry
are Spanish nations, delighted in the same food.
Concerning <hi>milk</hi> there is no doubt. For the
Scithyans give their children Mares-milke, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone
as they are borne. Thence have they
their names of horse and milke-suckers. The
same lay the milke in the Sun, that the thicker
part may settle downe, and by and by they
seath it. They say that it becomes like white
wine.<note place="margin">Cro. Hist. Polon. l. 29.</note> The Moschy once, the servants of the
Tarters, were wont to present them Mares-milke
upon their journey, as they came with
their Captaine to demand tribute.<note place="margin">l. 4. de morb. l. 28. c. 9.</note> Writers are
not agreed what Hippacks is. <hi>Hypocrates,
Dioscorides,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> write that it is chees,
which he ads smels of vennome, and answers
in proportion to ox-milke, others beleeve it
to be Mares-milke crudled. <hi>Theopompus</hi> writes
that it was Scithian food of Mares-milke;
however it is, we read in Theophrastus that
they could live 11 or 12 days together upon
that and licourise: Hypocrates testifies,<note place="margin">H. P. l. 9. c. 13.</note> that for
the most part they use Mares-milk chees. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is that any wonder, since some relate, that
<hi>Zoroaster</hi> lived once six moneths with milke
alone; which <hi>Atheneus</hi> declares also of another.
As for what belongs to <hi>Medicines,</hi> Horses milk,<note place="margin">Their use in Phisique.</note>
whay, blood, greace, curd, teeth, heart-bone,

their <hi>Milke</hi> is very purgative,<note place="margin">M. M. l. 2. c. 75.</note> as Dioscorides
delivers. <hi>Whay</hi> serves to cleanse the Ulsers of
the reins, to wit that, that by seathing is sever'd
from the milk, if we beleeve Aethius. <hi>Rhasis</hi>
writes that a woman, if shee unwittingly drink
Mares-milk, if shee presently accompany with
her husband, shall conceive. I find also in <hi>Pliny,</hi>
that the same milk is good to wash the matrix.

The <hi>hayr</hi> tied at a doore keepes flies, and the

so many knots within sores in the privities,
helpe them. The ashes of the same taken out
of the head, or belly stops a flux of blood.
Warts are taken away, if you bind a horse hayr
about them, because by tying that that feeds
them is stopt, and so they dry away. The ashes
of their <hi>Hoofs</hi> smeare with oyl, and water on

               <p>The <hi>differences,</hi> or <hi>kinds</hi> of Horses are

grew a proverb, when men spake of any huge

Those of <hi>Biscay</hi> are whitish; brought into the

Those of <hi>Cilicia</hi> payd for tribute 360 white

He delights in reed, that to other

Hence it is, that to the Aegyptians they were so

thus Pliny; their soonest bringing forth is after
30 month old, but a full exact birth after three
years, as it is with Mares, in the same months,
and after the same fashion. The shee-asses
brings forth in the twelfth month, for the most
part but one at once, for so is her nature, yet
twins sometimes, but very rarely. Seven dayes
after she will couple, and then conceives; but
after again shee will take the hee-asse. She is
not wont to doe so, unlesse she bring forth,
afore she loose the tooth, whereby her age is
knowne; but if she bring forth afore, she shall
be fruitfull as long as she lives. She uses to
breed all her life long, that is, till she be 30
years old; when their time comes, they must be
helped by a kind of midwiferie, for their great
toyling weakens them in those parts. They
never let the hee stand idle, for rest makes him
but worse. They bring the hee and shee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
afore the solstice, that is the longest, or
shortest day in the year, that every other year
they may bring forth about the same time,
which they do the twelfth month after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
Thus far <hi>Pliny.</hi> They are use to be
sore teated with breeding, therefore at six
months end they suffer their hee-colts to suck
no more, but suckle their shee-colts almost a
whole year. The breeders have milk in the
tenth month; <hi>Pliny</hi> saith, they are never with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
from the first. If the dames run in rank
pasture, it is deadly for the colts to suck for the
two first dayes after foaling; they call the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease

of as many colours, though all the rest of the
body be of one colour. They are all at <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
with the bird, call'd Aegithus, (that uses to
peck-asses galled backs, because these spoyl
their nests) as also the Spinus, (the Nightingal,
or Thistlefinch.) And among plants, they hate
hemlock most. They use to rub themselves
against thistles, and so wrong the Aegithus his
nest; which shee so dreads, that, hearing but
an Asse bray, she casts out all her eggs, and
the Chickens fall all out. The Spinus hates
the Asse, because he devours so the thistle-flowers,
that she lives upon. If in Hetruria
they eat but hemlocke, they are taken with a
deep sleep, and seaz'd with a senselesnesse, that
they seeme stark dead. Scaliger testifies, that
many with eating thereof fall a yawning, and
then are giddy, and turne round, and fall.

Or if hee, whom a Scorpion hath stung,
whisper the Asse in the eare, saying, a Scorpion

an Asse crop a vine-branch off, from that time
the vine shall take better, and prove more
fruitfull: and that those that have studiously
endeavoured this, have gain'd yearly an ample
vintage. Men use to fetch the water of the

that with her forefeet held up, with great ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,
and anone, as if all her jollity were turn'd
into the deepest sorrow, cast herself all along
on the ground, and there ly stone still, as struck
with an apoplexy, and could not be brought to
stir, with spurning, or kicking: after being bid
to greet all the beholders, shee would, like a

forefeet: and, which was the greatest wonder
of all, shee, to the amazement of the bystan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
would cast her body through a hoop, at

leap through. Lastly, like a dogge, shee would
take up an handkerchief, or glove dropt on

are so fond on their colts, that they will run

the Spanjards did sometime eat it. Wee know
also, that M.D.XVI. at the siege of Verona, it
was counted a dainty, when they used lentils,

their birth-feast-day would rost an Asse whole,
and reckoned it among Princely delicates. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caenas,
saith Pliny, was the first who appointed
Asse-colts in feasts, at that time prefer'd afore
wilde Asses;<note place="margin">H. N. l. 8. c. 43.</note> after his time the tast grew out of
request. That they are ill tasted, and hard of

                  <note place="margin">L. 6. de tuen. sa.</note> Galen saith, their <hi>milk</hi> is thinnest, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with that of the cattell that we use to

and Mares. Unlesse we so distinguish he
must be said to contradict himself; since Pliny
also writes, that camels-milk is thinnest, next
that of Mares, the shee-asses so thick that men
use it in stead of curds. It is best, if she be well,
well fed, young, and shortly after her foaling.
Physitians advise, some of them, that they that
are in a consumption,<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 23. c. 5. 28. c. 12.</note> should suck it themselves,
that it abate not of the native warmth. Galen
prescribe it to yong man, who was wasted
away, mixt with hony, as soon as he came out
of a bath. The same drunke alone refresheth
an exulcerated stomack; and is commended
against a cough, leannes,<note place="margin">H. N. l. 11. c. 41.</note> and spitting of blood.
Drinking it helps a sore breast, as Pliny delivers;
and taken in with hony it helps monthly terms.
It is not good for a weak, or giddy, swimming
head. It helps against parget, ceruse, brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and quicksilver. Gargling it is most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
for exulcerated jaws. There are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of some helped of the gout by drinking
Asses-milk. And some eased of that gowtish
pain, by drinking the whey thereof.<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 41.</note> It is
thought to help somewhat to the making wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens

Nero his Poppaea carried still along with her

cure a quartan ague, if the patient drink three

commends the same taken after the

bleached; whereof a part is softned in a draught
of spring-water, and the water taken in against
frenzy. Aelian witnesses the same of Asses <hi>flesh;</hi>
and that one Bathylis of Candia was recovered
of lunacy thereby, it being prescribed him.
Pliny saith,<note place="margin">Lib. 28. H. N. c. 16.</note> it cures the Tisick, especially in
Achaja: wee read the same in Avicen, who
addes that it is given in against the falling sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The <hi>liver</hi> also eaten helps against the same
disease, but is prescribed to be eaten fasting.
Others advise it to be drop'd into the mouth
mixt with a little of the universall medicine.
The <hi>milt</hi> is so effectuall against the spleen, that
the profit is felt in three dayes usage. The same
beaten to powder, and out of water put on the
breasts brings the milk into them, if we credit
Sextus. The fume is good for old matrices, as
Pliny holds. Their <hi>Reins</hi> in powder given in
pure wine, help the bladder, and to hold the
water. The Asses <hi>genital</hi> is conceived, sayes
Pliny, burnt to ashes to make hayr come thick,
and prevent gray hayrs, if smeare on the new
shaven with oyl, and pounched to powder with
lead. His right <hi>stone</hi> drunke in wine, or bound
to the arme provokes lust. Either of them helps
against witchraft. Wrapping infants in the <hi>skin</hi>
keeps them from frighting.<note place="margin">Plin. l. 10. c. 19.</note> A ring made of

Tarentus used it for a bait to take many

Pliny; The dung of the Asse-colt, voided first

flux, boyld in wine it greatly relievs the pain of
the skin: In three dayes it cures the kings-evill
given but as big as a bean in wine. A mares
foles dung hath the like efficacy. The same is
used to stanch blood. Tarentinus much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends

they love to have their standing in the open

Yet good Authors, not to be concealed,
as M. Varro, and afore him Dionysius, and
Mago, have delivered that in regions of
Africa, the broods of shee-mules are not so
prodigiously strange, but are as common with
them, as Mares with us. We shall unfold the
reasons of their barrennesse, in the books of
Nature.<note place="margin">Smell.</note> Some relate that they excell in the
sense of <hi>smelling,</hi> by the benefit whereof, leave
them any where, they shall by their sent alone
find out their way. Hence is it, that they are
easily tainted with an infectious aire, and
stroken with the pestilence, which also happens
to dogs. Of the diseases whereto they are
liable, see Aldrovandus.</p>
               <p>There is such a <hi>Sympathy,</hi>

be heald with the very sight of them. On the
contrary the Flowers, and leaves of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
rose, that are wholsome to man, are to
them poyson. In Mules also there is, I know
not what, deadly to Mice. For fasten but a
Mules left hoof at door, and the Mice shall
quit the house; they are ever tame. The
shees are found livelier then the hees, and wax
not so soon old. Those are cleansed by the
flowing of stale; these seem sooner old by the
sent of urine. They love tumbling to refresh
them, when weary. They borrow from the
fire hardinesse to labour, and boldnesse, and

saith Varro, that when a Wolf hath come to a
company of Mules, they have hemmed him in
among them, and kicked him dead. Yet any
un-usuall sight terrifies them, and brings them
into hazards. They kick most fiercely. There
hath been one seen, that would brook no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
but one. They are extream stubborn. I
saw, as I went between Naples and Rome,
one, that could by no means be forced to lead
the way, and being left by her fellows, lay
downe, making us all laugh, and the Priest,
who rode on her, fret. An example of their
craft,<note place="margin">Plin. l. utr. anim.</note> you have in Thales his Mule,<note place="margin">H. N. l. 8. c. 44.</note> and of their
memory, in <hi>Pliny.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Arist.</note> The monuments of Athens
declare,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 6. c. 24.</note> that one Mule lived 80 years; they
taking delight in him, because; when they
were building a Temple in the Tower, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
excused from labour for his great age,
would endevour to help, and in courage by
his company, the beasts that fell under their
burden; concerning which mule they decreed,
that no corne-merchants should offer to drive
him from their corne-sives: Some have wrote,
that they will not kicke, when they have drunk
wine.<note place="margin">Vse.</note> How true that is, we shall shew else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
They are of great efficacy against
poyson, few one poysoned in a Mules belly
newly killed, hee shall escape with life, if hee
remain therein, as long as there is any warmth
in the beast; Hee shall be much better, if hee
use many. <hi>Maranta</hi> is Authour, that there
have been Princes, who to save a life, have
used 30, 40, and 50 Mules. Some have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed

               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> mentions two <hi>kindes,</hi> namely the

Mules, of a divers kind from that engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
between a Mare and an Asse, but faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
as wild-Asses, have obtained the name of
tame from their likenesse. And indeed, as
wild-Asses, so Mules excell in swiftnesse. Such
Mules engender in their kind, as it is well
knowen in them, that in the time of Pharna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
father of Pharnabazes came into Phrigia,
that are there yet; three of nine are kept there
to this day. They commonly engender in
Cappadocia, but it is a peculiar kind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Zebra</hi> answers every way the mule,<note place="margin">Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus, Aldro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vand. l list. quad. l. 1. c. 8.</note> but
that it is a fruitfull breeder.<note place="margin">Purchas Plig. l. 7. c. 13. 5. 7.</note> Of a hayr full of

even from the back-top to the belly shee hath
lines, as painted, of three colours, black, white,
and yellow, the lists being disposed in an even
proportion, each almost three fingers broad.
They run wild, but in herds, and are famous for
swiftnesse; and, if tamed, might serve in stead
of an Horse. Some take them for mules.

and Africa, which though in shape, and
stature like the mule, yet is not it, (since it
breeds) and differs from the mule, and all other
beasts in colour. For in three colours, black,
white, and fresh red streaks of three fingers
bredth compasse the body from the back to
the belly in fashion of semy, or half circles; the
tail being of a red, and shining hew-footed, and
hoof'd as the mule, otherwise of a light, and
nimble foot, as the Horse, nay much fleeter
then he, so that it occasions the proverb in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,
swifter then the Zebra. Shee breeds
every year, whence there is great plenty of
them; but uselesse to the natives, who know not
how to use them; else they might serve them
as well as Horses, both in peace, and warre, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
having furnist those places with them,
where there are no Horses, to supply that want.
Those of Congo therefore, nether having
Horse, nor knowing how to yooke oxen, nor
to tame, or briddle the Zebra, nor know how
to use other beasts; are faine to use men in all
their works. And as they lay all their baggage
on mens shoulders, so themselves are carried
about by men in litters, or on chairs covered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59579:11"/>
from the Sun, having alwayes servants, or
other hirelings at hand to that purpose. And
if they are to dispatch long journies in a short
time, they carry many such man-bearers
about with them to take their turnes, as the rest
are weary; by which shifting, they ridde
more way, then Horses themselves. So far

that from the ey to the farther end

are twelve foot high; some thirteen; some reach
fifteen, and nine inches. Aloysius Cadamustus

then five of our Bulls. They are all black, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

it is harder on the back,<note place="margin">H. H. l. 8. c. 9.</note> then the belly. Their
back-skin is extreme hard and stubborn,<note place="margin">Solinus.</note> their
bellies are soft.<note place="margin">H. N. l. 11. c. 39.</note> Whether he be hairy, or no,
Pliny himself knew not; He hath no bristles
to cover him, nor can he use so much as his taile
to drive away the flies from annoying him;
Pliny speakes of the Elephants in some places;
but in others, their bodies have impenetrable
bristles. Cardan saith, their skin is naked, and
gives reason why it must be so. But Cadamu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus
testifies that he himself hath pluckt blac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
haires two palms long out of them. Gillius
affirms the same length thereof. Vartoman,
finally, reports, that they have a taile like the
oxes, about 27 inches long, with a few hairs at
the end; and in the description of Guinea we
read that the women use such for fly flaps to
drive them from their images. Nay Pliny, as
forgetting himself, writes, that the Indians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
strangely in Emeralds, counting them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
precious stones, and had rather want gold
then them, and that they make holes in them,
and tie them in Elephants bristles.</p>
               <p>They have an ugly mishapen <hi>head;</hi> and
about the temples a kind of tunnell,<note place="margin">Plin. H. H. l. 35. c. 5.</note> whereout
the male sends forth a fat stuff at coupling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time;
the female also hath the like then open,

a beast of that bulk,<note place="margin">Geog. l. 15. Oppian. Cyneg. l. 2. v. 519.</note> two hand-palms breadth
every way, and under them is a place, where
you may strike him dead with one stroak of a

Haserubal first found it out. Those among

Their <hi>eyes,</hi> though great, yet seem but small

tushes that hang out,<note place="margin">Arist.</note> the males are crooked,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 2. c. 5.</note>
and turning again, the females teeth strait, and
hanging downward. They have teeth so soon
as they are brought forth, but those great ones,
are not so plainly seen; with those they grind
their food as small as meal. They are placed
in their upper-jaw, and some are of an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
greatnesse. Bartomannus saw a couple
in Sumatra, hanging up, that weighed 336
pound. And Gadamustus saw one slain, whose
teeth exceeded 36 fingers bredth in greatnes;
and sticking 24 fingers bredth out. Of whose
vastnesse thus Pliny. The greatest teeth are to
be seen in temples. But in the utmost coasts of
Africk,<note place="margin">H. N. l. 8. c. 10.</note> where it borders on Ethiopia, they use
them in stead of posts in their houses, and for
fences,<note place="margin">Polyb. Guloss.</note> and stakes, and prope in their stalls for
cattell. Gillius reports, that they wax some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to ten foot length. Venetus the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,

pieces of gold, being 94 inches long, and 36
inches thick; and that it was so heavy, that he
could not lift it from the ground. Besides
Sabellicus writes, that there was at Firmus two
Elephants-teeth of that excessive hugenesse,
that Aurelian, who conquered it, caused them
to be carried for a miracle to Rome, and of
such an unbeleeveable length. Some call these
Horns. How properly Aldr and Cardan shew,
and shall elsewhere declare; onely I desire to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59579:12"/>
add here,<note place="margin">Arist.</note> that the lower jaw is onely stirred in
eating,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 1. c. 11.</note> the upper lying still. In that place, where
other beasts noses stand. The Elephant hath
a part hanging, narrow, and long, that reaches
to the very ground, board at the end, flexible,
yeelding nimble, like a serpent, that can every
way turn it self, a Trunk the English call it; the
Latines, <hi>Proboscis,</hi> (or a snout.) <hi>Tuba</hi> (a
Trumpet) <hi>Manus</hi> (a hand) as Pliny and Cicero
call it;<note place="margin">Cic. l. 2. de nat. Deo. Cas. l. 10. variorum.</note> 
                  <hi>Manus nasuta</hi> (a nosed hand) as Cassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,
Promuscis, as Vitruvius. The Greeks
call it <hi>Proboskitha, Mokteera, Pronomaian,</hi> &amp;c.
There is the same use of it, as of a hand. For
therewith they take, and put food dry, and
moist to their mouth. Therewith they breath,
drinke,<note place="margin">And take up bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; discharge a pistoll, as I have seen. l. 8. a. 1. ad 12.</note> smell. Lucretius therefore calls them,
<hi>Anguimanos,</hi> snakehanded. Aristotle H. A. l. 2.
c. 1. testifies, that they have bending joynts
in the lower part of their hinde legs; but, as
concerning the bending of their leggs, some
report otherwise, as that they have no joynts,
but their legs is one entire bone, which they
cannot bend, and that falling, they cannot rise
again: But others, as Pliny for one, deliver, that
they have behind short joynts, and within
bending hams, like a man; and indeed expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
hath taught us so much. Their <hi>feet</hi> are
round, like a horsehoofe, but broader, the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes
being some 18 inches round. Verto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
likens them to a table-trencher, form'd
of an hard, black, wide skin. Their toes are
misshapen, five in number, but not parted, and
scarsely distinguisht, the hoofs are not like
claws.<note place="margin">Plin. l. 11. c. 46.</note> They have two <hi>paps</hi> under their should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,<note place="margin">Arist.</note>
not on the breast,<note place="margin">H. A.</note> but on the side it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the shoulder-pits. Their Genital is like a
horses, but small, no way answerable to their
bulk. Pliny saith, that they gender averse, the
face turne from each other. Their <hi>testicles</hi> are
not seen outwardly, but lurke within about
the reins, whence they engender the sooner.
Ctezias trifles in saying their seed is as dry, and
hard as amber. Pliny saids, they have foure
<hi>bellies.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H. N. l. 11. c. 37.</note> Aristotle,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 2. c. 17.</note> that their gut is windding,
and turning, that they seeme to have foure
bellies, and therein meat is found. Galen makes
it very wide, and most like a horses, their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls
resemble a swines. Their <hi>liver</hi> is foure
times as great as an oxes; the rest of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
are answerable, except the milt; this is
lesse then proportion would require. Pliny
makes their <hi>lungs</hi> foure times greater as an
oxes. Aristotle denies that he hath any <hi>gall</hi> in
his liver: yet, if you cut that part, where it
uses to bide, some gally moysture more, or
lesse, will spurt out. Galen also avers, that there
is choller in his bladder. The same tooke a

and he observes, that it hath two ventricles in
it,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 4. c. 31.</note> and not three, as Aristotle saith. Whereof
Aelian thus; The Elephant is said to have a
double heart, and sense, that by the one he is
anger'd, by the other appeased, as the Moors
report. See the description of a couple in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovandus.

               <p>THe name of <hi>Monoceros,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aldrov. H. Quad. l. 1. c. 16.</note> that among
the Latines sounds so much, as a one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horned
beast, agrees to many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but in a strict sense, is retained
to one alone. namely that, who from having
but one horn, bears the name of Unicorn.
In the Brachmans dialect, called <hi>Kartazonon,</hi>
whether there is, or hath been such a beast in
nature: I shall elsewhere examine, after <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi>
and <hi>Bartholinus,</hi> the great son of so great
a father. For present we shall treat hereof
briefly, as resting on the fidelity of Relators.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>description</hi> of the Unicorne,<note place="margin">Strabo.</note> he
is said to resemble in his whole body the
Horse: He is tailed like a Boor, grins and
snarls like a Lyon, headed like an Hart, foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like an Elephant,<note place="margin">Plin.</note> furnisht with one onely
horn, and that a black one, two cubits long,
standing in the midst of his fore-head.<note place="margin">Solinus.</note> 
                  <hi>Isidore</hi>
makes him all one with the Rhinoceros, and
saith that his horn is so sharp and strong, that
what ever he strikes at, he shatters, or peirces
it through. There was one seen in the service
of the great Cham of Tartary,<note place="margin">M. Paul. Venet. l. 3. c. 15.</note> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Lambris. They are lesse then Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants,
holding their head downwards, like
a Swine, of a prickling tongue, wherewith
they get what they meet with; black eyed, and
very like the Rhinoceros. <hi>Lewis</hi> of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema
of Bononia, writes thus of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns
seen by him: There are Dens on the
one side of the Temple at Mecca, wherein
are kept two Unicorns,<note place="margin">Vartom l. 1. c. 18.</note> that are showen, as
the manner is, for a rarity.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>shape:</hi> The greater resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
a Horse-colt of thirty months old; his
horn, that he bears on his fore-head, is about
three ells in length; the other was a year old,
his horn grown to four hand breadth.</p>
               <p>The <hi>colour</hi> of the beast, somewhat darker
then that of a Sumpter, or Pack-horse, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like a Hart, short-necked, and thin-haired
thereabout, short-mained, and that hanging
only on one side: Small, and slender-legged,
like a Hinde: The feet a little cloven afore,
Goat-hoofed, the feet hairy on the right side.
He seems feirce, and of a nature affecting love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.
I adde not what <hi>Garzias</hi> hath out of
<hi>Hortus:</hi> They are said to be found in the
Arabian Deserts,<note place="margin">Bartholi. de Unicor. c. 24. Car. H. Arom. l. 1. c. 14. Paul. Venet. Aene. Sylv. Cadam.</note> and to have been seen there
by Merchants; as also between the Cape of
Good-Hope, and that they call the Currentes.
Some are in the Kingdom Basma, and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris;
some in the utmost parts of Asia, in the
Province Macinus, between the mountains of
India, and Cathay, where the Serici inhabite.
Some in the new world. The Horn is shewen
in many places; the most famous are, S. <hi>Denys</hi>
in France, Venetia, Spain, Utrecht, Helvetia,
Denmark, Hampton-Court in England,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59579:14"/>
Windsor, and the Gedansian of Empiricus.
That at S. <hi>Denys</hi> is of greatest note, being
rugged, not polished, blackish, and nearest
those Ancients describe. Writers differ about
the Unicorns horns lenth, <hi>Renodaeus</hi> makes
him as long as a mans hight, he takes it on
trust,<note place="margin">Baccius, l. 2. c. ult.</note> as we do.<note place="margin">Renod. l. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Baccius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pharin. c. 21.</note> and <hi>Marinus</hi> bring
it to six cubits: <hi>Golnitzius</hi> his measure is six
foot and an half: <hi>Bellonius</hi> makes it up full
seven foot. Nor do they agree about the
weight. <hi>Cardan</hi> saith, one hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> been seen to
weigh seventeen pound, and three quarters.
<hi>Golnitzius</hi> rises it to five and twenty. I with
<hi>Bellonius</hi> should judge the horn to weigh
eighteen pound, having poysed it in my hand.
<hi>Baccius</hi> thinks the <hi>Venetian</hi> are right. <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
that they are longer then old ones, nor
so writhed as Aelians, and so thin, that they
cannot be drunk out of. Coloured like a
smooth Harts-horn, and pale, not black. They
are reported at the siege of Bysantium, to be
conveyed to the Venetian Common-wealth,
with twelve breast-plates of Imperial Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.
The <hi>Spanish</hi> one hath nothing singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
a piece whereof <hi>Phil.</hi> IV. presented
to Cardinal <hi>Francis Barbarine,</hi> an eminent
man, and most courteous to strang Gentery.</p>
               <p>That at <hi>Utrecht</hi> is as long as that at Paris, and
reasonable great; much wreathed at top, and
then growing straiter toward the bottome.
The outside is of a sand-colour, the inside is
whither. It is held in great account, and is
shown for a right one, so that Colonia Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina,
hath bid a great summe of gold for it.
That of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> was found in the year
M.D.XX.<note place="margin">Bartholin. de Unicor. c. 27.</note> at the mouth of the River Arula,
near Brugia; white it is within, yellowish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
without writhings, two cubits long, but as
sweet as musk, especially if it be near the fire.
The <hi>Danish,</hi> one is kept in Fredericks-Burgs
Castle, above seven Roman-foot long, if we
except that part within the hollow, which Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholine
conceives to be above a foot, it is seven
fingers about, writhed all along, and sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
at top; the colour mixt of white, and
ash-colour, and in some of the spaces channeld,
and chamfered with black, and duskish streaks.
That of the <hi>Venetian Merchants,</hi> was brought
out of Germany, promising by the bright, and
divers colour'd shape, that it is a right one; and
the rather, because there fall pieces from it,
if you shave it, not like teeth, and shavings,
that can be crumbled; but there come thence
shavings that are clammy, and yeelding, as any
other cut hornes. I can say litle of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danensian</hi>
one. Empiricus returning from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,
not long ago, magnified it highly.
More about this beast Aelian tells us,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 16. c. 20.</note> saying,
that among all beasts he hath the must absur'd
vile voyce; that if other beasts come to him,
he is gentle, but ever fighting with those of
his owne kind; the males do not onely quarrell,
but they also with the females, so that they kill
one other. His whole body is very strong,
but his horn invincible. He seeks deserts, and
goes ever alone wandring. At <hi>coupling-time</hi>
the male is tamer, and feeds quietly with the
female; when that time is over, and the female
begins to swell, the male returns to his former
fiercenesse, and betakes him to his wandring
lovelinesse. Men say that there were some of
their young ones brought to the Prasian-King,
and that on feast, and triumph-dayes, they
were put together to fight, to shew their
strength: for no man ever remembers that
one growen up, hath been taken. So far Aelian.
Some add,<note place="margin">Albert. H. A. l. 22.</note> that this beast loves young Virgins
so, that if one spreads but her lap, as he comes,
he will lay his head there, and fall in a slumber,
and is so taken. For their <hi>use,</hi> all know how
they are commended for the soverain vertue
of their horne against venome, for where
poyson is, it sweats, and drops stand on it; and
so, as some think, the right horn is knowne.
Aloysius Mundella, commends it against the
bite of a mad dog, and other mischievous
beasts, as also of worms. The ancient Indian
Kings, who first arrived at the knowledge of
this horne, made cups of it for themselves,
that drinking out of them, they might fence
themselves against poyson, drunkennesse,
cramp, falling sicknesse, and other malignant
diseases.<note place="margin">

                  </note> A <hi>Iew</hi> of Venice, made a circle on
a table with that horn, and cast then a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
and a Spider within it, who had not the
power to passe that circle: after that they being
pluckt by it a hand high, whether by the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

No wonder then that it is so valued,<note place="margin">Baccius.</note> that Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Merchants ask'd for one of them 90000
crowns; and the Pope, setting up a kind of an
Apothecaries shop in the Vatican, gave 12000
pieces of gold to the Epidaurian Merchants,
for a piece of an Unicorns horne; of the which
Austin Ricchus the Popes then chief Physitian,
used to put now a scruple, now 10 grains in
wine, or cordiall water, and administred it with
great successe. And thus shall serve now to
have spoken of the Unicorn, we shall say more
elsewhere.<note place="margin">l. 4. H. A. l. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>2.</note> Of the Indian ones, the
same Aelian thus: I have been informed, that
there are wild Asses, no lesse then Horses bred
among the Indians, white bodied, onely
purple-headed, and blew-eyed, and that they
bear a horn in the forehead, a cubite and half
long; the upper-part whereof is light red, the
lower white, and the middle coalblack; and
that, not all, but the principall Indians have
hang'd them as bracelets on their arms, and set
them off with gold, and have use to drink out
of the same. They report, that, who so uses
to drink out of this horn, shall be free from
incurable diseases, nor shall be ever troubled
with convulsion fits, nor ever toucht with the
falling-sicknesse, nor tainted with any poyson;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59579:14"/>
nay, that if he hath drunk any venome, he shall
cast it up again,<note place="margin">Cresias.</note> and recover his health. And
when other Asses, all the world over, whether
tame, or wild, and all other wholehooft beasts
have, as it is said, nor ankles, nor gall in their
liver: These Indian Asses onely have ankles,
and these black, and that within, if you break
them, neither want they a gall; and that in
swiftnesse, they exceed not onely by much
other Asses, but also by far both Elephants
and Horses. And when they come first on the
way, their pace is but slow at beginning, but
then they mend it by degrees, and at length
none can overtake them. After the females
have brought forth, the sires very carefully
looke to the colts, and their haunt is in the
most desert parts of India: when the Indians
hunt them, they hold the colts feeding behind
them, and fight for them: they dare meet the
horsemen face to face, and make at them with
their hornes. So strong they are, there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of them, they make all yeeld, or what
will not. They break, or so shatter, that it
become uselesse, and is quite spoyl'd. If they
meet with horses they rend, and tear their
sides in pieces, that their very guts fall out, so
that horsemen are affraid to come near them,
knowing that the approach is the utter lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
destruction, both man and horse, they
lay finely about them with their heels. What
ever they bite, they make an utter riddance of
it. If they be once grown up, they are not to
be taken; they are kill'd with darts and arrows.
Their flesh is so bitter, it is not to be eaten.
Philostratus writes almost the same.<note place="margin">Vit. Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. l. 9.</note> The figure
that we have here added, is of a wild beast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied,
and eared like an Asse, armed with two

other about his eys; but because it is not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoof'd,

Of the former kind, some are horned, and
some not. We shall consider them in generall,
and in particular. We call those Ruminaters,
or chewers of the cud, that, having swallowed
their meat, bring it up again into the mouth,
and chew it again.</p>

in Greek, <hi>Mereykazein, Merikan,</hi> from
<hi>Meruein,</hi> to roul again. Some of the Latines
have fetched the word, <hi>Ruminating,</hi> from <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
the place in the belly whether the food
descends, and whence it is again sent upward
into the mouth. But Servius, from Ruma, the
upper part of the neck; whether such beasts
recall their eaten meat. But Mercurialis derives
it from <hi>Erumnae,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arnob. l. 7. con. gent.</note> that are these of the throat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe.
How necessary this chewing the cud is
for these beasts, we may gather from this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are fed with grosser food, as also
from this, because they want upper-teeth, and
the lower are not sharp. Whence it is, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
recompences the want of teeth with the
<hi>multitude,</hi> as it were, of <hi>bellies;</hi> for they have
no lesse then four; namely the belly, the call, the
tripe, and the paunch. The throat beginning
from the mouth reaches down to the lungs, and
midriffe:<note place="margin">Arist.</note> thence,<note place="margin">H. A. l. 2. c. ult.</note> to the <hi>greater belly,</hi> that on
the inside is sharp, and rugged, and hath a cell
near the knitting of the gullet, called the net, or
call; for it is outwardly like a belly, and within
netted, like womens head cals, and is much
greater then the belly; next is the <hi>tripe,</hi> rugged,
checkered, crusty, and as great as the call; next
is the <hi>paunch,</hi> greater and longer then the tripe,
and checkered, and crusted with many light,
and great crusts, vast, and misshapen, and then
follow the bowels. In the first hollow place of
the paunch the meat is to be seen undisgested,
even in bits, and pieces scarce torned; in the
second, more change, and yet more in the
third; and in the last at length perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted,
where it is turned into a white creame.
Nether yet do those only chew the cud,<note place="margin">Arist. H. A. l. 9. c. ult.</note> that
want their upper-teeth; for among the fishes
the Scarus doth the same, having blunt teeth;
and among the beasts, the common, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Mouse, the Hare, the Cony, as we have it
in Leviticus. If you ask the manner, and fashion
of chewing the cud, Aristotle answers, that the
meat being chewed again is sent out of one
belly into another, till at last it slides into the
bowels. Galen saith, that it is first brought up
out of the stomack into the mouth; thence it
passes into the kall, thence into the tripes,
thence into the guts. After sucking, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to chew the cud, in seven months, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it of the tame. The herders, in lesse time,
because they feed abroad; yet in winter, more
then at other times of the year; and they seem
to delight more in this chewing the cud, then
in eating. That they then require rest appeares
by this,<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 10. c. 73.</note> that they do that work lying in their
stalles.<note place="margin">Arist. H. A. l. 3. c. 21.</note> Aristotle saith, that their milk alone
cruddles, and that they have curdled milke in
their tripes, and that they abound in milke.
The causes hereof we shall elsewhere unfold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Horns</hi> are given to these chewers (the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59579:15"/>
Camel excepted) for defence, and offence.
The nourishment that should go to the making
of upper-teeth, which they want, turns into
Horses, and those are very manifold, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent;
neither hath nature in any thing more
wantonized then in these weapons of beasts;
Shee hath spread them into branches, as those
of Deer;<note place="margin">Plin. H. N. l. 11. c. 37.</note> to others shee hath given plain ones,
as to the Harts, called spitters, or pipers, from
the shape; others hath shee shaped like hands,
and those as fingered, called broadhorned. Shee
hath given to wild-goats, or Roes branched
ones, but small, as such which are never cast: to
Rams crumpled horns, like clubs, troublesome
to Bulls. In this kind shee gratifies females also
in many, onely male: To Roe-bucks-horns
hooked backward, to Bucks, contrary. To the
Strepsiceros, (a beast half wild, half tame, that
Africa calls the <hi>Bold</hi>) horns standing bolt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
writhed, and sharp at top. To the Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian
herds, moveable horns like ears. To those
of the Trogloditae, horns pointing downwards,
so that they are fain to feed with their necks on
one side. Others have but one horn, and that
in the middle of their head, or in their nose.
Again, some of them are strong to push with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,

                  <p>These horned beasts also have some <hi>peculiar
parts,</hi> as hucklebones, and sewet, and some parts
common with others, but otherwise placed, as
the belly, milt, udders. The <hi>milt</hi> is most round:
The <hi>bowels</hi> large; the <hi>udders</hi> between the legs in

Citisus breeds much, and sweet milk; but while
it flourishes, it is not so good, but dries up

March, because it makes them wild-headed.
Pliny says, that not onely that, that is sowen in
March, is hurtfull to oxen; but also that that is
sowen in May is hurtfull to Oxen, but also that
that is sowen in Autumne, makes them sleepy,

Aldrovand, and writers of husbandry. For their
age, the Cow lives 15 years at most, the male

knowen by changing their teeth;<note place="margin">Pliny.</note> the foreteeth
they cast within a year, and eight, or ten
months;<note place="margin">Arist. H. A. l. 6. c. 21.</note> then after six months by degrees they
loose the next, till within three yeare they have
changed them all; when they are best disposed,
and so hold out to fifthteen. At best, their teeth
stand fair, long, and even; but growing old,
they diminish, wax black, and rot. The Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetians
judge of their Cows age by certain
circles almost at top of their horns; they are
three at five years old, after more. Some thinke
they get a circle with every calving. About
their <hi>gendring, lust, coupling,</hi> and <hi>calving,</hi> I meet
with these observations. The Bull feeds with
the Cow only in engendring time; they couple
with the elder twice a day, with the yonger
oftner, and that with one, and the same, and
quietly. A geld one hath egendred, saith Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.
One Bull may serve 15 Cows. Varro
allows many more.<note place="margin">Varro. R. R. l. 2 c. 5.</note> Hee abstaines from the
cows that are with calf at first, and as it were

Aristotle about the excesse and signes of their
lust; as also Aelian. H. A. l. 10. c. 27. About what
heats then see Columella, R. R. l. 6. (thither I

and the skin wherein it is enwrapped, is also

fruitfull; for the most part they bring two at

and though they carry a couple, yet they say,
they ly both on the right side. They guesse by
the Cows frisking after coupling, whether shee
shall have a Bull, or Cow-calf; if on the right
side a Bull-calf; if on the left, a Cow-calf. They

of Anger, saith, that oxen are much enraged
by red, or any colour like it. But it is strange,
that oxen that have been made to draw any

they be forced to it, the ground will not thrive.

say it was a food prized only by Barbarians and
poor common people, yet Galen, and Diosco.
and others proclaim great vertue to be in it.
Vitalis de Furno Cardinal, and a famous Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian
saith that <hi>butter is naturally warm,</hi> and
moyst; heat is predominant in it, it is viscous,
and oylie. Oft eaten it moystens the stomack,
and make loos-bodied, softens the breast; cures
ulcers in breast, and bowells; especially, when
fresh and new, agreeing to mans complexion,
helps apostumate breasts and lungs; it being
the proper quality to ripen, disperse, and
cleanse all superfluous humours, especially if
eaten with hony and sugar. Butter resists poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
supples the members, softens, and helps,
smeared on eye-smart, disperses, and ripens im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postumes,
eases sore breasts, and lungs, and
gripings of the bowels, supples, and loosens
shriveled up sinews. It is a speciall remedy
against inward poyson, if hartily drunk melted
in hot milk, after you have drunk venome, for
by its fatnesse it stops the passages, that the
venome reach not suddenly the heart. But,
new butter is thus praise-worthy, not so the
old, &amp;c. Thus far the Cardinall <hi>Cheese</hi> is good
against flaxes, strangury, and colique. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates

They run there with horses, being equally

The Umbrian Oxen, chiefly by the river Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnus,

Ox,<note place="margin">Arist. H. A. l. 4. c. 71. Scalig.</note> Not high. His hide stretched out, holds
enough food for seven Guests. Like an Ox,
only mained like a Horse; but softer haired,
and lower; yellow haired. His eye-haires
long, tween ash-coloured and red, rougher then
that of the Paroa Mares, but wholly under:
None of them are very black, or carnation;
voyced like the Ox. The horns crooked and
thwart, and unfit for fight; a palm breadth,
and not full longer; each as thick as may be
grasped: Of a handsome shining blacknesse.
His ancles rather spreading, then bending
down-ward. He wants the upper-teeth, as the
Ox, and other horned cattel. The thighs are
shaggy; he is cloven-footed; his taile is not
great for his bulke, but greater then the Oxes.
He casts dust about, and digs up the earth like
the Bull. Her hide is stroke-proofe. Her flesh
sweet, and therefore men hunt her. She flies
when stroken,<note place="margin">Pliny.</note> till she tyre her self. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
herself with her heels and dung, which
she casts from her four paces; (not three akers,

burns so strong, that the cole can scorch a dogs-hair;
that it is, if you stir, and fright her; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise

nature, when her calving-time drawes near;
she seeks the mountains, and dungs about the

                        <p>THe name Bubalus is at this day an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
thing,<note place="margin">Aldrovan. quadr. l. 2. cap. 5.</note> as also it seemed to be in
<hi>Pliny</hi> his time; nor had it any peculiar
sense among the Greeks. Many call
divers wild-Oxen, especial there where they
were brought from abroad, Bubali. Some
make them Goats. We shall distinguish them;
calling the Bubalus, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
beast, having blood without fibrae, or
string-veins; the same with the African Ox.
<hi>Scaliger</hi> speaks of the Bubalis, whose blood
and horns are described by <hi>Aristotle. Pliny</hi>
makes him like a Calfe, or Hart. What is it
then? the Gazella? No surely, wherefore
what I could learn out of the African stories, I
will freely impart.</p>
                        <p>The African Oxen are scarce so great as our
Calves; but very strong, and can endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
I find him called Dant, and Lant, and
Elant; Hath an Oxes face, but is much lesse
and nimbler; yea, swifter then all other wild-beasts.
The hide impenitrable, iron cannot
pierce, only a bullet can; White-haired, taken
in Summer, because their hoofs are loosned
by the burning of the sand. <hi>Bellonius</hi> describs
another African Ox to be old, lesse then the
Hart, neater and greater then the wild-Goat;
of a square and well-shaped body, goodly to
behold, yellow-haired, and so shining and
smooth, that she seems sleeked over. The
belly hath red-wrinckles, and seems to incline
more to yellow then the back, that is dusk-coloured.
It is short, but strong thighed; thick
and short-necked, and hath a little dew-lap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
headed like an Ox, the horns black and very
crooked as the Gazella, bending like a Moon
in the increase, wherewith he cannot well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
himself, so crooked they are. Ox-eared,
full, and high-shouldered; the taile, like the
Panther, or Camel, Horses, hanging to the
hams; black-haired, twice as thick as the
Horses; lows like the Ox, but not so lowd. He
is not the same, whose picture <hi>Horatius Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
sent to <hi>Aldrovandus;</hi> for it was of much
higher and slender neck, and the horns bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
back, and crooking as in a wild-Goat. It
had great ears, the proportion of the head near
the beginning of the neck; faced rather like
the Kid then the Ox; wherefore reckoned by
some among the African Goats. The whole
body yellowish, except that the musle and
horns were blackish: It was very long-haired.</p>

is not that Bubalus in Aristotle,<note place="margin">Aldrovan quadr. l. 2. cap. 6.</note> shall
be manifest by comparing the History

him no precise name among the wilde Oxen,
while he saith, that among the Arachoti (an

that they are by red) there is no taming them;
chase them, they fly strait on, and never turne.
Enraged, he takes water, and dowses into the
head, to cool his boyling blood. The female
endures not a calf of another kind; knowing
it by the smell, but smear it with cow-dung,
the smell deceives her, and she suckles, and
brings it up for her owne. They will labour
hard; they are lead, and ruled by an iron, or
brasse ring-strook through the nostrils, with a
halter, or bridle fastened to it. Men say, that, if
he be overladen, you can not beat him up; he
will not stand up, till you disburthen him.
Their flesh is sold at Rome; and the Jews like it;
but it is so slimy, that it cleaves, if you clap it
on the wall. The cheeses, that abound in the
Pistorian Province, called Marzolinis, of an
ovall shape; (that is, shape like an egg, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

tasted.) They make rings of the hoofs, and
hornes, which worn on fingers, or toes, are
excellent against cramps; some tide on foure
sorts of threads, of gold, silver, brasse, and iron;
thinking them more effectuall so. Cloaths,
especially doublets are made of the hide; and
horse-trappings in Narzinga. The Siamenses
make bows of the hornes.</p>

this beast being so well knowne.
Yet we shall set downe the most memorable
things we meet with in authors. Nature hath
given the sheep a most weak <hi>head.</hi> The <hi>braine</hi>
is leane. The <hi>horns</hi> of the ews are commonly
smaller; many have none. Some lambs are
yeaned with hornes, the rams crooked, and
sometime more then two. Cardan writes that
he hath seene some choyce ones with foure,
we shew the figure of three, and six-horned.
The gelded change the place of the hornes,
bearing them on a quite contary fashion;
their <hi>eyes</hi> look a side downwards, far one from
the other,<note place="margin">Aristot. de gen. anim. l. 5. c. 1. Aristo. H. A. l. 2. c. 3.</note> darkish, or blackish, and broad. The
<hi>lips</hi> thin, contrary to ox-lips. The <hi>teeth</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
the ew having fewer then the ram.
After a year and half they change, (saith Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scentius,)
namely the two fore-teeth, and six
moneth after, the two next, then the rest; in
three or foure years at most, they shed them
all. The teeth of the younger are uneven,
when they are bigger, equall; when they wax
old, ungummed, lessened, and rotted. Their
<hi>bellies</hi> are as of all that shew the cud. Those
of the lamb we hereafter lay open. Know that
A denotes the stomach, B the gummes, C
the salter, D the Tripe. The testicles fall to

in very cold countries, in deep snows, and hard
winters, they have no gall, nor being folded,
eat; but in Spring, as they come to pasture,
they get great galls; and so it is with the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian
sheep. In Scopsis their <hi>spleen</hi> is very litle,
and round. Their <hi>reins</hi> are even, and the
sewet lies thicker about them; if they be quite
compast with fat, it kills them; which comes
from rank pasture, as in the Leontine Land in
Sicily: wherefore the Shepheards there drive
them late to pasture, that they may not eat too
much.<note place="margin">Bellunen.</note> In Syria, the fat lies thick between the
skin, and flesh in geld-rams, as in hogs. In their
ford, and hind-legs sticks a bump, near the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,

and hairy, like rose-cups, that hold the seed,
inclosed in a softy and thin down;<note place="margin">Lemnius de nat. mir. c. l. 3. c. 5.</note> It is oft taken

or chest-nuts. Shepheards are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that for this cleaving to the joynts, no
creature alive would be swifter then the sheep.
The <hi>tayl</hi> is thick of wooll. Hesiod. denies,
that the North-wind pearces their <hi>skin,</hi> by
reason of the hair, or rather the wooll. There
is scarce a <hi>place</hi> where they are not found,
more or fewer, and of great difference accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the place, as we shall hereafter shew in
the differences. Their food is grasse, whence
called <hi>Poephaga,</hi> grasse-eter; yet they eat leaves
also. That grasse is sweetest to them, that grows
where the plow hath gone, next that in dry
medows.<note place="margin">Colum. R. R. lib. 7. c. 2, 3.</note> To prevent fulsomnesse, men lay
salt in summer in wodden gutters, which they
lick when they come from pasture, that as it
were seasons it to them. In winter they nibble,
or browse on elm, ax, leaves, and the second
cut-hay, called Cordum. They eat also the
Cytisus, tame fisses, and, if need be, pulse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaffe.
Some give them a litle kern of resins,
and bran. Those that are pastured in salt
marishes, yeeld more milk, and more savoury
cheese, and are more fruitfull, and more tender,
and sweeter fleshed; such are those fat ones by
Ostia, and the neighbouring Portuensian Land,

commonly but one at once, yet sometimes

goodnesse of the pasture, and their naturall
strength enables them to breed twins. In some

such live not long. The Musmon is ingendred
between the shee-goat and Ram. From the
coupling of sheep with wilde rams, comes a
brood of the sires colour,<note place="margin">Albert. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

the succeeding breed; the wooll, in the first
young, rough; in the following ones, softer.
The brood is of the colour of the veins of the

Aristotle teaches that they must take in south<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winds,

Duva (a French herb, and name) but tasted by

In Attica they will not touch the root of

men put it on medicines. The wool of a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ram, taken from between his hornes, and
burnt, is good for the head-ake. The ashes (in
Dioscor. opinion) draws over a crust, hinders
dead flesh, closes ulcers. Men burn it, when
clean and pickt in a new earthen pot, to use as
afore. Some shear it, some pluck it off, and clip
of the top, dry, and pick it, and put it together
into a new earthen pot, and drench it in hony.
Others with lincks set it on fire, it being sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

hands, putting in water, and then let it stand,
and oft shift the water, till it lightly touch, but
not bite the toung, then they lay up, and keep

cheeks. Wool taken after sheep-shearing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the spring Aequinoctiall, and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
when they begun to sweat, that from the

ours; eares dangling; the tayl reaches but to the
anckles; with a great tripe; the yard in the midst
of the belly; the hornes small downward, ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
toward the eyes, and as it were crumpled;
at the bottome of his neck a long hairy maine,
the rest of his body is short-haired like a goat,
but hee carries no wool, black-headed and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the upper-half of his tayl, the rest white,
as also the hinder-part of the head; the fore-legs
white to the knees, the lower halfe black;
the hind-legs all black; about the dock and
back white, the sides have black spots; footed
like the goat, black-hoofed. Yet these Sheep
are as ours, some coloured on one fashion,
some on another; and one kind is thick-legged
like a man and fat, having no hanging mane,
nor wool, but is haired like a goat. Greater then
ours, their belly strutting out like an ox. In
Asia some are red-wooled. The region Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda
feeds some as big as Asses, and those
fair and fat, with tayls of 80 pound wight. The
Canusinian fleeces are reddish, or yellowish.
Those of Chios, for want of pasturage, are
very small;<note place="margin">Aelian. Hermola.</note> but their Cheeses is much cried

mount Ida, called by the shepherds Striphoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,

their teeth gold colour, the flesh and
wool like saffran. In Gortynis, they are red,
and have four horns. In Gothland are Rams
with four and eight horns, which makes them
so fierce, that to prevent mischief, which
they else do to each other, and to other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they are fain to saw them off. They
bear a soft and long wool. Hirta, one of the
Hebrides, hath sheep taller then the greatest
hee-goats, with horns as thick as those of
Oxen, and somewhat longer, and tailes touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ground. In Spain in <hi>Marineus</hi> his time,
there was such a glut of sheep, that he knew
many shepheards owners of thirty thousand,

which they cut off, both that the Rams may
come at them, and that oyl may be fetched
out of their fat: The Rams tailes also are cut
off, and the fat taken out, and are so neatly
sewed on again, that the seam is not to be
seen. Of which Rams we shall give a figure;
one without horns and taile, but having some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
growing in stead, with a kind of dew-lap
under the chin; all white, except the head, and
hoof-ends which are black. Another notably
fenced with bending and wreathed horns, they
and the head of horn-colour; the muzzle,
feet, testicles, and bottom of the taile of a
shining white, the rest all red.<note place="margin">Pliny. Gesner.</note> The fleece of
the sheep of Istria, or rather Liburnia, is liker

a Lamb hath been commonly sold for four

In Macedonia, they who would have their wool
white, drive them to Aliacmon; they who
would have it black, or dark, to Axius. The
Madagascar sheep have the heaviest tailes. In
Magnesia, and Mesopotamia, they yean twice
a year. Those of Milesia hold the third place
in goodnesse.</p>
                     <p>In Moscovy in the deserts about the rivers
Bonistenes, Tanais, and Rha, is a wild-sheep,
they call it Seigios, about the row, but shorter-footed,
with lofty strait-hornes, markt with
ringlets, (whereof the natives make knife-hefts
that are transparent) very swift, and leaps high.
The Nabathaeans (saith <hi>Strabo</hi>) have all white
sheep. In Naxus, they have a double gall. In
Panchaea, are much softer wooled then else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.
In Peru, they are as big as Asses, long-ledged,
grosse-bodied, long-headed, Camel-necked,
and shaped; their flesh is excellent,
especially their lambs. They plow with the
Wethers, which also carry their wood; they
never bleat, their colour is white, black, and
ash; they can carry fifty pound weight, and
let them rest a while, and lay on their burden
again, they shall bear it some miles; they can
make them sit, and eat, and turn their head
about, and grin; if over-loaded, they stink and
squat down, and till unloaded, can by no blows
be forced to rise up. Their wool exceeds ours
in finenesse, length, and abundance. They are
fed with corn, but are fed with little; and can
three or four dayes together go without eating
or drinking. <hi>Mathiolus</hi> exactly describes them,
telling us that they resemble partly a Camel,
and partly a Deer. They may be well called
<hi>Elaphokameloi.</hi> He is six foot long from the neck
to the tail, but four foot high from the back
to the foot-sole, the neck two foot long; like
a Camel in head, neck, and mouth; especially
in the parting of the upper-lip, and the genital;
but somewhat longer headed: he hath Deers-ears,
and is Ox-eyed, having no foreteeth in
the upper-jaw, but grinders on both sides, as
most cloven-footed beasts have, and it also
chews the cud; the back riged, which they the
cutter hath forgot; the shoulders near the neck
deprest, or flat; the sides swollen, broad bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
high buttocked; the tail but a span long,
in all which in resembles a Deer, as also in the
thighs, especially in the hind-legs; cloven-hoofed,
the cleft afore drawn far out; it hath
clawes round the foot, pointing and ending in
a thick skin; the sole as the Camels covered
with skin, pisses backwards as the Camel; the
testicles pinching inward; broad-breasted, and
bunched at the knitting, tween the breast and
belly; whence a kind of excrement seems to
vent it self; the neck, breast, and fore-feet
white, the rest of the body reddish, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the muzzle black, and the forefeet from
the knee shining bright. It is tame and gentle,
but can endure no cold, as others that are
brought us out of hot-countries. Offends no
man, but revenges it self strangly on those that
vex it, or wrong it: about the buttocks, not
defending it self by biting, or kicking; but by
spewing, or squirting on the vexer with a force,
to the utmost length of the neck stretched out.
So lustfull it is, that where there are no females
of the kind, he will couple with Goats: His
coupling-time is Spring, and Fall; yet those
shee-goats conceive not by him, being even
forced, as appears by their crying; and it is a
kind that hath no agreement with this beast.
They call it an Indian-sheep, who brought it
to us (saith <hi>Mathiolus</hi>) but you may judge how
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59579:23"/>
vast the difference is between it and our sheep.
Those Chilensian-sheep, whose picture the
Hollanders brought over, differs much from
these. They are somewhat in make, or bulk
of body, but that their hind-feet are cloven in
twain, and their fore-feet in four, and the wool
very long and shaggy, which they highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend:
but they are a like natured, and are
questionlesse of one and the same kind; only
the climate makes the difference, unlesse they
differ in that bespattring revenge, whereof I
speak even now, and is thought where it lights,
to breed the scab. <hi>Martial.</hi> (Epig. l. 14. ep.
157.) writes, that the sheep of Pollentia near
the Alps, are all gray-fleeced. The Rhetian
sheep of six or seven years old, get new horns
to their old. They yean two or three at once,
small ones, and not till after six or seven, the
first being strongest, and of thicker bulk. The
Sauromatan sheep are hard haired. The Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
have tailes of a cubit long, and most what
wooly in that part.<note place="margin">

and their looking that way, is a sure
signe of the revolutions of that Star. In the
Nothern-coasts they are great bodied, thick

eared, small headed, thick, long and bright
necked, high and broad horned. They are
almost all white. In Winter they live on Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark,
Mosse, and Poplar-boughs. The skins
are carried by great shipfuls into Germany, and
yield great gaine. The Caspian Goats are
whitest,<note place="margin">Aelian.</note> not horned, and as big as Horses: So
soft is their hair, that it may compare with
Milesian-wool; so that the Caspian Priests,
and the richest make it their wear. In Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenia
the Goats drink not dayly,<note place="margin">Anist. Mitab. Aelian. H. A. l. 3. c. 32. Plin.</note> but gape. and
take in the wind. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> therefore saith,
they drink not in six months. In Cilicia, and
about the Syrtes they are as shorn. At Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
they have long eares, manifold teats, and
are very fruitful. The owners carry fourty or
fifty up and down to sell their milke; and they
will milk them where you please, in your din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room,
though it be three stories high, afore
your eyes in tin vessels. At Narbon, they
have broad and long ears.<note place="margin">Gesner. Alex.</note> In Illyria they are
not cloven-footed; they bring sometimes three,
four or five at a birth, and give a gallon and a
half of milk. The same is said of the Indian,
near the City Tarnassuri; and of the Affrican
at the Promontory of the green-head. <hi>Xave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>

an Hee-goat suckling little kids, in that
corrupted History of <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> which
the Authour wrote in the Persian language. He
had but one udder, and gave a great sop
of milk dayly. The Mambron Shee-goat in
the Region of Damiata, they may ride with
saddle and briddle, and other Horse-furniture;
the ears dangle to the ground, the horns hang
downward, and turn up again under the

breeds Goats coloured like the Deer, and
greater by much; with an horn twelve hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

in winter, and cold in summer; like the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones.
And some are swifter then any beast.

living among rocky places, as the name gives

loftiest mountains, where your eye can hardly
reach them: yet if they be pursued by beast, or
man, it can cast it self headlong from the stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
crags, and yet help themselves so with
their horns, that they catch no harme. They
fall out often about the females in coupling
time: By consent of all they excell the tame in
goodnes of tast, savourines, and nourishment, in
delicacy of temper, easines of digestion, and in
paucity of excrements; yet is their flesh somewhat
drier; therefore the Arabes invented the
boyling them in oyl, to make them juicier. Yet
some thinke that what is sod in oyl becomes
dry, and looses the glutinousnes, as <hi>Psathuron,</hi>

that is Wild-goat. It is of the same
greatnesse with the shaggy-goat, only a little
taller, and in shape liker the tall wild-beasts.
<hi>Bellonius</hi> takes it for a Buck. The colour is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
dark and red; it inclines more to the
red in Summer then in Winter, to the dusky.
But <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Scalig. Bellon. ob. l. 1. c. 54.</note> it is in Summer yellowish,
in Winter ash-colour. <hi>Gesner</hi> saw one black
and white. Some are all white, but few. It
is red-eyed. The ears are longer then the
Rams, and carnation coloured, and on either
side a streak above the eyes from the root of
the horns, straight to the end of the mouth,
and ending in the upper-lip. The fore-head
marked with a kind of star. The upper part of
the tail hairy, black and round, and as long as
that of a Buck. The horns blackish, nine or
ten fingers long, rough with knotty ringlets;
none in the hooked part, which is smooth, and
sharp like a hook. Almost paralel, rising in
equal spaces; firm, only at beginning, only a
thumbs length, hollow; and rounder then those
of the tame. Some say they can,<note place="margin">Scal.</note> as we see
Goats, scratch their backs with them. It is
note-worthy what mischief they do themselves
by that scratching; they are thought to delight
so in the tickling, that they fasten the horn-tip
so in their skin, that they cannot pluck it back
again; so that they through anguish will cast
themselves from the highest clifts, and taken,
they dy of pain, or famish to death. They
haunt rocky mountains; yet not the tops as
the Ibex, nor leap they high, or far; they come
down sometime to the lower Alps. They meet
oft about some sandy rocks, and thence they
lick sand, as Goats do salt, whereby they rub
off their sluggish flegme, and sharpen their
stomack. When they are hardly chased, they
climb so high, that no dogs can come at them:
Then when they see the hunters creep on all
four to pursue them, they frisk from stone to
stone, and make to the mountain tops, where
no man can follow them, there they hold, and
hang by the horns till they are shot with guns,
or driven headlong from their hold, or famish
to death. Presently after S. <hi>Iames</hi> time they
betake themselves to the colder clifts, to inuse
themselves by degrees to cold. Being taken,
they are sometimes made tame. Of the skins
are made gloves for horsemen. When they
stray to find out new pastures, the next rock
they look wishly on, putting forth a foot, they
try often whether it be fast, or loose, and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
It is pleasant, saith <hi>Scaliger,</hi> to see how
in my uncle <hi>Boniface</hi> his hall, they that are kept
tame will leap at the hangings, wherein the like
wild are woven. As for their use, their flesh is
somewhat dry, and a breeder of melancholy,
and is of a wild sent. Hunters drink the blood
afresh, springing out for a present help for the
swimming of the head.<note place="margin">Pliny.</note> A cup of the sewet

short, saying, that among the wild-goats are
the Ibices on the Alps, of a wonderful swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
though their heads by burdened with
huge horns, where with they defend, and poyze
themselves; and can safely tumble, and frisk as
they lift from clift to clift, most nimbly. It is
a gallant creature, and great-bodied, almost
shaped like an Hart, but not so great; slender
thighed, and small-headed, the skin dark-coloured;
growing old, they wax gresly, and
have a black list along the back; clear, and fair-eyed;
cloven, and sharp-hoofed: The female
is lesse then the male, and not so dusky of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
He is bigger then the shaggy goat; not

happily to the Hippelaphus: His vast massy
horns bent toward his back, sharp, and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the more, the older he growes; for
they wax yearly, till that they grow to about
twenty knots in the old ones: Both horns,
when grown to their utmost, are well neat
sixteen or eighteen pound weight. <hi>Bellonius</hi>
had seen some horns four cubits long; they
have as many crosse-beams, as they are years
old. Fleet they are; nor is their any rock so
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59579:26"/>
high, lofty, or steep, that they will not reach
with some leaps, if it be but rough, and just
but so far out, that they can fasten their hoofs
on. They are wont to leap from clift to clift
six paces distant from each other. Falling, he
breaks the force of the fall with his horns. See
<hi>Aldrovand</hi> about the manner of hunting them.
There are two kinds of them in Candy. <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
writes, having seen of their horns brought
out of Cyprus: If they are surprized, and have
space enough, they venture on the hunters,
and cast them head-long from the rock; But
finding there is no escaping, they easily yeild
themselves.</p>
                        <p>Of the same kind is that African wild beast,
which Aelian H. A. l. 14. c. 16. describes thus:
Wild-Goats abide on the tops of the Lybian
mountains; they are well near as great as oxen,
their shoulders, and thighs extreme shaggy,
small legged; their foreheads round, thin and
hollow-eyed, not bolting much out; the horns
from the first sprouting, very unlike each other,
scambling, and crooked, and not uniformed
and strait, as other goats horns; but bend-back
to their very shoulders. No Goats so fit, and
able to leap, &amp; so far as they from clift to clift;
and though they sometimes leap short, and fall
headlong downe between the crags, they get
no harme, so made he is against such brunts,
so firme bodied, that hee hurts no horns nor
head. The Goat-heards have many arts to take
them, as high as they are, with darts, or nets, or
gins, being very cunning in that hunting. On
the plain ground any slowfooted hunts-man
can overtake them. Their skins and horns are
of some use; for the skins are very good to
make gloves for shepheards, and carpenters in
cold winters. The horns are as fit to draw water
out of rivers, or wells to drink in, as cups them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for they hold so much, as cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in at one draught; if well fitted by a good
workman, it may hold three measures. It hath
it's use also in physick. The curds as usefull as
those of the hare.<note place="margin">

                        <head>POINT IV. Of the Caprea, or Roe, in Pliny, the Goat half
Wild and half tame, and the common
Buck, or Doe.</head>
                        <p>PLinies Caprea, or Roe, is no other then
our Capreolus, or Kid; which the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
call Reh, not unlike the Hart in
colour, but far smaller, scarce so great as
the Goat. The male his horns commonly have
six branches. There was one had 17 horns,
whose picture the Duke of Bavaria sent to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drovand.
The horns are branched indeed,<note place="margin">Pliny. Virg.</note> but
small, and they cast them. Sharp-sighted they
are; small voyced: they shed not their teeth;
spotted; some spots are white. In time they
change colour, and the spots become not so
sightly. Many are taken in the Helvetian Alps;
yet they love lower places then other Wild-goats.
The Shee, if her Male be taken, seeks
another, bringing him to her old place; and if
the Shee be taken, the Hee seeks another.
Their horns they either know not how to use,
or dare not. They love to feed,<note place="margin">Bellifar. Iul. Alex.</note> where Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges
haunt. They run only when the wind
blows, to refresh themselves in their toyl. They
are as well tasted as the Boor, and their flesh
sooner digested. Of this sort are those in Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sile;
two kinds are of them, Cagua-cuete, and
Cagua-capara: Almost like our hee-goats. The
head about seven fingers long, great and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eyed,
large and wide nostrild; the mouth black,
the skin shining; the eares four fingers long,
two and an half broad; their veins easily seen;
the neck round and smoother haired then the
rest of the body; five fingers and a half long.
The body but two feet from the neck to the
rump. The tayl short, as of other Goats. The
forethighs a foot, the hinder a foot and half
long; the hoof cloven and black; and on those
two other lesser ones. Smooth-haired, red on
the thighs and feet, dark on the neck and head,
white under the throat, and the bottome of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59579:27"/>
neck; the tayl white below; the eares whit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
dusky without, and almost hairles; the
mouth a litle longer below then above. Hee
chews the cud, and is easily tamed: After one or
two months old hee becomes delicately white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted,
which in time weare out. The Brasile
Cuguacu apara is a horned Hee-goat, coloured
as the former, but somewhat lesse; the horns
have three shoots on them, the lowest is lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest,
and parted at top; the main horn is a
thumb thick, and eight or nine Rhineland fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
long. The <hi>Strepsicerote,</hi> or Roe-buck, is
described by Aldrovand out of Pliny,<note place="margin">Aldrovan. Plin. Bellon.</note> and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
among the wild-goats, that are outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish.
The picture of the Cretian one is taken
out of Bellonius.</p>
                        <p>The common Buck resembles in shape the
Hart, is greater then the Roe, but differs in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.
The Buck is smaller-headed then the
Hart; hee casts his head every year, the horns
stick foreward out, and not as others use: The
ridge of the back is blinking yellow, and hath a
black list all along. The taile reaches to the
hams, as a calves. The sides sometimes are
checkered with white spots, that with age wear
away. Sometimes the Does are all white, that
you should take them for goats, but that the
hair is short. Their horns are in many places
shewen of a vast greatnesse and beamy, as at
the ascent and steps of the Ambosian fort. The
flesh very like the Kids; the blood of a deep
black. Sometimes he is fat as a Wether. The
dung prepared with oyl of mirrhe, is said to
make hair come thick.</p>

<hi>Gesner</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Gesner.</note> the Musk lies in a bag in him. Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

They are so swift, that they are seldome taken

Some prefer Tumbascin musk, because
of the abundance of pasture there, which is
ripe in the bag, and better then that that is
hanged up in the aire: The unripe, though in

is better then the Abensin, then the Jurgian;

It is hornlesse, else like a wild goat. Nether is
that any hinderance, that he wants horns; since
there are dogs that are said to have horns, when
most have none. He delights in mountanious
and rocky places: She loves cold and deserts:
She seems to be refreshed with snow, and
frosts: She loves company, and the Herd.
She runs from all men she meets, putting her
young ones afore, being carefull of them. She
is taken by a swift chase; to which end three
thousand Barbarians compasse a mountain, and
by degrees make all the wild here together,
sometimes more then three hundred; they send
the females after the young ones; They are
taken also, when they come to a convenient
space, and toyles of cord, and lead laid for
them. They shear them to make coverlids;
their wool is fine as silke, of a lasting colour;
being natural, it needs no dye. In hot whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it refreshes, helping the inflammation of
the reins: wherefore they stuffe therewith
tikes for beds. It is said to ease the Gout. The
flesh hath no good relish; yet it is an Indian
dainty. And a piece of it new killed, and laid
on the eye, removes suddenly the smart. They
breed the Bezoar in the bowels, next to the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
Vicuna is the Taruca, of that kind, but
swifter, and greater, and deeper colour; of
soft and dangling ears, not delighting in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
she wanders among rocks alone. In
these is the Bezoar-stone found both of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

But Aldrovand himself durst define, whether
they are Indian Asses horns, or no. But, since
the Aethiops, called Sili, used them for weapons
against the Struthiophagi, or Estridge-eaters,
and they are very hand, and beamy, long, sharp-pointed,
and hollow, they seeme to belong to
the Oryx. The Egyptians fain many things of

it is not the same with this. The later calls
him Cavage; the former reckons him among

Hee is said by Oppian,<note place="margin">Aldrovan.</note> to be wild, a great foe

are numerous, and so tame, that they ride on
them. In Batavia they have abounded all
along, that tract of sand-hills, and valleys,
laying between the Haghs-wood and Egmond.
In Brittain, checkered have been white, and
black ones. In the region of the Chicoriary
in the new world, they are kept tame like
goats. Solinus writes, that there are none in
Candy, except among the Cydoniatae. Yet
Varinus mention Does in Achaea on that Isle.
Bellonius said there are many there, there
being no harmfull creatures in Creet. They
swim out of Syria to Cyprus, because there is
plenty of pasture, that they fancy. In Elaphus
an Asian-hill by Arginussus,<note place="margin">Aelian.</note> they are cloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eared;
and by the Hellespont. They are there

they dig holes in lonely places, they smell
rank like goats, their faces sported with black;
so they live, till a sound shewr of rain fall, and
then they return to their pasture. They gender
in August and September. The same Bucks
follow divers Does, and returne again to the
first. The tame are usually barren,<note place="margin">Plin.</note> unlesse
they be from the very first brought up tame.
They go with fawn eight months. They bring

Aspalathus kills them with the touch.<note place="margin">Their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</note> They
delight in covert, in wild woods, forrests,
chases, where the soyl is fat. They love vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards
and lawns, and pastures in woods, where
the Sun comes. The Buck leaving his pasture,
hids him to the woodside, but the Does run
into the thickets; they seek after fresh pasture,
but ever return home again. One uses like
a Captain to lead the Herd, they feed all day,
at high-noon they seek shade; they are fearfull
even to a proverb. Cantharion Arcas, was
by the oracle nicknamed a Deere. They are
good at leaping, whence a place near Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
hath the name; where two stones are
erected,<note place="margin">Gesner.</note> in memory of one that being hunted
leaped 60 foot, and upon a loaden cart to save
himself. When hardly chased, they will rest
themselves, till the dogges draw near them.
When they despair of escaping, they leave the
woods, fly into the fields, and sometimes into
towns, and houses for shelter; for most part
they go with the wind. Their sagacity and wit,
in deluding the dogges, is strange. If they are
hunted by Eager-dogges,<note place="margin">Budae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

parties; then if pursued, they fly among
the Deere, kept tame about house; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they mingle with the Herd, to shrowed
themselves, sometimes they will drive the
hunted Deere from them; they will amuse the
dogges by their uncertain steps, going back
the same wayes, or where other Deere use to
tread, to confound the dogges sent; they will
run round, and leap to put the dogges to
alosse. There hath been one seen to run
among a Herd of oxen, and leap on an oxes
back, and to ride him along way, and trailing
the hinder-feet on the ground, to put the dogs
to a cold sent. They have been seen to leap
into trees in shady places. They eat Cinara
against venomous grasse; and crabs against

herds, one resting the head on the others but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock,
and take turns when the first is weary.
This is most observed in the passage from Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia
to Cyprus; though they see not land, they
smell it. They put the weakest last, and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not out till the wind favours them. They
fatten in summer,<note place="margin">Aelian.</note> and then lurk in corners, that
their weight may not make them an easy prey
to the dogs.<note place="margin">Arist.</note> They hide themselves also by day,
when they have cast their horns, and keep in
shady places, to avoid annoyance from flies; and
feed in the night, till their horns sprout again,
then they come into the Sun to confirm, and
harden them. And when they can rub them
against trees without pain, they dare venture
abroad again. Some say they bury their horns,
some say but one; the horn is seldome found,
which is medicinable.<note place="margin">Plin. Arist.</note> In Epire they bury their

some white all over. These the Indians call
Kings of Harts &amp; Yztak Makanne. Others they
call Aculhuame. The lesser, Quauhtlamacame,
that of timerous become generous, and
wounded are so fierce that they assault their
hunters, and oft kill them. Others like them are
called Thalhuicamacame, of the same bulk,
and nature, but not so couragious. The least are
Tamamacame; perhaps a kind of goats. In
Duarhe, Xapida, and other parts of America
they herds of Deere, as we of oxen; breeding,
and fed in, and near the house. They let them
loose by day to seek their pasture in the woods;
at even they returne to their fawns shut up in
stalls; they milk them, and have no other milk,
nor cheese made of any other milk. In some
western parts there chased, and wounded in
hunting they seeke an herb, called by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians
Atochielt, whereby they refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and recover their swiftnesse. It is more
usefull to them then Ditany. In Virginia the
Deer are longer tayled then ours, and their
horn-tops bend back. In America is a race of
them called Seovassen, much lesse then ours,
and with lesse heads, their hair hanging down
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59579:30"/>
like Goats among us. In new Mexico, they have
hairy long tailes, as Mules, and they are as
great, or greater then Mules, and very strong.

he scarce leaves any print of his footsteps in the

him in the vallies. His horns are lofty, that are
crosse beamed from the very forehead; a
knotty branch is in the midst, that branches out
again into broader. The horns are white, and
streaked as with small veins. They differ from
the Elks-horns in height; from the Harts, in
breeth; from both, in colour, and numerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of branches. When he runs, he rests them
on his back, for while he stands still the lower
branches even cover his forehead; with these
lower he is said to breake the ice to come by
drink. His food is wood-fruit, and mosse on
trees. He makes himself lurking holes in the
Northerne mountains, and in hard frosts
comes to Mosiberg, and other hills in Norwey.

it resembles a Deer, but is greater, and of

He is attired with three rows of horns, on each
are two horns, so that his head seems made up
of little rocks. Of these two are greater then
the rest, standing where the Deers horns use,
which grow to five cubits length, and there
are seen on him five and twenty branches.
Those two in the middle of his head are short,
and weakly. Others he hath on his forehead,
liker bons, then horns, which he uses most in
fight. <hi>Olaus M.</hi> saith, he is three-horned, and
that he is a kind of Stag, but much taller, fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,

Their meat is mountain-mosse, white,
especially in winter when the ground is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with snow; which though never so thick,
nature hath taught them to dig through to
come by their food. In Summer they browse
on trees, leaves, flowers, and herbs; rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring
to stand upright, then to bend in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because their horns stricking out afore

head wryed on one side. If you bring them
into other lands, they live not long, as men
find in Holsatia, and Prussia. Hether some

and turned loose into the woods, but none of
their breed have been found there. Because
they are both wild and tame; their milk, skin,
sinews, bones, flesh, and hair are made service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to man. The milk and whey is for food.
The skin serves for cloaths, bedding, and
saddles; being strong and lasting, they make
therefore sacks, and bellowes of it. With the
sinews they sew garments. Of the bones and
horns they make bowes. The flesh they dry
in the wind and the smoke, to last many years.
The hoof helps the cramp. With the hair
they stuffe saddles and cushions.</p>

by a hand opposite, because it is full of pores,

it, who hath a foot by him; but he might be

twelf ounces; the part near the head, a man
could scarce graspe, adorned with five blades,
two on each side, beside a little one shooting
out. The legge weighed three pound and an

to betake him to the water, and to take a
mouthfull, and to spout it hot at the dogges.
He is seene seldome alone; in snow they goe
many together in company. One hastens
afore, as occasion serves; the rest tread in his
very steps, and hold the same pace: They can
hold out a day and a night, without eating or
drinking. If you take the yong one, you may
make the dame so tame, that shee will be
brought to drink beere with you. He hath
such a strength in his hoof, that with one blow
hee can kill a wolf, and bruise a tree, as if it
were a toad-stool. The natives, where they
are, eat the flesh, both fresh and salted; but the

In Phisick, the horne is binding, and good
against the epilepsy, if cut off between the
feast of the birth, and that of the assumption
of the Virgin Mary: Some say, on Aegidius
his day.<note place="margin">Olaus M.</note> The sinews are used in Swethland
against the cramp, made into a girdle, and tied
about the part in paine. The hoof helps
against the falling-sicknesse, and the stopping
of the womb, or hystericae. The outer right
hind-hoof of the male, afore he hath coupled,
choped of from the live-foot with a hatchet,
after mid-August, is a present help for the
cramp, and fainting fits; if you make a ring of
it for your left hand, or if you grasp it in your
right hand; or put a bit into the left eare, and
sometimes pick the eare therewith. The sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings

the Elephants, very rugged, full of deep folds
on the sides, and back, thick of hide, that a

holds enmity with the Elephant. He hurts not
mankind, unlesse provoked. When he is to
fight,<note place="margin">Nature.</note> he sharpens his horn on the stones: In
combate, he aimes at the belly, which he knows
to be soft; out of which he lets all his enemies
blood. If he cannot come at the belly, the
Elephant with his trunk and teeth dispatcheth
him. Provoked, he makes no more of a Man
and an Horse, then of a flea; he can with his
sharp tongue lick a man to death; fetching of
skin and flesh to the bare bones. Shoot him,
and he with a hideous cry layes all flat, that
comes in his way, even the thickest trees. Read
stories of his fiercenes in Bontius. Hee delights
strangely in mud. Being to fight, shee secures
her yong one first: Hee grunts like a hog. The

The thin skin of the Sow, is of the same colour
with the hair. He anatomized a Sowes belly,
and found in the utmost ends certain thin skins,
wherein it seems, were preserved the superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of dregs, and pisse. The navel-vein is
parted near the womb; the navel-vessels first
bend toward the left pinion, then encompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the neck croswise, they lead back toward
the right leg. In the Birth almost all the bowels
are conspicuous, the Liver, Stomack, Bowels,
Milt, Reins, Mid-rif, Heart, Lungs. The heart
whitish, the Lungs liver-coloured, the Liver
dark-red, the Reins great according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
of the vein appearing by the right
forefeet, but more by the hinderfeet; the
throat veins that ascend to the head, are of the
shape of a lambda (λ). In a perfect shaped pig,
the breast laid open by two crosse-sections, you
see two sinews, that passing through the throat,
and cleaving to the heart-skin, descend di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
through the sides of the heart to the
mid-rif, by whose sinewy-ringlet they are fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
through two or three branches, or sprigs;
whence passeth another to the upper-mouth of
the stomack. Here perceive you plainly the
severing of the axillary vein, and the thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miaean.
The lappets of the heart are hollow, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
from the forepart of the heart, conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

bottom of the bladder after two fingers bredth

acorns,<note place="margin">Hessel. Gerar. descrip. Austr.</note> chestnuts, dates, grane, bran, what not?
Beech-acorns make Sows lively, and pork light

Oken ones, well spread, large and heavy. Fast
flesh, but hard comes from Mast. Holmber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are best, given a few at once. Acorns from
the Esculus, the Oke, the Cork make light,
spungy pork. The Haliphlaei give them acorns
only, when they want other food. <hi>Pliny</hi> among
chestnuts commends those with a stony shell.
In Egypt, Cyprus, Syria, and Seleucia in As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siria,
they are fatned with dates. The Ash-fruit
also fattens them. Dry Cytisus is commended
by <hi>Aristomachus</hi> the Athenian. Scalions they
eat in Bavaria. Wild rape also, have leaves like
a violet, sharp, a white root, not without milk.
Henbane makes them run made. Green pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture

carcases; nay, they spare not their own pigs;

To fatten them with figs, till they

English are a year fatning them, which makes
their pork firme and dainty, where a Sow
becomes so fat, that she cannot stand nor goe,

                     <p>The Helvetians prefer March-pigs. In hot
Regions, winter ones are best. The Sow
having littered, gives to the first pig the former
teats, being fullest of milk. Every pig knows
it's teat, and keeps to that alone. Take away
the pigs she grows barren, leave her one only,

but cut one up it shews it self; nor is there scarce
any without three at the least, whereto those
are more liable, the flesh of whose thighs, neck
and shoulders are moyst, we call them meazles.
They cleave to the lower part of the tongue;
a Hog is knowen to be meazled by the bristles
plucked from the back, if the roots be bloody.
If they come out of a hot into a cold place, and
are suffered to ly down, if you stir them not,
there is a kind of convulsion in all their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
They are also troubled with hog-lice;
and in Summer, unlesse you often stir them,
they are taken with a lethargy. They are
troubled also with cough, sqincy, swellings and
loosnesse; unlesse they drink their fill, they
become shortbreathed. They are most bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish,<note place="margin">Plin. l. 8. c. 51.</note>
filthy, lustful, and greedy by nature; and
seem to have a soul only as salt to keep them

The Liver taken with wine, helps against the

stops a loosnesse. The Bladder provokes urine,

it, and a watry humour gushes out; yet
it is properly no navel, but a kind of soft

beasts, as is well known by the dissecting of
him. Some thinke that he breaths that way.
He is noysome;<note place="margin">Anton. Herrera.</note> he gnashes with his tusks hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly,
and is leaner and slenderer then ours.
He is fierce. The huntsmen climbe trees; a
herd of these Zaini bite at, and teare the body
of the tree, not being able to come at the men,
who from above wound them with bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spears.
They go in herds, and choose a leader,
and as men report, the least, and vilest of the
herd, old, and feeble, nor part they company

him. Some ascribe the like to the Bachirae.
They abhor the Tiger. The captain of the
Zaini calls of his kind more then three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
together, and conducts them, as a
Generall his forces; with these he sets on the
Tiger, who, though the fiercest of all Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
wild beasts, is yet overmastered by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
but not with a great destruction of the
Zaini; many of whom have been found lying
dead with the Tigre, and but a few left to ring
their knell.<note place="margin">Franc. Hernand.</note> Hee bites shrewdly, when first
taken; but when tamed, men take pleasure in
him. His flesh is like porke, or brawn, but
tougher, and not so sweet; his bristles are sharp,

on acorns, roots, and other mountain-fruit, and
also on worms, and such vermine as are bred
in moyst-fenny places. Their <hi>toes</hi> are some

Hee is called an Horse, not from his

him. Some say that hee is five cubites high,
and hath ox-hoofs, three teeth sticking out
each side of his mouth, greater out then any
other beasts, eared, tayled, and neighing like
the horse, in the rest like the Elephant; he hath
a mane, a snout turning up, in his inwards not
unlike an horse, or asse, without hair; taken
by boats. Bellonius saw a small one at By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium,
cow-headed, beardard, short, and

broad lips turning up, sharp teeth as a

short, tayled like a hog, swag-bellied like a

carcasse of one, preserved in salt, brought by
a Chirurgion called Nicholas Zerenghus from
Damiata into Italy; hee saith, that he was liker

mouth a foot wide, snout-fleshy and turning
up, litle-eyed, each an inch wide, and two long,
the ears about three; the bulke thick, the foot
broad, parted into foure toes, the ankle hard of
flesh, tayled like a tortoys: skin thick, tough,

goggle; his nose not great, his gape, as a sheeps,

stif and great necked, and reasonable thick,
strong of breast; the part of the back against
the heart broad, slender flankled, thighs stout,
and sinewy; the hair yellow, not much curling.
The forefeet are parted by five toes, the hinder
by four. The Lyonesse is differenced from the
Lyon, by the smoothnesse of her neck and
shoulders, the male having there a thick hair,
mane, as also by two teats in the midst of their
belly, whence we are not to argue the number
of Whelps. She hath little milk, so that the
Whelp must have other food, but little serves
the turn. As for the <hi>inward parts,</hi> the Lyon
hath exceeding strong temple-muscles,<note place="margin">Galen. part. l. 9. cap. 19.</note> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

aims at him, and misses; as one did to a yong
man in Iubaes army. One hurt with an arrow
by a passerby, revenged it a year after,<note place="margin">Aelian.</note> tearing
the same man, lighting on him againe amidst a
troop of men.</p>
                  <p>Another endeavoured to pearce a Lion with
a lance,<note place="margin">Albertus.</note> and missing the Lion, griped with his
paw his helmet, which saved his head; while
they walk they withdraw their claws, that they
may not be blunted. They go not strait on,
but sideling, shifting their steps to amuse the
chasers. No doubt but they may be tamed.
Onomarchus, King of Catana had them for
his familiars. One used to sit like a dogge by
the side of John II. of Portugall. In Adonis
Temple in Elimeae, they fawned on all that
entred. Berenice her Lion licked her face.
One converts with a Ram,<note place="margin">Mart. Epig. l. 9. c. 73. Plin. H. N. l. 8. c. 16.</note> as if they had
forgot their natures. Marcus Anthony at Rome
coupled them to draw a chariot, hee was the
first that did so, and it seemed ominous, that
in civill warre, when the Phatsalicks field was
fought, that generous spirits should be subdued
to the yoake; and it was a monstrous show
above those monstrous calamities, that hee
should then ride so in state with his Mimed
Citheris. Hanuo that famous Carthaginian,
was the first who durst familiarly handle a
Lion, which rendered him more suspected
both of craft, and cruelty. There are examples
also extant of their gentlenesse exprest to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
who have met them by chance. Mentor
of Syracuse, lighting on one in Syria, was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and would have fled, but the Lion met
him at every turne, fawned on him, and licked
his footsteps; at length hee spied a swelling,
and wound, and a thorn, whereof hee eased
him. Which is kept in memory in a picture
at Syracuse. Also Elpis a Samian arriving in
Africa by the shore-side, a Lion came with
open mouth, hee clomb a tree, calls on father
Bacchus, having no hope but in prayer; the
Lion left him not, but seemed to crave his
pitty and ayd, having a bone sticking in his
teeth, that put him him to excessive pain, and drew
lamentable cries from him; the man tooke
heart, come downe, pluckt the bone out, and
they said, that in gratitude the Lion hunted,
and brought prey to that man, so long as the
ship rode there. The story of Androdus
also is well knowen, the Roman slave, and the
Lion.<note place="margin">Gel. noct. Attic. l. 5.</note> Seneca also was eye-witnesse of a
Lion, that in the Amphitheater owned a man,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59579:36"/>
destined to dy there,<note place="margin">Plin. l. 8. c. 16.</note> and protected him from
the assault of other wilde beasts. The Lion
alone among all savage beasts, is gentle to
suppliants; sparing those that ly prostrate at
his mercy. Hee will assault men first, and spare
women; and unlesse hee be very hungry, hee
will not meddle with infants. In Lybia they
beleeve, that they understand requests. A Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian
captivessed is said to have escaped the
fury of many Lions, by pleading thus for her
self; alack, I am a silly woman, banished, weak,
and a petitioner to the noblest, and most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of beasts, that rulest the rest; thou canst
have no honour in such a worthles prey. It
used to be an hard task to take Lions; the
common way was in pits. A Getulian shepheard
mastered a Lion, by casting his coat on his
head; which was also shewen in a Theatre,
where a Lion being so muffled, was ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
and incredibly bound, without making
any resistance. It seemes all lies in the eye.

thereof.<note place="margin">Observ. l. 1. c. uit. Plin.</note> At Constantinople, when

among writers. The Lions chiefe honour is
in his hairy shoulders, and neck, which right
bred Lions in time grow too, but mungrells
want. And the manes also differ, some are
longer, and more curled then others. Some
are much fiercer then others. In Africa, and
among the Abyssines there are yellow as gold,
white, and black ones. In Lybia party-coloured
ones, with red mouths, and black and blew
spots like flowers. In West-Indies they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to ash-colour. Those of America are
not so vigorous. In Puma in Peru are none
so great as those in Africk; they are more time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and harmlesse, if you let them alone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,
dusky rather then yellow. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
meet by troups, and hunt them, and kill
them with stones and clubs. The Barbarians
climb trees, and thence gall them with their
spears, and arrows, they make merry with the
flesh, and feast on it; reserving the fat for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and with the bones they sport, and
daunced. A Spanjard having taken a tree,
kept of an huge lionesse, having pearced her
through with foure arrows, in her belly were
found two Tiger mungrell-whelps, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the spots. Hollanders have eaten of
Sea-lions.</p>
                  <p>There are other wild beasts that come some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
near a Lion,<note place="margin">Nierem. H. E. l. 9. c. 24.</note> as the Mitili, not hairy as
our Lion, but a kin to him, whelped duskish,
after grows yellow, sometimes red, and whitish,
bigger then the common Lion, (which may
be from the nature of the region) and not so
fierce. There is the Quamitzli, hee is tamer,
and nimbler then the lion; Some Spanjards
tooke him for the Panther. Then the Maca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitzli,
taking name from the Hart, and Lion;
and the Cuitlamitzi, so called from the lion
and wolf, thicker, but gentler, and lesse then
the lion; Hee lives by Hunting-deere, and
crotales; and when full, hee yet kills any
harmfull creature; when he hath filled his belly,
hee sleeps two, or three dayes, till he is hungry
again. Then the Tlalmitzli, lesse then a cat,
but faced like a lion, his looke and fiercenesse
seeme strange in so small a body. There is the
Cacamitzli, like the lion and cat, living among
the bulrushes, hee is but foure spans long, small,
yellow-haired, but long, small-eared, headed
like a Swan, long and rough-tayled; so fierce,
that hee sometimes dare set on a Stag. In
Mexico, Mixtli, signifies both cat, and lion,
whence that beast hath his name. He lives also
among the Pannicenses. Some of these kinds
it may be are reducible to the Baboons, or
Bavians.</p>

crooked claws, duskish hair about the neck,
white about the belly, the rest of the body ash-coloured,
everywhere black spotted, the
muzzle, and tayl short, the tongue rough, rather
grumbling then roaring, and of incredible
swiftnesse. He lives on the Tetrocamian hills;
hunts Deere, and other beasts of that bulke,
and sometimes men. The tongue is so veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
that a lick on the ey of his prey, blinds,
and kills it. He covers the carcasses of the slain
with herbs, hay, and greensward; then climbs
the next trees and houles; when the beast with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hearing, by instinct of nature, come at the
call, hastning as to a feast, and fill themselves

they seaze on men; and if with over-greedy

they retire softly, roaring; and finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

of <hi>Fedreman,</hi> a Tiger assaulted a troop
of Souldiers, and in the midst of them tare a
Spaniard, and three Indians, and escaped away
unhurt: Yet swadle them about the reins with
a stick, you cool their courage, and master
them; there is no other way. The Indians
dread no beast more, and even worship it.</p>
                  <p>The Devil very oft confers with them in the
shape of a Tiger: their claws are thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous,
and the wound they make incurable.
The Barbarians reverence, nay dread this beast
lesse, since the Gospel came amongst them.
They are taken in nets, and in some places in
traps. In Bengala are the fiercest found, and
implacably revengeful. One hath followed
along the shore-side thirty mile a Ship, wherein
any have been embarqued who wronged her.
Cruel to all they meet, man or beast: Nature
yeilds some prevention to this mischief. A little
beast ever accompanies the Tiger, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
barking discovers where he is; and both
men and beasts take the warning, and hide
themselves, or run away. They are most greedy
after mans-flesh, especially the black-Moors,
and know their ships, chasing them twenty
leagues together, watching if any come ashore,
to devour him. By night they leap into ships,
and surprize, and destroy the Mariners. To
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59579:38"/>
give a memorable example of what hapened
to one of our men, while we were trading in
Bengala. A certain Moor, a servant dreamed
that a Tiger snatched him away; the night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he hid himself in the prow of the ship; being
asked the cause, he told his dream, which the
some night was verified; for all being asleep,
a Tiger leaps aboard, touches not any else,
though thirty lay asleep in the ship, but seazes
the wretched Moor.</p>
                  <p>The lot of another was Luckier, as divine
providence ordered it; hee being ashore, not
far from the ship, a Tiger assaults him behinde,
and a Crocodile out of a river afore; the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
to prevent his foe, and bear away his prey,
for overhast, runs quite beyond the man, and
running against the ships-side, falls into the
Crocodiles jaws, and so the man escaped. It
cannot be said how those of Bengala, dread
the Tigers rage; whence they call him by
sundry names, fearing, that, if they should call
him by his owne name, they might be torne
in pieces. In Brasil there are multitudes of
them, and those hungry, ravenous, dreadfull,
and swift, and very strong. But once full fed,
they are said to be so sluggish, that common
curres can drive them away. Gluttony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
not mankind alone. In new Spain they
lurke in trees by rivers-sides, watching the
Crocodiles, and leap down, and surprize, and
kill them.<note place="margin">Pet. Mart.</note> Time was, when Darien was as
much pestered by Tigers, as Nemaea with
Lions, and Calidonia with wilde Boares. In
six month there passed not one night free;
wherein a heyfer, horse, dog, or hog, was not
devoured in the town-wayes; their herds, and
flocks were wasted, not a man could with
safety step forth a doores; especially when the
Tigresses had whelps, when hunger forced
them to sease man, and beast. At length ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
put the natives on this invention, to
revenge, and save the blood of them, and
theirs; they observed strictly the Tigers track
from their dens, and digged a ditch, cast up
light earth, covered it with hurdles, fastened
sharp stakes at the bottome; there came a hee-Tiger,
hee fell in, stuck fast on the stakes; the
Indians threw down great stones on him, and
dispatched him in the pit, they cast many darts
at him, which with his right paw hee shattered
into a thousand pieces, and chips. If when
half dead, and bloodlesse, hee bred such a
terrour in the beholders, how dreadfull, think
wee, was hee when loose? One John Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desina,
a Spanjard, who was present at the
busines, reports, that hee ate his share of that
Tiger, and that it tasted as well as beef. Ask
them, who never saw a Tiger, how they know
one, they tell you, by the spots, fiercenesse,
nimblenesse. When many have seen Leopards,
Panthers, Ounces so marked also; the male-Tiger
dead, they traced his footsteps to his
den, where female also dwelt; shee absent,
they tooke away two sucking whelps;
changing their mind, and that they might send
them to Spain, when bigger, they fitted iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chains
carefully to their necks, and left them
there to the dames nursery. A few dayes after
returning to the den, they found them not,
supposing that the dame in a rage had torne
them in pieces, and taken them away, that no
man might have them; for they affirme, that
they could not possibly be tame, alive out of
the chains. The skin of the male was stuffed
with dry herbs, and sent to Admirantus, and
the Governers of Hispaniola. See more of

Theophrastus thinks, that for that time
Bears flesh boyled and kept might increase,
there is no shew in them that they have
eaten, but onely a little moysture found
in the paunch, and a few drops of blood

the males grows so fat, that they hardly stirre;
the Shee-beare is leaner, because they breed.<note place="margin">Solin.</note>
They hold their lodgings in their dens seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,

they breed teeth, they champ on slips thereof.
If they assault Bulls, they make at the horns to

Fox; frequent in new Spain, in places lesse
cold; He lives by preying on weaker beasts,

sets on Deer, and Men; He is cunning
in avoiding hunts-men; of the wolfs nature,
revengefull, and mindfull of the losse of his
prey, long after hunts him that took it; and
with others falls on him, kills him, watches his
house, kills all the tame cattel about it. But is
so grateful to his benefactors, that he leaves
part of his prey to them. His pizzle rubbed on
the teeth, is said to give present ease to the
touth-ach. The Cuit-lax-caiotl, is of the like
nature and shape, but of another hair; thick,
and shag-necked; the hair so long on the
breast and face, that it is hideous to behold.
The Azcacoiotle sits on Ants holes, and by
night houles in several voices. The Ilpemaxtla
is of a hair white, black, and gold-yellow, small-headed,
and joynted, slender-bodied, and short,
but long-muzzled, and thin; He is found eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rywhere

small-muzzled, small-eared, hairy, and black-bodied,
especially near the tail, short-thighed,
black and crooked-claw; he lives in rocky<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,

the Izquiepatl, and the Conepatl, one with

and Asses hair, and in the woods of Iava, and
the kingdome of Congo; and in India on the
Emoden hills, and on that lofty mountain near
Aden a city of Arabia, and all about the Indian
Continent. In Malabar they are very cheape,
because they hurt the Indians Nut, that is the
gain of the natures. They eat any thing, and
gnaw their own tayl when they are lustfull.
They abhor Crocodiles so, that they are almost
strooke dead with the sight. In East-Indies,
under the Portugals, they eat them, and use
them in Physick. What sport they make is well
knowen. Their bones brayed, and drunk by
provoking sweat, ease the French pox. They
dote on their young,<note place="margin">Nature. Nierem. H. I. l. 9. c. 44.</note> and hugge them hard;
they feed on fruit, and birds egs. Many of
them eats and drink their own excrements.
Sometimes, if they see a man alone, they come
down, and play with him. They are full of
crafty tricks. It is strange to see how they cast
stumps of trees at passengers; they passe rivers
holding by each others tayls, and get over by
bows, and a chain by wondrous arts. Above all,
if one of them be wounded by an arrow, or
dart, no men can help one another better then
they, knowing how to stanch the blood with
leaves, and mosse, and save, if possible, the life.
They bring but one at a birth, and embrace
their young, and carry them to the craggy tops
of hills, where the huntsmen raise a heape, and
compasse it with maiz, and lay there the stone
Cacakoatl, the nature whereof is, when heated
through with fire to crack, and fly asunder, the
Baboone run to it, and to eat of that stone, but
terrified with the crack, forget their young,
and run away, leaving them a prey to hunters.
They carry also their young on their back, till
they can safely dispose of them. The young
hang with the hands about the dames neck,
and with the legs cling about her back. Some
are nimble as a bird in climbling trees, and scip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
from tree to tree. One hath been seen to
leap a river. The captains of them perceiving
a troup of men passe by, (for men dare not
passe by them alone, nor a few) they call their
fellows of divers shapes together, out-face the
men, and with hideous moyse skip from tree
to tree, and follow the men, mocking them
with a thousand Apes tricks, moppings, mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
waggings of the tayl, and make as if they
would assault them; but coming down, and see
the arrows, and guns, (which they have had
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59579:42"/>
occasion afore to be acquainted with,) aimed
at them, they fly swifter then the wind to the
tree-tops, where they complain, chatter, and
threaten. It is said, they are so dexterous,
that they can decline, and avoid arrows-shot,
and catch them flying, as if they were reached
to them; but the bullets put the younger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
their skill. When they see any of their
fellows fall, and taken up by the shooters, they
thunder above, filling the skies with hideous
noyses; as if you heard the roarings, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of a thousand Lions, and Tigers. But
one thing is worth hearing; each Ape, when
they take a tree, carry up stones in one hand,
and some in their mouths, and pelt the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
when they have done shooting. One
levelling at a great, long-tayld Monkey with
a gun, hee made as if hee would stand it; but
when the man winking with one eye, was
taking aime, he threw a stone in his face, and
brake it, and dashed out some of his teeth.
But since he perished by a new stratagen, and
was shot, just as the stone fell, and was eaten
for a dainty with mirth. Some would have
eaten then toads, or worse, so hungry they
were. Such tricks perswaded the old world,
that these were a humane race, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned
in fables, mention of the Baboons
birth-day. I thought once that they were
happily a kind of Pigmees. It is strange how

to the Tavern, and pay the shot. Among the
souldiers of Havana, a Baboon marked that
one won apace, and sate close to him, to have
his share, according to the manners; if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
he would fight for it; if he received it,
hee ran strait to the Taverne, and tooke a

the pot being brimfull, he drank it up, payed

more wine to the value, which he did twice, or

                  <p>Another being sent to the Taverne, and not
using to pay till hee had his bottle full, would
gather stones to defend it against the boyes;
and though he loved wine well, he carried it
safe and entire to his Master. He could not
abide painted women,<note place="margin">P. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note> but tore their hair and
cloathes. One great Baboon, with an extreme
long tail hanging by it, on an Oke, turning and
swing himself three or four times, caught hold,
skipped from bough to bough, and from tree
to tree, as if he had flowen. An Archer shot
one, who being wounded, in a fury set on him
who hurt him; he drawing his sword, cut off
the Baboons arme, and took him, but strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
resisting; but being brought to the Navy,
he grew tamer, being chained: and the hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
bringing a Boar home, he and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boon
were ever fighting; this with his tail
tangled the Boar, flew at his throat, and throat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

an Infant,<note place="margin">Aelian. l. 7. c. 20.</note> ran to the house top, and held the
child for a buckler between him and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to make him hold from shooting. Baboons

having a round goats-beard, they are as big as
our Foxes, high-browed, with black sparkling-eyes,
ears short and roundish; tail long, bare

the hair black, long, sleek, and shining. There
are swarms of them in the Woods there, and
make a hideous noyse. They meet daily again,
and again afore and after mid-day.<note place="margin">Marck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav.</note> One of the

husht in a twinkling, and the first concludes
aloud. They carry their young on their back,
frisking from bough to bough. It is a biting
and untamed beast. Some of them are great,
and black, having a long, black, shaggy beard.
If they find a Moor woman alone, they force
her. Clusius describes a kind, long tayled, with
a tuft at the end, like a Lion. The Guinee
<hi>Exquina</hi> in Congo hath dark hair, as it were
burnt, sprinkled with white tops. The beard
very white, the hair two fingers long, as it were
kemed. Anger him, he gapes wide and chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
Another sort is as great, or each cheek
stone of hair white, and yellow, bearded like
a Goat, reaching to either eare; black leged:
Toyish, and clamorous as the other. Ambro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sine
represents three prints of them; one he
conceives to be the Callitriche (or fair-haired)
living only in Aethiopia. A second a kin to that.
The third faced like an old man (a Marmoset)

first the Cagui, as the Brasilians, or the Pongi,

                     <note place="margin">Ambrosin. H. Digit. l. 2. c. 18.</note> or <hi>Mattern,</hi> hath the name
from his fiercenes; called also <hi>Martia,
Marta, Marrus,</hi> and <hi>Foina, Gainus,
Scismus.</hi> His teeth pure white, even
set, and keen. The dog-teeth in either jaw
hang out, six smaller of diverse length are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,
in stead of cutters, and are very small
in the lower jaw. The grinders are eight,
and like saws, some single. The utmost above
stand more inward then the rest by much.
Under the skin are sinewy small veins,<note place="margin">Zootom. Democr. p. 317.</note> stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, answering all the ribs in number, and
order; the ribs are fourteen. No membrane
fleshly. The <hi>muscles</hi> of the paunch are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two tunicles of the rim, which makes
it seeme thicker, and grosser, as the horny-film
of an Ox-ey; fleshy in length by that line, that
answers the navell, but not abroad, and onely
below. The <hi>kell</hi> fastened to the stomack, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls,
and milt; the milt very small, hanging on
the left side of the stomack, and a part of the
kell fastened to it. The <hi>stomack</hi> bigger then
ordinary for such a small body, consisting of a
doubled coat, the outmost whiter, the inmost
smoother, both thin. The <hi>guts</hi> fastened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
to the back-bone by a thin skin. No blind
gut, all uniforme. The <hi>bladder</hi> very long,
thin, but inclining more to the stomack. The
<hi>liver</hi> of seven films, the weakest three-parted,
like a chicken-foot, the middle three-cornerd,
annexed to the hollow vein, a litle way by a
thin skin. The right <hi>Rein</hi> is higher. The left
<hi>Emulgens</hi> longer then the right; both sprouting
from the great artery, not from the hollow-vein.
Yet I doubt of it. By the hollow-vain
are here and there reddish, and yellow <hi>kernells;</hi>
the uppermost on the right side joyns to the
liver by small veins. The <hi>hollow vein</hi> sends
many sprigs through the loyn-space of muscles
to the back bone; and the great artery lies
under the hollow. The seed-vessels descend
from the midst of the reins, but are parted in
two on either side below, one branch joyned
to the stone, reaching without the paunch.

an wimble-skind, close, sharp as a needle. The
right uritory sit higher into the bladder, then
the left; a fine sinew comes strait down, tied
to the right side, sit into the beginning of the
hollow vein. Also a small sinew on the left-side,
descends to the stomacks-mouth. The hollow-vein
is set into the right ventricle of the heart,
neare the right lappet, which is black, and full
of blood, and greater then the left; this is
white, and bloodles, hollow, spreading on the
right side into the lungs. The great artery
is set into the hearts left ventricle, bending
downward. The hollow vain on the right, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
a little above the lungs-branches it self, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
six springs, rising to the lower jaw. On the
right side the lungs, consist of foure lesser
veins, on the left of two greater. They are
most in the North, and in the German-Alps,
Southward, and toward Italy. They inhabite
the roofs of greater houses, and beech, and
firre-woods. A Boor told Gesner, that in
a very high firre-tree, he tooke a Mattern, and
foure welps. France hath no such. Out of
Poland are some brought of a slight dusk-colour.</p>

Beside other Weezels-food, they are said to
eat shrubs,<note place="margin">Renod. l. 3. Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cop.</note> their dung smels like Musk; they
are easily tamed. Gesner had one that loved
his dog, that went about with him; let loose,
shee would come to the chaine again, and play
with him like a cat, lying on the back. But
there is no trusting them; therefore some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise,
to take out their dog-teeth. The skin is
of use; that under the throat, makes caps good
and wholsome for the head.<note place="margin">Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</note> In Canada the
women shew their babes in them. There are
two kinds; one <hi>tamer</hi> of a dark yellow, except
a white part of the throat, which curriers and
skinners call Faina. Bodies like a cat, a litle
longer, and shorter legged. It rooms about
the country, kills Hens, and sucks their egs.
The other is <hi>wilde,</hi> of a brighter, and softer
hair, and a clay-coloured throat. Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite
Beech,<note place="margin">Ambrosin. H. Dig. l. 2. c. 19. Arist. Niphus. Alciate. Agricola.</note> and Oake, and Holm-woods,
some pitch, and firre-woods. About the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine

or the <hi>Sarmatick,</hi> and <hi>Scythian-Mouse,</hi> is
somewhat lesse then the Mattern, of a dark
yellow all over, except the throat, which is
ash-coloured. Found in the North, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
woods of Moscovia, in Lithuania,
white-Russia, and neare the Cronion-Sea, and
in Laucerusa, a wood of Scandinavia. The
Tartars, and Laplanders send the best skins.
The Guinee story tells of store, in a Province
of Congo; they lurke in shady Forrests, and
catch birds. They are very nimble, and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
It is said, that, if you lay the skin under
other cloathes in a chest-bottome, in three
dayes it shall be found uppermost; Handle
them, yet they remain even. The long-haired,
and inclining to black, are the best skins. You
spoyl them, if you lay them in the Sun. To
keep them from the moth, shake them oft,
and lay them up wrapped in wormwood; they
are very costly. Agricola saw fourty sold
for a thousand crowns. Ambrosine, a halfe
sleeve trim'd therewith, worth foure hundred
pound of Bonony-money. They of Obdoria,
offer this Mus-cats-skins to their Idol, called
Zlata Baba.<note place="margin">M. Paul. Venet.</note> The great Cham of Tartary, his

a kind of Panther, which the ancients thought
the only well-sented beast; this is thought the
same with the Hyena of old. It is armed with
sharp teeth and hair. An arme long from head
to dock; the legs to the feet, a third part of an
armes length. Hee is about the bignes of a fox,
coloured like a wolf, but black-spotted. Hee
carries a bag about his privities, wherein lies
the Civet, that is so fragrant.<note place="margin">Rondel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

woods. Brought also out of Egypt, where they
breed plentifully, and out of Spain into Italy.
Hee loves raw flesh, and field-mice. Cardinal
Galeotto feeds them at Rome with chicken-flesh.
In China hee eats sweet-meats, and rice,
and egs, and the sweet wood called Camaron;
if that be the beast Pigafetta, mentions in his
journall. Scaliger hath seen them so tame at
Rome and Mantua, that men carry them
harmlesly on their shoulders. A Florentine
Consul at Alexandria had one so gentle,<note place="margin">Bellon. Obser. l. 2. c. 20.</note> that
hee played with men, taking them by the nose,
ear, lips, teeth, and did them no harm. Ever fed
from the first it was with womans breast-milk.
The sweet excrement lurking as afore,<note place="margin">Fallopius.</note> is first
white, after of a clayish colour, at length waxes
black. It smells strong at first to wonder men;
being layd in the open ayr, and hardened, it
obtains that most gratefull fragrancy. Some
will have it to be his seed. It is gathered in a
silver spoon, or one of brasse, or horn, every
day a dram. If you vex him with a small rod,
hee yeelds more at a time. Some are said to
pisse civet at a set time of the year. Civet is best
kept in horn. There are some nobles of
Ulyssipone that gaine thence yearly fifteen
hundred pounds. It is of use in Phisick, and
otherwise. A grain put on hot bread, applied
to the navell eases the collique.<note place="margin">Maiol. Coll. 7.</note> It is one good

They love to sit abroad in the Sun in fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
They love the place best where they
were bred. Are easily tamed; but dy, if too fat,
yet, on the least scope given, they run away to
their old liberty, and fall to their first wildnesse.
They seldome grow fat in the woods, because
perhaps they live in fear. Against winter they
provide their house in Sunny places,<note place="margin">Wit.</note> in summer
Northward. They run far for food, on purpose
to keep themselves long winded by dayly
breathing, and to use their feet. To amuse the
hunters they run through windy wayes, shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
shrubs, least their hair should stick there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so yeeld sent to the dogs. They know
how to proportion their course, as the dogs
are slower, or fleeter, and they lurk, when
hunted, among clods, because they are of their
colour. Jews may not eat them; but among
the Gentiles, after Attalicus the Cydonian had
made Hare a dish at his feasts, it became a dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

fair. For certain Alexander Severus ate it
dayly;<note place="margin">Lamprid. Mar. Epig. 30. Brui. l. 13.</note> and Martiall writes something, that
sounds that way. As for the temper of Hares

long, and broad for such a body: The Indians
weave the hair into clothes and sheets, which
they wear for cloaks. The Brasilians have their
Cotias of the bignesse, shape, and taste of the
Hare; yellowish, little eared, and almost no
tail. There is a greater kind called Pacae, round
mouthed, Cat-faced, dusk, with white spots;
tender of flesh, and skin also, therefore fought
after as a dainty. There is also a kind that the
Indians cudgell to death; then flea it,<note place="margin">Amat. Lusitan.</note> and work
the blew-beaten-flesh into a Paste, which they
wrap in the skin, and call Musk.</p>

One that kept Conies, relates that
some have brought three young at once; and
after a fortnight as many more. But in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,
and Italy, they seldome breed in winter,<note place="margin">Niphus.</note>
they bring five or nine at most; that of their
double-sex is a fiction; they suck oneantwenty
dayes; if any handle them, the dames are
angry, and either forsake, or hurt, or kill their
yong: And the males doe the same, if the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
are busie about their young, and neglect
them. By leaping Rabbits,<note place="margin">Nature, and Wat.</note> scape taking;
they forsake places, where they are in danger;
and one going, all the rest follow. It is known
that they chew the cud; through envy they
will bite one anothers ears, and legs off, yet
are easily tamed. Cardan knew one of it self
follow the dogs; they dig them burrows with
many outlets. In Spain they in sandy soyl
undermined, and subeverted a fair town,<note place="margin">M. Varro.</note> so that
the natives must seeke other dwellings; they
come not abroad, but mornings, or evenings;
and go not far from burrows, and stop up the
entrance, to prevent discovery by the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers;
their flesh, especially of the young
ones, is tenderer then Hare.<note place="margin">Use.</note> A Spanjard was
the first who made it a dish on his table; they
care not in Spain for tame Conies, they tast
too much of their food, but wild are a dainty.
They parboyl them, and stuf them with sweet
herbs; and lard them with pork. In <hi>Phisick,</hi>

one fouretimes as bigge as ours, and strangly
fat. Pliny thinks that the Betick-Conies have
double inwards. Some called <hi>Vtiae</hi> in India,
are no bigger then Rats. I leave to the reader
to judge, whether they are Conies that Scaliger
describes, of Hare-colour, short-eares, thick-body,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59579:47"/>
and well set, long-tails like the Squirrels.
Some call them Pharohs-Mice, some Indian-Hares;
there those they call Indian-Pigs, of the
bignes of our Conies, but shorter-legged, on
the fore six toes, on the hinder-feet five; they
have Mice-teeth, no tayl, a sharp Muzzle; Ears
little, and round, rather bristled then hairy; they
gruntle like Pigs, they eat all herbs, fruit, bread,
oats, living many month without water. One
male is enough for seven, or nine females; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

they kindle, in 60 dayes all seeing. The males

Some are called Pontick mice; the Getulian,
and Indian are pied. The Pontick lives about
Pontus, and used there for weare, called also
the Laffican-mouse, and the Venetian, and by
the Pole, Popieliza. He is ash-coloured in
bright, the tail not so bushy as others, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
as the common squirrell. He is buried
all winter in a deep sleep, some on the back are
more ash, some more fier red. The Getulian
is party-coloured red, and black, streaked
handsome with white, and dusk from the
shoulders to the tail through back, and sides,
lesse then the common one, with hanging
ears, almost as big as his head, round, fetched
through the surface of the skin, long headed
like a frog. Of the Indian are five, or six kinds.</p>
                  <p>1. The Quauhtechallotl, the Tliltik, or Tli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locotequillin,
so called from the black colour,<note place="margin">Hier. H. E. l. 9. c. 34.</note>
and the pine-tree, where he dwells. He eats the
pine-apples, in the hollow there he layes up his
winters provision, there they keep their brood,
and gnaw all round. They are subtile, chirp like
sparrows, the tail is woolly, and can cover the
whole body. They are easily tamed, and
brought to eat any thing. Eating, he stands on
his hind-feet, and holds his meat with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feet,
lifting up his tail, but running he stretches
it out at length. Anger him he raises his hair.
They make winter-furres of the skins, which
are warme, and handsome.</p>
                  <p>2. The Quauhtechallotl, Quapachtli, or
Corticolotequilin, so called from the clay-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the belly, twice as big as others; and
except the belly is white, black, and dusk; the
tail long and bushy, that can cover him all
over. They live with their young in burrows,
eat Indian wheat, which they take out of the
fields, and lay up for winter, they are subtile, and
never tamed.</p>
                  <p>3. The Tlechallotl, with a tail half bald, and
shorter, not about nine inches, is never tamed,
bites cruelly, gnaw all things, is bright, and
dusk, eats as squirrells, and most maiz, hath
great eyes, digs himself a burrow, strews it
with wool, cotten, or any soft thing, lives there,
and chirps like a sparrow.</p>
                  <p>4. The Thalmototli, of a span long, great-headed,
and eyed for such a small body; the
tail long, bushy, with white, dark, and black
streaks, and can cover himself therewith, the
body is pied, sometimes inclining to yellow.</p>
                  <p>5. The Quiniichpatlan, or flying mouse,
black, shaped like a small bird, long near the
arms, and thighs; he goes from tree to tree, as
if he flew; lesse he is then the rest mouse-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
great eared, feed as the other. The ashes
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59579:48"/>
of the tail burnt, are said to easen child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing.</p>
                  <p>6. The Yztactechalotl, like the rest, only
the head, neck, and buttocks at top, yellow, and
the tail hath blew spaces, and whitish, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
streaks; the rest of the body is whitish,
whence it hath the name.</p>

They are prously tender of their old fires, and
dames. Like Mice, they quit a ruinous house,
three months afore it fall by a prophetique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;
that winters-fatning by rest, lasts not
above six years. All that inhabite one wood,
meet sometime, and maintain a flight against
those of another hill, or river. All authours
hold that there is poyson in them about their
tail, and that their pisse sprinkled on any part,
makes it incurably, putrifie to the bone. Some

Q. Scaurus was the first who set their flesh

Gliraria, or Dormouse pens. They are thought
best, and fattest from October to January;
and the younger the better meat. In Phisick
they have also place. Eating the flesh frees from

saith Niphus. In Cantabria, men are hired to
hunt them. The Aeolians, and Trajans were
so vexed with them, that they sacrificed them
to Smynthian Apollo. They entrap them, and
knock them on the head with a Spade; when
they are hurt, they betake them to succoury,
that is their nature. Not to speak now of the

Some of them sleep from harvest to spring,<note place="margin">Avicen.</note>

in all twenty teeth. They are not beyond
the Appenine hill,<note place="margin">Plin.</note> but everywhere in Italy,<note place="margin">Matthiol.</note>
especially about Trent, also in Germany. They
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59579:49"/>
winter in stables, in summer they haunt gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
and Cow-dunghills, feeding on roots,
especiall eatable thistles, to the Husbandmans
great damage, also on carrion. Those by
Trent are not venomous.<note place="margin">Matthiol.</note> They hate the track
of wheels.<note place="margin">Barbarus.</note> Their squeake is shriller then of
other mice, but by reason of its dimme sight, it

will catch, but not eat them. Their bite is
worse that are great with young to any other
creature that is so. The Alpine Mouse lives
in the Alps, is called also Marmota, and beare
mouse, it being shaped like both.<note place="margin">Ambro. dig. vi. l. 2. c. 34.</note> Albert refers
the Empetra to these, a beast now unknown
headed like a Hare, as big as a Cony, the ears
so small, scarce seen above the hair, like a
badger long, and party-coloured haired, short-tayled,
sharp nayled, and dig deep. In winter
it grows monstrous fat.<note place="margin">Aurel.</note> The foreteeth like the

there in a large womb. The liver hath
seven lappets distinct, the greatest towards the
left side. The gall-bag is the fold to the duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum,
the spleen long like a large Swallows.
The water-vessels, or Uriteres not comming
strait down from the reines, but cleaving to the
back, and small. Most of them about Trent,
and in the snowy cold parts of Germany.
They feed on fruit, especially milke, that they
suck as pigs, therefore haunt they sheep-coats.
Being tamed they eat pulse, bread, fish, &amp;c.
About Christmasse dig, you find them asleep
in the ground, nothing wakes them, but the
heat of the sun, or fire. A little thing frights
them, vex them, they squeak like a pipe, or
against change of weather. They stink so, that
in summer they are not to be endured; nor
want they wit. Toward winter they convey
hay, and chaff into their holes. They lay one
flat, and load him with hay, and drag him by
the tale into their hole, which hath two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances;
through the one they all passe too, and
fro, out of the other they carry their dung.
When winter begins they stop up the doore,
and in the depth of winter they stop up the
other so fast, that a spade cannot pearce it.
About the end of September they meet seven,
or more in one hole, commonly the number
is odd, and there on straw they ly snorting till
spring. One still stands centinell, while the
rest go abroad; if he spy any thing, he squeaks
aloud, and warns the rest, whereupon they all
come running, and he enters last. In fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they play together, and murmur, and bark
like little dogs.<note place="margin">Stump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fius.</note> When tame they will looke
your head, like an Ape. About approach of
winter they come, and eat with those who live
on the Alps. They rost and boyl them in black
pottage, and sprinkle them with salt, and hang
them in the smoake, and give them to women
in child-bed. The fat softens shriveled sinews,
and smeared on the navell provokes sleep. The
stomack eases the collick.</p>

that they can last a year without food. They
live most on apples,<note place="margin">Food.</note> and grapes, which they

drinke milke,<note place="margin">Aelian. l. 16. c. 69.</note> and wine in houses; they hold
enmity with the Beare, Wolfe, Fox, the viper,
and the herb water-grasse. When he hears the
barking of dogs, or smells the approach of
wild beasts, or hunters, he forthwith rouls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
up like a ball, and lies, as if he were starke
dead. He shifts his layer, as the North, and
South wind change, and from wall to wall, if
you keep him in house, accordingly as the
wind sits. When you take him he pisses,<note place="margin">Arist. H. A. l. 9. c. 6.</note> and
that wet slackens, and opens his prickles. They
meet, and ingender, as mankind doth. Some
eat them, but they breed the strangury, unlesse

fattest, when they get plenty of food. Some
spice, and bake them in crust. Gesner warmed
them in vineger,<note place="margin">Durantes.</note> and wine, and larded them,
and stuck them with cloves, and rosted them.
They are very usefull in Phisick, the liver helps
the reins, the gall dries up warts, the spleen
rosted, and pulverized is good for the spleen;
the flesh prevents miscarrying, and if killed at a
blow, the strangullion, if you hang it about
you conveniently; dried it helps rumples in the
skin. The Polonians use the fat to that end,
it is also good for the stone; the blood is not
unusefull for the stone, the reins, and the scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of the urine; the ashes with Bears-grease
sleeks the hair; many use the same with oyly
fat to prevent miscarrying; it is used also in
the pain of the reins, and against the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the skin; the dung newly voided with
the herb Sandarucha, vineger, and tarre hinders
shedding of hair: with the hide and prickles
men used of old to fetch spots out of cloaths.
They are distinguished into the swine,<note place="margin">Kinds.</note> and the

vapours from them. In Brasil is such a beast
resembling the hedge-hog with very long
bristles, pale haired, black at the tops,<note place="margin">Majolus.</note> and very
sharp, and prickly. Nature hath layed up a

for he as they lives in burrows.<note place="margin">Maphaeus.</note> He can
dig in one night fifty paces; if he be not tied, no
place can hold him, he mines through all in
houses, and towns, and gets away. There are
sundry kinds of these armed beasts, but the
Ajatochtlus seemes to me the strangest, rarely
written, or found. He is armed with hard plates,
as I my self have seene; As big as a Malta dog,
the feet small as a swines, the snout long, and
slender. He is all over armed as with male, or
armour like a Cavalier, plated, the plates joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
close, distinct, which he can move, and every
way fence himself with. His belly is bright, and
soft-shined as ours, having here, and there long
slender hairs. He hunts after Ants, lies on his
back, with his tail on his mouth, so that the
pis-mires comming on fall strait as a prey into
his power,<note place="margin">Anton.</note> which he eats. It is said also that he
fills with his own water the hollow on his belly
between the plates,<note place="margin">Herrera.</note> and so the ants, the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
lying in their way, come directly into his
mouth: when he flies, in all hast he claps his
head, and tail on his belly, and fences himself
with his shell, rolling up himself round. If he
be chased hard, he flies at the hunters breast,
and oft strikes almost the breath out of his
body. He haunts marishes. Feeds on worms,
fish, berries, and apples. The flesh is very fat,
and sweet, but flegmatick, and breeds crudities.
The ancients used the tail to fence those they
called their Zebratanae, which were of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use among them. Their shall is many
wayes usefull both in warre, and peace. They
say that a dram of the pouder thereof taken
in, helps to sweat out the French pox. He is
found in hot boggy places.</p>
                  <p>There are among the Lucatanenses two
sorts of them; some are as harmlesse, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
nourishment, others unwholesome,
and poysonous, provoking to vomite, and fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the belly so with wind, that they bring
swounding fits, and at length kill. The Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote
is oyl of olives, unlesse the venome have
too farre prevailed, then there is no remedy.
If happily any recover, their hair falls off, the
colour fades, and they pine away by degrees.
Those that beare eight shells or plates, are
harmlesse; those with six venomous. The
harmles also want a hip-bone, and have red
spots about the belly: this beast is beloved of
the Vipers, that have a voyce, that they can
live together in the same hole, and never injure
each other.</p>
                  <p>The former kinde is armed round to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
other gates then those in Spain,<note place="margin">Consalv.</note> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in Europa.<note place="margin">Ferdinan.</note> He is fourefooted, covered
all over,<note place="margin">Oviedus.</note> tail and all with a hide like the slough
of a Serpent, called the American-Crocodile,
betwixt white, and ash-colour, but inclining
more to white, like a Barbed war-horse, as big
as an ordinary Dog, harmles, burrowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in the earth, like the Conies; they are taken
in nets, and with Cros-bows, killed commonly
in seed-time, when the stubble is burnt, or the
ground tilled, or husbanded, to bring grasse.
Consalvus writes, that he had often eat of
them; and that it is better tasted then kid, and
found wholesome. He thinks that men might
hence learne to Arme-horses, completely
capable. Others are otherwise opinioned
about them. Some say, he was never seen to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59579:50"/>
eat, but lives ever under, and on earth.<note place="margin">Monardes.</note> Others
say, some few have been brought into France,
and been seen to eat seeds, and fruits. I refute
neither; they may speake of diverse kindes.
Platean, and Clusius acknowleged three sorts
of them. One short-tayled, one foot, and foure
inches long, and fourteen inches about; cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a dusky hard crust, so grown happily
by age, and oft handling, after a manner
checquered; from the neck to the midst
roundish, the shells party-coloured, the middle
of the body set with three rows of diverse
coloures, fouresquare plates; the hinder-parts
as the first; the head so plated to the nose; the
eares wide, and pointed; the tayl short, not
greater then a mans two fingers ends, round,
and armed; the belly soft, and shaggy, as the
picture presented it; as also the hinder-part of
the thighs, and the throat, and nostrills; three
toes on the hinder-feet, and spur'd, two on the
forefeet, and a spur; the yard long, and stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out. His chief strength lies in the tail-bone,
a pill whereof made of the dust, as bigge as a
birds-head, and put into the eare, asswages
eare-paine, and takes away tingling, and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of hearing, as it is said; but it is knowen to
give certain ease. I adde the craft of the Chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinchus,
they that have seene it and report,
that when it raines, he lies on his back, gathers
water on his soft belly, that lies between the
plates, and remaines so, while the shewre lasts,
though it rain the whole day, till some Deere
thirsty, comes unawares to drink, then he closes
his plates, and snaps the Deers slips, and nose;
and let not go the hold, till he stifle him. And,
as the Hedge-hogge also, he craftily rouls up
himself round, like a ball, and nothing but fire
can loosen him. The Indians abuse the shells
to their witchcrafts, especially to discover, and
punish theeves; first touching the ground
therewith, that the suspected person had
toucht, or any thing else; they fill his mouth
with the drinke Chicha: then beat they drums;
the shells the while skip, and daunce. Hereby
is the theeves face marked with a whelk, that
runs along his cheeks through either jaw; if
the charm hold.</p>

not wreathed like a Swines;<note place="margin">Zootom. p. 306.</note> the forkends reach
to the reins, tied by veins, that come as far as
the womb, the testicles resting thereon by a
thin skin. At the first opening of the neck, the
body shews it self in bulk, shape, and colour,
like a Snails-head thrust forth out of the shell;
you cannot thrust a bodkin in, till you cut it
up a litle. Dissect a bitch, you find the puppies
wrapt up in three beds called <hi>chorion, allantoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
and <hi>amnion;</hi> the former can scarce be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they are so thin. In the right corner ly
usually five whelps, in the left foure; each hath
its bed, the chorion in the midst, girdles ly
thwart two fingers broad, streaked with black
from the end, and red in the middle; each as
blood-spotted. The <hi>kell</hi> like a bag, covering
the upper-guts; the top sprouting out of the
stomack-bottome, compassing the whole; the
hinder-part is set into the Spleen, and the
sweetbreads; which latter shew themselves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
at the rise of the <hi>duodenum,</hi> being fastned
thereto, and to the <hi>porturine,</hi> which sends a
trebble-branch to the neighbouring-parts,
Meseraick, Spleen-guts, the Paunch-branch
runs beyond part of the stomack; the Spleen-branch
runs up strait to the mouth of the
stomack. The <hi>Spleen</hi> is tied to the mid-rif by
a film two fingers broad, and to the stomack
by the kall; the <hi>Spleen</hi> is like a foot with a wide
shoo on. <hi>Colon-gut</hi> it hath none; the <hi>blind-gut</hi>
receives the end of the strait one, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
is as long as your middle-finger. At
the end of the streight-gut within, is one faire
lappet, and another lesse in the beginning of
the blind-gut. The streight-gut is much
rumpled. There is a fold of arteries from the
<hi>aorta</hi> wound, to the hollow of the liver, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
the <hi>pancreas;</hi> pluck one, you draw
the other, and the upper-bowells. Above the
upper-mouth of the stomack are two kernels,
both Spungy-moist, the right harder, and
greater then the left. Dogs-blood is black, as
burnt. At the tip of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> is set in a
round muscle, descending in a middle-line.
The right lappet of the <hi>heart,</hi> is twice as big
as the left. On the parts of the <hi>pan,</hi> that the
temple-muscles cover, appears no thin skin, to
enwrap them, besides what is proper to the
muscles; but on the other parts of the brain-pan
there is. At the tongue-root is a small
kernell on either side, drawne out sideling.
The ringlets of the sharp artery lie thwart, but
not awry as in the Swine. The <hi>brain</hi> is greater
then a Swines. Turn the brain up, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
mamillary-passages shew themselves, and
the beginning of the back-bone, if you cut
deep, there you shall spy two small passages,
one comming from the paps in a strait line,
reaching to the end of the inner-brain; the
other a litle on this side, lying upward thwart
of that. On the fore-feet are five toes, on
the hinder foure. The Bitches-belly hath
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59579:51"/>
two rows of paps on either side. Albert saith,
that the nostrils of a Dog of a good breed, are
at the ends, round, firme, and blunt. The
temple muscles, are noted to be very strong,
as in the Wolf,<note place="margin">Galen.</note> and the Lion, which inables his
jaws to break bones. There were no Dogs in
Brasil, till Vilagagnon's voyage. If any come
by hap into the Arabian Island Sigaron, they
wander,<note place="margin">Place.</note> and die. They eat any thing, even
fish, and carrion. Onely they refrain dogs-flesh,
and what is thunder-strooke.<note place="margin">Lerius. Textor. Food.</note> They eat
grasse also, and it is their Physick. From Ash-apples
they abstain, because the turning-joints
of their hips are thereby pained. Drinking
wine, or strong water, makes them run wild,
till the vapour be spent. They are ever given
to gendring,<note place="margin">Gendring. Arist. H. A. l. 5. c. 14.</note> seldomest in Autumne. They
hold on so till twelf years old; sometimes give
over at nine. If they begin at foure, the breed
is better; if at a year old, not. They are foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
dayes hote; and the Bitch six months after
puppying,<note place="margin">Id. Ib. l. 18. c. 28.</note> go to Dog again. They couple also
promiscuously with other beasts; as with
Wolves by Cyrene, whence spring, Crocutae,
with Lions, whence Leontomiges come; with
Beavers whence Castorides; with Foxes,
whence Fox-dogs. They carry their puppies
sixty dayes, some three-and-sixty. They bring
a litter of twelf, sometimes sixteen. A Hare-hound
in Bononia, puppied seventeen at once.
Albertus saw Mastives, that brought in the first
litter nineteen, at another eighteen, at a third
thirteen.<note place="margin">Arist. l. 5. c. 14. Pliny.</note> Those that women dandle, puppy
one at once. First they breed males, next
females; then males again, if they couple in
due time. The first resembles the sire; the rest
are, as it happens. They are all puppied-blind,

streight veins running outward, two sinews are
on the sides of the sharp artery, on either side
one, descending to the upper-mouth of the
stomack, sending also branches to the said
sides of the sharp artery. The said sinews
are knit by one common nerve descending
awry; then are set into the left side of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
tied by many strings, where the sharp
artery first parts appeare great <hi>kernels,</hi> and
some small ones white, red, ash-coloured,
mixed. In the sharp artery are half circles,
parted as in man, but behind wrapped in a
double coat; the one outward, and fleshy, the
other inner, and sinewy sprouting from the
circle-brims. In the heart are lappets-party-coloured,
the right more spotted with black,
and white, then the left; besides the right is
thicker, and rounder, the left slenderer, and
longer, like the dogs, both hollow, and stringy.
In the right creek of the heart is fold, like
net-worke, longer, and plainer to be seen then
that in the dog; but not with such laps. The
<hi>great artery</hi> is almost in the midst of the heart,
inclining to the left side. The inner-coat of
the stomack is rough all along, like the plaits
in an oxes paunch, turning up into a round.
Those tunicles are very fast, tied to the upper
orifice of the stomack; the pleats ly crosse. The
Liver is coloured like that of the dog-fish. In
the eare-bone a shell, a maze, a little window, a
ring, a round muscle, three small bones, and a
stirrop, but not bored through. In the brain
are three creeks,<note place="margin">Casserius.</note> two round with net-folds. In
the eye the uvea or thin skin, cleaves not afore
to the cornea, or horne-tunicles, whence the
lesse dilatation to this greater kinde; in that
part is the uvea, coloured like a pale leaf. The
optick nerve is almost in the midst, inclining
downward, the outter thick skin somewhat
covering the eye, as in the Cock. In the Hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat
we observe, that there is something pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
about the spermatique vessels, testicles, &amp;c.
A white streake, the third part of a finger
broad, descending by the right side of the
paunche, lies under the muscles of the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum;
the membrane is very thin; the Perito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeum
under the ensie forme, or sword, is fat.
The <hi>Kall</hi> is very fast, tied to one right liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string,
and to the spleen, and stomack, and the
gut <hi>duodenum,</hi> like a purse, or bag. The <hi>bladder</hi>
fastened above to the Peritonaeum, and below
to the streight gut. The <hi>stones</hi> are covered
with foure skins; the outmost called scrotum;
the next dartos, the third, erythroides, or the
red; the fourth is the inmost. There is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
also considerable in the vessells prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and conveying the seed, &amp;c. Wee saw
the <hi>uriteres</hi> descending from flat, or hollow
of the reins to the bladder-neck: also the
<hi>milk-veins,</hi> tending toward the bunchy-part
of the reins, both sprouting from the body of
the hollow-gut, but the left is higher then the
right, and all most twice as long. The straight-gut
is tied to the beginning of the tayl by a
middle-string; it hath veines, and sharp kernels.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59579:53"/>
Wee saw the <hi>mid-rif,</hi> and <hi>meseraicks,</hi> and <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breads,</hi>
being a kernelly substance. Wee saw
the <hi>blind-gut</hi> a thumb-breeth long; the other
guts are uniform, but winding, and brittle.
The <hi>reins</hi> large, bigger then a great nut, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are a few creeks, through which the pisse
is strained. We saw the vein <hi>porta</hi> with it's
meseraick, and Spleen-branch; hereout sprouts
the coeliacus; a branch compassing the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
and conveys the melancholy humour
thither to provoke appetite. We saw the vein
<hi>ascendent,</hi> pearcing the mid-rif, and reaching
the heart, and set into the right side thereof.
Wee saw the <hi>peerles</hi> vein-branched from the
<hi>hollow</hi> vein by the heart, and turning back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again,
and descending by the backbone on the
right side, which sends forth sprigs to the ribs
to nourish them. The <hi>liver</hi> is distinguished by
six strings, out of the midst of two of them on
the right side goes the <hi>gall</hi> forth; the bottome
shews like a bolt-eye. The <hi>gall-bag</hi> hath two
branches, the one passes from the liver to the
<hi>duodenum,</hi> carrying the dregs away. The other
running back to the bladder, to be kept there.
In the <hi>duodenum,</hi> foure fingers below the pores
called <hi>cholidochi,</hi> is found a worme, little, but
of the bignes of the ureteries: from the sides
of the ascendent hollow veine, descends a
sinnew to the fleshy ringlet of the diaphragm;
and another on the left side proped with the
thin skins of the sharp artery, conveying feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the diaphragm. We saw the <hi>turnagain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si news,</hi>
which propagated from the sixth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation
of sinews, are set in at the head of
the sharp artery; the one on the left turning
upward about the great artery; the other about
the branches of the arterie, tending toward
the throte; the heart with a double lappet on
the right, and left side, the right is greatest,
and blackish; the left of the colour of the
heart. The <hi>heart</hi> hath a right venticle to beget
vitall spirits, and a left one whether the vein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood
is conveyed, and it hath foure large
vessells; the first is the hollow ascending vein,
which is set into the left eare; the third, the
arteriall vein, containing blood, having a
double coat, whence it hath the name; this is
set into the lungs, to nourish them. The
fourth is a vein-artery, set into the left ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle
of the heart, to convey to the brain blood,
prepared there, to beget animal spirits. In the
right venticle are <hi>lappets,</hi> or partitions, which
keep in the blood, and so in the left. The <hi>lungs</hi>
have six fins. Wee saw the inner-muscles about
the <hi>larynx,</hi> or the head of the sharp artery,
which being inflamed, breed a squincy. There
are <hi>kernells</hi> in the yard like a Cats-tongue.
Wee marked the passage, leading to the
bladder. The Cats brain-pan hath red streaks
like veins; the inner-eare is rarely fashioned,
whereof they have such use to listen, and
looked, and prey by night. Herein we marked
the communion between the great artery, and
the great vein, where the first parting is into
the bowels.</p>
                     <p>I beleeve it is common to all living creatures
what I observe in the tame Cats-back bone, for
with the own membranes, it being covered at
the end, that which answer the hard menynx,
the inner sends forth nerves from it self, but
since there are companies of them, like strings,
we note that they having passed a little way,
meet as in one knot, as we in top of grain. And,
since those severall strings are covered with
the same skins, if you strain one, you spoyl the
other, till they come to the knot. In one rib
of the house cat was noted a round knob, like
a tree-knot, the midst whereof being broken
asunder was porose, and full of pits with drops
of blood. My fellow dissecters doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was the breach of a bone in anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,
or some error in the first shaping, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous
stuffe. In a man on the flat part of
the forehead bone, that lies between the two
eybrows ly equally on the right root of the
nose: Bruize but that bone, or peirce it, you
find two long pits, passing sidelings above un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the skull, and below blind ones with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
These are doubtlesse the chambers of
smelling, where the breath is, as also in the ear,
which is but of late discovered. That which
strengthens my opinion is, that in a hound these
cells are broader and more conspicuous then
in man; dogs excelling in sent. This is not found
in a Monky, perhaps because he needs not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in that sense.</p>

They swarm so in the waterish places of
Egypt, that they would destroy all, if the storks
did not devour them. They are said to be
dumb in the Island Seriphus, and Cyrene,
perhaps because the water is cold. They are in
streams, but delight in puddles where bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes,
reeds, and sea-gras grows. They are
ever found in the waters that never freeze, but
not in brimstony, or mare-waters, they being

get the Frogs shape, the tail being parted into
two hinder-legs. Strange it is that after six
months living they are indiscernably resolved
into slime, and again reingendred in the spring
puddles. But some in warmer waters last all
winter, and in spring the old ones swim about.
The egges are shed about the banks of pones,
and marishes, hanging together as in a string,
like black bits of flesh; Chymists call it sper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,
or spawn. They hate Storks, Swans, the

against winter they skulk. Busbequius heard
them by Strigonium in December, the waters
there being warm, and sulphurous. They are
clamorous against rain, either because they feel
it colder, or are much taken with sweet water.
They can dive long having but small lungs.
They are thought to dy in winter, and revive
at spring. They lurk also in the ground, and
come with their young abroad then. They
couple by night, and on land, not for shame but

The first have five very small toes, with nails

a cubite long; in Nysa an Indian Hill, foure
and twenty foot long, and yellow, or blew.
They inhabite commonly graves,<note place="margin">Albert. Place. Lin. chot. Plin.</note> dens, thorny
places, and ruined heaps. At Genua in the
Prince of Doria his Fort, wee saw very many
in the open ayr. They eat flesh, herbs, bees,

fingers. The whole skin of a delicate green,
with black, and white spots, chequered, like
chamelet; it is scaly, the greatest scales are on
the back, thighs, and tail, and here all equall.
From the neck to the tail end a new of plain
ones, like saw-teeth, and green; the head about
two fingers long, and scaly; the scales greater
then elsewhere; the neck a finger and half long,
five thick, their eyes large, clear, and blackish,
nostrills wide, the teeth many small, black,
short; tongue thick, the head on each side black
spotted, a gullet hanging as fish gills, or a crop
down to the breast, most part blackish, that he
can gather up, and let hang out, when vexed,
or frighted. From the mouth to the crop it
hath bristles, and on the back, it hath four
thighs, and four feet, on each five toes, all
scaly, the fore-thighs are shortest, and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest,
four fingers long, and the middle toes
shorter then those on the hinder-feet; the nayls
black, and crooked, like bird-claws, &amp;c. The
hinder-thighs like a mans calf, the foremost
not; the dock five fingers thick, and so the tail
thinner and thinner, and ending like an aul.

the heart taken out leaped; it had in either side
above ten egs, some as big as a cherry, some
lesse; the fat plainly seen, as a Hens; in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
was much fruit, especially sweet Limons,
which was the usuall food. They eat also meal
and Mandioca-water. They can fast two, or
three months together. The flesh is well tasted,
boyled, and long fried with butter, it tasts as
well as chicken, or cony. It hath heart, lungs,
liver, gall-bladder, reins, bladder, genitals, as
other beasts; a large liver, a double stomack,
one afore, receiving the food, whence a gut as
big as the little finger, and about ten fingers
long, whereto is knit the other ventricle, that
disgests food, hence passe the other to the

withdraw it. It yeelds no voyce, is patient,
loves raw-egs, can fast long. The Markgrave
kept one in his chamber, tied, and sometime
loosed, gave it water out of a glasse; unlesse,
when thirsty, it used to sit all day, moping in a
corner. It loved to ly on hot ashes. One
trod of a piece of the tayl, yet it grew two
fingers after: In two month it ate not, and so
pined to death; onely it sometimes licked in a

                        <p>The <hi>Taraguira</hi> of Brasil is a Lizard, in, and
near their houses, common in their gardens,
and everywhere; about a foot long, and some
lesse: the body round, all full of three cornered
ash-coloured scales: hath no crop under the
chin, the back plain; they nod nirably with the
head, when they spy any things, and run swiftly,
and wagging. They wake a man, if they see
any Serpent, or venemous creature, making
toward him. As they couple, the Hee bites
the Shee gently on the neck, and pulls her to
his side.</p>
                        <p>The Brasil <hi>Americima,</hi> is a small Lizard, three
fingers long, and no thicker any where then a
Swans-quill; footed, and ledged as the Senem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi;
blacke-eyed, almost square-bodied, the
back cloathed with ash-coloured scales, the
sides with dusky ones: the head, legs, and tayl
with blew ones, all bright and smooth, the toes
like hogs-bristles. The Portugees say it is
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59579:56"/>
venemous, and longs to suck the blood of
women great with child; they report that if it
but touch a woman, nay her cloaths, she never

lesse inward; both rising sideling as out of the
arm-pits, springing from a thin skin clinging to
the shell, and ending in a sharp tendon; under
these long, round muscles six other appeares
long that haply bend the arms. Two come to
the thighs sprouting from the foresaid mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
these are lesse then the former, but more
fleshy, and are set into the thighs. The back-bone
is compact, and fastened strongly to the
shell, in the middle of the length. Below the
head in the midst a fingers breath from the
sides descend two muscles, plucking the head
inward, and two other a little below, all long.
The liver is parted but alike big on the right,
and left side, without bunched, within hollow,
on the right side craggy containing in a strange
workmanship the nether mouth of the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack,
and a part of the duodenum; the left side
holding the greater hollow of the stomack,
like a hollow eyebrow. The gall-bag lies deep
in the right string of the liver. The stomack
nearly resembles a mans, or swines; but after it
comes to the bowells it hath three large hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
wherein are perfected the three dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.
In the two first is a herby substance, the
latter better wrought, and from hence cleaves
the milt round, and black; in the third a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
moystish, and very white substance, like a
chewed chesnut, but washy. It is thought this
serves for a bladder, that, as Hens use, darts out
sometimes a white moysture. It is large, and
shaped like a chesnut, thin, and of a large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.
It clings fast to the peritonaeum. The
straight gut at the end hath such side passages,
as all Cocks have, but parted, and reaching into
the sides, even to the reins. Here on each side
ly their egges. The mid-rif is interwoaven with
great veins. The heart is roundish, and whitish,
hollow on one corner, placed just above the
liver. The sharp artery (which is worthy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king)
a little after the beginning is cloven, and
the branches are twisted. The lungs above
cling to the back-bone, thin, not fleshy, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
skinny, set into the sharp artery, like a
blackish net-worke. The disposition of the
Hyois-bone, and shield-gristle is remarkable. In
the skull of the Sea-tortoyse is a partition.
These come about in the deserts of Africa, and

the blood clears the ey-sight, and removes
blood-shot, rednesse in the eyes, and helps
against all venome of serpents, spiders, toads,
the blood wrought with meal into pilles, and
take in wine; the gall with Athenian hony is
good for the yellow in the eyes, and the stroak
of a scorpion; the ashes of the shell kneaded
with wine, and oyl, closes chaps, and ulcers. The
scales shaven off at top in drinke allay, as the
the powder of the shell inflames lust. The
urine I thinke is not seen but in dissection, but
is thought good against aspick-bites, better, if
mixt with hog-lice; the egges hardened make
an ointment for swellings, and ulcers comming
from cold, or burnes. Some swallow them in

the ribs, on each side eight, the former shorter;
middelmost longer, the hindmost also smaller.
They eat the egges as flesh, they lay their eggs
on the shore; digging a pit in the sand, and
burying them. I have oft trackt them in their
walke. Some I have had foure foot long, and
three broad, of such a bulk, foure strong men
could scarce stirre one. The shells as carved
in diverse geometricall figures; some black,
and glistring with yellow streaks, goodly to
see too: others, otherwise shaped. The other

it is lesse then other Tortoyses; the shell the

The upper hath an crooked longsquare shape.
It can hide it self under the shell, and thrust
out the head three fingers; the head is three

pointed, mouth wide, eyes blackish, balls cole-black:
on the feet are foure very long black

                  <p>HAving through Gods grace finished
the History of the Foure-footed
Beasts, as many sorts as are, as yet
knowen, I thought good to adde this
appendix about forreigne doubtfull Creatures,
which I am yet thinking to what head, or kind
to referre. As first: The <hi>Tlacaxolotl,</hi> it is
roundish-faced, bigger then a Bull, great-head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
long muzzle, broad eares, cruell teeth;
faced almost like a man, whence it hath the
name: the neck thick, the nails like the Bulls,
but larger: the buttocks great, and broad, tayl
thick and long; skin thick, hair yellowish, and
brisly. It is seldome found, living among
stones, and in desolate places. The Atzaceani,
Tepotzonzotla, and Haquelagani, are not far
from the Honduras. It feeds on Kacaotli,
Quapachtli, and green-Hoali, in the wide fields,
and sowen grounds; and where they are not,
on leaves and shrubs. The flesh is eateable. It
fears not the face of man; Arrows cannot
pearce the hide; therefore they catch them in
pitfalls, and holes covered with leaves, as the
Indians doe Elephants.</p>
                  <p>The Cabim, or Sionium, or Thabal is bred
in Java. It hath one strange vertue, if any
carry with them the tip of the mouth thereof,
wound him in a thousand places, he shall not
bleed one drop.<note place="margin">Nierem Ex. l. 9. c. 3.</note> There have been many trialls

when Naodabeguea Malacensis, an enemy of
the Portugees, in a manfull fight against them,
was at length overpowered, and wounded in
many places, and fell, no blood started out of
the widest wounds; after in rifling him, as they
plucked from his arme a gold arm-let (strange
to say) the blood with his life gushed all out
suddenly, as out of a broken vessell, which they
being astonished to see, they understood by
other captives that in that arm-let was closed
a Cabims mouth, that is so potent in stanching
of blood.</p>
                  <p>As for the Maripetum,<note place="margin">Nierem. Hist. Ex. l. 9. c. 49.</note> Aloysius Almeida
writes, and others affirme, (both with what
truth) that among the Japons in the Gotian
kingdome is a wood wherein is bred a beast as
big as a dog, short-leged, good to eat, gold-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured,
soft-haired. Growing old, it leaves the
land, and takes the sea, and by degrees turns
fish in a certain space, loosing his beasts shape,
and that some have been taken not wholly
transformed, the full time being not exspired,
one part beast, the other scaled, and fined.</p>

such ears, a Calves lips; the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-lips
hangs a handfull over the
lower, which he lifts up, when angred, in the
rest like other beast, but a Calf most; he hath
no harme. The hoof helps heart-pain, the skin
makes an impenetrable target. It hath two
stomacks, one receives the food, the other is
found, none knows how, stuft with wood, and
twigs. The use of this stomack is not knowen.
Nature uses not to make any thing needlesse.
The hunter must wound him afore he takes
water, for there he bites dogs to death. Men
have been taught breathing a vein from him,
for he, his blood is rank, and he even swells, lets
himself blood on the inside of the thighs with
a splinter of a reed, as the Sea-horse doth. He
is reddish-haired, and that hanging down, and
resembles a Cow in bulk, and shape. But that
he is not horned,<note place="margin">Lerius.</note> and hath a short neck, and
long daugling ears, by his dry, and slender legs,
whole hoof, a man may take him to be of the
breed of the Cow, or Asse, yet differs much
from both, having a very short tail, (though in
America many beasts are bred, without tails)
and hath much keener teeth, yet none need
feare him, he trusting more in flight, then fight.
The wilds shoot them, or catch them in pits, or
grins, and have handsome devices to hunt
them. They value him highly for his skin,
which they cut round, and lay a sunning to
make targets as big as a reasonable tun, which
they use in warre, as being hardly to be pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
I brought two of those shiels carefully
into France; but returning, the famine was so
sore, that all provisions being spent, we must
eat apes, and parrets, and we were fain to fry
those two targets, and other skins in the ship,
to eat. The flesh tasts like beef, especially the

other,<note place="margin">Plin. l. 28. c. 6.</note> the Panthers hair falls off. Diverse
write of this enmity, and that the Civet-cat is
untameable. The best reason is, that the

By Aristotles yet there is a vessell in the Hyae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,
that makes the heedles think it Epicene,
or double-sexed. He is genitaled as wolves, and
dogs; and that other passage is but for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements.
And there is female Hyaena, and
under the tail of both is a streake, but it is seen
more in the males, which are oftner taken then
the females.</p>
               <p>On the other side,<note place="margin">Exer. 117. p. 7. Gesner. Busbeq. Clusius. Arist. Solin. Aelian.</note> Scaliger derides those
that think the Hyaena, and Zivet to be the
same, and many others confute that opinion;
many things being said of the Hyaena, that fit
not our Civet-cat. As first, a hard skinne, and
a main, and neck, that are not the Civetta.
Besides that there is no gum in the mouth, and
but one tooth, or one bone all along, shutting
like a box, but the Zivet hath many teeth.</p>
               <p>And some write, that the Hyaena fains a
mans voyce, and learns Shepheards names, to
entrap them; and imitates mans vomiting, to
entice and catch dogs. But none of these are,
as yet observed in the tamest Civet-cat. But
Bellonius might easily confute all this:
saying that those things are falsely ascribed to
the Hyaena, as the stifnes of neck to the Lion
by Aristotle; and that Solinus speaks not of the
Hyaena, but of the Crocuta, gendred between
the Hyaena, and Lionesse. That those passages
are rather to be admired, then beleeved, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
and confuted by some writers, and in
silence passed by others.<note place="margin">Scal. Ex. 211. p. 2.</note> Adde, that the

               <p>And for that above the mane,<note place="margin">Arist. H. A. l. 8. c. 5.</note> Bellonius
might probably answere, that the Hyaena is as
big as a Wolf, yet but two handfulls high, and
the mane is longer then the other hair, and may
hang to the ground; as wee see in Swine, the
bristles on the back are longer then other hair;
and so in our Civetta you may say, why then
did not Aristotle rather liken the Hyaenaes
mane to the Swines bristled crest, then the
Horses mane: I answere, that perhaps he took
his description from some Indian Authour,
that had seen a Horse, but not a Swine; for it
is not certain, that such Swine as ours are in
India; so that Aristotle changed not his expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
about the mane. Besides Scaliger gathers
out of Aristotle,<note place="margin">In l. 15. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

of the Hyaena, and Civet is diverse. And
Faber findes a contradiction in Scaliger, <hi>Ex.</hi>
217. <hi>Cardan. p.</hi> 7. But truth is, either
Aristotle was deceived by a false relation, or
some fault is in the text; or he is not to be
understood literally, and strictly; but thus it
may be taken, that the Hyaena hath a streak
behind, but no passage, but the Civet hath two
passages, and hollows; one wherein the Civet
is gathered. But Busbequius saith, hee saw
two Hyaenaes at Constantinople, a litle lower,
but as long as a wolf, skind like the wolf, but
rougher haired, thicker, and spotted with
black; the head huge, close to the back-bone,
without turning-joynts, that without turning
the whole body about, they could not looke
behinde them: and that in Galatia are very
many, found easily out by their gathering of
carcasse-bones, mens, and others, to their den.

lustfull. Herein like our Civetta, whose Civet
makes not themselves onely prove to lust, but
mankind also, if annointed with it. Referre
hither Philes his Greek verses of the propertie
of beasts, and of the Hyaena, no way agreeing
to the Zibet-cat; (Chap. 43. of the Land,
and Sea-Hyaena) the summe is, that the Hyaena
changes Sexes, finding a man asleep, puts the
right hand to his nostrils, to make his sleep
sounder, lays the earth that was under his head
on his throat, and with embraces throttles him
sleeping. And the finnes of a Sea-Hyaenaes
right-side with a touch, provoke sleep, stupifie,
and bring terrible dreams. The Hyaena de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives,

liker a dogs then a cats, reddish. Ringlets are
about the eyes, that are not fierce, nor great,

scarce any hairs on the beard, the neck longer

from the head to the back on the neck are
such coloured streaks; and another on the back

Handsomly set off toward the tail by the streak
with blackish, round, ovall spots in order on a

The tale streakt, and so party-coloured, and

whereof one is the Civet-bag; the middlemost

hold their firmues, and cristalline transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy,
but two, or three dayes, and then grow
dimme, and are cut into bits three, or foure
like snails-shells. Some have indeed put the
question, why Cats, Hyaenaes and Bats, see
clearly by night. Besides the Civets-eares are
little, round, and haired as a Badgers. The
body is whitish, and ash as a wolves, sprinkled
with black spots, the feet but little, and short,
and black-haired; foure toes on a foot, and a
small thumb inward, as on a cat. The nails, as
the dogs, black, short, thick, and blunt, not as
claws. Next under the tayl is the excrement-passage;
then the testicles, then the Civet-bag,
&amp;c. In the figure wee have printed all
accurately, according to their naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
The Civet-bag lies between the
genitall, and stones, which are large, these I cut
out, and found them sentles, the seed-vessells
were very thick; below was a small bladder.
The whole genitall is hide within the body, as
in cats, while the beast is quiet, onely a kernell
seen; but in the carcasse it hangs quite out. The
hair of the whole body is long, rough, bristled,
as a Boars, and on the neck, and by the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone
black, very long, and stiffer, which starts
upright, as on the Swine, when the beast is
angry. The tail is very long, and pretty hairy,
reaching to the ground, and marked with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
spots.</p>
               <p>Hence we conclude these to be Hyaenaes.

               <head>CHAPTER VI. Of the Zibeth-vessell, or Civet-bag.</head>
               <p>ZIbeth is gathered only out of one
small part of the beast, we shall see
whence. It is a foul mistake, that the
Gazella voids Civet,<note place="margin">Riolan. Patholog. c. 11. Renod.</note> as dung; nor
comes it out the genitalls, but it lies thereabout.
To let passe Columna his discourse of the
testicles (Epist. 1. ad Fabrum.) It is clear, that
the Civet in the males lies between the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,<note place="margin">Alex. Bened.</note>
and the stones. The testicles are conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
in the males, and tane out, but ly hid
within the females. In these between the anus,
and the secrets are swellings, are bagges framed
by nature, wherein by little and little the Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
is gathered, and thence voided. And
being but two, the unexperienced may mistake
them for testicles, and some that have seen the
beast often, much more those who never saw
it afore; so hath Columna mistaken. The Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
part at first sight seemes a feminine passe,
having a long streak, and thick lips, which feels
as bigge as a small egge, gristly it is, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
hard, which, if you open with your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
a little, there shew themselves two very
long holes like nostrills, hollow underneath,
where are the seats of the Zibeth. These
vessells if you squeese out with your fingers
they open themselves wide, and shew the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse,
which may well hold an almond
kernell; in these bags is no pore, and no passage
appears, but it being cut, I found a hardish body
as big as an egge, feeling griftly, divided into
two bags, as big as two Spanish olives, and
those not at all grisly, but fleshy, stuffed with
small, white, hard kernels, much harder then
the stones; distinct they were those bags, but
joyned with thin skins, or films, and the inner
was common to both bags, which I keep still
by me dried, which sent yet strongly of Civet,
when the stone dried smell not all. And (which
is strange) the beast being spent by a dropsy,
and all the bowells putrified, and it stinking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferably
as it was cut all over, only the Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
vessell sented wonderfully, and yet holds
its fragrancy.</p>

saith such bumps are also in Hares, whence the
vulgar bruit of their double sex, and he writes
the like of the Moschus, and the Beaver, that
this hath two such swellings in the groyn,
each in his thin skin as big as a Goose-egge,
between which are the privities. These swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
sweat out a fat moysture, which he licks,
and sucks out, and after annoints therewith all
his bodies as far as he can reach. These are not
testicles, for they are there besides, and these
have no passage to convey, are send forth wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
That liquour at first is like oyl, after it is of
the colour of hony, and as thick. The like is in
the Hare (saith he) and the Moschus, whence a
sweet substance flows. Nor are they to be
heard, who take these swellings, for inflamed
pushes, or hote matter from the navell. That
the swelling is like a kernell, or testicle they
know, who sophisticate musk, making it up
round in such a shape, and calling it the

seed-milk; and uselesse, as snot, sweat, filth, &amp;c.
Corruption this is not, there being no sore. I
take it to be an excrement proper to that ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelly
substance of the foresayed bags, that
breeds by its innate, proper power such a thing,
as the stomack makes chyle, the liver blood,
breasts milke, testicles feed, ears, ear-wax, the
cuttle fish inke, the viper poyson in the teeth,
and the like, as the Beaver, and Moschus, &amp;c.
breed on hony, sweet excrement. But I dare
not determine, whether it be usefull, or useles
to the sweet part, or the breeder. But we may
guesse, that it is unprofitable to the beast, it
seeming burdensome to it, whereof it would
case it self, and the female, when tame, seems
to delight, that the Civet with an eare-pick
should be taken out of her. On the other side
the sweetnesse of the sent, shews it is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturall
rottennes, but an exact concoction,
and natures master-piece; and it puts forth it
self naturally and copiously after that part
hath concocted it, as milk, &amp;c. Usefull no
question it is, nature gave not those bags such
a vertue to breed such a sweet in vain. But
to what purpose? Seed begets milk-nourshes;
whereto serves this? whether to provoke the
beast to generation; as wee find Musk awakes
lust, and the Castors-hony; or whether to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure

the beast it self is unquiet, and
seeks to disburthen it self. The
eagernes of it seemes to swell,
vex, and prick, and provoke evacuation; and
the tame ones take delight to have the bags
emptied with an eare-picker. The Blacks, or
Moors,<note place="margin">Faber out of Father Greg.</note> search after old, and dry stumps of
trees, and mark the large and oyly spots, and
take thence a round substance cleaving there
as big or small as a chesnuts, they let it boyl out
in water, and take that swimmes, being fat, and
oyly, and pour it into clean pots, and keep it
for their use, and this is the purest Civet. For on
thoes trees the beast rubs, and leaves it, when
the bags are full, and urge him. And keep them
tame in a cellar, when the Civet abounds in the
bags, it troubles them, and they cannot stand
still, but run up, and down, and rub against the
walles, to ease themselves of it, and so it is lost.
The servants of D. Barnardine of Corduba
fetch the Civet out thus:<note place="margin">F. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumna.</note> One drew the chain,
wherein the Zibet was tied, another held the
hind-legs, a third chased the bagges, and with a
large ear-pick fetched the Civet clean out,
scraping on all sides, then wiped the short-hair
of both bags with cotton wool; and after six
times fifty emptying the bags they gather
Civet enough to full a chesnut-shell. In sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
it is moyster, and every two dayes in
warme weather they gathered half an ounce,
but in winter they got it scarce once a week,
nor so much, the female yeelded lesse, but
without striving.</p>
               <p>The Civet seems fat, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

swims at top in water, and serves it self from all
other things; it is as hony, or butter, it is thinner
in summer, at first gathering, but after thickens.
I fetched out of a dead one above two drams
of Civet, whitish, and fast as hony. Scaliger &amp;c.
likens it to black sope, but he saw only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
and that old. Some say, the fresh is ugly,
and stinking, and after comes to smell sweet,
contrary to amber,<note place="margin">Amatus. Quadra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius.</note> and musk, which are the
newer the better. Donatus (out of Eremi. l. 1.

melts,<note place="margin">Id. de. Theriaca. c. 11.</note> and dissolves, which distinguishes it
from the adulterate, false Civet. It is said the
Civet of the male is whitish, that of the female
Lion-coloured at first after a weak, but white
also at first gathering. An ounce of the females
is worth four of the males. They mix six ounces
of this with one of that, and so it is perfect; the
males alone is little worth.</p>
               <p>It is many wayes sophisticated,<note place="margin">How so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> as mixed with

Algalia is not Serapions Sederva, which is a

neck, as in Dogs; in the breast twelf, after the
usuall way; seven others on the back, as in the
Dog. But the Hedge-hogge hath eight; the
