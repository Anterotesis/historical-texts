            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT Of the Taking of Captain Holland, Who (it's ſaid) is the very Man by whoſe Hands was the late Earl of Eſſex Murthered.</head>
            <p>IT's now too notoriouſly known to the World to be denied, that they who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced for theſe ſeveral Years paſt into the higheſt Seats of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> have prophaned that great Name, Poyſoned its Streams, and deceived the People whom they ſhould have Inform'd, both by Vindicating the Authors of this Bloody Murther, from the Guilt and Suſpicion of it, and by Defaming and Wounding the Memory of a moſt Noble, Innocent, and Guiltleſs Perſon (whoſe Spittle, ſome time before, they were Ambitious to lick up) with the Infamy of <hi>Fe lo de ſe,</hi> 'tis to them that the Enemies of Proteſtancy, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Rights owe the Succeſs of all theſe Attempts: And its they whom the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought to Accuſe of being the Inſtruments of Betraying us to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> and inſtead of detecting, they have became Advocates for <hi>Aſſaſſinates,</hi> and Concealers of <hi>Maſſacres,</hi> that we may even ſay with <hi>Jeremiah, Be aſtoniſhed, O ye Heavens at this, and be ye borridly afraid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that God who has ſaid, <hi>There is nothing covered that ſhall not be Revealed; nor any thing hid which ſhall not be known or come abroad;</hi> even that God to whom Vengeance belongs, has by his good Providence, brought to light the very Villain (whom it's not to be doubted but will be proved) that Murthered the late Noble and Innocent Earl of <hi>ESSEX:</hi> This Monſters Name is <hi>Holland,</hi> and generally known by the Name of Captain <hi>Holland,</hi> a Creature of the Earl of <hi>Sunderlands,</hi> from whom he has had very great Rewards; and 'tis generally ſaid, and I doubt not but will be proved, that he has received a Penſion of Five Pounds <hi>per</hi> Week, for theſe ſeveral Years paſt, from the ſaid Earl.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Holland</hi> is a bold daring reſolute Man, has a very ſharp Eye, and ſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; he has been a Man of Intreague all his Life-time, and One who has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready Convicted of the greateſt of Villanies: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of Counterfeiting and making Falſe-Guinies. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In being a chief Actor in Cheating the Silk-Man of <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence-Lane,</hi> by Inſinuating to him, that he, with ſome others, had a Warrant from the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> to ſeize him for ſpeaking Treaſonable Words, from whom (on pretence of getting him off on the Account of his Intereſt with the ſaid Earl) he got ſome Moneys down, and Bonds for Three Hundred Pounds; which afterwards being detected, his Accomplices were Exemplary Puniſhed, but himſelf Pardoned. A <hi>Third</hi> time for Robbing Dr. <hi>Gattaker</hi> of <hi>Lime-ſtreet,</hi> by Debauching the Maid-Servant, with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of one <hi>Davis;</hi> for which, they all Three were Condemned at the <hi>Old Baily,</hi> and <hi>Davis</hi> and the Maid-Servant Executed, but our Noble Captain had his wonted good Fate of a Pardon, by the Intereſt of his Old Friend the Earl of <hi>Sunderland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Warrants having been given out, and Meſſengers in ſearch for this Captain <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was at laſt (by the Indeſatigable Induſtry of a Noble Lord) taken in a Houſe about the middle of <hi>Eſſex</hi>-ſtreet, near St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s-Church Yeſterday Noon, where he remains till further Orders come (from thoſe Honourable Committee of Peers, that take all the Examinations about the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s Murther) to what Priſon he muſt be carried.</p>
