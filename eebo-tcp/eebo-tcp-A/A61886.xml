            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

His Declaration was against <hi>Anabaptists, Quakers,</hi> and (by which having expressed the <hi>two</hi> former he can mean the <hi>Independents</hi> onely) <hi>Sectaries</hi>; and to <hi>subvert them without fighting,</hi> since that was his Promise to those of <hi>Cheshire,</hi> it must have been effected by a suddain <hi>Massacre</hi> of the <hi>Army</hi> at least. If that was not his <hi>intent,</hi> (as it is discretion in his Partizans not to own it now) yet that it would have been as <hi>outragious</hi> an <hi>issue,</hi> is not to be doubted, since it would not have been <hi>prudentiall,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>possible</hi> for him and his confederates (especially in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>) to have restrained the <hi>affectionate</hi> ardours of an <hi>incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed rabble.</hi> But suppose we, Sir <hi>G.

and Governour in his Father's time, and afterwards one of his</hi> Mesnadero's <hi>or</hi> domestique <hi>creatures, and alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed a particular inclination for him. So things came to open War, to the utter ruine of the</hi> Union. <hi>For the King was</hi> resolute <hi>and</hi> fierce, <hi>and set to destroy the Priviledges of the</hi> Ricos hombres, <hi>and their way of</hi> Uniting; <hi>and the</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia <hi>did faintly prosecute him out of natural weakness as well as personal regards; and at last being not able to reduce the King by fair means to equitable terms, and being loath to see either his friend, or his Country ruined (and possibly not able to endure the contumelies and affronts put on him by such as he ought to have protected) he died, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged them more than by his life. For the</hi> Election <hi>of the</hi> Justitia <hi>being in the King, he deferred to make one till he had subdued the</hi> Union, <hi>which now was become of no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> (<hi>though they did choose</hi> Conservators of the Union) <hi>by reason there was no</hi> Justitia <hi>in being. This consideration made both sides hasten to a Battail, wherein after a bloody conflict, the</hi> Union <hi>was dissipated, and the King absolute Conquerour, who thereupon made one</hi> Galacianus Tarba <hi>to be</hi> Justitia, <hi>who had been instrumental in betraying the</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>to which he first adhered; and he did publickly with his sword cut in pieces the Writings containing the</hi> Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Union, <hi>and destroyed all the memorials thereof which he could come by, and enacted, that it should never be</hi> revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>again. As for the</hi> Justitiate, <hi>it was weakened (though not frustrated) by being turned into a</hi> Court of Judicature, <hi>and to be managed accordingly, eight men (of the great Personages) being enjoyned in each</hi> Cort general <hi>to help him in the executing of his Sentence. And it did prove a great protection to the</hi> Aragoneses <hi>as to criminal Causes, and things of lesser moment, but though the old Solemnities were upheld, yet did not that restrain their Kings from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching upon their</hi> Fueros, <hi>there being no</hi> standing Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia <hi>under the</hi> Ricos hombres <hi>to assist him.

            <p>This last discourse suggests unto me another Model, which I shall exhibite to you, leaving circumstances to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrivance.</p>
            <p>Let there be a <hi>Select Senate</hi> for the securing of the <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> with the <hi>standing Army</hi> for their <hi>Guards,</hi> and a power to curb the Trustees of the whole Nation in Parliament, if they go about to subvert the <hi>Fundamentals.</hi> Let them have the <hi>Executive</hi> power, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> in ordinary the <hi>Legislative.</hi>

            <p>I have not time now to discriminate their powers, but if the posture of the people in a <hi>Militia</hi> be setled according to my other model, according to this all parties may receive a fair establishment. There may be <hi>Censors</hi>

And if it be thought meet to fix an extraordinary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter upon any person amongst us; He may be as in the <hi>Roman Senate, princeps Senatus,</hi> or <hi>Prince of the Senate,</hi> a Title which hath nothing of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or of a <hi>single person,</hi> but only <hi>Honour</hi>; for the power was in the <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Senate,</hi> the prince was only reputed the best and ablest man in the republick, and who had signalised himself by his actings formerly, and was <hi>first</hi> to give his <hi>suffrage,</hi> or deliver his mind by <hi>speech,</hi>
